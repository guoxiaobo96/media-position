Why are there no emojis that represent interracial couples?\n\nA group of advocates which include dating app Tinder, Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian and the founder of Emojinotion, Jennifer 8, are asking Unicode Consortium to add interracial couple emoji into its mix. The Consortium is the nonprofit that reviews and develops emoji standards,\n\nIn a proposal made public on Tuesday, they ask for the addition of 21 different sequences with various skin tones for the existing emoji, couple with heart, for example.\n\nTinder also launched a Change.org petition to drum up support.\n\nAs the largest and most diverse platform for meeting new people, we are uniquely positioned and incredibly proud to petition for this update, said Rosette Pambakian, Tinder's head of brand, in an e-mail. Inclusivity is a core value at Tinder, and we believe in fighting for what our users believe in.\n\nPambakian said Tinder ideated the concept for the interracial couples and is an author of the proposal.\n\nMultiracial emojis only became available in 2015. In 2017, Microsoft's Windows 10.0 added interracial couple sequences. But those can only be accessed by copy and paste for now.\n\nRelated: 157 new emoji coming to iOS, Android\n\nThere's been a steady rise in interracial marriages since 1967, according to a Pew Research Study. In 2015, about 17% of all newlyweds were in interracial relationships.\n\nTinder recently paid for a study on interracial couples that it also released on Tuesday. Its findings reveal 61% of respondents say they're very open to the idea of interracial dating and marriage.\n\nThe interracial couple emojis proposal features photos of some of the authors and their biracial spouses.\n\nOhanian is pictured with his wife, professional tennis star Serena Williams. He said in the proposal that emojis should reflect current society.\n\nWe want our kids to have emojis that look like their parents, he said in a statement. Emojis are the universal language of the internet and should reflect the modern world where interracial relationships are normal.\n\nOhanian was one of the advocates who helped make the hijab emoji a reality in 2017, along with Emojination's Lee.\n\nLee, who has advocated for a number of emoji including the dumpling, is a coauthor of the interracial couple proposal.
Is your phone, tablet and laptop killing those in-flight entertainment screens at each seat? Not quite.\n\nIn-flight internet provider Gogo and Delta Air Lines on Tuesday announced it was unveiling a new kind of tablet that would be affixed to the seat-back. Rather than a wired, custom-designed screen, Delta would install standardized Android tablets at each seat that would wirelessly stream content from an on-board server.\n\nThat will not only reduce the weight of the system, but also opens a lot of new possibilities for airlines.\n\nGogo's new product is part of a major shift in how in-flight internet is transforming how we stay entertained in the sky.\n\nThe new screens will start rolling out on the first of 75 new Bombardier C Series aircraft arriving at Delta in the spring.\n\nEven as seats are smaller and planes more packed, your flying experience is going to be marked by improved technology. And increasingly the advancements represent a marriage between our personal devices and in-flight entertainment and connectivity.\n\nOur Airborne Living Room\n\nHow we use our devices on the ground is now how we expect to use them when we fly, airlines say.\n\nPeople are very accustomed to consuming multiple pieces of information at one time these days, said Joe Kiely, Managing Director, Customer Experience & Product Development at Delta in an interview. And having the seat back screen and having streaming...and wi-fi, which is getting faster and faster is what they're really accustomed to when they're at home.\n\nDelta has those individual screens on all its new planes and it spent $770 million to add them to most of its older jets. And the carrier announced Wednesday the airline was adding free texting to all its connected aircraft.\n\nAirlines have split on the future of seat back screens. Smaller jets that don't hop between continents aren't getting the same electronic amenities as bigger jets. Airbus says only about 30% of its smaller single-aisle jets are delivered with personal monitors, the number is estimated to be even lower for Boeing.\n\nRelated: This plane may vastly improve flying in the U.S., if it first doesn't start a trade war\n\nBut with more passengers coming aboard with a myriad of electronics, some airlines are questioning if the screens they provide still have a place in the sky. Nearly 80% of Americans now own a smartphone and half have a tablet, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nUnited Airlines, Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines have all steered away. Instead, phones, tablets and laptops can tap into high-speed internet or on-board streaming to deliver the same entertainment library or live TV.\n\nAnd the country's biggest carrier, American Airlines, said that its 100 new single-aisle 737 Max jets would arrive without seat back screens. The airline said Thursday it was removing them from its current 737s.\n\nIt makes sense for American to focus on giving customers the best entertainment and fast connection options rather than installing seatback monitors that will be obsolete within a few years, the company said in a statement.\n\nJonathan Norris, vice president of sales and marketing for Panasonic Avionics, which supplies about half of the world's in-flight screens, says American's attitude is understandable. Your [in-flight entertainment] screen is judged by your latest iPhone or your tablet, he said. Panasonic is developing a new generation of more easily upgradable screens that will be ready around 2020.\n\nGoing The Distance\n\nWhile airlines debate the future of those seat-back screens, the one place they aren't going away is on long-distance flights.\n\nAirbus says all its new long-range A350 jets and A380 superjumbos are fitted with the screens at each seat. And over the past three years about 95% of its smaller twin-aisle A330s have the same. Boeing declined to supply its figures, but a review by CNNMoney suggests its long-range jets have similarly tricked-out cabins.\n\nThe electronics ban on nine Middle Eastern airlines earlier in 2017 put the screens back in the spotlight. The ban forced travelers to check or leave behind their laptops and tablets. One airline declared: 'Let us entertain you,' a nod to the individual systems at each seat for movies, games and even a view outside.\n\nEven low-cost, long-haul carriers like Norwegian Air Shuttle are putting screens at each seat on its biggest jets.\n\nIn-flight entertainment has come a long way. The first in-flight movie dates back to the 1920s, but aerial cinema took its biggest leap in the 1990s with small personal screens at each seat. Airlines started adding sluggish wi-fi in 2004, but it wasn't until smartphones and tablets arrived a decade ago, that carriers started to think differently about aerial entertainment.\n\nDelta's move to improve the seatback screen is only the first step, says Gogo. By connecting the aircraft through a high-speed satellite internet connection, the seatback screen may open up a world of entertainment choices for airlines.\n\nHigh-speed services from Gogo, Honeywell, Panasonic and ViaSat can already stream video to a device you bring aboard, but it won't be long before airlines can enable streaming services like Hulu, HBO Now and Amazon Video directly to the seatback.\n\nAnd the big names in content streaming are taking notice. Netflix on Monday said it had developed a new type of encoding to shrink the amount of bandwidth used for in-flight streaming.\n\nAirlines are also merging on-board technology with the devices passengers have in their carry-on luggage.\n\nLufthansa's app now lets you make personal playlists of music, audio books and films that are ready on the screen when you take your seat. Singapore Airlines wirelessly pairs your phone or tablet with your screen to control a movie or follow the flight's progress.\n\nThis is about the internet of me, says Norris. This is about a passenger who walks on, synchronizes their phone with the seat back...to customize their experience on board.

Ms May spoke after leaders of the 27 remaining member states of the European Union met and approved the United Kingdom's withdrawal agreement for leaving the European Union and the political declaration that will set the course for the U.K.'s relationship with the E.U. once Brexit is complete. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nBritish lawmakers have soundly rejected Theresa May's Brexit deal, in the biggest defeat for any UK government in the modern parliamentary era.\n\nAfter 200 speeches across eight days of debate, members of the House of Commons ignored the Prime Minister's final pleas to support her plan and threw it out by 432 votes to 202.\n\nThe margin of defeat – greater than the previous record set in 1924 – means the Prime Minister now faces a deep political crisis with no clear way forward.\n\nThe opposition Labour party immediately triggered a vote of no-confidence in May's government, hoping to capitalize on a perilous moment to force a general election. Acknowledging the scale of the defeat, the Prime Minister said she would allow time for the House of Commons to debate the motion on Wednesday.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the defeat catastrophic and said a vote of no-confidence would allow the House of Commons to give its verdict on the sheer incompetence of this government.\n\nBut May urged lawmakers to listen to the British citizens who voted to leave the EU. I ask members on all sides of the house to listen to the British people, who want this issue settled, and to work with the government to do just that, May said.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nMay now has 24 hours to save her government. If she loses the vote of no-confidence, it makes a general election more likely.\n\nIf she survives, however, May said she would follow a two-stage process to break the Brexit impasse. First, she offered cross-party talks with lawmakers as an attempt to try and figure out a way forward. May promised the government would approach those talks in a constructive manner.\n\nThen, if a consensus emerges, she would take a revised plan to the European Union.\n\nBut there isn't much time: Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, whether a deal is in place or not. Every day that passes without this issue being resolved means more uncertainty, more bitterness and more rancor, May said.\n\nIt seems likely that May will survive the confidence vote. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) – the Northern Irish party that props up May's minority government – said it would work with the Prime Minister to secure a better deal.\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster welcomed Tuesday's vote, saying the UK parliament had acted in the best interests of the entire United Kingdom.\n\nFoster added: Whilst some may wish to use this defeat to boost their political ambitions, we will give the government the space to set out a plan to secure a better deal.\n\nPHOTO: DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP/Getty Images Pro-Brexit supporters hold up placards outside the UK Parliament as MPs debated.\n\nEuropean response\n\nMoments after the vote, European Council President Donald Tusk demanded the UK clarify its intentions on its plan as soon as possible.\n\nIn a statement, Tusk said: We will continue our preparations for all outcomes, including a no-deal scenario. The risk of a disorderly exit has increased with this vote and, while we do not want this to happen, we will be prepared for it.\n\nIn a tweet, Tusk also pointed out that the UK could unilaterally withdraw its notification to leave the EU: If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?\n\nIf a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is? — Charles Michel (@eucopresident) January 15, 2019\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, also warned of the ticking clock. I take note with regret of the outcome of the vote in the House of Commons this evening. I urge the UK to clarify its intentions as soon as possible. Time is almost up, Juncker wrote.\n\nHow the UK got here\n\nTuesday night's vote was the product of more than two and a half years of tortuous debate and negotiations, after 51.9% of British people voted to leave the EU in 2016.\n\nUntangling a 45-year marriage was not as easy as some Brexiteers claimed it would be. Particularly when it came the contentious Irish backstop – an insurance policy to prevent the return of border infrastructure between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – which has been a thorn in the side of May's deal.\n\nMay's defeat seemed inevitable. Lawmakers were due to vote on her deal in December but the process was thrown into disarray after May pulled the plug, admitting she would lose the vote by a significant margin.\n\nThe biggest challenge came from hardline pro-Brexit lawmakers within her own Conservative party – their opposition to what they see as an overly soft exit has dogged her deal from the start.\n\nIt's hard to see an obvious way out of the mess. Even if a consensus can be reached in parliament, there's no guarantee the EU would agree to reopen negotiations.\n\nIf no agreement can be reached, and the UK edges towards crashing out of the EU without a deal, it's possible the government could collapse, or the Conservative party could replace May as leader.\n\nAnother possibility is that parliament could force a second referendum, or – least likely of all – scrap Brexit altogether.\n\nThe only certainty is that with just 73 days left before the country is due to leave the EU, the UK is no closer to knowing what will happen.

We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\n\n(CNN) There are men of character in the U.S. Congress, both House and Senate. There are women of character, too. But the evidence for 'character' needs to be something other than the iteration of the word itself, writes Marjorie Garber in her book Character: The History of a Cultural Obsession.\n\nThat is a useful frame for trying to make sense of the dramas that proliferated on Capitol Hill this week as Congress took up multiple nominations to President Joe Biden's Cabinet and held its first hearing on the January 6 insurrection. As Garber notes, the translation of individual traits into a national character most often occurs at times of stress, as a marker not so much of social progress as of social and cultural anxiety.\n\nWe saw this. Conviction and commitment (and the lack of same), and in darker terms, eccentricity, hypocrisy and excuses made for bad behavior were on full display on the nation's highest political stage.\n\nDismissing hypocrisy with a laugh is part of what has left America's political discourse vulnerable to infiltration by dangerous conspiracy theories, wrotereacting to Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson's remarks during hearings about the violent Capitol riots. He suggested, citing multiple discredited claims, that the day had a jovial, festive tone and that the assault had been a false-flag operation. As Ghitis pointed out: That conspiracy theories exist and are spreading is not news, but hearing them uttered by a US senator during an official congressional hearing marks a new low, one that demands we sit up and take notice.  And because tens of millions of Americans believe the same thing[s]... by uttering that poisonous nonsense from the halls of Congress, Johnson is pumping more fuel into a dangerous fire.\n\nWhile no huge new revelations emerged during Tuesday's testimony about the US Capitol riots, the hearing sharpened the contours of the story, bringing into focus staggering security, defense and leadership failures,observed: There was no shortage of finger-pointing and blame-passing, but one big takeaway was clear: We've barely scratched the surface of what happened on one of the most ignominious days in American history.\n\nAndrea González-Ramírez, writing for Gen, noted of the nominees, all of whom would be history-making firsts in their positions if confirmed: I saw a familiar pattern develop.

Champagne corks pop in Berlin as gay rights supporters celebrate a historic vote to legalize same-sex marriage Photographs by Andrea Gjestvang for CNN Story by Laura Smith-Spark and Claudia Otto, CNN\n\nBerlin (CNN) — Pouring rain could do nothing to dampen the spirits of scores of people who gathered outside the Bundestag in Berlin on Friday morning, some clutching rainbow umbrellas, to await parliament's vote on a bill legalizing gay marriage in Germany.\n\nAs news came that the bill had passed — convincingly — they broke out into loud cheers, wept tears of joy and exchanged kisses. Some popped champagne corks in celebration despite the early hour.\n\nThis was the day that some had doubted would ever come. And now, in the space of a few days, an offer by Chancellor Angela Merkel to allow lawmakers a free vote on the issue has become all but law.\n\nPeople celebrate outside the Chancellery in Berlin after lawmakers voted to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nOnce Germany's Senate approves the bill next week, as expected, homosexual couples in Germany will have the same rights as heterosexual couples to marry and jointly adopt children — barring any legal challenge.\n\nIt is a very important moment for Germany and for the queer people in Germany, because we fought really long for equality in our rights and now it is time, project manager Andreas Reschke told CNN.\n\nAsked if he had any marriage plans, Reschke laughed and looked at his partner as he responded. Yeah, maybe.\n\nAndreas Reschke kisses his boyfriend after the result was announced.\n\nNico, a 20-year-old student who preferred to give only his first name, said he had traveled with his partner from Dresden, 120 miles away, to be part of the landmark moment and that he was now so happy.\n\nWe woke up very early and we knew it was raining in Berlin, but we thought it is so important we have to come here, he said. It is incredible, I can't believe it. I think (Merkel) said it on Monday and today is Friday and we have a new law.\n\nThe change means his dream of marriage is now possible, he said, as is his hope of one day adopting children.\n\nNico and Jan came to Berlin from Dresden to witness the historic moment.\n\nHannah Klaubert, 26, said it was important to be visible on such a significant day — and that the fight for equality was not over.\n\nThere are still 200 people who voted against (the bill) today, so I think it's going to be important still, said Klaubert, who works for an international non-profit organization.\n\nAnd there are so many other issues like trans-rights and all other kinds of things that are not okay here and that we need to keep on fighting for.\n\nHannah Klabuert hugs her partner.\n\nSpeaking after the bill passed, Merkel — who had until Monday opposed the holding of a free vote on the issue — said she had voted no, but that it had been important to put it to a vote of conscience.\n\nKlaubert said she was unimpressed by the way the Chancellor handled the issue. I think it was just a political, cold-hearted strategy and I really don't like it.\n\nFor Torsten Benzin, a lawyer, the change in the law is hugely significant.\n\nTorsten Benzin said Friday's vote was as monumental a moment as the fall of the USSR.\n\nIt took almost 30 years in Germany, we fought for it and today is the day. For me personally, because I'm from the former GDR, this is as important as the Berlin Wall falling, he said.\n\nI'm already in a partnership and of course, I will now finally change it into a real marriage. This means no longer having to tick boxes on forms to say that he is partnered rather than married, Benzin said, adding: My sexuality is nobody's business.\n\nHe said Merkel had delayed on the issue until her hand was finally forced by pressure from rival political parties ahead of September's elections. I believe that it was a tactical maneuver because she knew, if she didn't do it now, it would be an ever-lasting thing for the next coalition negotiations.\n\nRainy weather didn't stop people from gathering outside the Bundestag in Berlin.\n\nSoftware developer Sebastian Vetter told CNN he had braved the downpour to be part of the historic moment.\n\nIt is important to show we are here, we support gay marriage, marriage equality, marriage for everyone — so that the people there who are giving their vote know we are here and we are proud to be part of the community, he said.\n\nMerkel could have acted on the issue far sooner, Vetter said, but no matter how it happened it just happened. Now we got the chance and we have to use it.\n\nIt is a historical day and yes let's celebrate the whole weekend, said Sebastian Vetter.\n\nWhile he has no immediate plans to get married, Vetter is very happy to now have that option.\n\nLet's see what the future brings, but as we saw in other countries, if there is gender equality people are more aware that people love people and that has nothing to do with their sex or gender.\n\nIt is a step in the right direction to end discrimination.
Atlanta (CNN) I live alone in my home surrounded by my family who live here, too... it's corona-complicated.\n\nI haven't seen them in weeks. Not in person. I hear them, their footsteps, and my wife's voice as she talks on the phone to others. The creak of the floor, the open and close of a door. The TV. The shower.\n\nI am haunted by living ghosts.\n\nWeeks ago my wife, Blis, and I planned what we'd do if someone in our family got sick, including how we would divvy up living space to isolate the patient. It's a concern because my wife has an autoimmune disease.\n\nWe had already stocked up. Being a journalist, you are pretty up on the information, and the virus writing was on the wall some time ago. But events have unraveled in ways I hadn't fully considered.\n\nI had been on the road about two weeks, in Alabama for an execution, then on the trail of the coronavirus, hopping flights to hot spots in Florida, Boston and New York.\n\nUsually my family is thrilled when I tell them I'm headed home. This time I could hear the hesitation in my wife's voice when I called with the news.\n\nYou can keep going, she said It's OK.\n\nI said CNN had told us we all were now going to be based and working from home.\n\nOh, was the reply.\n\nIt wasn't that she didn't love me. But for the first time in 30 years she wasn't sure she wanted me... home.\n\nI knew why. I was a threat.\n\nThe rest of the family had been sheltering in place. I was waltzing back with who knows what. And though I had no symptoms, I had to be treated like that patient we had hypothesized weeks ago.\n\nOnce at my house, in the garage, over the phone, I was told what my life would be.\n\nYou will go up to the master bedroom she said. She had already hurriedly evacuated her things. That is where you live, eat and work.\n\nMy heart said, This seems pretty extreme. My head said, She's exactly right.\n\nSavidge has quarantined himself in a bedroom to protect the rest of his family.\n\nTwo weeks is what they recommend, she added, referring to the self-quarantine guidelines. And every time you go off on another story... the clock resets.\n\nSo, in the bathroom, I have a cooler full of drinks, a coffee maker and sanitizing wipes.\n\nIn the bedroom, I have three computers for work, another to watch Netflix, and two phones that serve as communications and camera for video links to CNN and my team.\n\nIf I need anything, I call my wife or son and it materializes outside my door. There's a knock, they retreat, I retrieve once they have vanished again.\n\nI do leave the house each day to exercise. I call down. The rest of the family shelters in place till I'm out the door. We do the same in reverse when I come back.\n\nSavidge used a tablet to continue his tradition of making a birthday card for his wife.\n\nMy biggest challenge so far has been a birthday card. I have made one for my wife every year of our marriage. Today, her birthday, I struggled. I managed some crude drawings using a tablet.\n\nThe hard part was getting it to print remotely downstairs when I couldn't see if anything was coming out. It took several tries coordinating over the phone with my son, who was at the printer.\n\nFinally, success.\n\nOn his wife's birthday, a slice of cake was left for Savidge outside his self-imposed quarantine room.\n\nThen tonight over FaceTime, I joined my family singing Happy Birthday. Instead of blowing out the candles, my wife extinguished them with a wave of a magazine.\n\nMoments later came a knock and a slice at my door. I never saw who delivered it.\n\nThese are the times in which we live.
Todd Graham is the director of debate at Southern Illinois University. His debate teams have won five national championships and he has been recognized three times as the national debate coach of the year. Follow him on Facebook and Twitter . The views expressed in this commentary belong solely to the author. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) Several candidates made strong cases for themselves in the New Hampshire debate on Friday. While Amy Klobuchar came out on top, the grades below indicate just how close the debate was (and unlike the Iowa caucus, you don't need some new app to figure out who performed well).\n\nAmy Klobuchar: A\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar avoided most of her previous mistakes (interrupting other candidates and speaking over the moderators) and had her best debate yet. Klobuchar was particularly terrific in the last half of the debate. Her final answer -- in response to a question about the state of our country, where nearly one in five preschoolers live below the poverty line -- was by far the best on stage. She slammed the complete lack of empathy from President Trump and made clear that she would support those who have trouble stretching their paychecks to pay for rent. To highlight the contrast between her and Trump, Klobuchar continually repeated, I know you and will fight for you.\n\nBut it wasn't just her final answer. Senator Klobuchar was solid on her defense of voting for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and why big money, voter purges, and gerrymandering are hurting the political process. Finally, Klobuchar pointed to the popularity of the Affordable Care Act, and delivered an excellent defense of keeping it in favor of Medicare for All.\n\nJoe Biden: A-\n\nBiden defended the politics of the past with more vigor than in any previous debate. He began by mentioning many of the policies he supported, from fighting domestic violence, to banning chemical weapons, and allowing same sex marriage, going on to say, I don't know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden was so bad.\n\nBiden also effectively highlighted his record on gun control and slammed Senator Bernie Sanders for voting to protect gun manufacturers against lawsuits from victims of gun violence.\n\nFinally, in a uniting stance, Biden asked the audience members to stand and applaud the actions of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who testified in the House impeachment inquiry, only to be fired on Friday by President Trump.\n\nBiden should reiterate his commitment to African-American voters, instead of simply repeating poll numbers that point to their strong support for his candidacy. Finally, Biden should try to remember that his newly found energetic anger isn't appropriate for every answer in the debate.\n\nBernie Sanders: B+\n\nSenator Sanders was effective in his overall message about corruption, taking on drug companies, and price fixing. And toward the end of the debate, Sanders was persuasive when he brought up the climate crisis and argued that military spending around the world could be better used to fight our common enemy, which is climate change..\n\nSenator Sanders took some shots at Pete Buttigieg for courting wealthy donors, which would have been more effective if the Senator had been able to provide clear examples of how campaign money might have influenced specific policy decisions. Sanders also had a bit more trouble on issues like the cost of his health care plan, and gun control, but ultimately came out with decent defenses.\n\nElizabeth Warren: B+\n\nEven though Warren may not have stood out in the first half of the debate, she set up her answers with a clever theme and reiterated the values of the party by stating: We are Democrats. This played well with her indictment of the overarching corruption in the political system that favors corporations and the wealthy.\n\nPerhaps her best moment came when she criticized Pete Buttigieg's answer on racial disparity in policing, and easily pivoted to the broader topic of why we need race-conscious laws in all areas, including housing, education, employment.\n\nFinally, while I like that Warren seemingly stood her ground on the need to withdraw troops from the Middle East, she then hedged her answer when she was pressed on whether she would maintain a US military presence in the region if her generals advised her to do so by saying, I want to hear the plan. In the end, I wasn't sure precisely what her position was.\n\nPete Buttigieg: C+\n\nButtigieg's best moments came when he talked about his own experiences. As a veteran, Buttigieg was excellent when talking about Trump being unfit to serve as a commander-in-chief. He argued that Trump has no regard for the military when he does things like refusing to read the intelligence reports or pardoning war criminals.\n\nButtigieg had trouble answering a question about why marijuana arrests of African-Americans increased while he was mayor of South Bend, Indiana. And Buttigieg missed his moment when he was criticized for accepting big money donors. His defense -- that Democrats needed to bring everybody into the fold -- fell flat. Buttigieg delivered a stronger answer in the previous debate when he said that Democrats needed all the financial help they could get in order to beat Trump.\n\nTom Steyer: C\n\nSteyer's theme was that the Democratic nominee must be able to hit Trump on Trump's best talking point: the economy. Over three different questions, Steyer mentioned how the economy must be central if a Democrat wants to beat Trump. This strong use of repetition played to his strength.\n\nWhile Steyer's eye contact with moderators, other debaters, and audience members was much better than in previous debates, he still made a basic debating error by bringing up a point without explaining it. Steyer claimed one of Biden's campaign surrogates made a racist remark. Steyer refused to drop this point but did not clearly explain the situation. What happened? I don't know -- because Tom Steyer didn't offer an explanation. Steyer's attack left viewers confused, and Biden went on to brag about his support among the Black Caucus.\n\nAndrew Yang: C\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nI liked that Yang went back to his Freedom Dividend -- a $1,000 a month stipend -- as his theme. What hurt Yang in this debate was his inability to tie the idea of a universal basic income to solid evidence that it will help issues from social justice to employment and even addiction. When Klobuchar pressed him, Yang should have interjected and spoken up about how he'd pay for his addiction treatment centers.\n\nOverall, I thought Yang was a bit off in his delivery last night with misplaced pauses, a lackluster speaking style and a rare inability to focus on presenting his most persuasive answers. To be honest, I think not being in the Iowa debate might have thrown off his timing. Both in substance and in style, I've heard Yang give better answers in previous debates.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\nERIN BURNETT, HOST: OUTFRONT next, the losses at JPMorgan, the number getting bigger today. The Dow took a hit and a high level executive lost her job.\n\n\n\nAnd possible new evidence of Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program. Today there's a diagram. We show it to the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein OUTFRONT tonight.\n\n\n\nAnd new details just released about the case against George Zimmerman, the man charged with killing Trayvon Martin. Let's go OUTFRONT.\n\n\n\nGood evening, everyone and OUTFRONT tonight we have breaking news. The market today dropped about 125 points, thanks to Greece and JPMorgan. Deepening trading losses at the bank today. The total losses for America's biggest bank, at this moment we can tell you could now be $4 billion. Just on Friday we were telling you it was only three billion and you may have seen reports the day before that it was two billion. And JPMorgan is about to face a firing squad here in Washington. At the bank today heads started to roll.\n\n\n\nThe first out was the woman at the top of the chief investment officer, Ina Drew (ph). She made $30 million in compensation in the past two years. It's unclear at this time how much of that may be clawed back related to recent competition reform. We're also just hours away from a more public showdown. CEO Jamie Dimon will be facing shareholder fire in person at the company's annual meeting in Tampa.\n\n\n\nJamie likes a fight but you can bet that he is not thrilled about the timing of this. There will be a lot of tough questions from shareholders and here in the halls of the Senate there's an investigation in the works. Senator Bob Corker, Republican from Tennessee, is the man who called for the hearings and he's OUTFRONT tonight. And good to see you, Senator.\n\n\n\nSEN. BOB CORKER (R-TN), SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE: Good to be with you, Erin.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: All right, so what do you want to find out?\n\n\n\nCORKER: Well I mean this is an interesting point in time. Rules are being promulgated right now that affect all of these things. And the question is under current laws that have been passed, if they're fully in place, was this in fact a proprietary trade or not, which is something we don't want to see happening in these institutions, or was this really a legitimate hedge that would take place within an institution. We've been getting a lot of, you know, this has evolved.\n\n\n\nWe had a lot of conversations this weekend with the examiner in charge at the OCC that oversees JPMorgan. And we got one piece of input that's evolved, that sort of walked back away from that and I guess at the end of the day this is very complex. This is certainly no threat whatsoever to JPMorgan as far as it being --\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Well it's small relative to their assets.\n\n\n\nCORKER: Yes, this is two months worth of earnings to them, but the issue is there are a lot of rules that are being created right now and whenever you have especially something this high profile it's going to affect the outcome --\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Right.\n\n\n\nCORKER: -- of what's actually happening right now in Washington.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: But you're saying looking at the top accountants and auditors who are looking at this right now they still are not able to determine whether it was proprietary, i.e., should not be happening under the new rules --\n\n\n\nCORKER: Right.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: -- or legitimate?\n\n\n\nCORKER: And those rules aren't in effect yet.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Right.\n\n\n\nCORKER: The question is what's really happened here and do we have laws that affect what's been happening. There's some very specific language in the Volcker Rule that really -- that talks about hedging and it talks about aggregate, it talks about unique trades and the fact is nobody yet has been able to determine whether this is something that could stay in place or not.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: So -- but JPMorgan itself, I mean is it possible you could do something about the bank? I mean you talk about it being small for that bank, and it is. And some people say, oh, well that's a sign that the system is strong. But then you could look at it and say why is the bank so big. It's 45 percent bigger in terms of assets, 2.3 trillion in assets. That's 15 percent of the U.S. economy, JPMorgan and it's 45 percent bigger now than it was right before the financial crisis, just to be clear.\n\n\n\nCORKER: Yes.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: I mean is that OK?\n\n\n\nCORKER: Well I mean that is a whole different issue. And you know there was resolution language that I actually spent a lot of time on myself that you know you create the opportunity to wind -- you have the ability to wind down an institution that fails. But again, that's a whole separate issue --\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Right. But you could make the argument it isn't because you could say well if it were smaller, Jamie Dimon would have known what was going on opposed to --\n\n\n\nCORKER: (INAUDIBLE) so here's the question. Under Volcker --\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Right.\n\n\n\nCORKER: -- is this something that is legitimate after Volcker is fully implemented? A lot of people are saying yes. Secondly, there are people who say that this couldn't have happened if you had the Glass-Steagall (ph) regime in place.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCORKER: The OCC -- the OCC has categorically said that's not true, this could have still occurred. And if you had -- if you downsize the institutions, this kind of trade could still occur.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Right.\n\n\n\nCORKER: So I think what we need to do is understand you know how this -- how this occurred. It was all on the banking side, not on the investment bank side. And do we have policies that appropriately deal with this? So this is, again, very unique, very specific, very complex.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Right.\n\n\n\nCORKER: And we only had one hearing on the Volcker Rule prior to making it law.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Although -- I hear you, but I mean unique and specific, I feel like we hear that every time there's a big trading loss. They are all unique and specific. That's why they keep happening.\n\n\n\nCORKER: Yes. No, no, no, look --\n\n\n\nBURNETT: That's the problem.\n\n\n\nCORKER: I mean and let's think about it. I mean human beings do bone-headed things. In a business like this, things like this are going to occur. We need to make sure we try to regulate properly. But the best antidote to this is to have capital requirements that are sufficient. And as we mentioned earlier, this is a very large institution.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Yes.\n\n\n\nCORKER: The riskiest thing they do is to make a loan. And what we need to ensure is that capital requirements are strong enough. And in this case, obviously, way beyond that.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Now, you're speaking for reform so I don't mean to imply that you're not. But your top contributor was JPMorgan Chase. Individual and PAC (ph) donations, $61,000. You're up for re- election.\n\n\n\nCORKER: Yes.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Do you feel conflicted? Do you feel that you're more likely to be sympathetic listening to Jamie Dimon because he gives you a lot of money?\n\n\n\nCORKER: I mean -- you know my race last time was a national race that was huge. There were people who contributed from all walks of life and the same is true this time. I was the first person who called for a hearing here, so I don't think that's the case at all and I know it's not the case. And, no, I don't feel conflicted at all. Look, I tell these guys when they come in, I just had this same conversation with Jamie Dimon recently and a group of other people here I'm not a friend of banking.\n\n\n\nI'm not a foe of banking. What I want to see is that we have capital markets -- that we have capital markets in this country that function appropriately, that we have a financial system that meets the needs of an economy like we have in the U.S. and I just want to see it work in the appropriate way. One of the biggest setbacks we've had to our economy is the crisis in this financial system that sets us back years.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCORKER: So look I just want to make us -- I want to make sure that we have good outcomes here. And what -- and senators are not basing judgments on this or things that they believe to be perceptions, but the reality of what's actually happened in this case and hopefully a hearing will help us do that.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: All right, well Senator, thank you very much. Senator Corker of course joining me here in Washington. Now let's check in with John Avlon in New York. John, what are your thoughts? I'm curious just overall about your thoughts about lobbying dollars going from industries to committees that regulate those industries.\n\n\n\nJOHN AVLON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well look the growth of lobbying over the past decade in particular has been a real problem. Many people point to it as a cause for not just the increased spending we've seen but things like the lobbying that has watered down the Volcker Rule. Much of it was pursued by JPMorgan Chase. So lobbyists do have their thumb on the scale and it's a growing problem in Washington. And it's contributed to a lot of the frustration that people feel at home, the sense that Washington isn't working. Lobbyists are an important reason -- part of the reason why.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: So do you think, John that we'll be able to get reforms or what's your sense?\n\n\n\nAVLON: Well, look, follow the money. That's one of the tougher things to do, but certainly in this specific case calling for a hearing is a step in the right direction. The question is, is it not just about asking regulators what went wrong but bringing members of JPMorgan Chase and of course this is all complicated by the fact that JPMorgan Chase has been the responsible bank and they've been powerfully arguing against regulation, against the Volcker Rule. Well, that argument is going to be a lot tougher to make going forward as we find out this loss isn't two billion as they said last week, but now four billion perhaps or higher. This is a complicated position they find themselves in of their own making.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Yes, absolutely of their own making and as we said completely avoidable as well. John Avlon thank you.\n\n\n\nAnd ahead, Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, joins me to talk about evidence of a possible weapons test, explosive test for a nuclear weapon in Iran.\n\n\n\nAnd President Obama slamming Mitt Romney for his time at Bain Capital, calling the Republican a job-killing vampire on the same day he well had lunch with a private equity titan to raise money. Tonight Romney fires back.\n\n\n\nAnd hangings and decapitations. We're going to take a look at what could be the biggest threat to this country. It's not in the Middle East. It's across our southern border. We'll be back.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Our second story OUTFRONT, countdown to an Iran showdown. There is new evidence today that Iran is moving forward with a nuclear weapons program, just as talks are getting under way to convince the country to stop its suspected program. Negotiators from the International Atomic Energy Agency today left the Iranian mission in Vienna in silence. Usually you know they'll take the opportunity -- you see the cameras there -- to talk to them to say something. They said nothing.\n\n\n\nThe IAEA is in the middle of its first talks with Iran in three months. The latest report from the agency, of course you may recall, said there were quote strong indications of possible nuclear weapons development. Indications like this picture from The Associated Press in today's Washington Post. Now let me just explain exactly what you're looking at here because I looked at this and said what is this? Something that could be in my backyard. It's a drawing of what's believed to be a nuclear explosion containment chamber hidden at a secret Iranian military base perhaps near a site called Parshan (ph) that the government in Iran has refused weapons inspectors access to.\n\n\n\nExperts say a chamber like this is what you use to test a nuclear weapon. And we talked to them. They confirmed that. Important to say, though, that this picture is not a picture that we have confirmed the authenticity of. There are, though, new signs that the economic sanctions against Iran are working. Take this story on the front page of today's Washington Post. Quote Iran unable to sell oil stores it on tankers. Literally they're storing it on tankers, turning off the GPS on the tankers so that -- because it's against maritime law to do so because they don't want anyone to know where the tankers are (INAUDIBLE) they're trying to sail into ports and just find anyone to buy their oil. So earlier today I spoke to Senator Dianne Feinstein. She is a key leader in the Senate on national security issues, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and I began by asking her what it will take to reach an agreement with Iran.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nSEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CA), SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRWOMAN: I think all of us pretty much know what the parameters of an agreement are. And I think we also know the window is closing, that Israel is quite adamant that this is an existential threat, that she will not let Iran achieve a nuclear warhead and that means all kinds of unpredictable military actions.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: When you say everyone is on the same page about a deal, I was talking to Prime Minister Netanyahu a couple of weeks ago and he said he would allow no enrichment, none at all, not even the three percent that you would be using if you were using nuclear power for medical use or things like that. That doesn't really seem to be the same page as the United States, though, right? I mean would --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: The United States would accept a little bit more, right?\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: I don't think that's the United States' position. I think its confined enrichment to five percent, limited to the medical isotopes. Move anything above five percent out of the country or secure it --\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Right.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: -- have full transparency and 24/7/365 day-a-year access for the IAEA to all these sites. And then be willing to also talk about other things, which is what the Iranians have wanted to do. I am hopeful. In my view it's the best chance of a solution. Of course this is the P-5 (ph) plus one, so it's a unique bargaining agent, you might say.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: When you talk about access, I want to ask you about Israel in a second, Israel issue, but access. I have this picture which I know is -- it looks a little strange. The Associated Press obtained this from a government that is skeptical of Iran's honesty in its nuclear program and they say this is a chamber used for testing explosives for nuclear weapons. We did make some calls today and experts said indeed this would be consistent with that, but we haven't independently verified the source government. Supposedly it's at the Parshan (ph) site though, which is the site the IAEA has not been able to --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: -- get access to after repeated requests. How big of a problem is this?\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: Well, number one, I've never seen that picture. It could be from anywhere so I don't know where it's from, so a comment would be useless. I can say this. The decision as far as our intelligence is concerned is that Iran has not made the decision to enrich to military grade uranium. Now, having said that, there's no comment on whether they have speeded things up so they could get to that position --\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Right.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: So that if a decision was made, it could go more quickly.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Yes.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: So I mean I think that's what's out there. There's one other thing. The sanctions are biting. They're biting deeply. Additional sanctions will go into play with the Central Bank. And so by June or July, the sanctions should be approximately full tilt.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Iran is going to ask for the sanctions to be rolled back. Don't put those really tough sanctions that Europe was going to be putting on this summer, don't do it, because we've made progress. That's what they're going to ask for. Is there any way you think that the United States at least would say, OK, we don't have to put that extra round of sanctions on, or is that something that must go forward to get the final deal done.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: Well, this is just my view.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Yes.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: My view is that sanctions should not be lessened until and if there is a final deal concurred in by all.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: And that leads me to Israel where you said the U.S. and Israel aren't necessarily on the same page in terms of what level of enrichment to allow. Prime Minister Netanyahu telling me nothing. You're saying the U.S. would allow up to five percent. How is the U.S. and Israel going to bridge that gap? Because if they say zero we say five and they strike, we're going to be involved.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: Well, there is a strong difference between the United States and Israel. There also is a strong likelihood that if Israel were to attack, the United States would be drawn into what would become rapidly another war with Iran that could have catastrophic consequences throughout the Middle East. And one of the things that we don't do well is follow through on figuring out if you do this and they do that, then what happens? Do we support Israel? Israel is close to us. Obviously we're going to back up Israel.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Right.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: Then, is it war? And then what do the rest of the Middle East do?\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE) BURNETT: Is it war, the big question that everyone has to be thinking very much about here in the Senate and Washington and in this country over the next few months.\n\n\n\nNext on OUTFRONT prosecutors filing new evidence just this afternoon. (INAUDIBLE) actually crossing right now, regarding the shooting of Trayvon Martin and the case against George Zimmerman. And the president goes after Mitt Romney and his record at Bain Capital. Plus, we're going to go inside the drug wars from Mexico. And amazing statistic, did you know that 90 percent of the cocaine in this country comes from Mexico, and 70 percent of the guns that are used in Mexican drug crime come from right here in the U.S.? We'll be back.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: New evidence coming to light tonight in the murder case against George Zimmerman. He of course is the neighborhood watchman who's admitted to shooting Trayvon Martin. Now, the Orlando Sentinel reported late this afternoon that the special prosecutor's office filed an eight-page preview of their case with the county clerk. Now, in it nearly two dozen primary witnesses are listed.\n\n\n\nThere's also some never-before-seen video and more than 50 recorded audio statements that the state plans to use at the trial. Coming OUTFRONT on this story, our legal analyst, Mark Nejame and Mark obviously I know you know a lot about this. Can you tell us who are some of the witnesses and obviously everyone is going to go what, a new video, I feel like we've all seen these videos so many times. What is this new video?\n\n\n\nMARK NEJAME, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Well, we have a lot of things coming out but it's just the beginning. You're going to see a lot more coming out over time. I think there's about 18 police officers from the Sanford Police Department who are on the witness list. There are 67 CDs coming out that will have a lot of information on it. And there's two videos, as I understand it, one from the 7-Eleven and one from the clubhouse. So we're going to be getting a whole bunch of new information.\n\n\n\nI'm not sure if some of the most important information is coming out in this first wave though. The autopsy reports I think are going to be extremely relevant. An enhancement of the 911-tapes is extremely relevant. And knowing where everybody was, the proximity of where the shooting occurred, the clubhouse, the car, where he was staying, all those are important pieces that I don't know if those are going to come out in the first wave. I'm anxious to see if they do.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: And why would they come out in waves? Why would you wait -- just because literally they don't have it all together or is this standard procedure? I mean how much more do you think there is and when will we get it?\n\n\n\nNEJAME: Well, it's entirely possible that they're just not completed -- they have not completed everything yet and they're not going to turn it over until in fact they are. And if I could, you had indicated earlier that all this was information they were planning on using. Not necessarily, in Florida we have very open discovery laws. And if in fact there's something that's favorable or unfavorable, it still needs to be turned over to the defense and then a determination will be made if one side or the other plans on using it and if it's even admissible in court. So there's a very open discovery --\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Oh OK.\n\n\n\nNEJAME: And everything has to be turned over.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: All right I didn't know that and we just found out that Zimmerman's lawyer got the discovery package, you know, late tonight, so presumably he's just going through it, presumably going to try to block all of this, the video for example, something that the American public would want to see. But to block it from going public. Will he succeed?\n\n\n\nNEJAME: He'll have an uphill battle, that's for sure. We have very -- as I said, very open not only discovery, but sunshine laws in Florida. So he'll have to make an argument that the public's right to know is far outweighed by the public policy of protecting the safety of some of these witnesses because of the possibility of some death threats or injury or harm coming to some of these witnesses, to possibly being harassed and witness tampering. One would imagine that he would try to bring that out to show that some public safety outweighs the public's right to know. It will be an uphill battle.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Yes. Mark, how in the world are they going to find a jury that isn't full of people that have opinions on this case? I mean everyone in this country has an opinion on this case.\n\n\n\nNEJAME: Well everybody who's watching CNN has an opinion on the case but that doesn't necessarily mean that everybody is in fact watching it. It's interesting to find that those of us who follow matters such as this, it's water cooler talk, and we all follow this and are interested in it. But there's many people who in fact don't follow these matters, then the challenge becomes are those really people you want to have on a jury who really remains so utterly misinformed, but that's what happens.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: All right especially when they live in the area. All right thanks very much to Mark. Appreciate it.\n\n\n\nAhead, 49 mutilated bodies dumped in Mexico, an absolutely horrific act. We're going to talk about that, tell you exactly why it's happening and why it could be the biggest threat to this country.\n\n\n\nAnd the president going negative, attacking Mitt Romney. We'll be back.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nERIN BURNETT, HOST: We start the second half of our show with stories we care about, where we focus on our own reporting from the front lines.\n\n\n\nAnd, first, JPMorgan making some changes after taking a massive loss on trades. The chief investment officer, Ina Drew, the first person out. She made more than $30 million in the past two years. She headed the unit that has lost what could be now $4 billion.\n\n\n\nTomorrow, CEO Jamie Dimon will be answering shareholders at the company's annual meeting in Tampa.\n\n\n\nNumber two, a group representing Palestinian prisoners has reached a deal with Israel to end a hunger strike. That strike began all the way back April 17th. The announcement of the deal sent crowds to the streets of Gaza to celebrate.\n\n\n\nTwo thousand prisoners were protesting their treatment in Israeli prisons. The deal covers things like when a prisoner can be moved into solitary confinement and will allow family members to visit. There are over 4,500 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails tonight.\n\n\n\nSixteen billion dollars -- well, that's the size of California's deficit. And it's nearly twice as big as Governor Jerry Brown estimated four months ago. If he were running a bank, he'd be facing some problems right now.\n\n\n\nBut today, he said he wants to cut state payrolls by 5 percent and hike taxes on the wealthy.\n\n\n\nI asked the senior senator, Dianne Feinstein, about the crisis and she brought up one specific individual.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D), CALIFORNIA: I was reading about one high- tech executive that because of capital gains was going to leave his citizenship and move to -- or become a citizen of Singapore.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Yes, the Facebook guy.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: Yes. Well, I say let him go. I can't think of anything more disloyal to do, candidly.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: The man's name is Eduardo Saverin. He's 30 years old and was the founder of Facebook. Reports say he'll save $60 million in taxes by becoming a citizen of Singapore, which has no capital gains tax.\n\n\n\nWell, Yahoo!'s CEO is out. Scott Thompson resigned over the weekend after it was revealed he didn't have the computer science degree that he claimed. We took a look through the latest SEC filings and here's what he'll get. No severance but he will get to keep the $7 million he recently collected in cash and stock.\n\n\n\nYahoo! has named Ross Levinsohn the interim CEO, currently the head of global media for Yahoo!\n\n\n\nWell, it's been 284 days since the U.S. lost its top credit rating. What are we doing to get it back? I asked (INAUDIBLE) in the air, I'm sitting here in the Senate, where is everybody?\n\n\n\nOur fourth story OUTFRONT: one of the biggest threats to this country and it's much closer than a lot of people think. You know, you think of, you know, the Middle East somewhere or you think of China. But, no, it's Mexico.\n\n\n\nAnd investigators are trying today to identify 49 bodies that were found mutilated beyond belief and recognition. Stuffed in plastic bags in a small town of San Juan, yesterday. That's less than 100 miles from the American border. The bodies are 43 men and six women were found headless with no feet and no hands. They are victims of Mexico's Los Zetas drug cartel.\n\n\n\nMore than 47,000 people -- 47,000 people, just think about that for a minute -- have been killed in Mexico since President Felipe Calderon launched an offensive against drug cartels in 2006. Ninety-nine have been killed in brutal fashion like what I just described in just the past month, as the two biggest cartels, Los Zetas and Sinaloa fight for control of Mexico's border with the United States.\n\n\n\nWhy do they fight for control of that border? Because the drug wars are continuing. Ninety percent of the cocaine that enters the American country and it comes through Mexico. It's also the main supplier of marijuana and meth in this country.\n\n\n\nSo the question is what else is getting into the United States that we don't know about?\n\n\n\nJay Ahern is former head of the border protection and now a principal at the Chertoff Group; Hipolito Acosta is a former undercover INS agent and author of The Shadow Catcher.\n\n\n\nAppreciate you both taking the time.\n\n\n\nJay, let me just ask you, it seems like the violence is getting much, much worse. What I just described with the heads and the feet cut off, this is brutality at a level that I think is very hard to imagine, but it appears to be at this point, dare I say common?\n\n\n\nJAY AHERN, FORMER HEAD OF U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION: Yes, I think when you actually take a look, Erin, the numbers may be closer to 50,000 since December of 2006 when President Calderon really started to take the fight to the cartels. We've seen it start to level a little bit in the last few months. Leveling is really a statement of choice here, that about 1,000 killings per month. But the gravity and the heinousness of the killings this past few days really shows as far as how aggressive and how ruthless these individuals are. Beyond just the beheadings, the cutting off the arms and legs sends a strong signal.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: It certainly does.\n\n\n\nPolly, how -- is this really about controlling -- who's controlling the drugs going into the United States? I mean, this is still a question of U.S. demand and supply that is not necessarily from Mexico but transiting through Mexico?\n\n\n\nHIPOLITO ACOSTA, FORMER UNDERCOVER INS AGENT: Yes to both of your questions.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Polly, sorry, go ahead.\n\n\n\nACOSTA: I think what you have -- I'm sorry. What you have are two cartels that are actually fighting for a very lucrative route, and I think this violence is going to continue. Jay was talking about sending a signal and I think it sends a strong signal to anybody who would oppose the cartels in that particular area.\n\n\n\nI think the violence is going to continue during the next few months. We have a presidential election coming up in Mexico and I think some of the cartels are positioning themselves to make sure that they control this particular areas for a number of reasons.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: And let me ask you, Jay, about something else. I don't know if everyone remembers but obviously there was a plot that the United States government alleges was put forth by the Iranian government using an Iranian-American in Texas who was hiring a Mexican drug cartel to commit an assassination that would have killed civilians right here in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\nWe also, of course action heard from Air Force General Douglas Fraser, who testified on whether there was other terrorist activities going on in Mexico to get into the United States, and here's what he said.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGEN. DOUGLAS FRASER, COMMANDER OF U.S. SOUTHERN COMMAND: Those organizations are primarily focused on financial support to organizations back in the Middle East, but they are involved in illicit activity. And so that is the connection that we continue to look for, as we watch in the future, that connection between the illicit activity and the potential pathway into the United States.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Jay, how big of a risk is this, the Hezbollah or other terrorist activities could be working with drug cartels to get into the United States?\n\n\n\nAHERN: Well, I think one of the things that's important to recognize, these are criminal organizations and they certainly will diversify what their level of criminality is, whether drugs today, weapons tomorrow or a need to move high-valued targets across the border. Certainly, that was a great piece of work by the federal agencies specifically doing drug investigations and actually uncovered the individual who was contemplating an assassination attempt.\n\n\n\nBut, clearly, these are criminals, and they're going to do anything they can for a profit going forward. BURNETT: Polly, one thing I find hard to understand here, and especially with all the coverage in this country on the whole Fast and Furious controversy, there are 6,600 licensed gun dealers in the United States within 100 miles of the Mexican border, 70 percent of the guns recovered from Mexican drug activity had originated here in the United States.\n\n\n\nWe're the ones arming this whole problem, right?\n\n\n\nACOSTA: Well, you know, but let's understand one thing. The guns were going into Mexico way before Fast and Furious occurred, whether we would have had Fast and Furious or not. I think that the -- frankly, the Mexican government needs to stand up and stop blaming the United States for arming them.\n\n\n\nThey have -- they need to address the issue of the cartel that say they have in Mexico and certainly we work very closely with foreign governments to stop the illegal flow of weapons in any direction. But I think that weapons were long available in Mexico before Fast and Furious. I think that the efforts that our government is doing to stop that flow is commendable because our agents work very hard to stop that flow of weapons into Mexico.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Jay, do you think it's fair to say that the biggest threat to the United States could be from our southern border, whether from drug wars or from other terrorist organizations? You know, I was in Laos a year ago and a Mexican drug dealer had been with someone I was with doing a deal for drugs coming from southeast Asia, so it's certainly more than Colombian cocaine now.\n\n\n\nAHERN: Sure it is. But, I think, Erin, let's put a couple of things in perspective. Certainly when you aggregate the amount of cartel deaths, again action 47,000 or 50,000, it's more than any other loss of life anywhere else on the globe so that poses a significant threat.\n\n\n\nLet's also focus on some of the facts that occurred the last few years as well. When you take a look at the apprehensions along the Mexican border coming into the United States, last fiscal year was 340,000. That's down 53 percent from 2008, and one-fifth in 2000, when it reached the tied of 1.6 million coming across the border.\n\n\n\nSo when you actually take a look at the fence being built, the deployment of additional agents, personnel and technology, there's a higher degree of control on the border today. That's not to say that 300,000 is an adequate number to apprehend, we need to do better. But I think the key to continue to make sure we protect the country is to continue the strategy of not only controlling our own border, but Mexico needs to control the borders coming into their country from Central and South America where all of those drugs originate.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: All right. Thanks very much to both of you. This is going to be an issue we're going to cover a lot more of on this show.\n\n\n\nAnd coming up, President Obama's brand new attack ad accusing Mitt Romney of killing -- we'll tell you what.\n\n\n\nPlus, turmoil in Greece and the domino effect that might hit us right here at home.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Apple and Exxon are in bed together and we're going to explain exactly, well, why this marriage has occurred. That's coming up in just a couple of moments.\n\n\n\nBut now, our Outer Circle where we reach out to sources around the world.\n\n\n\nAnd we begin tonight in Greece. Talks to form a government failed, and that leaves the state of Greece's government and economy in complete and utter chaos. This is crucial for the rest of the world. New elections could happen in June but no one is sure.\n\n\n\nAnd with no government to manage the economy and no one to pay the debt or pay anybody that works for the government, there is a real possibility that Greece leaves the euro. You may say so?\n\n\n\nWell, Matthew Chance is in Athens and I asked him what the consequences would be for the rest of Europe and the world if Greece goes vamoose.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nMATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Erin, the truth is we're in uncharted waters. One of the main effects immediately it's going to have to Greece is that the country will run out of money. It won't be able to pay its bills, its pensions, its state workers' wages -- none of these things that a country needs to survive will be need to be paid.\n\n\n\nIt will have to print its own currency, the drachma. That currency is like to drop through the floor when it comes to its valuations against the euro. So, Greece would set itself on a path to a great deal of poverty and economic hard ship.\n\n\n\nThe other impact Greece crashing out of the euro may have is the impact of contagion. If Greece crashes out of the single currency, what's to stop other debt-laden economies like Ireland, like Spain, like Portugal, like Italy from doing exactly the same thing? Up until now, this big European project of getting all these countries together, these diverse countries together, diverse economies together and bringing them all under the umbrella of a single currency has been something that's really dominated European politics. If that ends, if Greece exits the euro, that whole project comes to an end and it potentially puts the European Union and the cohesion of the European Union under threat.\n\n\n\nAnd so, you can't really overstate the significance of what Greece is deciding right now, which direction it will go in -- Erin.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: All right. Thank you very much to Matthew Chance. Of course, Europe the biggest trading partner for America. So if it falls, major job losses and another deep recession would happen here.\n\n\n\nAnd now, let's check in with Anderson. Anderson is in a Turkish refugee camp near the Syrian border.\n\n\n\nAnderson, obviously, you're going to have a special show tonight. Tell us a little bit about it, Anderson.\n\n\n\nANDERSON COOPER, HOST, A.C. 360: Yes, Erin, we're in one of many refugee camps along the Turkish/Syrian border, now home to 23,000 Syrians -- men, women and children. The reason we came here is because for 14 months, the regime of Bashir al Assad has lied about what's happening in Syria. We came here because for 14 months, the regime of Bashir al Assad has tried to silence the voices of the people who are living in these camps and the people who have had to flee Syria.\n\n\n\nTonight, we want you to hear their voices. We want you to see their faces and hear their stories and hear what they have had to live through for the last 14 months. The children that they have seen arrested by the regime, tortured by the regime, parents who got the mangled bodies of their children return to them in the dead of night. Children who have seen their parents shot to death on the streets of Syria simply for asking for reforms, asking for basic freedom that we all take for granted.\n\n\n\nSo, tonight, we're going to be telling you their stories and you're going to hear their voices and see their faces to find the truth of what is happening inside Syria -- Erin.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: All right, Anderson, very much looking forward to seeing you in just a few moments there.\n\n\n\nOur fifth story OUTFRONT, it's the economy finally. Well, maybe. But at least in this ad.\n\n\n\nObama and Romney trading jabs on issue number one. First up, a new Obama ad rolling out in five battleground states which calls the private equity firm that Mitt Romney founded a job killer.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, OBAMA CAMPAIGN AD)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: They made as much money off it as they could, and they closed it down, they filed for bankruptcy without any concern for the families of the communities.\n\n\n\nJACK COBB: It was like a vampire. They came in and sucked the life out of us.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was like watching an old friend bleed to death.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: The Romney camp is not hanging back, rolling out its own video attacking the president's record on debt, announcing plans for a speech on the deficit tomorrow and, I have to say, sending e-mails and finding private phone numbers of members of the media to send or their P.R. people to send their stats on jobs. So, fighting back hard.\n\n\n\nCNN contributor David Frum, John Avlon in New York, and Michael Waldman, former head of speechwriting for President Clinton also joins us.\n\n\n\nOK, great to have all of you with us.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: You said that that's a pretty tough ad.\n\n\n\nDAVID FRUM, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: That is a pretty tough ad. But I wonder whether it really counts as a pivot to the economy. What exactly is President Obama proposing to do? I mean, if private equity really is bad, if it does more harm than good, it's free to operate in the Obama administration. President Obama isn't proposing to do anything to restrict private equity.\n\n\n\nSo, all he is saying is you are a bad man. He is not offering an economic critique. And he's not offering an economic alternative.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: OK. Do you buy that spin, Michael?\n\n\n\nMICHAEL WALDMAN, BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE, NYU: Well, I think that part of this is in a sense kind of a brush-back pitch. Romney is going to say I've run a big company, I have a successful record and so I can make the critique against President Obama and his record. And this is saying, you know, when one thing when Governor Romney talks, he talks about success and we ought not penalize success.\n\n\n\nAnd to a lot of people the way he says it sounds a little smug. I think there's a real unease that people have apart from the specifics of Bain, let alone the ad, an unease with the kind of the financialization of the economy that leads to manufacturing firms being hollowed out and that sort of thing.\n\n\n\nSo I think, look, it's certainly not subtle and it's not unexpected.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Not subtle and not unexpected. But John Avlon, certainly something the Romney campaign is afraid about.\n\n\n\nLet me just go back to emphasizing the point they literally called members of the media on their private cell phones and got their numbers to try to make the case for how Bain Capital and private equity creates jobs. So they're afraid.\n\n\n\nJOHN AVLON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Well, look, I mean, this attack left a mark back in the Republican primaries. Remember, you had Rick Perry saying this isn't venture capitalism, this is vulture capitalism.\n\n\n\nBut I think, you know, this is not even an economic ad. This is an attempt by the Obama camp to draw an early contrast to define the candidate further as a person. It is a personal attack, a personal characterization about values underlying the economy, rather than anything aiming to provide a prescription for how to solve this problem. BURNETT: Speaking of how the president wants to be seen. So, today, he gave the commencement address at Barnard College. And I watched it, and I watched the introduction to him. It's very laudatory. This is a women's college.\n\n\n\nSo, David, we know he's trying to build a case to get women's votes. But at best it split. CBS poll came out today, Mitt Romney is leading among women 46 to 44 percent. I want to emphasize that's within the margin of error, but still.\n\n\n\nFRUM: You know, it's kind of a screwy poll, I have to say. Among other things, one of the questions it asks, are you less likely to vote for the president because of his stance on same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\nWell, they have 43 percent of Americans saying I'm less likely, even though Republicans disapprove of the president 90-10. So, they've gone from saying, I will absolutely never vote for the president, too. I will double absolutely never vote for the president.\n\n\n\nI don't know how meaningful that is. I wonder the gender gap is usually about 10 points. So if it's shrunk to two, that is true. That would be colossal news. It's also possible the polls make mistakes.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Well, and we have many polls coming out everyday.\n\n\n\nJohn, what's your case?\n\n\n\nAVLON: I do get the sense, as David does, that this is a bit of an outlier. That said, it could be on the leading ledge of the other shoe dropping with the regard to the political consequences of the president's decision to back gay marriage. We're seeing troubling gaps, not just among independent voters, but also self-identified centrists.\n\n\n\nThose trends should make the Obama camp very nervous as they look to future polls.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: And one thing that could make you very nervous, Michael Waldman, is what came out of this same poll in terms of independents. Mitt Romney now leads independents, according to the CBS poll, by 43 percent to 36 percent. That's well -- that's no margin of error.\n\n\n\nWALDMAN: Well, again, if the numbers for women or the numbers for independents on election day are on this poll, then it's president- elect Romney. But it is a bit of an outlier. The one bit of good news for President Obama in that poll, interestingly, was that independents and women and young people were more likely to be supportive of the president's stance on same-sex marriage than other voters.\n\n\n\nYou never know entirely -- it's true. This could play out in a bad way for him or in a good way. Remember during the 1960 campaign -- we all read about, I should stress, wasn't actually playing attention then. We read about John F. Kennedy's outreach to Martin Luther King's family and the kind of surprising impact that that had. These social issues are not as straight and linear and easy to predict as sometimes the economic indicators are. So this will have ripples. But we don't know in which direction the ripples will go.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: All right. Thanks very much to all three of you. We appreciate it.\n\n\n\nAhead, Apple and Exxon sitting in a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-G. Who does that upset more? Apple people or the Exxon people? But they are. And we'll tell you why, next.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: So today while we were looking at the market selloff I checked out the two biggest companies in America. It used to be for years that there was one company and everybody else. And that one company was ExxonMobil. But now ExxonMobil, a company that many people love to hate, is a distant second.\n\n\n\nOne of the nation's most prestigious journalist has just written a book on Exxon called, Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power. It talks about the Valdez spill and deals with corrupt governments.\n\n\n\nI spoke to the book's author Steve Coll about what we as Americans should like about Exxon.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSTEVE COLL, AUTHOR, PRIVATE EMPIRE: I do think they bring out the rule of law wherever they go. They want a world that is stable and safe for oil and gas drilling. One of the ways they promote that is by evangelizing about the importance of the rule of law. And they enforce a universal system of contract.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: All right. So those are pretty good things -- probably not good enough.\n\n\n\nBrings me to a company that everybody loves to love, Apple. Nine months ago, it was the second biggest company in America. It is now number one, and by a huge margin.\n\n\n\nMeasured by market cap, Apple is more than 1/3 bigger than Exxon, worth more than half a trillion dollars, half a trillion dollars. Look at the iPad in your hand, half a trillion dollars.\n\n\n\nWith the surge has come scrutiny of keeping money off shore to avoid U.S. taxes, of offshoring too many jobs, of using materials like, which is sometimes mind by children. Apple said it's working to address some of these things. And it is a company seen as the best of America to children around the world.\n\n\n\nBut you know what's interesting? I asked Steve Coll about whether Apple and Exxon had anything in common. He said absolutely. And let me list to you what he said. They're both closed systems. Neither of them like to be written about. They don't have an open door policy for the press. And they have a culture that's strong but set directly from the top.\n\n\n\nI thought he might have laughed. But it seems there's a lot alike about Exxon and Apple.\n\n\n\nSo, here's to being proud that American companies are the leaders in their fields and they hope to continue to become better companies not just bigger ones.\n\n\n\nWell, tomorrow, I'm spending the day here in Washington at the 2012 fiscal summit. It's an issue that will define the power and greatness of our country. This year, the Bush cuts expire, the $1.2 trillion in super cut takes effect. The debt ceiling needs to be raised. These are just a few of the things that could send like lemmings off a clief.\n\n\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, Treasury Secretary, Alan Simpson, Congressman Paul Ryan, and speaker of the House, John Boehner, are all going to be together. You'll see Speaker Boehner tomorrow at 7:00 p.m., because I'll be with them. We've been looking very much forward to that.\n\n\n\nThanks for watching, look forward to seeing you again live from Washington tomorrow.\n\n\n\nA.C.360 starts now.
Concord, New Hampshire (CNN) Jill Biden isn't a stranger to the presidential campaign trail, having stumped for her husband's bid for president and vice president.\n\nShe's now logging grueling hours advocating for Joe Biden's 2020 bid\n\nThe pace of the campaign often keeps Joe and Jill Biden, a married couple of 42 years, apart. Jill Biden spoke with CNN in Concord, New Hampshire, where she shared how she stays handles the pressures of the trail.\n\nHe came home the other night, I hadn't seen him, probably for a week. And so I think it's important in a marriage that you keep that spark going, she told CNN in an interview in Concord, New Hampshire. Before I saw him, I lit the candles. I put on the fire. We sat down and we started talking. And like always, it's always about the kids and what's this person doing or that person doing, or the grandkids. But after 20 minutes, we were like, 'God, we're exhausted.' So we went to bed.\n\nI'm telling you we have very few moments together, so I tried to make the most of those moments, and I don't talk politics, she said.\n\nRead More
Protestors attend a demonstration in Stockholm, Sweden, in November 2017, against slavery in Libya,\n\nStory highlights The overall number of reported trafficking victims has increased globally Girls account for 23% of all trafficking victims, says report Human trafficking worsens in conflict zones\n\n(CNN) —\n\nA growing number of girls are being reported as victims of human trafficking, according to a new UN report.\n\nGirls account for 23% of all trafficking victims detected globally, according to the 2018 Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, produced by the UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC).\n\nThe figure, which is based on data from 2016, is up from 21% in 2014, and 10% in 2004, the year when the UNODC began collecting data on children.\n\nBoys account for 7% of reported trafficking victims, down from 8% in 2014, and up from 3% in 2004.\n\nIn the profile of identified victims, we are seeing more and more children, an increase particularly in girls, says Angela Me, chief of the UNODC's research and trend analysis branch.\n\nMore on human trafficking\n\nBut the UN says that this rise could be due to better detection of victims globally.\n\nMe explains that trafficked girls are typically victims of sexual exploitation, while boys are more often exploited for forced labor.\n\nThe UN defines girls and boys as being aged less than 18, but Me says some member states use different definitions.\n\nThe report shows that women and girls account for almost three quarters of all detected victims of trafficking in 2016. Females make up 94% of the total victims trafficked for sexual exploitation, and 35% of those trafficked for forced labor.\n\nArmed conflict\n\nIt also finds that armed conflict in some regions of Africa, the Middle East and Asia is likely to increase vulnerability to trafficking.\n\nIt says that areas with weak rule of law and lack of resources provide traffickers with fertile terrain to carry out operations, adding that armed groups take advantage of people in a desperate situation to traffic victims for sexual exploitation, forced marriage, armed combat and various forms of forced labor.\n\nPopulations fleeing conflict, such as Syrian, Iraqi and Rohingya refugees are also targeted by traffickers.\n\nIn migration flows, you have a dispersion of families and then you have many children who travel alone, who definitely become more vulnerable to be trapped into exploitative situations, says Me.\n\nThe report also indicates that the overall number of reported trafficking victims has increased. In 2016, about 40% more victims were detected compared to 2011.\n\nBut the UN says that this rise could be due to an increase in trafficking globally, or it could be a result of enhanced national capacities to detect, record and report data on trafficking.\n\nIn 2009, only 26 countries had an institution which systematically collected data on trafficking cases, whereas in 2018, the number had risen to 65.\n\nThere are now a whole bunch of countries that have new legislation so are more equipped from a legislative point of view to criminalize and to prosecute and at the same time to protect the victims, says Me.\n\nSuch anti-trafficking policies have not only led to increasing numbers of detected victims, but also to more trafficking convictions in Asia, the Americas, Africa and the Middle East.\n\nHowever, the report cautions that the absolute numbers of convictions remain very low, adding that globally There appears to be hardly any risk for traffickers to face justice.
Gwyneth Paltrow's marriage to Coldplay frontman Chris Martin seemed to be unshakeable (she even had great relationship advice!). But in March 2014, the A-list couple announced that they were undergoing a conscious uncoupling. The pair may be better friends than spouses. Martin went on the honeymoon with Paltrow and her new husband, producer Brad Falchuk.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nOne of Hollywood's happiest divorced couple, Bruce Willis and Demi Moore split in 1998 after a 10-year relationship. The pair, who knew each other for three months before wedlock, have three daughters. Moore was married to Ashton Kutcher from 2005 to 2013. Wilis married Emma Heming in 2009 and Moore attended their vow renewal in March 2019.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nWith Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom being the type to write love letters to one another -- and Bloom being the kind of romantic who would frame them -- we definitely did not see their 2013 breakup coming. Yet according to Bloom, he and Kerr -- whom he married in 2010 after a three-year courtship -- still love each other, even if it's only as parents to their young son, Flynn. Kerr married Snapchat chief executive officer Evan Spiegel in 2017 and Bloom got engaged to singer Katy Perry on Valentine's Day 2019.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nWill Arnett shocked fans when he ended his marriage to Amy Poehler. According to People magazine, Arnett filed for divorce in April 2014. The couple, who tied the knot in 2003, first announced their separation in 2012.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nJustin Bieber swept the slightly older Selena Gomez off her feet, and the two were on and off for a while. Although their relationship appeared to end for good in 2013, they spent an awful lot of quality time together in 2014 and then reconnected in 2016 before finally going their separate ways. Bieber married model Hailey Baldwin in 2018, but that hasn't stopped people from thinking about Jelena.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nKhloe Kardashian's whirlwind romance with basketball player Lamar Odom made us skeptical at first, but once we saw them in action we believed love really can be found in a month. Kardashian eventually filed for divorce after nearly five years of marriage. It's definitely not anything I'm through, she said of her breakup in March 2014. I'm going through it, but I'm not (over) it. And while she put the divorce proceedings on hold in 2015 to support him through his health crisis, she refiled in July 2016. Kardashian now has a daughter with NBA player Tristan Thomas.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nThe reason we're wistful for the days when Ryan Gosling was dating Rachel McAdams is simple: If the two people who starred in The Notebook can't make it work, who can? So far Gosling has been making it work with actress Eva Mendes and the pair have two daughters. McAdams has been in a relationship with screenwriter Jamie Linden since 2016.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nFrom their first screen test for 2008's Twilight, Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart were the perfect match. According to director Catherine Hardwicke, Stewart felt connected to (Pattinson) from the first moment. That electricity or love at first sight or whatever it is. Whatever it was, it didn't survive a cheating scandal in 2012, when Stewart admitted that she'd had a momentary indiscretion with her Snow White and the Huntsman director, Rupert Sanders. She went public with her relationship with screenwriter Dylan Meyer in 2019.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nDavid Arquette and Courteney Cox were so adorable together, they could be endearing in a horror movie, as they were in 1996's Scream. It was a shock when, after 11 years of marriage, the two announced they were breaking up in 2010. The couple, who have one daughter, Coco, have remained friends.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nOne of our other favorite '90s couples again includes Depp, who dated model Kate Moss from 1994 to 1998. A pairing with that much heat and great hair should never fall apart.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nLenny Kravitz and former Cosby Show star Lisa Bonet seemed tailor-made for each other, right down to their love of hippie style. The pair met at a New Edition concert in 1985 and married in 1987, welcoming daughter Zoe a year later. We were very young, and it was wonderful, Kravitz recalled in 2013. Now, Zoe's mom and I are best friends, Kravitz said. It's interesting because that's how the relationship started. Bonet is now married to actor Jason Momoa.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nMadonna's four-year marriage to Sean Penn was one of the wildest rides of the '80s, and that's saying something, but we agree with her words after their divorce in 1989: I do believe we all have soul mates, she told People magazine. I don't believe that we necessarily end up with them. After their split, both Madonna and Penn moved on to new relationships (several times).\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nCountry stars Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert stunned fans when they announced in July that they were divorcing after four years of marriage. There was much sadness on social media over the split. She married police officer Brendan McLoughlin in 2019 and Shelton has been dating singer and fellow The Voice coach Gwen Stefani since 2015.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nJohnny Depp and Winona Ryder had amazing chemistry on- and off-screen, from Edward Scissorhands to the tattoo parlor, where Depp had Winona Forever inked on his arm. Alas, although we adored their courtship, Depp and Ryder weren't meant to be.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nIn 2001, every teenager with access to MTV and Teen People wanted to find the Britney Spears to their Justin Timberlake (or vice versa). With those two ruling pop music, not even their questionable fashion sense could mar the public's love for their romance. Sadly, matching denim outfits wasn't enough to make this last: The couple broke up in 2002, and many listeners believe Timberlake's Cry Me a River is about his relationship with Spears. Spears had a super brief marriage to friend Jason Alexander in 2004 and was married to backup dancer Kevin Federline from 2004 to 2007. Timberlake married actress Jessica Biel in 2014.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nOnce upon a time in 1999, a young blonde pop star named Jessica Simpson met another young blond-ish pop star, Nick Lachey, at a Teen People party, and they immediately fell in love. Lachey even wrote a song about their passion -- that would be My Everything -- and then he and his new bride signed up to film their love for an MTV reality show called Newlyweds.

(CNN) — The term Indian cuisine covers a lot of ground. From the Himalayan peaks in the northern state of Uttarakhand, to the tropical southwestern coast of Kerala, each landscape comes with its own climate, history, trade links and religious customs. And each has a unique food culture.\n\nAs a culinary destination, India offers an epic food bucket list . But the past year has been tough for travel, with most of the world's holiday plans put on hold because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIndia's cuisine, at least, can still journey far beyond the country's borders. According to the United Nations , people from India make up the world's largest diaspora community -- and they have brought their delicious food with them.\n\nIn the UK, for instance, tens of thousands of Indian immigrants arrived in the early 20th century, followed by an influx of Bangladeshi immigrants in the 1970s -- many setting up restaurants that tailored Indian curries to local tastes. As a result, curry has become a firm fixture and Anglo-Indian inventions, such as chicken tikka masala, are among the nation's favorite dishes.\n\nWhile curry houses with standard menus are still popular, the world's taste for Indian fine dining is evolving to encompass lesser known regional delicacies and bolder experimentation.\n\nIndian chefs living around the world are feeding this growing movement, with menus that celebrate their family heritage, while bringing new dimensions to traditional cooking techniques and recipes.\n\nCNN spoke to five of these culinary ambassadors about the dishes that -- for them -- capture the delicious diversity of India.\n\nChef Jessi Singh: Buffalo milk kebab, Punjab\n\nChef Jessi Singh was born in Punjab, India, and grew up between Australia and America. He brings his unique culinary journey to modern Indian cuisine, including his signature buffalo milk kebabs.\n\nWhen it comes to making a kebab, milk curd probably isn't the first ingredient that springs to mind. But for Punjab-born chef and restaurateur, Jessi Singh, this is the ultimate taste of home.\n\nCrispy on the outside, with a soft, creamy center, kebabs made with curd, yogurt or paneer cheese are a popular appetizer in restaurants across northern India.\n\nBorn in a farming village outside of Punjab's capital, Chandigarh, Singh encountered the dish -- and its key ingredients -- at source.\n\nBefore I even turned 10, I knew how to milk the buffaloes, he says.\n\nSingh takes charge of fermenting the milk for the kebabs in his restaurants in Australia, including Melbourne's Daughter in Law and Don't Tell Aunty in Sydney. Served with an orchid and bright pink beetroot sauce, his kebabs might not look like the meals he ate as a child, but the vivid colors represent Singh's Punjab heritage in other ways.\n\nBack home, color doesn't associate with a gender, or a certain people, or a class, he says. Color belongs to everyone. You will see men wearing pink turbans, a red shirt ... We are a very, very colorful culture. So that's what I put in my food.\n\nDaughter in Law , 37 Little Bourke Street, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; +61 (03) 9242 0814\n\nDon't Tell Aunty , Shop-2, 414 Bourke Street, Surry Hills, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia; +61 (02) 9331 5399\n\nChef Garima Arora: Millet roti, Telangana\n\nGarima Arora is the first and only female Indian chef to earn a Michelin star for her restaurant in Bangkok, Thailand. Now she's putting the spotlight back on India, starting with Telangana -- the southern Indian state she was born in.\n\nThailand-based chef and restaurant owner Garima Arora has attracted a lot of attention for her pioneering take on Indian cuisine. A former pupil of world-famous Indian chef Gaggan Anand , she is the first and only Indian female chef to earn a Michelin star for her Bangkok restaurant, Gaa, while The World's 50 Best Restaurants rated her as Asia's best female chef in 2019\n\nNot content with her own trailblazing accolades, Arora is taking another approach to rewrite this narrative around Indian cooking.\n\nIn 2019, she launched Food Forward India , a traveling non-profit initiative that aims to map out the cuisines of every Indian state, starting with the one Arora was born in -- Telangana.\n\nFood in this southern Indian state is most often associated with the refined dishes of Telangana's capital, Hyderabad, developed over centuries in the Mughal and Nizam royal courts. But Arora was interested in highlighting food customs beyond the metropolis.\n\nThere was a big difference between the way urban Telangana eats to the rural Telangana to the tribal Telangana, Arora says. The idea was to take that and show it to the world.\n\nOne rustic ingredient Arora hopes to spotlight is millet. Among the world's earliest cultivated grains, it's a historic staple in Telangana's rural communities.\n\nArora is giving millet a fine-dining update as a roti tartlet, filled with creamy, chilled crab and fresh coconut. She says her cold curry gives the sensation of eating something fresh, cool, earthy -- but in one bite.\n\nGaa , 46 Sukhumvit 53 Alley, Khlong Tan Nuea, Watthana, Bangkok, Thailand; +66 (0)63 987 4747\n\nChef Deepanker Khosla: Mutton biryani, Uttar Pradesh\n\nBiryani is one of the most popular Indian dishes of all time. Chef Deepanker Khosla is adding a new chapter to biryani's layered history in his zero-waste restaurant in Thailand.\n\nChef Deepanker Khosla is making waves with his award-winning sustainable restaurant, Haoma, in Bangkok, Thailand. He says the zero-waste farm-to-table concept is a prototype for restaurants in the future, inspired by his upbringing in the Uttar Pradesh city of Prayagraj, formerly called Allahabad.\n\nMy dad has this beautiful kitchen garden, Khosla says, So harvesting our own produce, eating fresh, sustainable ... this is tradition.\n\nA hydroponic system on the restaurant terrace recycles rainwater to grow plants and tilapia fish, while all waste from the kitchen is recycled back into fish food and compost.\n\nThe restaurant farm supplies almost all the produce for Khosla's neo-Indian menu, a modern, high-end take on centuries-old Indian dishes.\n\nThat includes biryani; a fragrant mix of meat or vegetables, rice and spices, the meal is universally loved across the Indian subcontinent. Many historians believe biryani originated in Persia and was brought to India by the Mughals, who controlled the area from the 16th to 18th century.\n\nIt made its way into the cuisine of almost every region, each suffusing the dish with its own flavors and techniques.\n\nKhosla makes a version known as Awadhi biryani -- a beloved dish back home in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nLightly spiced pieces of mutton and rice are layered into a pot, sealed with dough, and slowly steamed for hours, in dum pukht style.\n\nDum pukht means slow breathing, so you let the food breathe in its own juices, Khosla says.\n\nWith an ever-evolving menu that adapts to the seasonal produce that can be grown on the farm, Khosla is excited to spotlight authentic, regional recipes.\n\nWhat we know about Indian cuisine is not even the tip of the iceberg, he says. India has 22 distinct cuisines with more than 5,000 different dishes ... that is what I take pride in.\n\nHaoma , 231 3 Soi Sukhumvit 31, Khlong Toei Nuea, Watthana, Bangkok, Thailand; +66 (0)2 258 4744\n\nChef Palash Mitra: Fish curry, West Bengal\n\nChef Palash Mitra has mastered a range of South Asian delicacies in his Hong Kong restaurants. But for the West Bengal-born chef, one dish is closer to the heart: Bengali fish curry.\n\nTo call Bengali fish curry, or macher jhol, a classic West Bengal meal would be an understatement. As the local saying goes: mache bhate bangali, which roughly translates as 'fish and rice is what makes a Bengali'.\n\nFish is a staple in West Bengal's cuisine largely because of geography. Crisscrossed by rivers that flow into the Bay of Bengal, the east Indian state boasts a huge variety of fish. And the importance of fish carries into ritual life too.\n\nWhether it's a funeral or if it's a marriage, fish is an integral part of it, says Palash Mitra, a chef born in West Bengal's capital, Kolkata. Fish is the symbol of a new life, the end of life. It's entwined.\n\nAs culinary director of South Asian cuisine for Hong Kong's Black Sheep restaurant group, Palash supervises four restaurants, which offer fish dishes that span the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe tandoori cobia ... or the salmon ... these are really, really popular dishes, he says.\n\nBut Bengali fish curry is the dish that's very close to my heart, he says. Mitra cooks his mother's recipe: chunks of rui, a South Asian carp, slowly simmered in a light broth, enriched with spices, potatoes, cauliflower and tomatoes, and served with rice. He plans to put it on the menu at his restaurant, Rajasthan Rifles on Hong Kong's Victoria Peak, this summer.\n\nRajasthan Rifles , The Peak Galleria, Shop G01 G/F, 118 Peak Road, Central, Hong Kong; +852 2388 8874\n\nChef Kuldeep Negi: Tandoori prawns, Delhi\n\nSpices are at the heart of all Indian food and Chef Kuldeep Negi understands them better than most. In his Singapore restaurant, Negi serves up a bite of his Delhi heritage -- with a kick.\n\nOf course, there's one thing that defines India's culinary legacy more than any dish. Spices are at the heart of all Indian food, with India using, buying and selling more spices than any other country, according to the government's spices board\n\nKuldeep Negi, Chef de Cuisine of Singapore's Tiffin Room restaurant inside the historic Raffles hotel, understands India's spices better than most. Growing up in Delhi, he had Asia's biggest spice bazaar on his doorstep: Khari Baoli, in Old Delhi's Chandni Chowk market. This maze of stalls, bursting with color and heady aromas, has been supplying kitchens in India's capital since the 17th century\n\nAs a child, Negi's mother brought him to the market, and taught him how to select and blend the spices.\n\nShe is very particular about choosing the spices because India is a country of different seasons. So each season has different spices, says Negi. How to use them, when to add into the dish, how long you're going to cook (them) -- that's very important.\n\nThe art of blending spices is still an important part of Negi's cooking today. Though you're more likely to find chicken or lamb grilling in the tandoors of landlocked Delhi, Negi wants to make the most of the seafood available in Southeast Asia.\n\nFor his signature dish, tandoori prawns, he brings out the succulent, smoky flavors of the jumbo prawns with his unique spice mix: saffron, turmeric and red chili powder, blended with rose petal, bleached cardamom and green cardamom.\n\nWhen you go to bite that, you will feel it, the freshness of the powders, he says. It's all about the spices.
Rhae Lynn Barnes is an Assistant Professor of American Cultural History at Princeton University. Keri Leigh Merritt is a historian, writer, and filmmaker from Atlanta. They are at work on a new Civil War documentary. The views expressed here are the authors' own. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nOver the last four years, many have warned the public about the flagrant threat to democracy that President Donald Trump poses. Wednesday's failed coup proved that MAGA, or Trumpism, is not over simply because Trump lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden. Trumpism is far from dead. Instead, it is now their New Lost Cause\n\nThe Lost Cause, also known as the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, is America's most successful disinformation campaign. It was an ahistorical theory advocating the erroneous belief that all White southerners valiantly fought for the Confederacy to save true American (read: White supremacist) values. It centers on the delusion that slavery, known as the peculiar institution, was often benign and even welcomed by the enslaved.\n\nThis postwar mythology exploded nationally in the late 19th and early 20th century through popular culture vehicles like the films The Birth of a Nation and Gone With the Wind and White supremacist laced textbooks that argued the American Civil War hinged on the protection of states rights from an aggressive North or federal government -- not the expansion of slavery -- and the promise that the South would rise again.\n\nA New Lost Cause raised the Confederate flag\n\nDuring Tuesday's Georgia runoff election , the South did rise to meet our historical moment and elected two Democrats, further spurring Trump's New Lost Cause, a dangerous delusion of election fraud spread rampantly by social media algorithms proven to spread disinformation faster than fact, Russian bot farms and far-right media.\n\nBut the main perpetrator and beneficiary of the myth is Trump himself, who claimed even before the election took place that it would be stolen through rigged election practices, hacked voter machines and by fraudulent ballots. Much like the perpetrators of the Confederate Lost Cause, the proponents of the New Lost Cause claim to be patriotic defenders of the real America or authentic (White) America.\n\nMuch of Wednesday's melee was more reminiscent of both the triumphs and the tribulations of the historical era that created the Lost Cause : Reconstruction. Its distorted representations in popular culture, with its brilliantly hopeful beginnings, its progressive ideals, and its attempts at racial justice unbearably gave way to an unrelenting violent, deadly white backlash that had no repercussions or consequences for home-grown terrorists.\n\nWednesday, for the first time in American history, White supremacists treasonously raised a Confederate flag inside the United States Capitol, disrupting America's peaceful transfer of power and invoking tangled memories of our nation's Civil War.\n\nLive on CNN, Washington, DC's former Chief of Police said the national guard needed to take back the Capitol, a structure built by enslaved Black laborers , making it clear that the bedrock of our nation's legislative body was under siege.\n\nReconstruction is more than a punch line\n\nAs historian Heather Cox Richardson argued Thursday , Yesterday the Executive Branch of our government tried to destroy the Legislative Branch. Perhaps realizing this, Sen. Lindsay Graham , one of Trump's most ardent defenders, finally spoke out against the violent attempts to avenge Trump. Invoking the 1876 election that essentially ended Reconstruction, Graham quipped that for people looking for historical guidance, this is not the one to pick. As a White Senator from the state that launched the Civil War, his aside about Reconstruction served to historically distance himself from the bloody violence and racist terror of his Confederate and segregationist forefathers.\n\nJUST WATCHED Keilar on GOP: When you sell your soul, there's a debt to settle Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Keilar on GOP: When you sell your soul, there's a debt to settle 13:12\n\nSen. Ted Cruz , advocating for a third option, also hearkened to the 1876 compromise to call for an electoral commission to examine claims of voter fraud, urging Congress to create a committee of House Members, Senators, and Supreme Court Justices to conduct a 10-day emergency audit.\n\nLike Graham and Cruz, Sen. Dick Durbin also compared the Trumpist objections to the 2020 election results to the 1876 election. Durbin stressed the cataclysmic ramifications of ending Reconstruction too early: It was a commission that killed Reconstruction, that established Jim Crow ... (that) re-enslaved African Americans, Durbin said. Relating the 1876 compromise to modern-day voter suppression, he blamed Trump for inciting the attempted coup.\n\nRep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat from Michigan, connected the day's events to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, tweeted that politicians who supported the coup have put their name on a list with Orval Faubus, George Wallace and Bull Connor. Faubus, Wallace and Connor all used the Confederate flag as a rallying cry to White supremacists to join in Lost Cause ideology and maintain Jim Crow segregation.\n\nSupporters of US President Donald Trump protest in the US Capitol Rotunda on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC.\n\nAs rioters, incited by the President and with some carrying White supremacist imagery descended upon the Capitol , scaled its walls, planted pipe bombs, and dangled from its railings, the pictures and videos were simultaneously stunning and revolting: The bright reds of the Confederate and Nazi flags and matching MAGA hats simmered against a sea of Trump flags now sold on street corner popup shops that outnumbered American flags, a noose, a raised wooden cross reminiscent of Klan lynchings, and a sweater reading Camp Auschwitz. The lineage between the slaveholding secessionists and the modern insurrectionists could not have been more clear: Both groups were willing to destroy the union and both used violence to deflect their own racial fantasies of power and privilege slipping away.\n\nA scene -- literal and figurative -- from 'The Birth of a Nation'\n\nMany historians have feared, and some have warned of the possibility of this day for months, some for years. Trump even campaigned in the style of the Jim Crow South's White supremacist demagogues, running on hatred and grievance, and cashing in on racism and xenophobia.\n\nNow, in the same moment as the historic election of Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, who will respectively be the first Black and Jewish senators to represent Georgia , White supremacists armed with equipment ideal for taking hostages staged the nation's first real coup attempt while seeking to burn the Electoral College ballots. Just like their Confederate forebears, they angrily rejected legitimate election results, vowing vengeance and inciting racist violence.\n\nTo be sure, the chaos and uncertainty from the attempted coup and their defiling antics were jarring but not without precedent - the entire scene could have been lifted out of the 1915 White supremacist film  The Birth of a Nation . As the first major motion picture screened in the White House, the blackface epic rife with disinformation and Lost Cause sentiment had been based on the bestselling novel  The Clansman: An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan .\n\nFormer President Woodrow Wilson, a historian and architect of federal segregation, was rumored to have deemed The Birth of a Nation like writing history with lightning. In one of the most pivotal scenes in the saga, set in 1871, former slaveholding Confederates watched in horror from the Capitol's gallery -- the exact place where Reps. Jason Crow and Susan Wild were pinned to the floor beneath chairs yesterday -- and gawked at America's newly-elected Black congressmen and the first (fictional) Black speaker of the House.\n\nLike the domestic terrorists who vandalized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office, defiantly putting their feet on her desk with the American flag prostrate, the Black congressmen in The Birth of a Nation (White actors in blackface) were admonished to keep their shoes on, with their feet off desks.\n\nFrom The Birth of a Nation (1915)\n\nThe blackface congressmen snuck liquor into the Capitol. They devoured fried chicken while wildly gesturing as they argued in favor of interracial marriage. They openly brandished guns and knives, gambled, and leered lasciviously at cowering white women in the gallery. As a silent movie, a title card on screen explained it all: The helpless white minority.\n\nThe lie of the 'helpless white minority'\n\nThe helpless white minority.\n\nThat simple lie lays bare so much of America's misery and suffering. The far-right and White supremacists' purported fear of losing status, wealth and most importantly, political power, in the face of mass Black voter turnout has always been part of what animated racial violence in this country, from riots to lynchings to police brutality.\n\nIt's no coincidence that the infamous The Birth of a Nation scene that perverts and degrades Black leadership supposedly occurs in 1871, one of the most tumultuous years in Reconstruction. Hiram Revels , America's first Black Senator and a preacher like Warnock, was in office, serving only a year. Union Army Generals founded the National Rifle Association, and Congress passed the Ku Klux Klan Act outlawing terrorist conspiracies by white supremacists. The act gave the President the power to suspend the writ of Habeas Corpus in regions prone to homegrown terrorism.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nDespite this act, and the formation of Black militias and voting blocs throughout the South, White supremacist violence accelerated unabated throughout the region for another 90 years with a legacy that still haunts us today. Slavery, Jim Crow and Reconstruction's failures to prosecute treasonous Americans materialized yesterday - in the plume of gun smoke inside the Capitol.\n\nThe task of peaceful unification is monumental, but it is imperative America upholds the Constitution and prosecutes those who commit treason to the full extent of the law -- for the stability of the nation and for the continuation of democracy. As the Radical Republican Congressman Thaddeus Stevens aptly concluded just months after the bloody Civil War, If we fail in this great duty now, when we have the power, we shall deserve and receive the execration of history and of all future ages.
Sean Gardner/Getty Images\n\nLOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles Lakers' 2017-18 season might be considered an audition for the services of LeBron James, who can leave the Cleveland Cavaliers in July as a free agent.\n\nAfter the Cavaliers' 121-112 win over the Lakers on Dec. 14., James imparted private advice to rookie point guard Lonzo Ball.\n\nBrandon Ingram has begun to emerge as the team's primary scorer, as evidenced by his toe-to-toe battles with Kevin Durant in two overtime losses to the Golden State Warriors. Rookie Kyle Kuzma scored a career-high 38 points Wednesday in a road win over the Houston Rockets.\n\nThe Lakers (11-18) are showing impressive flashes of what they could be, but it's premature to consider Los Angeles a favorite for James' services. The hypothetical marriage is seen as a long shot, according to Ramona Shelburne and Brian Windhorst of ESPN.com.\n\nExecutives Earvin Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka need to have contingency plans in place.\n\nDarron Cummings/Associated Press\n\nAs the Oklahoma City Thunder (16-15) and New Orleans Pelicans (15-16) struggle to find their stride, the Lakers should keep close tabs on Paul George and DeMarcus Cousins. Like James, George has a $20.7 million player option with the Thunder for the 2018-19 season that he is likely to decline, while Cousins' deal with the Pelicans ends after the current season.\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nBased on the NBA's current salary-cap projection of $101 million for the 2018-19 season, both players will be eligible for contracts starting at around $30 million. The Lakers can afford to sign one of the two without breaking up their youthful core. They'd be able to re-sign pending restricted free agent Julius Randle with another $6.4 million to spend (less if they keep Ivica Zubac, Thomas Bryant and/or Tyler Ennis).\n\nInstead of Randle, Los Angeles could have $18 million to spend, perhaps to retain Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Brook Lopez or to acquire another team's free agent altogether.\n\nBoth Johnson and Pelinka have claimed the Lakers will have two max slots available next summer, but that currently isn't accurate, not without a move to open space that sheds the $36.8 million owed to Luol Deng and/or the $25.9 million to Jordan Clarkson over the next two seasons.\n\nThe Lakers could have the space to bring in both George and Cousins to play alongside Larry Nance Jr., Josh Hart, Ball, Ingram, Kuzma and even one of Clarkson or Randle, depending on how the team escapes Deng's contract.\n\nConsidering James will turn 33 on Dec. 30, George and Cousins—both of whom are 27—may give the Lakers more longevity on their dollar. Neither has LeBron's NBA Finals experience, but both would represent a significant upgrade in comparison to the incumbent talent.\n\nIf landing James and one of the two is plan A, George and Cousins without James might be plan B.\n\nDavid Zalubowski/Associated Press\n\nAs the Feb. 8 trade deadline nears, the Lakers should consider making a play for their targets before free agency. The Cavaliers are going to ride or die with James, even if he leaves the franchise in July. The chance to win another title is worth that risk.\n\nCan the same be said of the Thunder and Pelicans, with both teams hovering around .500? What could the Lakers offer, knowing they may be able to lure George and/or Cousins in free agency?\n\nLos Angeles would be better off waiting if the price includes Ball, Ingram or Kuzma, but Randle would be the key piece the Lakers can afford to dangle.\n\nThat assumes New Orleans or Oklahoma City is interested in the Kentucky forward, who has blossomed this season as the team's backup center. Few teams will have much available cap space this summer, meaning Randle's restricted rights could be valuable to either franchise.\n\nTo make a deal with the Pelicans, the Lakers would need to send out at least $13 million in salary to acquire Cousins. Randle is earning just $4.1 million, which means they'd have to include other players with him, be it Caldwell-Pope or a bigger package with Corey Brewer, Tyler Ennis and Zubac. Roster space could be problematic for New Orleans in a four-for-one trade.\n\nA deal could expand to include a pair of bad contracts, with Omer Asik going to the Lakers and Deng to New Orleans. That wouldn't entirely erase the Deng mistake, but Asik's contract is more forgiving, with $23.3 million owed over the next two years (including only $3 million guaranteed for the 2019-20 season).\n\nCousins would still be an unrestricted free agent after the season with a cap hold of $27.1 million. That could give the Lakers $30-35 million left to spend, be it on George or even James in free agency. Trading for Cousins at the deadline essentially would give the Lakers an additional $3 million in cap space in July, before they re-sign him at the max of roughly $30 million.\n\nDavid Zalubowski/Associated Press\n\nGeorge has a higher salary, as he's earning $19.5 million with the Thunder this season. The Lakers would need to send out at least $14.5 million in salary to acquire him in a trade. As a free agent in July, George's cap hold would be $29.3 million, around $1 million below his maximum salary.\n\nCousins would be slightly friendlier from a salary-cap perspective, but it isn't as though the Lakers will have a friendly menu of choices before the trade deadline. The Pelicans and Thunder would much rather bolster their own rosters with hopes of retaining their respective All-Stars this summer.\n\nClarkson, who runs the point for the team's second unit while providing 14.1 points a game, might appeal to other teams as well. He's earning $11.6 million this season with two additional years left on his contract. The Lakers could trade him in lieu of or in conjunction with Randle.\n\nAs far as draft picks, the Lakers owe their 2018 first-rounder either to the Philadelphia 76ers or Boston Celtics. Los Angeles cannot trade its 2019 first-round pick until after the 2018 draft. In the meantime, the Lakers can freely trade away first-rounders starting with the 2020 draft.\n\nOther top potential free agents in 2018 include Kevin Durant, DeAndre Jordan, Chris Paul, Isaiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Jabari Parker (restricted), Carmelo Anthony, Aaron Gordon (restricted), Clint Capela (restricted), Zach LaVine (restricted), Greg Monroe and Nerlens Noel.\n\nUltimately, the Lakers can afford to wait. If they miss out on James, Cousins and George, they still have spending power for one or two max contracts to go with a nice group of young, developing players.\n\nWhile the Lakers would love to have an All-Star on their roster before Los Angeles hosts the All-Star festivities at Staples Center in mid-February, they may have to wait until the summer for a blockbuster acquisition.\n\nAll quotes were obtained firsthand unless otherwise noted.

(CNN) — What are the world's best foods? We thought we knew. Apparently we don't. Our list of the World's 50 best foods stimulated some impassioned debate about the conspicuous lack of French dishes and the merits of ketchup over mayonnaise.\n\nKetchup? Pop Corn? Chips? Plenty of Thai but few Malay food? What about Chinese (Sichuan, Cantonese, etc)? No Brazilian or Argentinean? queried commenter Max. Reader LoveFoods wrote, OMG why are people hating? If you don't like the list, make your own! I love Thai and Japanese foods.\n\nLoveFoods was right. So we threw it open to a vote on a Facebook poll. And now, after more than 35,000 votes, it appears we got it all wrong. The world's most delicious food is not Massaman curry, as we suggested, but a meaty, spicy, gingery dish from west Sumatra.\n\nCouscous and lemon curd cake both took scores of votes, but didn't make the list. Some 439 people thought gelato deserved a place in online history. The world's 50 best foods according to CNN readers are below. Bon appetit.\n\n50. Goi cuon, Vietnam\n\nLittle packages of delightful food freshness. Courtesy Ducson Nguyen\n\nThis snack made from pork, shrimp, herbs, rice vermicelli and other ingredients wrapped in rice paper is served at room temperature. It's meat light, with the flavors of refreshing herbs erupting in your mouth. Dipped in a slightly sweet sauce laced with ground peanuts, it's wholesome, easy and the very definition of moreish.\n\n49. Lechon, Philippines\n\nGreat color, better taste.

The result is a thin layer of crispy skin on juicy, succulent meat. Every mouthful makes you wonder why you eat anything else. Great way to kick off this list.\n\n48. Parma ham, Italy\n\nParma ham, the most multi-faceted of treats. GIUSEPPE CACACE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPossibly the most versatile and best food of all. You see it folded around melon, wrapped around grissini, placed over pizza, heaped over salad. There's good reason for that: these salty, paper-thin slices of air-dried ham lift the taste of everything they accompany to a higher level, following the same theory as the Italian guy who thinks carrying around a copy of Candide makes up for the tiny Speedos.\n\n47. Fettucini alfredo, Italy\n\nAn Italian dream. Courtesy shansby/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nSaying no to fettucini alfredo is like saying you don't find Monica Bellucci attractive. It's just wrong. The main ingredients are butter and Parmesan cheese; it's rich and creamy and it can be made in 15 minutes (consumption time included). A good serving of this can turn dinner with the family into something you actually look forward to.\n\n46. Maple syrup, Canada\n\nCanada's finest. Courtesy Raffi Asdourian/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nWith poutine and Montreal-style smoked meat not making the top 50, maple syrup becomes the sole Canadian representative in the list. But before selling you on its natural flavor and balanced sweetness, we must give credit to its mentor, the waffle, playing Batman to maple syrup's edgier, sexier Robin.\n\n45. Roti prata, Singapore\n\nA flipping great dish. Courtesy Alpha/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nThe truth is curry wouldn't be curry if it wasn't for this dough-based pancake. Looks and tastes like Indian naan, roti prata is flipped and turned and flipped again before it's heated over a grill plate. Its preparation is so theatrical you'll feel like dancing a jig while you're eating it.\n\n44. Laksa, Singapore\n\nSingapore's glory.

One whiff of its pungent curry-coconut aroma and you'll be transported to all three countries. Best way to travel ever.\n\n43. Fajitas, Mexico\n\nWho can resist fajitas? Courtesy Denis Dervisevic/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nThis assembly kit of a dining experience is a thrill to DIY enthusiasts everywhere. Step 1: Behold the meat sizzling on a fiery griddle. Step 2: Along with the meat, throw side servings of capsicum, onion, guacamole, sour cream and salsa into a warm, flour tortilla. Step 3: Promise all within hearing range that you'll have just one more. Step 4: Repeat.\n\n42. Hamburger, Germany\n\nEveryone's favorite junk-food treat. PAUL J. RICHARDS/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhen something tastes so good that people spend $20 billion each year in a single restaurant chain devoted to it, you know it has to fit into this list. McDonald's may not offer the best burgers, but that's the point -- it doesn't have to. The bread-meat-salad combination is so good that entire countries have ravaged their eco-systems just to produce more cows. A global best food contender.\n\n41. Galbi, Korea\n\nKorean grilled ribs. Courtesy egg (Hong, Yun Seon)/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nYeah, I would have thrown Kalbi Jim or something similar on there, wrote reader Nobody. Some Korean dishes are savagely good. We could forgive Nobody for opening 222 Facebook accounts to put Galbi in the list. But we're pretty sure the balance of sweet and savory in Korean short ribs means there's no underhand vote-rigging required.\n\n40. Bibimbap, Korea\n\nSee, healthy food can taste good. Courtesy Beyond Neon/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nMixed vegetables and beef, sitting atop steaming-hot rice, held together by a half-raw egg. The beauty of this Korean dish lies at least partially in the diner's DIY mixing of the ingredients. Bibimbap is best when served in a heated stone bowl, and eaten with metal chopsticks.\n\n39. Masala dosa, India\n\nBreakfast for one billion people. Courtesy McKay Savage/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nA crispy, rice-batter crepe encases a spicy mix of mashed potato, which is then dipped in coconut chutney, pickles, tomato-and-lentil-based sauces and other condiments. It's a fantastic breakfast food that'll keep you going till lunch, when you'll probably come back for another.\n\n38. Warm brownie and vanilla ice cream, Global\n\nThe dessert you can use to compare all the world's restaurants. Courtesy robin.norwood/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nThere are some diners who will not frequent an establishment if it does not have brownie and ice cream on the dessert menu. You may call them fools. We do, too, but having done so we then happily leave the first restaurant after the main course to visit one we know has this perfect dessert on offer.\n\n37. Potato chips, United States\n\nThe world's cheapest delicacy? shutterstock\n\nDespite major criticisms suggesting that potato chips aren't real food, voters like Deepti Ravi believe that they rock. What started as a chef's trick on a fussy diner is now one of the world's most child-friendly foods. But think of them this way -- if a single chip cost, say, $5, it'd be a far greater (and more popular) delicacy than caviar, a prize worth fighting wars over.\n\n36. Moo nam tok, Thailand\n\nNeither soup nor salad -- but definitely delicious. Courtesy Dietrich Ayala/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nGrilled pork combined with lemon juice, green onions, chili, mint sprigs, fish sauce and toasted rice. Legend has it the blood from the meat along with the dressing inspired some happy carnivore to name this brilliant dish waterfall (nam tok moo) meat.\n\n35. Neapolitan pizza, Italy\n\nNeapolitan pizza isn't always so big -- but whatever its size it's delicious. MARIO LAPORTA/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe best pizza was and still is the simple Neapolitan, an invention now protected by its own trade association that insists on sea salt, high-grade wheat flour, the use of only three types of fresh tomatoes, hand-rolled dough and the strict use of a wood-fired oven, among other quality stipulations.\n\nWith just a few ingredients -- dough, tomatoes, olive oil, salt and basil (the marinara pizza does not even contain cheese) -- the Neapolitans created a food that few make properly, but everyone enjoys thoroughly.\n\n34. Shrimp dumpling, Hong Kong\n\nSmall, but brilliant. Courtesy Stewart Butterfield/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nSucculent shrimps, steamed well but not overdone, wrapped inside translucent rice paper. This simple form of dim sum has been a must-eat dish for decades. Words on the street say the more pleat folds there are the more skillful the chef is.\n\n33. Seafood paella, Spain\n\nPaella, Spain's signature dish. Boca\n\nThe sea is lapping the shore by your feet, a warm breeze whips the tablecloth around your legs and a steamy pan of paella sits in front of you. Shrimp, lobster, mussels and cuttlefish combine with white rice and various herbs, oil and salt in this Valencian dish that will send you immediately into holiday mode. Though if you have it in Spain , you're probably there already.\n\n32. Lobster, Global\n\nIf you were on a million menus you'd have big claws too. Courtesy Chloe Media/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nForget all your fancy, contrived lobster dishes deployed by show-off chefs eager for Michelin endorsement. When you have something as naturally delicious as these little fellas, keep it simple. The best way to enjoy lobster is simply to boil it and serve with a side of melted butter and slice of lemon.\n\n31. Fried chicken, United States\n\nThe all-American classic. Courtesy Neil Conway/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nI have had almost everything. But they left off fried chicken...  reader Michelle Souza commented. Michelle: your fellow readers have made up for this unforgivable lapse. This all-time American favorite makes its entry with all the artery-choking goodness that made Colonel Sanders a very happy, if not healthy, man.\n\n30. Cheeseburger, United States\n\nCheese makes all the difference. Andrew Burton/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nThe power of cheese? Add it to an ordinary hamburger, the food gets pushed up 13 spots in the poll.\n\n29. Chili crab, Singapore\n\nWe've added it to the list, don't get crabby. Courtesy May Wong/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nReader ST suggested that chili crabs, contrary to popular beliefs, aren't difficult to make. Fantastic list of delicious food! Chilli Crabs are actually very easy to prepare. Here is an easy recipe for you :) ST forgot to mention, however, that it is difficult to stop eating this high-ranking best food.\n\n28. Barbecue pork, Hong Kong\n\nThe best pork comes barbecued and honey-drizzled. Courtesy City Foodsters/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nAlong with many comments left by reader Louis4, s/he wrote, TX bbq tastes like turds. Is that all you have beside that boring food? Here you go, Louis4. Your fellow readers suggested the Chinese version of barbecue pork. This honey-coated meat is sweet, tender and it goes well with everything -- rice, noodles or even by itself. Ask for the half-fat, half-lean barbecue pork to really indulge in this delicacy.\n\n27. Tacos, Mexico\n\nIt's taco time! Jake Lindeman\n\nA fresh, handmade tortilla stuffed with small chunks of grilled beef rubbed in oil and sea salt then covered with guacamole, salsa, onions, cilantro or anything else you want -- perfect for breakfast, lunch or dinner. This is the reason few visitors leave Mexico weighing less than when they arrived.\n\n26. Penang assam laksa, Malaysia\n\nAs photogenic as the best food gets. Courtesy Pandora Voon/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nPoached, flaked mackerel, tamarind, chili, mint, lemongrass, onion, pineapple ... one of Malaysia's most popular dishes is an addictive spicy-sour fish broth with noodles (especially great when fused with ginger), that'll have your nose running before the spoon even hits your lips.\n\n25. Chocolate, Mexico\n\nChocolate -- the world's guilty pleasure. Courtesy LongitudeLatitude/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nThe Mayans drank it, Lasse Hallström made a film about it and the rest of us get over the guilt of eating too much of it by eating more of it. The story of the humble cacao bean is a bona fide out-of-the-jungle, into-civilization tale of culinary wonder. Without this creamy, bitter-sweet confection, Valentine's Day would be all cards and flowers, Easter would turn back into another dull religious event and those halcyon days of gorging yourself to eruption point at Christmas would be fanciful imaginings.\n\n24. Fried rice, Thailand\n\nA tremendous Thai tradition. Courtesy marnalbano/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nIt's true, anyone can fry rice. But can you fry it as well as the Thais? We suspect not.\n\n23. Bulgogi, Korea\n\nThe messiest, meatiest food for champions. courtesy Korea Tourism Organization\n\nLiterally meaning fire and meat, this Korean dish has been in existence for nearly 1,000 years. A bowl of bulgogi gives everything you need in a balanced diet -- carbohydrate (rice), protein (beef and egg), vitamins and minerals (mixed vegetables), and fat (oil). Four good reasons to order a second bowl.\n\n22. Egg tart, Hong Kong\n\nEgg on your face can be a good thing. Courtesy City Foodsters/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nFlaky on the crust with a sweet and smooth egg custard in the middle, egg tarts are best eaten hot when they're fresh out of an oven. This dessert can be ordered in the most rundown bakeries and most glamorous hotels in Hong Kong . Former Governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, declared eating egg tarts one of his favorite pastimes in the city.\n\n21. Fish 'n' chips, England\n\nA salty, vinegary homage to the basics. LEON NEAL/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnything that's been around since the 1860s can't be doing much wrong. The staple of the Victorian British working class is a crunchy-outside, soft-inside dish of simple, un-adorned food fundamentals. Sprinkled with salt, vinegar and dollops of tartar sauce, it is to nouveau cuisine what Meat Loaf is to Prince.\n\n20. Pho, Vietnam\n\nVietnam's answer to What should I eat today? Courtesy kaz k/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nThis oft-mispronounced national dish (fuh is correct) is just broth, fresh rice noodles, a few herbs and usually chicken or beef. But it's greater than the sum of its parts -- fragrant, tasty and balanced, the polar opposite of the moto rider who brought you to the little cafe where you find the best stuff.\n\n19. Green curry, Thailand\n\nIt's easy eating green. Courtesy pukekoblue/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nKermit got it wrong. It's not hard being green, it's delicious. For many this coconutty-creamy and spicy curry should have made the top 10. Goes with steamed rice like bikinis go with Thai beaches.\n\n18. Croissant, France\n\nA Parisian classic. Marie Hennechart\n\nFlaky pastry smothered in butter, a pile of raspberry jam smeared over the top and a soft, giving bite as you sink in your teeth; there's nothing not to love about this fatty, sweet breakfast food that must be married to a cup of strong coffee.\n\n17. Gelato, Italy\n\nSo many flavors to choose. Why bother? courtesy Salvatore Farina\n\nThanks to Eat, Pray, Love, the best dessert in Italy is more popular than ever. True gelato makers use only fresh ingredients and no artificial flavors or colors, and allow you to mix and match as many different flavors as you want. With a higher density and less fat than ice cream, gelato often tastes richer but healthier -- perfect for your own no-carb-left-behind experiment.\n\n16. Kebab, Turkey\n\nWhatever the kebab, its guaranteed to be tasty. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nFor keeping starvation at bay for the entire student population of the United Kingdom, the doner kebab should clearly be honored. But they are hardly the delicious prototype worthy of representing a region. Reader Elena Vorobyeva told us, There are so many forms and shapes of it: doner, iskender kebab, shish kebab, chop shish kebab, orman kebab, etc. So summon the shish kebab. Pick your meat, shove a stick through it, grill. Then wonder why you don't eat like this every day.\n\n15. Ice cream, United States\n\nThe fuel of the heart-broken across the world. David Paul Morris/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nSomehow there's always room for a tooth-rotting, U.S.-style pile of ice cream with nuts, marshmallows and chocolate sauce. Thank God for extra long spoons that allow you get at the real weight-gain stuff all mixed up and melted at the bottom of the glass. Other than a dietician, who wouldn't agree this is one of the best foods in the world?\n\n14. Satay, Indonesia\n\nStick it, soak it, eat it, lick it. Courtesy Marufish/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nReader Paul Peh wrote, I can make satay too but the prep will take at least half the day and [the eating will be done] in less than half hr. lol. Half an hour? What's the hold up? Last time we drowned some skewered meat with this peanut-based sauce we were ready for seconds before you could say mmmm.\n\n13. Chicken rice, Singapore\n\nSingapore's national dish. Courtesy Madeleine Deaton/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nOften called the national dish of Singapore, this steamed or boiled chicken is served atop fragrant oily rice, with sliced cucumber as the token vegetable. Variants include roasted chicken or soy sauce chicken. The dipping sauces -- premium dark soy sauce, chili with garlic and pounded ginger -- give it that little extra oomph to ensure whenever you're not actually in Singapore eating chicken rice, you're thinking of it.\n\n12. Kimchi, Korea\n\nHow much money have Korean restaurants lost out on by giving this away for free? Great Big Story\n\nIs South Korea the most generous nation or what? South Korean restaurants provide this starter dish of fermented vegetables for free. Perhaps because few South Koreans can last more than two days without it.\n\n11. Lasagna, Italy\n\nLasagna is right on so many levels. pinch of yum\n\nLasagna overtook pizza to become the most sought-after Italian food in this delicacy list. There's a reason this pasta-layered, tomato-sauce-infused, minced-meaty gift to kids and adults alike is so popular -- it just works. Dee Dodge wrote, I love Lasagna. The lack of exclamation marks tells you how seriously true fans take this dish.\n\n10. Massaman curry, Thailand\n\nStill a top 10 best foods entry. Courtesy Marita/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nAlthough not the world's most delicious food, it is still emphatically the king of curries. Spicy, coconutty, sweet and savory, its combination of flavors has more personality than a Thai election. Even the packet sauce you buy from the supermarket can make the most delinquent of cooks look like a Michelin potential. Thankfully, someone invented rice, with which diners can mop up the last drizzles of curry sauce. The Land of Smiles isn't just a marketing tag-line. It's a result of being born in a land where the best curry is sold on nearly every street corner.\n\n9. Peking duck, China\n\nThe only way to eat your duck. GREG BAKER/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPeking duck! its a wonder..... wrote Shan Cao on our Facebook page. We can only guess Shan Cao was in the middle of forking a piece of this maltose-syrup glazed duck dish into his/her mouth and forgot to finish the sentence. Slow-roasted in an oven, the crispy, syrup-coated skin is so good that authentic eateries will serve more skin than meat, and bring it with pancakes, onions and hoisin or sweet bean sauce. Other than flying or floating, this is the only way you want your duck.\n\n8. Ramen, Japan\n\nWorld's loudest food? Courtesy Jonathan Lin/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nJapanese protocol says the tastier your ramen is, the louder you should slurp it up to show respect to your chef. Not that they need more respect. One mouthful of this most Japanese of noodle broths will quickly tell you that either you have a ramen trigger in your brain, or Japanese chefs are geniuses.\n\n7. Dim sum, Hong Kong\n\nFamily lunches are fun again. Kate Springer\n\nEqually fun and delicious to eat, a trip to Hong Kong isn't complete without trying this traditional Cantonese lunch food. Popular with everyone from pass-through tourists to local kids and the elderly, most dim sum come in bite-size pieces so you don't have to waste time cutting the stuff up. Bring a few friends and wash the food down with the free-flow tea.\n\n6. Som tam (Papaya salad), Thailand\n\nThailand's best salad. Courtesy Jessica Spengler/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nAfter reading reader Kun Chotpakdeetrakul's comment, Papaya salad and som tam [are] the same thing. You should combine vote for these two together, we did just that, pushing som tam to just 80 votes shy of the top five. To prepare Thailand 's iconic salad, pound garlic and chilies with a mortar and pestle. Toss in tamarind juice, fish sauce, peanuts, dried shrimp, tomatoes, lime juice, sugar cane paste, string beans and a handful of grated green papaya.\n\n5. Pad thai, Thailand\n\nEven better when it's messy. Courtesy Steve Snodgrass/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nHere's a food Thai people can't live without. Similar to Bulgogi (see #22), pad thai is packed with nutrients stirred into one glorious fried-noodle dish. The secret's in the sauce -- tamarind paste. If anyone ever creates a Hall of Food Fame, that should be first on the list.\n\n4. Tom yam goong, Thailand\n\nDo you eat or drink soup? Either way just get it inside you. Courtesy amrufm/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nReader Supot Sakulwongtana made it clear that delicious includes a little bit hot. A little bit hot is right because you need room for a load more flavors too. This Thai masterpiece teems with shrimp, mushrooms, tomatoes, lemongrass, galangal and kaffir lime leaves. Usually loaded with coconut milk and cream, the hearty soup unifies a host of favorite Thai tastes: sour, salty, spicy and sweet. Best of all is the price: cheap.\n\n3. Sushi, Japan\n\nRice, salmon, wasabi -- world's best food trio? Tonic Photo Studios, LLC/ Photographers Choice RF/ Getty Images\n\nWhen Japan wants to build something right, it builds it really right. Brand giants such as Toyota, Nintendo, Sony, Nikon and Yamaha may have been created by people fueled by nothing more complicated than raw fish and rice, but it's how the fish and rice is put together that makes this a global first-date favorite. This perfect marriage between raw fish and rice has easily kept sushi in the top five. And like one reader, Nymayor, wrote, Now to be fair, DELICIOUS can be simple. The Japanese don't live practically forever for no reason -- they want to keep eating this stuff.\n\n2. Nasi goreng, Indonesia\n\nMore rice -- a common factor in many of these dishes. Courtesy Indi Samarajiva/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nI like rendang and nasi goreng, two of most popular food in Indonesia! Reader Rizky Ramadhika's got it. And thousands of other voters agreed. The wonder of combining rice with egg, chicken and prawns strikes again. The second fried rice to make the list, this Indonesian delight received more than 10 times the vote of its Thai counterpart (see #23), propelling the former from non-runner to runner-up.\n\n1. Rendang, Indonesia\n\nNo. 1 as voted by you. Courtesy stu_spivack/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nReader Kamal F Chaniago showed great foresight when he wrote, Rendang is the best. A clear winner with a loyal following, this beefy dish can now rightfully claim the title of World's Most Delicious Food. Beef is slowly simmered with coconut milk and a mixture of lemongrass, galangal, garlic, turmeric, ginger and chilies, then left to stew for a few hours to create this dish of tender, flavorful bovine goodness.\n\nThe Indonesian dish is often served at ceremonial occasions and to honored guests. It's not only delicious but also comes with a simple recipe. If you haven't already, go ahead and take reader Isabela Desita's advice: Rendang should be the first! It's really nice, you should try!

Here, the pirate ship Jose Gasparilla celebrates the playoff game with an illuminated sign in Hillsborough Bay near downtown Tampa. Check out some highlights from the two teams' earlier games:\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe College Football Playoff National Championship game is coming up Monday. Other than being a mouthful to say – it needs something elegant, like Super Bowl – it should be a great game. Expect a clash, of both titans and colors, as the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Clemson Tigers vie for the title. Here's everything, and we mean everything, you need to know about the game.\n\nWhat time is it?\n\nKickoff is at 8 p.m. ET Monday.\n\nWhat channel is it on?\n\nThe game will be broadcast on ESPN, and if you don't have cable, you can catch it on WatchESPN, the channel's streaming service.\n\nWhere is it?\n\nThe game will be played at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida.\n\nWhat team usually plays there?\n\nThe stadium is home to the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which explains the giant pirate ship in it.\n\nWho's playing?\n\nThe Alabama Crimson Tide (in crimson, obviously) will take on the Clemson Tigers (in white, with orange helmets, according to Bleacher Report).\n\nWhat schools do they represent and where are they?\n\nThe University of Alabama is in Tuscaloosa, and Clemson University is in Clemson, South Carolina.\n\nDo these teams have history?\n\nBoy, do they ever. This game is a rematch of the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship, which Alabama won 45-40.\n\nWho are the quarterbacks?\n\nKeep these names handy: The Alabama quarterback is Jalen Hurts, and Clemson's is Deshaun Watson.\n\nWho are the coaches?\n\nNick Saban coaches Alabama, and Dabo Swinney coaches Clemson. More on this later.\n\nWhat's the spread?\n\nAccording to Bleacher Report, Alabama is favored by six points (the same number as a touchdown), with the total points at 51. We told you this would be good.\n\nHow many championships has Alabama claimed?\n\n16, including four under current coach Nick Saban.\n\nThat's a lot.\n\nYeah, they're a pretty big deal.\n\nHow many championships has Clemson claimed?\n\nOne, in 1981.\n\nCan I get tickets, and how much will they set me back?\n\nIt's going to cost you – plenty: Tickets for the game start at $895 apiece on Stubhub.\n\nThe really baller sideline seats are going for as much as $50,000, which is about what it costs to get a four-year education at either Alabama or Clemson.\n\nEveryone keeps talking about the SEC. I don't know what that is and at this point, I'm too afraid to ask.\n\nDivision I FBS teams are divided into conferences. Think of them like leagues. Alabama belongs to the Southeastern Conference, or the SEC. It is the most powerful conference and one of the reasons it seems like everyone in the South is crazy about football.\n\nClemson is in the Atlantic Coast Conference, which is also pretty good.\n\nWhy is Alabama's mascot an elephant if the team is called the Crimson Tide?\n\nThis is actually a great story, as related by Alabama's athletics website. Basically, during a much-hyped 1930 game between Alabama and Ole Miss, the Alabama team came out with such strength and force, fans yelled, Hold your horses, the elephants are coming! and the name Red Elephants stuck amongst sportswriters.\n\nHow do you pronounce Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney's name?\n\nIt's DAB-oh SWEE-nee, as in doing the dab. Someone should call him The Dab. His real name is William Christopher Swinney.\n\nWho is Lane Kiffin, and why does anyone care?\n\nKiffin was the offensive coordinator for Alabama and was slated to leave the school at the end of the season to coach another team. However, Saban, Alabama's head coach and a god among football men, recently made the surprising announcement that Kiffin would not be sticking around to coach during the championship game. Drama ensued.\n\nWhat should I yell out the car window if I want to proclaim my allegiance to one of these teams?\n\nIf you're into Alabama, you only need to know two words: Roll Tide. This is suitable for any occasion, up to and including wills and marriage vows.\n\nIf you're rooting for Clemson, a hearty Go Tigers will suffice.\n\nWhat does the trophy look like, and is it better than the crystal football egg thing teams used to get?\n\nThe trophy looks like this:\n\nIt's not better than the old trophy, which looked like it belonged in the throne room of Buckingham Palace.\n\nHere's what the winning team used to receive. Pretty snazzy, right?\n\nWhat are some other fun facts I can use to sound smart?\n\nClemson had an undefeated 2015 season going into last year's championship game and then lost to Alabama. This year, it's Alabama that's been undefeated so far. Does that mean anything? Who knows?\n\nThis is also the first time two teams have met for a rematch of a Division I College Football Championship, made even more interesting (or boring, perhaps) because, well, they just played each other last year!\n\nNow you know everything there is to know about Monday night's game. Enjoy.
Written by Allyssia Alleyne, CNN\n\nFor football fans, the Super Bowl is the most important day of the season, the culmination of five months of National Football League competition. And for those less interested in the sport, there's the halftime show, when the world's most famous performers deliver 15 minutes of high-voltage entertainment.\n\nOn Sunday night, Jennifer Lopez and Shakira gave highly energetic performances which included crowd surfing and pole dancing . Throughout, J-Lo changed into multiple Versace outfits, including a silver mesh body suit and a feathered cape that dueled as Puerto Rican and American flags, to celebrate her heritage.\n\nSinger Jennifer Lopez performs during the Pepsi Super Bowl LIV Halftime Show at Hard Rock Stadium on February 02, 2020 in Miami, Florida.

Indeed, the most-watched halftime show, Katy Perry in 2015, attracted 118.5 million viewers , while the game itself drew an average audience of 114.4 million viewers.\n\nThis massive audience makes the halftime show a valuable platform for artists to promote designers and spread messages through their fashion choices -- sometimes courting controversy and backlash in the process.\n\nCNN Style looks back at some of the best fashion of halftime shows past.\n\n1993 - Michael Jackson rocks the military look\n\nMichael Jackson performs at Super Bowl XXVII in 1993 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Credit: Steve Granitz/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nGiven its significance today, you'd think the Super Bowl halftime show has always been a prestige event. But it was only in 1993, when Michael Jackson brought his trademark pageantry to the event, that it took on its current reputation. Before then, the show had mostly been dominated by marching bands.\n\nJackson's performance -- introduced by no less than James Earl Jones -- opened with him springing eight feet into the air from underneath the stage (a trademark of his 1992 Dangerous World Tour), against a backdrop of pyrotechnics.\n\nHe then stood motionless for one-and-a-half minutes in a military-inspired black-and-gold ensemble, before launching into a medley of his hits.\n\nGiven Jackson's repertoire of songs against police violence, war and injustice, this look was subversive. Michael made (the uniform) his own by pushing the envelope, rebelling against the establishment the uniform is supposed to represent with all those badges and making it rock 'n' roll, Michael Bush, one of Jackson's costume designers, told Rolling Stone in 2012.\n\nBut it was also just fantastic theater for an audience that had previously settled for Disney characters and an Elvis-impersonating magician\n\n2004 - Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction\n\nJanet Jackson performs during the halftime show at Super Bowl XXXVIII at Houston's Reliant Stadium in 2004. Credit: Frank Micelotta/Getty Images\n\nJanet Jackson and Justin Timberlake's 2004 performance will forever be remembered as the incident that brought wardrobe malfunction into popular parlance.\n\nWhile performing a duet, Timberlake ripped off a part of Jackson's bustier, exposing her breast to millions of viewers, and Nipplegate was born.\n\nA lot of people were unhappy. The Federal Communications Commission reportedly received more than 500,000 indecency complaints about 9/16 of a second of exposed flesh, and levied a $550,000 fine against CBS, the network airing the game, and its affiliates. (The fine was thrown out by the Supreme Court in 2012.)\n\n2007 - Prince's perfect timing\n\nPrince at Super Bowl XLI in 2007. Credit: Philip Ramey/RamneyPIX/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nPrince -- dressed in blue suit and chest-bearing orange button-down, hair covered with a black scarf -- performing Purple Rain in the middle of a torrential storm, purple symbol guitar in hand, was a glorious finale to a performance that saw one of history's most incandescent performers giving his all for 140 million views.\n\nThe heavy rain made the smoke and lights seem mysterious, instead of merely ridiculous.

To add an extra veneer of dark glamour to her performance, Madonna enlisted designer Riccardo Tisci , then creative director of Givenchy, to design her costumes.\n\nFollowing my collaboration with Madonna on her last tour three years ago, it is a great honor for me to be a part of yet another historical and iconic moment, Tisci told Vogue after the performance. People say everything has a limit, but limits do not exist with Madonna.\n\nThe bespoke outfits, inspired by looks Tisci had designed for the French fashion house, included an embellished gold cape and a gladiatorial black mini skirt with a studded belt, each accessorized with an Egyptian-inspired headpiece by British milliner Philip Treacy.\n\n2015 - Katy Perry goes (more) pop with Jeremy Scott\n\nKaty Perry, wearing Jeremy Scott, performs her single Roar atop a metal lion during the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show.

On Saturday, she released the video for her new single, Formation, a visual exploration of southern black femininity and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which ripped through predominantly black New Orleans neighborhoods in 2005. On Sunday, she took to the stage to perform in one of the year's most-watched televised events.\n\nHer performance was unabashedly politically. She opened the show with an all-black dance troupe donning afros and black berets, an obvious reference to the way the way Black Panther Party members dressed in the '60s. (Forgoing the beret, Beyoncé tipped her hat to Michael Jackson with a black-and-gold military jacket recalling his own Super Bowl look.) The dancers also assumed an X formation at one point, a reference to Malcolm X.\n\nWhile fans and critics praised the performance, and the audacity of making such a powerful statement in front of her entire country. New York Times Magazine staff writer Jenna Wortham put it well: I think she wants us to know that even though she's headlining a mainstream event like the Super Bowl, she has opinions and isn't afraid to share them, nor is she afraid to do it on a national and global scale.\n\n(It's worth noting this was in February 2016, seven months before Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem in protest against police brutality and racism in the US.)\n\nOthers took offense at what they perceived as an anti-police sentiment. Some were so upset that they organized a poorly attended anti-Beyoncé rally at the NFL's New York headquarters. Rudy Giuliani, the outspoken former mayor of New York mayor and Donald Trump's attorney, called it outrageous.\n\nThis is football, not Hollywood, he told Fox News , and I thought it was really outrageous that she used it as a platform to attack police officers who are the people who protect her and protect us, and keep us alive.\n\n2017 - Lady Gaga takes to the skies\n\nLady Gaga performs during Super Bowl LI Halftime Show at Houston's NRG Stadium in 2017.

Both were designed by Atelier Versace, so subtle they were not.

(Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nRihanna claims her father and his business partner fraudulently used her name to make money and she's suing them over it.\n\nThe singer alleges that her father, Ronald Fenty, and his partner, Moses Perkins, falsely represented their company's affiliation with her.\n\nAlthough Mr. Fenty is Rihanna's father, he does not have, and never has had, authority to act on Rihanna's behalf, nor has he ever been authorized to use her name, intellectual property or publicity rights, the suit obtained by CNN reads. Similarly, neither Mr. Perkins nor the Company has any affiliation whatsoever with Rihanna.\n\nThe pair launched Fenty Entertainment, a production and talent company, in 2017.\n\nRihanna's popular Fenty Beauty line of cosmetics also launched in 2017.

(CNN) Each week, Sheri McGregor gets hundreds of emails from parents shut out of their children's lives. Every story is different, she said. What the parents have in common is a profound sense of isolation.\n\nThey say, 'I thought I was the only one,' said McGregor, founder of a website for estranged parents who lives in the foothills of California's Sierra Nevada mountains. A lot of these people have been suffering alone for years. ... You feel like you're the only one, so you don't tell other people.\n\nAfter being cut off by her own adult son, McGregor had felt the same. In the years since, she has written extensively about the healing process, and heard from countless families coping with similar losses.\n\nFamily rifts between parents and adult children are the most common, according to the Cornell University survey.\n\nMcGregor, and the people who write to her, are not alone in their rifts with family members. It's something they have in common with millions of people.\n\nIn one recent high-profile case, multiple family members of Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois released a letter shunning the politician for his criticism of then-President Donald Trump. What a disappointment you are to us and to God! they wrote . It is now most embarrassing to us that we are related to you.\n\nOver a quarter of adults responding to a US survey by the Cornell Family Reconciliation Project reported being estranged from a family member. The representational survey, which is the first of its kind, suggested by extension that tens of millions of Americans may be estranged from at least one relative.\n\nThat number is probably low, said Karl Pillemer, professor of human development at Cornell University, who led the study and explored his findings in the recent book  Fault Lines: Fractured Families and How to Mend Them .\n\nPeople find this to be an embarrassing problem, he said, noting that even in a confidential survey, some topics can simply feel too shameful to share.\n\nThe groundbreaking survey sheds light on a topic Pillemer said is poorly understood by scientists, given how widespread and painful estrangement is. No more than 20 reliable scientific articles about estrangement exist, he said, and those are all based on small and non-representative samples.\n\nToday, however, researchers and mental health professionals are tuning into the problem. Here's what experts say about why estrangements happen, why they may be rising and how families can begin to heal.\n\nWhy family estrangements happen\n\nEvery family is different, but there are six main paths to estrangement between family members, Pillemer said.\n\nDivorce can have long-term impacts on families. Conflict over money and inheritance can play a major role in blowups.\n\nRelationships with in-laws can cause tension, sometimes to the point of estrangement. A family member might also have unmet expectations, seeing their relatives as failing them in some crucial way.\n\nFor example, tennis champion Naomi Osaka 's Japanese mother, Tamaki Osaka, was estranged from family members for over a decade because they disapproved of her relationship with Naomi's Haitian father, Leonard Francois.\n\nThe most prominent path, though, may be a painful history that proves just too hard to move on from, Pillemer said.\n\nProblems in childhood, problems in the family of origin were a main cause in many estrangements, he said. In some ways, that reflects how what he calls positive shared history can provide a buffer against the stress of normal conflict, Pillemer explained.\n\nImagine a pair of siblings facing a conflict about money, for instance. Or a parent-child relationship strained by a difference in values, like the family situation faced by Tamaki Osaka.\n\nRemembering a lifetime of positive, loving interactions could see the family through a rocky patch.\n\nIf there's been this long and solid basis of childhood attachment and affection, you're more likely to reconcile. It's more likely to be a temporary thing, Pillemer said.\n\nWhy family estrangement may be rising\n\nA family rift is intensely personal, yet each story plays out against a broader cultural backdrop of values and behavioral norms. While no historical data exist to demonstrate a clear rise, Pillemer said he suspects estrangements have gone up over time.\n\nSomeone feeling comfortable saying 'I never want to speak to my family members again,' is probably increasing, he said. Divorce, which correlates to likelihood of family estrangements, has risen dramatically over past decades.\n\nThere is also a change in perspective, Pillemer said. The sense that 'I will stick with my relatives no matter what' ... I think that's still there to some extent. But I think there's a lower-threshold breaking point, for younger people in particular.\n\nMany Americans now place a greater emphasis on individual well-being, said psychologist Joshua Coleman, author of the new book  Rules of Estrangement: Why Adult Children Cut Ties and How to Heal the Conflict .\n\nStaying in contact is much more tied to identity, to personal growth, to the pursuit of happiness, he said. In the past, Coleman explained, such bonds were more likely to be grounded in a sense of duty or obligation.\n\nThat's different now, said Coleman, whose focus is mainly on estrangements between parents and adult children. Such ruptures are particularly painful, and the Cornell University survey found they're the most common of all.\n\nToday, parents are held to a much higher standard, Coleman said. The only thing that keeps an adult child tied to a parent is whether the adult child wants the relationship.\n\nThat's not necessarily a bad thing, he said. The cultural shift makes it easier for adult children to separate from parents who have been abusive , or who reject their sexuality, gender identity and basic values.\n\nPrior generations of parents had too much power in terms of relationships with their children, while today it's much more equal, he said. In some cases, though, Coleman thinks US culture has swung too far away from family cohesion to support overall social well-being.\n\nThe equilibrium between cohesion and individual happiness varies between cultures and families. In the Cornell University study, for example, participants from families who immigrated to the US from the Caribbean, Africa and Latin America reported feeling strong social pressure to repair any rifts with estranged relatives.\n\nOverall in the US, though, we're wedded to this more individualistic narrative of personal happiness, Coleman said, that if a relationship doesn't make you feel good, or makes you feel bad in any way, then you should consider this person toxic and cut them out of your life.\n\nThat, in turn, might not actually make us very happy, Coleman said. There's enormous loneliness in our culture, he said.\n\nOlder adults tend to be especially isolated, a situation that has been aggravated by the pandemic. Being part of a group — caring about what other people think, feel and need — is important.\n\nHow estranged families can find healing\n\nSome estranged families make their way to Coleman's Oakland, California, therapy practice , where the psychologist works with parents hoping to reconcile with their children. It's a predicament he can relate to, because he, too, has experienced such loss firsthand.\n\nI had an estrangement with my daughter, which has made this kind of a mission, said Coleman, who has since reconciled with his child. The parents I work with are heartbroken, they're miserable.\n\nReconciliation is possible for many families, Coleman said, but it's not easy. In most cases of successful reconciliations between parent and child, he said parents initiate the process.\n\nParents must show empathy for the adult's child's perspective, they have to take responsibility. Coleman often invites parents to write their children a letter that does just that, acknowledging why the child felt they needed to cut off the relationship.\n\nIt's not all about making amends, he said. It's also important to signal that you're ready for a relationship that respects your family member's ideas of what a healthy connection looks like, even if that differs from your own expectations.\n\nNot all parents, frankly, are capable of doing that, Coleman said. And sometimes parents may do all of these things and the child is still not willing to reconcile.\n\nColeman underscores empathy when he's talking to adult children, too. If they were open to reconciliation, I would pursue with them a different way of looking at their parent, one that's borne more of compassion and empathy, he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSuch a shift in perspective can be difficult for people on each side of a rift. For many families, though, he said the benefits of reconciliation means it's worth the hard emotional work.\n\nPeople sometimes say, 'How successful are you?' Coleman said. We're very successful when both people are willing to come to the bargaining table and are open to change. But both people have to be willing.
(CNN) America faces 13 days of danger before the departure of an unhinged commander-in-chief who set his mob on the US Capitol in an act of insurrection that shattered a more than 220-year tradition of peaceful transfers of power.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's seditious behavior has provoked a full crisis inside his White House bunker in his final days, following a fracture with his ultra-loyal Vice President Mike Pence , who refused to join the futile but destructive effort to overturn the result of the election.\n\nAfter orchestrating one of the most notorious days in US political history and trashing democracy by refusing for weeks to accept his defeat, Trump suddenly issued a dead-of-night statement belatedly pledging an orderly transition of power to President-elect Joe Biden on January 20.\n\nBut as usual, the move appeared motivated by self-interest rather than a sense of duty as it appeared to be an attempt to stem a wave of West Wing resignations amid talk of a snap impeachment or effort by the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to force him from office.\n\nIn unspeakable scenes on Wednesday, marauding thugs marched from an incendiary Trump rally to storm the Capitol. Their aim was to stop lawmakers finalizing President-elect Joe Biden's victory ahead of his January 20 inauguration. But the bedlam, which saw rioters smash windows, lay siege to lawmakers and reach the House and Senate chambers, had the opposite effect, hastening the moment of final repudiation for the President and his baseless claims of a stolen election.\n\nA number of Senate Republicans who had been minded to drag out the President's stunt flipped in revulsion at the storming of their citadel of democracy in an ugly culmination of a lawless presidency. But despite the outrage perpetrated by Trump supporters, more than 100 of his allies in the House -- a majority of Republicans -- still voted to uphold totally fraudulent claims of election fraud.\n\nBut shortly before 4 a.m. ET on Thursday morning, Pence read out the final tally of electoral votes — 306 to 232 in the President-elect's favor — as the Constitution and the will of the people triumphed over Trump's stunning attempt at a coup.\n\nShortly afterward, the President issued a written statement pledging an orderly transition on January 20 even though he said he disagreed with the outcome of the election, once again repeating false claims about how the facts were on his side.\n\nWhile this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again! Trump wrote.\n\nThe breaching of the Capitol for the first time since 1814 overshadowed hugely significant results of twin runoff elections in Georgia that handed Democrats control of the Senate. The victories of Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff will transform prospects for Biden's presidency, which will begin in a nation ripped in two by Trump's seditious behavior and consumed by a murderous and worsening pandemic that produced a new daily record of more than 3,800 Covid-19 deaths.\n\nBut before then, there is growing concern about the stability of a President who has had his Twitter and Facebook accounts suspended because of incitement but retains the full power of the presidency and the nuclear codes.\n\nInside his White House bunker on Wednesday night, Trump was fulminating about his defeat and what he sees as the treachery of Pence.\n\nSome officials were considering resigning, including national security adviser Robert O'Brien. His deputy, Matt Pottinger had already gone Wednesday afternoon, sources told CNN. A GOP source said that some Cabinet members held preliminary discussions about invoking the 25th Amendment to force Trump's removal from office on the grounds he is not fit to serve. There were demands from some House Democrats to trigger immediate impeachment proceedings. However the tumult is resolved, there is the alarming prospect of an uncontrollable President running rampant and a splintered chain of command at the White House that will have grave national security implications and could create a vacuum conducive to further unrest.\n\nIt is not clear how much momentum efforts to expel the President will gather with Trump so close to leaving office. But they reflect extreme concern of even those officials and Republicans who have appeased his wild impulses and abuses of power for four turbulent years.\n\nAfter all, a President who has already been impeached once, who was caught on tape trying to steal the election in Georgia last weekend and who has never recognized the guardrails of his office, is acting in a way that suggests he thinks he has nothing to lose.\n\nHe's out of his mind, one source who is in frequent contact with Trump told CNN's Jim Acosta.\n\nPresidential historian Douglas Brinkley expressed concern about the damage that an unchained and angry president could wreak in the next two weeks.\n\nAnybody in any federal bureau has to be keeping a close eye on Donald Trump because he is acting and thinking in an irrational way, Brinkley said.\n\nA surreal moment\n\nThe most terrifying truth revealed by the assault on the Capitol was not the act itself. It was the mania of a President who turned his insurgents on the nation's legislature and who has immeasurably deepened political estrangements that will fester long after he has left office.\n\nThe spectacle of rioters, waving Trump flags and wearing Make America Great Again hats piling up the steps below the glorious dome that shines as a beacon of self-government was too surreal to believe at first. But while shocking, the unprecedented scenes of an American horde rampaging through the halls of Congress, of police guns drawn in the House chamber and of rioters smashing windows cannot be said to be a surprise.\n\nThey were, in fact, a logical climax to a presidency steeped in demagoguery, conspiracy theories, incitements to violence and a strongman's contempt for the Constitution. They were the inevitable result of years of misinformation and instigation by Trump, his aides and his lie-pumping media propagandists that have left millions of Americans believing his false claims of a rigged election. The shame of a dark day in American history is shared by all those who mocked warnings that Trump's political treachery was brewing an explosion -- including Republican lawmakers, who have abetted his ludicrous claims of voter fraud after enabling his malignant presidency.\n\nWe are going to walk down ... to the Capitol, Trump said in a rally near the White House that lit the touch paper for a day of mayhem as Congress met to finalize Biden's election victory.\n\nYou'll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength, you have to be strong.\n\nThe appalling scenes horrified an incredulous watching world and recalled the revolts and palace rebellions of unstable banana republics rather than the stately rituals of the supposed last best hope for democracy on Earth.\n\nThis is not America, Josep Borrell, a top European Union official, said on Twitter.\n\nSadly, and to the contrary, this is the America wrought by the country's most vengeful President whose abominable four years in power have stoked an American carnage more dangerous than the economic blight he decried in an inaugural address delivered nearly four years ago from the same steps overrun by his thugs.\n\nA day of infamy actually began with the FBI opening an investigation into an apparently fake threat broadcast on air traffic control frequencies to fly a plane into the Capitol to avenge the US killing of a top Iranian general last year. The day's peril came not from outside but from within, as the Trump mob pulled off an incursion previously only managed by British armies 200 years ago.\n\nThere has been a recent debate among journalists on how to refer to Trump's bid to steal a free and fair election he lost, his refusal to honor a peaceful transfer of power, and his incitement of angry supporters to disrupt the constitutional process.\n\nThis is as close to a coup attempt as this country has ever seen, former Washington Police Chief Charles Ramsey told CNN.\n\nTimothy Naftali, a CNN presidential historian from New York University, said that Trump had broken a golden thread of democracy that has sustained American freedom.\n\nToday was the first time in our history that a President has opposed a peaceful transfer of power, Naftali said.\n\nA 'shameful' episode\n\nThe question now is whether Wednesday's outrage will be a one-off eruption, that once quelled, will become an awful memory of a presidency that tore the country apart.\n\nBut the bitter feelings unleashed by Trump are not confined to the tens of thousands of supporters who flocked to Washington, DC. The President and his media shills have seeded a pernicious mistrust of democracy across vast swathes of the country. The majority of Trump voters are not violent. But millions of them believe his poison about the election being stolen — and think their country is being taken away from them. This raises the possibility that Wednesday's unrest is more than the violent death throes of a failed presidency, but a venomous force that will not only thwart Biden's hopes of healing corrosive divides but will fester once Trump leaves office and offer him a platform for continued extremism.\n\nUtah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said that the best way to show respect for voters who are upset at the election result is not to perpetuate Trump's lies but to tell them the truth.\n\nThose who choose to continue to support his dangerous gambit by objecting to the results of a legitimate, democratic election will forever be seen as being complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy.\n\nSeveral Republican senators were angered by Wednesday's events -- despite sending a signal of impunity for Trump's previous abuses of power by voting to acquit him in his impeachment trial and forging a marriage of convenience with Trump to pursue shared goals like confirming conservative judges.\n\nTrump and I have, we've had a hell of a journey. I hate it to end this way. Oh my God, I hate it, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said. All I can say is count me out. Enough is enough, Graham said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell condemned the violence and reinforced his opposition to efforts to block Biden's victory.\n\nWe will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats, McConnell said. We will certify the winner of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nEleventh hour resignations and acknowledgments of Biden's victory, however, are hardly profiles in courage following the indulgence granted by Republicans to Trump's anti-democratic conduct and weeks of appeasing his denial of Biden's victory.\n\nTrump silent amid the mayhem\n\nWhile members of Congress took cover beneath their seats, and his supporters roamed though leadership offices, Trump did nothing — but watch the mayhem that he had triggered unfold on TV.\n\nOne source told CNN's Kaitlin Collins that Trump was more preoccupied with what he sees as Pence's political apostasy after the vice president announced he would not seek to disrupt the certification of Biden's victory — a step he had no power to take in any case. Eventually, Trump issued a video telling protesters to go home but exacerbated the situation by making more disgraceful and false allegations about a stolen election.\n\nThe President's silence when real violence was raging contrasted with his incessant and false pre-election claims that leftist mobs were running rampant through US cities and his calls for the restoration of Law and Order.\n\nAnd the apparently meager US Capitol Police forces that were overwhelmed in Congress contrasted sharply with the heavily armed phalanxes of security forces Trump poured onto streets filled by Black Lives Matters protests over the summer. On that notorious occasion, the Justice Department sent federal troops into Lafayette Square with tear gas to clear protesters ahead of an absurd presidential photo-op.\n\nIt was left to Biden , who will take office in a country brought to its knees by Trump's divisiveness and a pandemic that is now claiming more than 3,000 American lives per day, to offer the steady hand of leadership.\n\nThis is not dissent. It is disorder. It is chaos. It borders on sedition, Biden said in a speech in Delaware.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.
(CNN) Transportation Secretary nominee Pete Buttigieg said Thursday that the Biden administration will look at all relevant authorities at its disposal toward a federal mask mandate on all forms of transportation, part of his confirmation hearing that could put the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor on the path to becoming the first Senate-confirmed LGBTQ Cabinet secretary.\n\nWe are prepared to make sure that we use all relevant authorities to enforce the President's executive order to ensure that across all modes of transportation, workers, passengers, commuters are protected, Buttigieg told Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts during his confirmation hearing before the Senate's Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.\n\nButtigieg, who gained national attention during his upstart presidential campaign, is also expected to play a central role in President Joe Biden's push for a bipartisan infrastructure package. During the campaign, Biden proposed spending $1.3 trillion over 10 years to build schools , roads, bridges, railroads and pipes, expand broadband access and usher in a 100% clean energy economy .\n\nWe need to build our economy back, better than ever, Buttigieg said. The Department of Transportation can play a central role in this, by implementing President Biden's infrastructure vision creating millions of good-paying jobs, revitalizing communities that have been left behind, enabling American small businesses, workers, families and farmers to compete and win in the global economy, and tackling the climate crisis.\n\nButtigieg often spoke about infrastructure on the campaign trail from the perspective of a small-town mayor, arguing that local governments like the one he once ran needed people in Washington who understood their needs and issues.\n\nRead More
Robinson signs autographs before the start of the Old Timers Game between the Angels and Dodgers at Anaheim Stadium in 1969. Three years later, he died of a heart attack at age 53. His legacy lives on in countless ways: His number has been retired by every baseball team, and Jackie Robinson Day is celebrated every April 15 in honor of his first day in the majors. Rachel Robinson founded the Jackie Robinson Foundation, which gives scholarships and leadership training to minority youths, in 1973.\n\nRobinson attends a meeting for Freedom Marchers in Williamston, North Carolina, in 1964. He was there to lend his name to the integration efforts in the city.\n\nJackie and Rachel Robinson had three children, from left: Jackie Jr., David and Sharon. They're shown at their home in Stamford, Connecticut, in 1962. Jackie Jr. died in a car accident in 1971 at age 24.\n\nRobinson retired after the 1956 season and became active in other pursuits. He became an executive for the Chock Full o'Nuts coffee company, spoke out on civil rights -- and occasionally popped up on television, as with this appearance with Ed Sullivan in 1962.\n\nRobinson was a terrific base runner, leading the National League twice in stolen bases and upsetting pitchers' rhythms on a regular basis. He also stole home 19 times in the regular season, and in the 1955 World Series, his steal of home in the eighth inning of Game 1 helped ignite Brooklyn to its only World Series victory (though they lost the game).\n\nRobinson played several positions for the Dodgers: mainly second base but also third base, first base and a little outfield. Here he leaps into the air in an attempt to make a double play as the Cubs' Hank Sauer slides into second in a 1952 game.\n\nDodgers shortstop and native Kentuckian Pee Wee Reese was a supporter of Robinson in the latter's first rough year in the majors, refusing to sign a petition from teammates for a boycott and -- according to some stories -- showing his solidarity by putting his arm around Robinson's shoulders. He became one of Robinson's best friends. The two are pictured in 1950 with their children, cooking soup.\n\nDodgers executive Branch Rickey eyed Robinson as the right man to break the color line and signed him to his first major league contract. The two are shown here in 1950.\n\nRobinson married Rachel in 1946. Through his years in baseball and afterward, she was his partner and sounding board, a steady companion when he was the subject of criticism and worse. She's still a vibrant presence at age 93.\n\nRobinson was born in Cairo, Georgia, but raised in Pasadena, California. He was a formidable athlete, lettering in four sports at UCLA and leading the nation in rushing as a football player. After a short stint in baseball's Negro Leagues, he signed a contract with the Dodgers organization and spent his first season with its Montreal Royals farm club. Here, he crosses home plate after hitting a three-run home run on Opening Day 1946.\n\nJackie Robinson, who broke the color line in Major League Baseball by becoming the sport's first modern-day black player, had a rich life beyond the game. No wonder: A life, he said, is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. Click through for a look at Robinson's life.\n\nStory highlights Jackie Robinson, a sweeping documentary about the baseball star, airs Monday and Tuesday The film shows echoes between Robinson's life and events of the present\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe story of Jackie Robinson isn't just the story of a pioneering baseball player.\n\nIt's also, says Ken Burns, a story that says much about race and America – as well as the complicated man at its center.\n\nRobinson is the subject of Jackie Robinson, a documentary from celebrated filmmaker Burns, his daughter Sarah Burns and her husband, David McMahon. It airs Monday and Tuesday on PBS.\n\nRobinson's life paralleled, and sometimes intersected with, events in the life of the country. He was born in the Jim Crow South, the son of sharecroppers and the grandson of a slave. He grew up in California, the state to which so many would migrate in the coming decades.\n\nHe served in the military – and fought its discrimination. He played in New York in the 1950s when it was the capital of baseball.\n\nHe was a Republican who attended the 1964 GOP convention but then supported Democrats as the political parties' makeup changed. He struggled with the social tumult of the 1960s, a conflict poignantly reflected in his relationship with his son, a Vietnam War veteran who overcame a drug problem only to die in a car accident. He had a rich and devoted marriage to his wife, Rachel, his partner and sounding board.\n\nIn other words, there's a much bigger picture than the one you'll find on a baseball card.\n\nThis is a multigenerational portrait of an African-American family, Burns said.\n\nHe added, In some ways, knowing the full, complex picture of Jackie gives you a greater perspective on what's going on today, from Trayvon Martin and Ferguson to the presidency and even the rollback of some of the essential liberties given to African-Americans in the mid-'60s that now seem to be in jeopardy.\n\nFire and competition\n\nThere are any number of stories in Jackie Robinson that echo events of our time.\n\nFor example, the image of Robinson entering the major leagues is of a man who kept his temper in check, engaging in the Christ-like gesture of turning the other cheek, in Burns' words. Certainly, he was encouraged to do so by Branch Rickey, the Dodgers executive who signed him, and Robinson did largely channel his aggression into his play.\n\nBut there was a great deal of anger underneath.\n\nIn one instance, as an officer stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, during World War II, Robinson was told to go to the back of a desegregated Army bus. He refused, the driver called the MPs, and Robinson was taken into custody. He was later booked on some trumped-up charges (though most were eventually dismissed) and court-martialed. He was acquitted, but the event left its mark.\n\nMoreover, as a black ballplayer, he was sometimes unfavorably compared with Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella, an easygoing sort praised by the press as much as the fiery Robinson was criticized. Robinson was accused of being a rabble-rouser and of insolence – terms that attempted to define him as an angry black man.\n\nI think if you understand the more complicated person – the sort of driven, competitive, impatient person who was asked to (break the color line) – you have an even greater appreciation of what it must have been like to withhold his response, Burns said.\n\nA love story\n\nThe documentary also puts Robinson's marriage to Rachel at the center. Rachel Robinson, now 93, is revelatory: a sharp, vibrant presence and guide.\n\nA really telling moment is when there's the discussion in the first episode about how smart he was in picking Rachel. And I think it's really true, that (if) there's no Rachel, then there's no Jackie, Burns said.\n\nRachel Robinson wasn't just an adoring wife, Burns observes. She sent back an engagement ring when she was unhappy with his behavior. She had her own job, as a nurse, and insisted that her husband stay active after his playing career ended.\n\nIn their dynamic, there are parallels with another couple Burns interviewed for the film: Barack and Michelle Obama.\n\nThere's the President and first lady, another couple hurtling through time and space – seemingly a different time and space – but experiencing the same thing, Burns said. As the President said, it's really good to go home when people are giving you a lot of grief, not based on substance but on the color of the skin, and have somebody who's got your back.\n\nLegacy of a 'great American'\n\nRobinson died in 1972. He was 53 years old.\n\nIn the decades since, his legacy has been secured. Every April 15, Major League Baseball celebrates Jackie Robinson Day to honor the Hall of Famer. Every MLB team has retired No. 42, Robinson's uniform number. The Jackie Robinson Foundation – founded by Rachel – continues to award college scholarships and provide support services for worthy applicants. The movie 42 brought the story of Robinson's life to a wide audience. A Jackie Robinson Museum remains in the works.\n\nBut for all that, Jackie Robinson still finds new stories to tell.\n\nAfter all, Robinson isn't just the most important person in the history of baseball, Burns said.\n\nHe was, the documentarian added, one of the great Americans of all time.
London (CNN) When an American actress marries a prince, the world watches. And Meghan Markle , who is soon to wed Britain's Prince Harry , is not the first.\n\nOn April 4, 1956, hundreds of journalists gathered at New York's waterfront to catch a glimpse of Grace Kelly as the Oscar-winning actress boarded the ocean liner that would take her to Europe -- and to the man she was engaged to marry, Rainier III, Prince of Monaco.\n\nIt was the harbor's biggest shipside news conference in 30 years, writes Robert Lacey in his biography of Kelly. The whole country was mesmerized.\n\nThe couple's fairy-tale wedding two weeks later was broadcast to over 30 million television viewers in Europe alone, according to Lacey.\n\nMore than six decades on, a similar fairy tale is mesmerizing people around the world. Unlike Kelly, Markle will not officially become a princess, but to most, that hardly matters.\n\nLike Kelly, Markle is described as passionate and beautiful -- and a woman who knows what she wants.\n\nWhat else does she share with America's most famous princess bride?\n\nThe outsider\n\nMarkle, 36, is no stereotypical princess. She's American, divorced and biracial (she has an African-American mother, Doria Ragland, and a white father, Thomas Markle).\n\nShe grew up in Los Angeles, 2,700 miles from Kelly's home city of Philadelphia. But her school, Immaculate Heart High School, a Catholic school for girls, was just a short walk from the Hollywood studios that propelled Kelly to stardom.\n\nBoth acted from a young age and forged successful on-screen careers before crossing an ocean and entering an entirely new world.\n\nWhen Grace Kelly became Princess Grace, she put Monaco on the map, says royal historian Carolyn Harris.\n\nMeghan is an outsider (in the royal family), and I think that's only a good thing, says Anna Whitelock, royal historian at Royal Holloway, University of London. She has a unique perspective.\n\nKelly, who was just 26 when she married her prince, reportedly struggled to feel accepted by Monaco's high society, and some of its royals.\n\nGrace Kelly came up against the established traditions that existed in Monaco, says Carolyn Harris, royal historian and author of the book Raising Royalty.\n\nBoth as a foreigner and as an actress, she found she inadvertently offended people.\n\nIn contrast, Harris sees Britain's royals making a big effort to create a supportive atmosphere for their newest member.\n\nMarkle herself has spoken of the warm welcome she has received from Prince Harry's family.\n\nThe family has been great, she said in a joint interview with her fiancé , filmed and broadcast on the day they announced their engagement, adding that she was starting to feel a part of not just the institution but also part of the family.\n\nMarkle spent Christmas Day with the royals in 2017, unusual for someone who hasn't yet married into the family.\n\nHarris attributes this difference mostly to cultural shifts.\n\nThis marriage gives a sense of just how much social and cultural change has taken place over the course of Queen Elizabeth's life, says Harris. The royal family is now much more inclusive in terms of who can be a member.\n\nWhitelock believes Markle, as an outsider, can help push that process even further -- and likens her to Harry's mother, Princess Diana, in that regard.\n\nDiana held a mirror up to (the royal family). She forced them to change and modernize and look outwards. I think Meghan will also be a force for good.\n\nThe actress\n\nPrincess or actress -- take your choice, Lacey writes in his biography of Kelly. Grace could not be both.\n\nWhile Markle has not reached the same heights as Kelly -- who starred in 11 movies and won an Oscar for her performance in The Country Girl (1954) -- she has built a successful career as an actress, most notably starring as Rachel Zane in seven seasons of television drama Suits.\n\nMarkle played paralegal Rachel Zane in seven seasons of Suits from 2011 to 2018.\n\nBut for Markle, like Kelly, relinquishing that career was a step on the path to becoming a royal. While Kelly reportedly seemed reluctant to wholly give up her former life and later tried to return to acting, Markle has spoken positively of the shift.\n\nI don't see it as giving anything up, I just see it as a change, she said in the engagement interview. It's a new chapter.\n\nHarris says Markle's experience in the world of celebrity will help both her and the royal family in the transition process. She's used to being in the public eye and that's an asset for the royal family, she says.\n\nBut Meghan still faces a big transition, Whitelock says. She comes from a very different world -- a world of Hollywood and celebrity and acting, she says. There will need to be a pivot on her part from promotion of Meghan Markle to promotion of the monarchy and the royal family.\n\nKelly's performance in The Country Girl won her an Oscar for Best Actress in 1955.\n\nLacey's book suggests Kelly found that process a challenge. And, as Markle has also remarked, a headline-making career as an actress does not prepare a person for the scrutiny and press attention faced by a princess.\n\nAs naïve as it sounds now, I did not have any understanding of just what it would be like, Markle said in November, adding with a nod to her fiancé: I don't think either of us did.\n\nAs Harry's wife, Meghan will never be off the press radar -- especially if the couple start a family, as they say they intend to. They will have to try to strike a balance between public and private, says Harris. There will be tremendous public fascination if they have children.\n\nThe feminist\n\nTalking to Lacey, actress Rita Gram described Kelly as one of the first independent women in America... She left her home, she earned her own living, she made the bed.\n\nThe biography tells of a woman who sought to be self-sufficient and self-determining, a daunting prospect in 1950s America. While many battles for female independence have since been fought and (largely) won, Markle shows a similar disinclination to bow to patriarchal norms.\n\nShe's a mature, very independent, very articulate woman, says Whitelock, who notes that Markle spoke more than her fiancé in their engagement interview and showed great self-assurance. It's a partnership of equals.\n\nMarkle seems to have a strong sense of self, says Harris.\n\nMarkle has also been a vocal advocate for gender equality since childhood and in February declared her intention to hit the ground running with her work to empower girls and women across the UK.\n\nIndeed, with the passage of 60 years and the accompanying cultural shifts, Princess Meghan finds herself with far more freedom than Princess Grace, both as an individual woman and in her female advocacy projects.\n\nOf course, Kelly was marrying the monarch, while Markle will be wife to a man who is unlikely ever to be king (Harry is sixth in line to the throne). Markle can speak, dress and act more freely than her Philadelphian counterpart.\n\nGrace saw her royal duty as being the model corporate wife to her husband, wrote Lacey. And later: She was very good at smiling, at being dignified and stylish... But that, Grace now knew, was just about all that being a princess had to offer.\n\nPrincess Grace of Monaco and Prince Rainier III of Monaco meet the media during a trip to Atlantic City, five months after their wedding.\n\nWhile Markle will have scope to be far more than her husband's accessory, she does also face a raft of unavoidable new restrictions and protocols. Her entire life will be scheduled well in advance, says Harris. That reduces the scope for spontaneity.\n\nAnd what Markle can say -- and where -- is now much more limited. Her days of winning fans by documenting her life on a blog are over, Whitelock observes, adding that the act of closing down her lifestyle website The Tig last year is indicative of a bigger closing down.\n\nThe humanitarian\n\nLacey recounts how Kelly threw herself into charitable work in the years after her wedding, making frequent visits to Monaco's orphanages, hospitals and homes for the elderly, becoming president of Monaco's Red Cross and founding a charity that lobbied for the rights of children.\n\nFor decades, royals across the world have used their unique position to shine a spotlight on particular causes -- and the UK's young royals are no different. It's a role Markle is well prepared for.\n\nIn 2016 she became a global ambassador for World Vision and traveled to Rwanda to see the impact of the charity's clean-water initiatives. A year earlier, she was named the UN Women's Advocate for Political Participation and Leadership.\n\nWhitelock believes Markle is showing the right character for charitable work too. She's shown a real sense of ease with people. She doesn't have the kind of stuffiness or the nervousness of the other royals on their early outings... She will reach out to people.\n\nMarkle clearly connects with people, says Whitelock. On this occasion, she was meeting members of the public during a trip to Northern Ireland with Prince Harry.\n\nAnd while Kelly seemed to do most of her charitable work alone, Harry and Meghan are clearly planning a joint assault on the world's problems.\n\nIt was really one of the first things we connected on, Markle recalled in the engagement interview. One of the first things we started talking about when we met was just the different things we wanted to do in the world and how passionate we were about seeing change.\n\nThat's what got date two in the books, she added, smiling.\n\nAnd since date two, back in July 2016, the pair have had a lot of time to get to know each other, to become the fantastic team Harry says they are, and for Meghan to acclimatize to the reality of her new role.\n\nMarkle is entering this open-eyed, says Whitelock. She's coming to this as a very well-equipped princess.
(CNN) The shocking invasion of the US Capitol by a mob of supporters of US President Donald Trump is proof that the anger and frustration that divides America politically has reached a boiling point.\n\nWhile only a radical few may condone violence, disappointment and animosity over the outcome of the election -- fueled by false tales of election fraud -- is widespread among Trump supporters.\n\nThat bitterness could threaten relationships with family, friends, colleagues and loved ones, as many find themselves on opposite sides of a seemingly unbridgeable ideological chasm.\n\nIsn't there a way to communicate that allows both sides to be heard without further tearing these relationships apart?\n\nCNN put that question to experts before the November presidential election. The answer: absolutely. Here are 10 suggestions on how to de-escalate angry conversations and begin to bridge the gap.\n\nAsk yourself: Why am I doing this?\n\nIt's important to know why you want to reach out.\n\nIn terms of deciding whether or not you want to have a conversation with somebody across political lines, it is important to be aware of what your own motivations are, said Tania Israel, author of  Beyond Your Bubble: How to Connect Across the Political Divide: Skills and Strategies for Conversations That Work .\n\nIf your goal is to change the other person's mind in one conversation, you're going to be really disappointed, because you're not likely to be that effective, cautioned Vaile Wright, American Psychological Association's senior director of health care innovation.\n\nIt can help to keep your relationship with that other person top of mind, suggests Jacksonville, Florida, clinical psychologist Nina Silander, who has written about the lack of conservative views in the field of psychology\n\nThink about why it is you care about this person or why you like them or appreciate them, Silander said. That can soften your response and help you better articulate your perspective and lend credence to their viewpoint.\n\nDealing with 'fake facts'\n\nYou may find it difficult to acknowledge a perspective that you know to be based on disinformation. Entrenched views among certain age groups have become more common as people share exaggerated or falsified news via social media.\n\nLists of fake news sites are available, such as this one by Snopes or this tip sheet from Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, but shoving those in front of your friend or relative isn't likely to elicit a positive response.\n\nInstead, try to approach the issue by acknowledging the emotions of the person who has chosen to believe fake news, even as you gently discuss the facts.\n\nIt's clear that we need healthy and productive ways to engage across different opinions, but we should never have to accept false information. We can and should challenge non-factual statements. As we approach these engagements, it is more productive to not challenge each other's emotional reaction to a situation, said Caroline Hopper, managing director of the Citizenship & American Identity Program at The Aspen Institute, which oversees The Better Arguments Project along with The Allstate Corporation and educational nonprofit Facing History and Ourselves\n\nThe Better Arguments Project wants to teach us how to have more productive arguments. These conversations don't have to drive us apart, the group says. In fact, by learning to argue better, we can come together.\n\nWe need to be interacting within a realm of fact, but we also need to leave room for human emotion, feelings like hope and fear, which we know can absolutely steer discourse in this country just as much as facts can, Hopper added.\n\nFor example, a person should not challenge someone telling them: 'I am upset about the outcome of this election because it makes me feel afraid.' Rather, we should seek to understand more about why that opinion is held.\n\nTry curiosity first\n\nTo de-escalate ill will, avoid approaching the exchange with a list of talking points or facts in mind, experts suggest. Instead, you want to ask questions and truly understand the response.\n\nThe most important thing you can do is to listen to the other person, advised Israel, a professor in the department of counseling, clinical and school psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\nTo do that, enter the conversation with simple curiosity, she advised.\n\nBeing curious about where they're coming from and trying to understand where they're coming from helps set people's expectations (about the outcome of the talk) more appropriately, Israel said.\n\nBe prepared to listen, not talk\n\nTo do that, you may have to learn and practice some new (or rusty) skills, the type taught in marriage counseling, for example.\n\nRepeating back what you think you heard and asking questions are techniques known to elicit clarifications, as your loved one realizes either they misspoke or you misunderstood.\n\nMinimizing misunderstanding is incredibly important -- repeating back what we think we've heard, asking questions to clarify, looking and really striving for opportunities to share and find common ground can go a long way, Silander said.\n\nIt helps you to really listen if you know that you're going to need to summarize, Israel added. It's also going to help them to feel more understood, and that's going to help to create that connection and keep the entire conversation on a calmer level.\n\nGo a step further and acknowledge the other position, Silander suggests.\n\nTrying to understand someone else's position, or trying to see the world through their eyes is what we call in developmental psychology, 'theory of mind.' It's something we learn to do between four and five years of age -- understanding that other people can see things differently, Silander said.\n\nUsing I statements instead of you statements is another important way to facilitate dialogue, Wright said.\n\nUsing I statements to express how you feel may foster communication with someone with opposing political views.\n\nFor example, you could say 'I have a lot of concerns about this election, and how it might affect health care because I have a preexisting condition.' Keep it about you and your feelings and about the policies, not the people, Wright added.\n\nExperts CNN spoke to point out that these skills not only will help better our dialogue across political lines, but in our daily lives as well.\n\nThey're also going to help us to be better parents, better partners, better community members and coworkers, Wright said.\n\nBeware the minefield of human nature\n\nExpect to feel an emotional flare-up when you hear things you don't like. It's part of being human, an ancient and automatic reaction to any perceived threat to our well-being.\n\nIt turns out that our bodies don't necessarily know the difference between the saber-toothed tiger and a shocking news event or a heated conversation with another person, Israel said.\n\nOur sympathetic nervous system goes into action when we perceive a threat, flooding the body with adrenaline and other stress hormones. Key signs of that reaction can be a racing heart, tense muscles, even a flushed face.\n\nWe are ready to fight or to run away from the threat, Israel said.\n\nSuch reactions to politics can even harm our health, research has found.\n\nThe hospitalization rate for heart attack and stroke in a major California health system was 1.62 times higher in the two days immediately after the 2016 presidential election than the same two days the week before, a study released in late October said.\n\nThis is a wake-up call, said study author David Williams, chair of the department of social and behavioral sciences and a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in a statement.\n\nWe need to pay greater attention to the ways in which stress linked to political campaigns, rhetoric and election outcomes can directly harm health.\n\nGround yourself\n\nIt's possible to interrupt our natural tendency to become stressed and anxious by using grounding techniques as soon as we feel ourselves tensing, psychologists say.\n\n'We can do deep breathing, Israel said. We can physically ground ourselves by noticing the feeling of the chair underneath us or by touching our own arm and paying attention to that.\n\nSet yourself up for success by making sure you're in top mental shape for the conversation, Wright suggests.\n\nIt's not great to have these conversations at the end of a long, hard day, or when people have been drinking or a situation where you're not as emotionally in control as as you'd like to be, she warned.\n\nBeware of tribal urges\n\nIt's natural for people to want to be in groups with similar viewpoints, or to find our tribe, experts say.\n\nDuring an election year, we can become rather tribal, and that can be inflamed by media, it can be flamed by special interest groups, and it caters to our own human nature, Silander said.\n\nThe people media choose for spokespeople usually are more extreme in their views, but it's also our basic psychology that we tend to have these distorted perceptions of people who we see as being different from ourselves, Israel said.\n\nThis instinctual feeling of us versus them intensifies with divisive rhetoric, Wright said, which can lead us to label people in ways that make it difficult to find common ground.\n\nIt isn't just that you and I have differences on how the educational system should run, Wright said. It becomes 'You don't care about teachers, you don't care about kids.' It becomes not about the issue, but about you as a person and your values.\n\nTry to find common ground\n\nTo combat that, Silander suggests learning about the fundamental value differences between liberals and conservatives in an objective and considerate way.\n\nIt really enables us to better understand and empathize with one another, Silander said. And we can start to see that maybe we often share concerns that are more similar in nature than we would have thought, even if we disagree with what solutions to those concerns would look like.\n\nAs an example, Silander points to civil rights issues as a way for liberals to try to understand why some conservatives believe mandates to wear masks are an infringement on personal liberties.\n\nThe underlying theme or principle can at least be one way to relate even if we disagree, she said.\n\nJoin a group and practice\n\nPractice makes perfect, as they say. Over the last four years, groups of people dedicated to bringing political opposites together have sprung up around the country.\n\nJoining a training -- such as those offered by The Better Arguments Project -- can jump-start your skills for that all-important talk with a loved one.\n\nThe concept of a better argument is really all about caring more about one another than we do about our opinion on a specific subject, Hopper said.\n\nIf we politely ignore our differences -- especially with those closest to us -- we are giving up our public discourse, our family discourse, to the voices that are the most polarized, she said.\n\nWe're not going to be able to seek any kind of informed solutions together because we're not getting the full scope of information that we need, she added.\n\nBe human first\n\nTo have a better argument, one has to care about the other person, not just their opinion about the issue.\n\nWe ask participants to 'be human first.' What we mean by that is you shouldn't only engage with each other about your opinions; share more about yourself and seek to learn more about the person with whom you are engaging, Hopper said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOtherwise, you will only see one another only as opponents, rather than as people representing very full lives and experiences that are shaping those opinions, she said. The priority is to walk away from that interaction caring more about that other person than about whether or not you won that argument -- be human first.\n\nThis also means that you have a right to expect that your own humanity should be acknowledged and respected. There is no room for hate and bigotry in a 'better argument.'\n\nThis story is updated from a story that originally published on November 4, 2020.
(CNN) -- Polygamist sect leader Warren Steed Jeffs, who is awaiting trial in southern Utah, was charged with eight additional felony counts from Arizona in two separate cases, authorities said Thursday.\n\nPolygamist Warren Jeffs is facing eight additional counts related to alleged incest and sexual contact with a minor.\n\nA grand jury indicted Jeffs May 10 on two counts of sexual conduct with a minor and two counts of incest for alleged incidents that occurred in 2002, according to a statement issued by Mohave County Attorney Matthew J. Smith.\n\nOn Thursday, another grand jury indicted him on two additional counts of sexual conduct with a minor and two additional counts of incest. Those offenses took place in Colorado City, Arizona, in 2003, according to the indictment.\n\nBoth indictments state that Jeffs, leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (FLDS), committed the offenses as an accomplice.\n\nAccording to Arizona law, sexual conduct with a minor is a Class 6 felony punishable upon conviction by up to a year in prison. Incest is a class 4 felony punishable upon conviction by up to 2½ years in prison.\n\nThe cases involve two separate victims, Smith said in the statement. Mr. Jeffs will not come to Mohave County to face these charges or to have an initial appearance on them until his Utah case is resolved.\n\nJeffs, 51, is awaiting trial in Washington County, Utah, on a charge of being an accomplice to rape by arranging the marriage of a 14-year-old girl to her 19-year-old cousin.\n\nThe trial initially was set to begin in April, but Fifth District Judge James Shumate postponed it earlier this year, and a new date has not been set. At the time, Shumate said the delay was due to recent information in the case, but he did not elaborate.\n\nThe judge in March refused a defense request to move the trial out of Washington County because of press coverage, but he said he may reconsider if attorneys encounter difficulty during jury selection.\n\nUtah prosecutors say that because Jeffs forced the underage girl to marry, and therefore forced her to have sex with the adult man, and because Jeffs insisted she stay married, he is an accomplice to rape.\n\nDuring his preliminary hearing in December, Jeffs' defense attorneys said that he never knew whether the marriage he arranged was consummated and, if it was, whether the sex was consensual.\n\nThe girl, identified only as Jane Doe, testified at the preliminary hearing that she was so scared during the forced wedding.\n\nThe whole time I was crying, she said. I wanted to die.\n\nThe rape as an accomplice charge is a first-degree felony in Utah, carrying a penalty upon conviction of five years to life in prison.\n\nJeffs previously was charged in Arizona with two counts of sexual conduct with a minor for allegedly presiding over arranged marriages, along with an additional charge of conspiracy.\n\nThose charges, from 2005, were put on hold while Jeffs faces trial in Utah.\n\nJeffs was captured August 28, 2006, in a traffic stop near Las Vegas, Nevada. At the time, he had been on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List for months.\n\nThe FLDS freely practices polygamy in the towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, which straddle the state line. The sect maintains groups of followers in Texas, South Dakota, Nevada, British Columbia and Mexico.\n\nThe offshoot sect broke from the mainline Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, over the practice of polygamy.\n\nThe Mormon church, which gave up plural marriage more than a century ago, has no ties to Jeffs' group.

Kamala Harris announced that she will run for president in 2020. Almost immediately, headlines appeared declaring her the female Barack Obama. Like many other prominent women, she is – wrongly and inaccurately to boot – best known as a derivative of a more-famous predecessor.\n\nPHOTO: Holly Thomas Holly Thomas\n\nThere are similarities between Harris and Obama, to be sure. Both are Democrats, both have a background in law, both have a mixed-race background. There is an obvious convenience to the comparison. It neatly captures the public imagination at a time when Harris is yet to be world famous, but is charismatic, on the rise and prepared to challenge President Donald Trump, while Obama's name continues to conjure a nostalgic, anti-Trump emotion.\n\nIt makes superficial sense. But it's also symptomatic of a lazy habit that infantilizes high-profile women in America and abroad, and skims over the personal details and unique circumstances that shaped them.\n\nKamala Harris is the first Indian-American woman to have a seat in the US Senate. She was also the first woman, black, Indian-American or South Asian, to serve as district attorney of San Francisco, and as California's attorney general. The most famous instance of public sexism she faced before announcing her presidential bid occurred in 2013, when none other than Barack Obama called her the best-looking attorney general. Obama later apologized to Harris after the remark was widely criticized (rightly) as sexist.\n\nThe two are very different political beings. Obama, with some liberal moves such as reduced sentences for drug offenses aside, did not make prison reform a priority, and was against mass incarceration. But the prison system is a subject close to Harris' heart.\n\nDespite personal reservations, she promised to defend the death penalty in California as attorney general, and proved herself an often harsh prosecutor, favoring long periods of imprisonment. In other areas, Harris has positioned herself further to the left than the former President. Those only aware of her overlap with Obama might make assumptions about her attitudes elsewhere, which would turn out to be untrue.\n\nHarris is far from the only female politician to receive this media treatment – and that treatment isn't always limited to comparisons to more famous men (though admittedly that's overwhelmingly the case when it comes to world leaders).\n\nTake Theresa May. Coverage of the British Prime Minister is regularly peppered with references to Margaret Thatcher. Throughout her negotiations over the Brexit deal in Brussels, Belgium, in December, newspapers referred to May's handbag-wielding Maggie moments – Thatcher's handbag being the mythical weapon with which she would supposedly clobber her opposition.\n\nConsidering Margaret Thatcher was in favor of Europe, fought for Britain's interests within the EU, and for Britain to strengthen its position as a member of the EU, this likeness is especially ironic.\n\nTheresa May's Brexit strategy has been to make determined noises while championing a cause – leaving the EU – she campaigned and voted against, and she consistently makes zero productive headway with it. Her predecessor David Cameron's negotiation of the ultimately null EU reform deal in 2016 was far more Thatcheresque in its intention and execution (even if the referendum he called subsequently was not). Coverage of his doings, however, didn't call him Maggie – or indeed, refer to other male PMs who went before him. When he acted in his own name, he was treated as such.\n\nThe fudging of political personalities can be derogatory in both directions, depending on individual sympathies. When Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer succeeded Angela Merkel as leader of Germany's Christian Democratic Union last year, she noted the commentary describing her as a mini Merkel, or Merkel 2.0.\n\nI have read a lot about what I am and who I am, she told her party. Mini, a copy, simply 'more of the same.' Dear delegates, I stand before you as I am and as life made me, and I am proud of that.\n\nThe attention paid to Kramp-Karrenbauer's likeness to Merkel distracts from the future implications of her attitudes for the country, and indeed, Europe at large. Kramp-Karrenbauer is extremely conservative on same-sex marriage, and has likened it to incest in the past. Her stance on migration is also vastly stricter than Merkel's, and she has made it clear she is keen to dial down the more liberal attitude exhibited by the party in the last decade.\n\nWhile Merkel's political career was catalyzed by the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification, Kramp-Karrenbauer's has been forged in the wake of Merkel's. That by definition gives her an adapted frame of reference, which merits its own scrutiny.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nEvery politician – every person – is a product of their own time and place. In the coming months, it looks quite possible that Kamala Harris might win Obama's endorsement of her bid for president.\n\nIf she does, the comparisons between the two are likely to reignite. As with May and Kramp-Karrenbauer, those watching would do better to pay attention to the political landscape Harris is working within now, rather than any nostalgic connotations. The president whose footsteps are most pertinent to Harris, the president who she will be measured against should she prevail against her fellow Democratic candidates, is Donald Trump.\n\nIf she finds herself competing with him, the very least Harris deserves, the very least the voting public deserves, is to be judged as an adult in her own right, running under her own name.
(CNN) Internal rifts in both political parties are threatening to derail an effort to renew a set of powerful surveillance tools prized by law enforcement ahead of their expiration next month.\n\nWhite House officials are aligning with GOP Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio against Attorney General Bill Barr and Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, over the best legislative strategy to renew the authorities. Divisions among House Democrats caused an abrupt decision to scrap a key committee vote on Wednesday. And a number of influential Democrats, including House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, stiffened their opposition to Barr's and Graham's call for a quick extension of the authorities to avoid a lapse in the surveillance law.\n\nThe growing divisions over both the policy and the legislative strategy are raising the prospects that Congress might not reach a deal by a critical March 15 deadline when the authorities are set to expire.\n\nJordan, after meeting with White House officials on Wednesday about the matter, told CNN that he differed with Barr's strategy of a straight extension, arguing changes must be made now to the law.\n\nI think Barr has done a great job as attorney general, but I don't think we can do a clean reauthorization, Jordan said.\n\nAt issue is a trio of expiring authorities of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA, that have been caught in a proxy fight over the future of the wider national security wiretap program in the wake of cutting criticism from the Justice Department's inspector general over the bureau's use of FISA in the Russia investigation. The House Judiciary Committee had been set to hold a hearing Wednesday afternoon to review legislation that would extend the authorization of some of the expiring provisions while also adding in limited reforms, but the hearing was canceled after a last-minute move by a Democratic lawmaker to propose more radical changes.\n\nThis week Senate Republicans seemed to be coalescing around their own strategy -- a clean reauthorization of the provisions followed by broader reform down the line -- further complicating the environment in which lawmakers are acting.\n\nPartisans on both sides of the aisle had dug into their opposition of the bill ahead of the House Judiciary Committee hearing. Rep. Zoe Lofgren , a Democrat from California, had said she wanted to add amendments to the legislation that would inject more civil liberties protections, and Georgia Rep. Doug Collins , the committee's top Republican, had said on Tuesday that the proposal failed to protect American citizens -- including future presidents and presidential campaigns -- from unlawful spying.\n\nAfter the committee vote was postponed, Collins slammed the Democrats in a statement for stall tactics.\n\nDemocrats are yet again putting our national security at risk with their stall tactics, Collins said. Critical counterterrorism provisions are hanging in the balance because Democrats chose to delay an already ill-timed markup.\n\nCollins and Jordan are among a group of House Republicans who have clamored for even more sweeping changes to the broader FISA system after the Justice Department inspector general reported in December that the FBI had made a series of errors as they sought to wiretap Carter Page , a former Trump campaign adviser.\n\nReform of the secretive surveillance court where national security officials obtain wiretaps in terrorism and espionage cases has long been a goal of civil liberties groups like the ACLU. The addition of conservative lawmakers inspired by the inspector general report and the President's criticism of the FBI has created an unusual marriage amid the current debate.\n\nThe surveillance bill that had been set to be marked up before the House Judiciary Committee Wednesday afternoon had been crafted over months of careful negotiation with the Judiciary and Intelligence committees, House leadership and outside civil liberties groups like the ACLU, but was scrapped at the last minute after Lofgren said she planned to introduce a group of amendments that were seen as making the legislation's eventual passage untenable, a committee aide said.\n\nThe committee aide said Lofgren's office had been included early on as the bill was being written, but after this report was published Wednesday, Lofgren denied that in an interview, saying her office had not been part of the negotiation process, had only been shown the text of the bill earlier this month and had expressed around that time that they were interested in making amendments.\n\nSome of the reform provisions from a bipartisan reauthorization bill Lofgren had co-sponsored in January were included in the bill eventually put forward by the Judiciary Committee, though Lofgren had wanted deeper reform, like the expansion of the role of an outside attorney to challenge the government's evidence before the FISA court.\n\nThey're simple things to protect the civil rights of Americans. There's no poison pill in there. If the Constitution is a poison pill we've got bigger problems, Lofgren said.\n\nTuesday afternoon, Lofgren told committee leadership that she would be introducing the amendments, the aide said. Nadler decided to scrap the markup Wednesday afternoon after consulting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who leads the Intelligence Committee, the aide said.\n\nThe Republican fracture on the issue appears to have reached the White House, where influential factions have been pushing the divergent strategies. A number of House conservatives met earlier Wednesday with Jared Kushner and White House counsel Pat Cipollone on the FISA fight, two sources familiar with the situation told CNN.\n\nAfter the meeting, Jordan, who's close to the President and set to take over GOP leadership of the House Judiciary Committee with Collins running for the Senate , told CNN that he didn't support simply passing a clean reauthorization of the expiring provisions and saving the structural reform for a future date.\n\n(DOJ Inspector General Michael) Horowitz just told us that (the FBI) lied to the FISA court 17 times -- 51 mistakes that they made in the whole process, 17 misstatements, omissions, better known as lies, in the Carter Page FISA, Jordan said. So we have to reform. There are some good reforms I think we can do.\n\nSchiff is also resisting a clean reauthorization of the expiring provisions, according to a committee official.\n\nNo, Nadler said Wednesday when asked if he would back a straight extension of the three expiring provisions.\n\nAmong the committee's rank-and-file members, feelings about the bill were even further mixed.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat, suggested in an interview that she would be fine with letting the three FISA provisions lapse, though she added the committee was working to find an agreement with significant reforms that would make it palatable to a wider group of lawmakers.\n\nI'm one of those individuals probably that reflects concerns that society has, which is privacy, how much power do we give government and at what expense do we have additional security, said Rep. Lou Correa, a California Democrat who sits on the committee and was supportive of changes to the bill that was set to be voted on during the Wednesday meeting.\n\nOn Tuesday, Barr was on the Hill to lobby for his own plan for the surveillance reform. In a closed-door meeting, Barr urged GOP senators to extend the expiring provisions while he takes steps within the Justice Department to begin reforming elements of the law administratively, according to several senators and a senior Justice Department official.\n\nBarr also indicated that Congress could work on broader reforms to be enacted at a later time, and said he supported the effort by Graham to hold hearings on the issue in future weeks, the senators said.\n\nBarr told the lawmakers that his approach had the support of the National Security Council, the intelligence community and the FBI, although he acknowledged that there are differing opinions within the White House, including at the Domestic Policy Council, the DOJ official said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas warned Nadler that it would be a mistake to block a clean extension of the expiring provisions.\n\nI don't know if he wants to be responsible for the expiration of some essential tools for anti-terrorism investigations, said Cornyn, a member of the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary committees. I would be surprised if he wants to bare that responsibility but I think that's where we are right now.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments including comments from Rep. Zoe Lofgren.
Two women in northeastern Nepal on their way to see doctors, on May 14, 2015, after earthquakes killed over 8,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless .\n\nStory highlights Child trafficking often increases after natural disasters such as earthquakes The disruption of institutions means the usual child protection systems aren't in place, writes Anna Childs Exploitation of trafficked children can take many forms -- forced prostitution, labor, marriage, militia and more\n\nEditor's Note: Anna Childs is academic director for International Development at The Open University. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nWhen a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal in April 2015, it killed well over 8,000 people and turned much of the country into a disaster zone.\n\n17 days later, as recovery operations were getting established, a 7.3 magnitude quake caused further destruction.\n\nIn the desolation, chaos and widespread panic that followed, a surge in child trafficking was inevitable. Just as it was after the 2004 tsunami in southern Asia, the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the 2011 drought in Horn of Africa, the 2013 typhoon in the Philippines, and many other natural disasters besides.\n\nSo why do these disasters make children so vulnerable to trafficking – and what can be done about it?\n\nUNICEF defines child trafficking as the act of recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation either within or outside a country.\n\nThe exploitation of trafficked children can take many forms – forced prostitution, labor, marriage, militia, domestic servitude and more – but nearly always means dirty and dangerous work for little or no pay, often involving sexual abuse and enforcement through threat and violence.\n\nAccording to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the most common form of human trafficking (79%) is trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation.\n\nIt's difficult to get accurate and current statistics on trafficking because generally only those survivors who are identified and rescued can be counted, and there is no single monitoring organization.\n\nPHOTO: NOEL CELIS/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Children swim on a flooded street in Manila on September 23, 2013, after monsoon rains and Typhoon Usagi caused floods and landslides.\n\nIn 2001 the International Labour Organization estimated that worldwide there are some 2.5 million people who have been trafficked. The UNODC suggests that an average 20% of these are children, with a much higher fraction in many developing countries and regions.\n\nPoverty plus disaster\n\nIn Nepal, as in other developing countries, birth registration is poorly enforced, making children difficult or impossible to track in any system.\n\nPeople living with poverty are especially vulnerable to the false promise of a better future, and in an economy that depends heavily on dividends from migrating workers, desperation can lead people to consider risky opportunities.\n\nFamilies are often enticed by the offer of well-paid work for their child in another region or country.\n\nThey may even be given an advance against the child's anticipated earnings, and trafficked children hope to improve their lives and send money back to their families. But when they arrive at their destination, they find that the situation is very different.\n\nIn most poor societies, it's the girls who are more readily taken out of school (or never sent in the first place). Parents may believe that education is wasted on a girl whose destiny is to marry and leave home.\n\nThat leaves them open to persuasion that the opportunity to go away and gain life experience is in their daughter's best interests. Girls – especially those with disabilities or from ethnic minorities or certain castes – are therefore particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.\n\nA 2001 estimate suggested that 12,000 girls are trafficked from Nepal to India annually for prostitution, a horror highlighted in the book and movie Sold.\n\nThis number took no account of any other trafficking from or within Nepal. Current estimates put the annual total at around 20,000.\n\nVulnerability amplified\n\nIt's easy to see how a natural disaster can amplify the conditions that enable and attract traffickers. The immediate disruption of state and civil society institutions, particularly schools, means the usual child protection systems aren't in place. Regulatory mechanisms and border controls are also in chaos.\n\nUnder the cover of rescue efforts, traffickers (often women) can pose as religious leaders, relief workers or representatives of government-accredited employment agencies promising jobs. Sometimes these tricks are mere opportunism, but sometimes they are the well-organized work of national and transnational criminal groups.\n\nPHOTO: Handout/Getty Images South America/Getty Images A mother shelters her children from the sun in a tent city in the commune of Cite Soleil after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010.\n\nThe people they exploit are extremely vulnerable. With family breadwinners killed or injured, land and livelihoods destroyed and food and shelter hard to come by, people are more inclined than ever to take desperate actions.\n\nChildren separated from their families may be believed missing or dead. The assumption, genuine or otherwise, that a child is an orphan makes them especially vulnerable. Sadly some families even send their children to orphanages because they can't afford to care for them.\n\nThese orphans may be trafficked directly or otherwise subjected to illegal adoption, sold to well-intentioned families from richer nations.\n\nThis typical story from Nepal tells of seven children who have disappeared from a small village. Their parents believed they were sending them to a Buddhist monastery in India:\n\nWe had to lie to police so that my son could leave the village with the Lamas, said a parent of one of the children. We are happy because the Lamas had promised to educate my son and send him home after three years.\n\nNone of these children have been heard of since their departure shortly after the quakes, and their location remains unknown.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nLess than two months after the Nepal quakes, UNICEF reported that 245 children had been intercepted and saved from trafficking. That number has shocking implications for how many might not have been so lucky. Dr Tshering Lama of ChildReach Nepal recently estimated that hundreds if not thousands of children will have been trafficked as a direct result of conditions caused by the earthquakes.\n\nIn the direct aftermath, UNICEF worked in collaboration with the Nepali government on a range of responsive and preventative measures, and with civil society and a number of national and international NGOs to prioritize getting children back into school as quickly as possible.\n\nA fundamental strategy to fighting child trafficking in Nepal is to keep children in schools, protecting their right to education and a safe environment.\n\nCampaigns such as Taught Not Trafficked, working in partnership with survivors' group Shakti Samuha, promote crucial awareness and have been providing education, shelter, legal aid, vocational training and counseling before, during and after the period of the quakes.\n\nBut more than that, it's essential that child trafficking everywhere is not treated as a symptom of crisis during times of natural disasters.\n\nIt must be recognized as a scourge that requires coordinated international action, including advocacy and awareness integrated across all programs that work with vulnerable children and their families and communities. In this way, agencies will be prepared to respond quickly and effectively when – not if – the next disaster strikes.
(CNN) A Jewish shopkeeper standing proudly outside his store, a wry smile on his face and an Iron Cross pinned to his lapel.\n\nJust a meter away is a Nazi guard.\n\nIt is an notorious image of the Nazi era, replicated in museums and institutions across Germany.\n\nUntil now little was known about the man photographed outside his Cologne bedding store on April 1, 1933 -- the day the Nazis launched a boycott of Jewish businesses.\n\nThe boycott saw guards stand outside Jewish shops in a bid to deter customers from entering. Many stores were subsequently vandalized.\n\nAs many countries around the world commemorate Holocaust Memorial Day on Monday, the incredible story of one Jewish shopkeeper, whose defiant picture has been shown around the globe, has been uncovered by researchers at genealogy site MyHeritage\n\nHis name was Richard Stern.\n\nIf you look closely it seems the Nazi party agent feels uncomfortable, Eike Stegen, a historian at the House of the Wannsee Conference, told CNN.\n\nYou realize that he is wearing a fantasy uniform -- he has never been to war, while the soldier in the picture is the Jewish German who is proudly showing his Iron Cross.\n\nThe power is with the soldier from the First World War.\n\nThe Iron Cross, once a military decoration, was considered a top honor in Germany during both world wars.\n\nStern's fight against his oppressors went even further than this image. He would later receive another award for his outstanding military contribution -- this time from the US army in World War II.\n\nRichard Stern earned the prestigious Iron Cross for his distinguished service during World War I.\n\nThe photo of defiance\n\nResearchers at MyHeritage uncovered a wealth of information about the German Jew who earned the prestigious Iron Cross for his distinguished service during World War I.\n\nThey sifted through hundreds of online documents to uncover his incredible story.\n\nResearcher Nitay Elboym told CNN that he and his team became interested in the 1933 photo after seeing the image online and learning that it hangs in the House of the Wannsee Conference, at which the Nazis devised the Final Solution, which the Nazis used to describe their genocide of Jews in Europe.\n\nIt's his body language that got our attention, Elboym said. Not only is he standing there with the Iron Cross on, but the look on his face says 'I was a German hero in World War One, I'm wearing the medal that you gave me, so how dare you do this?'\n\nJack Romberg, a Florida-based rabbi, is the grandson of Stern's sister Martha.\n\nThe eldest of three brothers, Romberg recalls his quiet relative with affection. Now retired, the 65-year-old is writing a book about his great uncle, whom he says was more like his grandfather.\n\nRomberg was able to shed light on the 1933 photo, which is also on display at Berlin's Jewish Museum as well as the city's German Historical Museum, the NS Documentation Center in Cologne and the nearby Roonstrasse Synagogue.\n\nAt Wannsee and the Jewish Museum in Berlin, the picture is displayed alongside a pamphlet written by Stern.\n\nJUST WATCHED Drone video shows scale of Auschwitz camp Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Drone video shows scale of Auschwitz camp 01:12\n\nAccording to Romberg, Stern's brother-in-law Heinz Flögerhöver produced the leaflets in his print shop next door, distributed them to passers-by and took the photo. The shop was forced to close following Kristallnacht in 1938. This rampage of state-sponsored violence by the Nazi regime against Jewish communities caused widespread looting and destruction of Jewish properties across Germany and Austria.\n\nAddressed to all front comrades and Germans, the document states that Hitler and the Nazis repeatedly declared: Anyone insulting a combat veteran is punishable by imprisonment!\n\nStern said in the pamphlet that he had enlisted as a teenager and served during World War I.\n\nHis brother and father also served. Taking a stand against the boycott, he wrote: Has the German Jew become a second class human, only tolerated as a guest in his fatherland?\n\nWe see this action against German Judaism as an insult to the memory of 12,000 German combat soldiers of the Jewish faith killed in action.\n\nIn 2012, Romberg visited the Jewish Museum in Berlin and was taken aback by what he saw.\n\nTheir version of the photo is huge and the picture of the leaflet is very close. I stood there and I couldn't stop staring at it even though the same picture hangs in my office. I couldn't say anything -- it was unbelievable.\n\nOn his most recent visit to Germany in September, Romberg met with archivists at the various museums and institutions.\n\nThey were shocked that they'd met a living relative of Richard Stern -- it blew them away, he said.\n\nStegen told CNN that Stern's image features in the House of the Wannsee Conference's permanent exhibition, The Meeting at Wannsee and the Murder of the European Jews.\n\nThat is why we portray Richard Stern. He does not 'simply' suffer from persecution, he is not merely a victim of discrimination, hatred, racism, but he acts, Stegen said.\n\nTwo World War medals, given either side of the Atlantic\n\nRecords unearthed by MyHeritage show that Stern left Germany and arrived at Ellis Island, New York, aged 40 in May 1939 -- just four months before war broke out. It stated that the first person he met up with in the US was his brother-in-law Ludwig Walker.\n\nThe research carried out by MyHeritage did not uncover a wife or children. Romberg explained that the reason was because in 1927 Stern had promised his dying father that he would look after his sister Martha, whose marriage had broken down, and her son Rudolf.\n\nStern became the boy's legal guardian and worked to guarantee their safe passage to America, together with his own. But problems with Martha's paperwork delayed their escape until the very end of August -- just days before war broke out.\n\nA census the following year revealed that Stern was working as a bus boy and lived in Queens with two of his sisters, Walker, a niece and a nephew.\n\nOn October 13, 1942 -- less than a year after America joined the war -- Stern enlisted in the US army.\n\nThen on October 13, 1942 -- less than a year after America joined the war -- Stern enlisted in the US army.\n\nHe was aged 43 and still not a citizen.\n\nScott Daubert, director of the National Infantry Museum in Columbus, Georgia, told CNN that a German national being recruited by the US at the time would have been quite rare but that soldiers were sometimes recruited for their language skills.\n\nBeing a non-citizen and German would have certainly raised an eyebrow or two, but there would have been many questions early on in the training stage to gauge loyalty, Daubert said.\n\nIn 1944 Stern was awarded the Silver Star, which is the third-highest military combat decoration that can be awarded to a member of the US armed forces.\n\nMyHeritage researchers discovered a newspaper clipping from July 6, 1944, detailing Stern's service in Italy.\n\nThe Long Island Star-Journal reported: The victim of German brutality, 45-year-old Sergeant Richard F. Stern, earned the Silver Star for gallantry in action during an assault Jan. 7 on the slopes of Mount Porchio when in the face of heavy enemy fire he addressed the Germans in their own tongue and demanded that they surrender, convincing them they were hopelessly outnumbered.\n\nToday, the medal holds pride of place in Romberg's home, alongside a treasure trove of documents and letters from Stern.\n\nWhen I was about seven my dad told me the story of Uncle Richard and what he did in World War II, so that summer I went running in to the house and said 'Uncle Richard can I see the Silver Star?' It was in a box at the bottom of a drawer in a back bedroom, Romberg told CNN.\n\nThe Iron Cross, however, is missing.\n\nRomberg told CNN: In 1942 the USA were collecting metal to melt down and make into ammunition.\n\nSo Uncle Richard turned it in to create bullets to shoot the Nazis. He made it very clear in January 1942 that he had to enter the US army. He was 43 but determined to do it.\n\nMonday, January 27, 2020 marks the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp.

Despite Biden's hopes for a bipartisan deal , a process is underway that would allow Democrats to pass the bill through the Senate with just 51 votes. The House is on track to pass their portion of the proposal as soon as next week. But the bill could face a tougher time in the Senate.

MUST WATCH New Capitol riot video shows extreme levels of coordination 01:48\n\nNew audio and video recordings from the January 6 insurrection on Capitol Hill offer even more insight into how some rioters had little fear of police as they launched a large, coordinated attack. The footage also highlights the restraint of police at the scene, and suggests the riot could have been deadlier had officers acted more aggressively. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced plans for a commission to investigate the riot, similar to the one that examined the 9/11 terror attacks. But some of the extremists who entered the Capitol that day are carrying on as before. As the FBI investigates members of the extremist, anti-government Oath Keepers, the group's leader might even be emboldened .

At the height of the pandemic last year, the British had one of the highest national death tolls in the world. Now, thanks to an early series of big bets on then-unproven vaccines, as well as its centralized National Health Service, the UK has the third-highest vaccination rate in the world -- behind only Israel and the UAE. That's especially good news, as more evidence suggests that the coronavirus variant first identified in the UK is linked to more severe disease . The UK's success comes as new research from Israel finds that the Pfizer-Biotech vaccine appears to reduce symptomatic coronavirus infections by more than 90%. Elsewhere in the world, the rollout hasn't gone as smoothly: Peru's foreign minister resigned r ecently after being outraged that government officials had been vaccinated even before the country started offering doses to health care workers.\n\n4.

(Health.com) -- Lana, a 38 year-old publicist in Los Angeles, California, was diagnosed with genital herpes in 1997.\n\nSince then, she has kind of been hiding from the dating scene.\n\nLet's face it: How do you drop that bomb on a potential love interest? And when?\n\nShe considered a number of online dating venues, but she says Match.com asked too many questions on its enrollment form, eHarmony was too religious, and MySpace was too much of a hookup zone.\n\nI wanted to meet men with my same diagnosis so we wouldn't [need to] have 'the talk,' or fear of rejection and transmitting, she says. Most of us with this don't wish to spread it.\n\nDespite -- or perhaps because of -- the economic downturn, the billion-dollar online dating industry has been booming. But not everyone has felt welcome at the party.\n\nWhile sites like Match.com and eHarmony don't discriminate, they also don't cater to people like Lana who are coping with sexually transmitted diseases, disabilities, or mental health conditions. All of these can make dating -- often an ego-shattering minefield for those in perfect health -- even trickier.\n\nOn bigger dating sites the competition is tremendous, says Jim Houran, PhD, a clinical psychologist and columnist for Online Dating Magazine. And let's face it, depending on what [the illness] is, it could very well make you uncompetitive in the larger dating pool.\n\nHealth.com: 28 days to a healthier relationship\n\nFortunately, there are a number of alternatives. A new breed of dating sites has emerged to play cupid for people with chronic diseases and disabilities.\n\nOver the past five years, several sites -- such as Prescription4love.com, Nolongerlonely.com, and Cisforcupid.com -- have launched to serve the needs of people with conditions ranging from bipolar disorder to Crohn's disease. Together these sites now boast tens of thousands of members.\n\nIn addition to providing their users with a more hospitable environment, these websites defuse the tension over how and when to disclose an illness, which is often an issue for people with diseases and disabilities who venture onto mainstream dating sites.\n\nWhen health problems equal heartache\n\nAfter some horrible results on other dating websites, Lana joined Prescription 4 Love and the STD-specific site Positivesingles.com.\n\nBoth sites require members to disclose their illnesses upfront, clearing the air for what might be a deal-breaking revelation later. Within her first week on Positive Singles, she went on three dates and has since gone on seven more, which fostered one romantic relationship and a friendship over the past two years. She's even rejected a couple dozen guys.\n\nHealth.com: How to tell your partner a health secret\n\nI don't think I would have been able to have 10 dates without the site, says Lana. It's easier to get rejected via email, and you can take baby steps online without hunting outside.\n\nThough Prescription 4 Love didn't yield any dates for Lana, this fast-growing online community offers an alternative to mainstream dating sites for thousands of singles.\n\nNow three years old, the site currently has 8,000 members who represent nearly 40 health conditions ranging from genital herpes (2,425 members) to Tourette's syndrome (32 members).\n\nRicky Durham founded Prescription 4 Love in 2006, inspired by his late brother Keith, who lived with Crohn's disease for 15 years before passing away in 2004.\n\nHe was a good-looking boy, and he could find dates, but when do you tell someone you have a colostomy bag? The night you go out? Two weeks after you go out? Durham asks. He was having a hard time with that, so I thought if he could find someone who had the same disease, or someone with a colostomy bag, he wouldn't really have to discuss that.\n\nSince launching the site, Durham, 48, who previously dabbled in the stock market and worked as a bartender, was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Though he doesn't find it appropriate to be a member of a community he founded, he says he can empathize with his members.\n\nIt's nice to find someone who's going through what you're going through, he says.\n\nLove for less\n\nNiche sites are also a lot less expensive. Prescription 4 Love, which started charging in May 2009, is $9.95 per month, while most of the features on No Longer Lonely (including the dating service and chat rooms) are still free.\n\n(Access to the site's full features is available for $24 per year. That's substantially cheaper than sites like Match.com and eHarmony, which can cost upwards of $35 per month.)\n\nTo me, that's pressure right there, says Robert Watson, the executive director of the nonprofit dating service DateAble.org, which caters primarily to those with physical and mild psychiatric handicaps. If it's the 30th day of the month, you're thinking, 'I've got one more day to find someone or it's another $35.'\n\nDateAble, which was founded in 1987 by a Washington, D.C., doctor who wanted to give her patients a way to combat the isolation that accompanied their physical disabilities, charges a $125 initiation fee for the first year and $25 every year thereafter.\n\nFor that fee, members get a more personalized experience, as DateAble is more akin to an old-school matchmaking service. The organization has been responsible for almost 1,000 marriages, according to Watson. As one of its first members, he should know: He met his wife, Lynn, at a DateAble Valentine's Day party in 1988.\n\nI didn't want to try it, says Watson, who has moderate cerebral palsy and was working as a national project director for the United Cerebral Palsy Association at the time. But I probably knew everybody in my community and nobody I knew wanted to date me or vice versa. Lynn lived 60 miles away, but we made it work.\n\nBy pushing a friends first concept, which has been emulated in the communal blog and forum features of Prescription 4 Love, No Longer Lonely, and other illness-specific sites, DateAble members can get up to speed on the dating world in a familiar environment without the prying eyes of the Web.\n\nPeople with disabilities, especially developmental disabilities, are typically behind the eight ball because they haven't had the practice of dating in college or their young adult life, says Watson. Many of them never had the puppy love, been broken up with, experienced the fights, or the good stuff.\n\nTo make up for this lost time, his best bit of advice is to be totally honest. Even in our post-Americans With Disabilities Act society, notes Watson, failing to mention that you're confined to a wheelchair or dealing with another type of handicap might bring a first date to an abrupt end after a courtesy I'm sorry drink.\n\nThe stigma of mental illness\n\nPeople with physical disabilities aren't the only ones who face stigma while dating. People with mental health problems, from chronic depression to schizophrenia, have also benefited from specialized sites.\n\nJim Leftwich, 39, a college librarian from White Plains, New York, has lived with schizoaffective disorder, a condition that combines features of schizophrenia and mood disorders (such as depression), since 1992. In 2004, after years of brushing up against the harsh realities of the dating scene, Leftwich founded No Longer Lonely, a dating site that caters to the mentally ill.\n\nI thought to myself, 'There should be something like this out there,' and I was surprised to find there wasn't, says Leftwich. If you're mentally ill, it's kind of a hostile world out there. I thought by taking down that whole bugaboo of having an illness, making it all open with everyone knowing, it would facilitate things. People would be more trusting and relationships might be more successful.\n\nNo Longer Lonely now has 16,000 members and a brand new interface (similar to those of social-networking sites) that allows users to upload poems, art, videos, and blogs. The site has been responsible for more than 20 marriages.\n\nI find with my clientele, they're more willing to get to know someone remotely and they're more open, he says. They don't have the same kind of prejudices that people in general tend to have.\n\nEven though most mental illnesses can be controlled with medication, therapy, or a combination of the two, some people still view conditions such as bipolar disorder as a mark of weakness or instability.\n\nEven in today's enlightened society, where acceptance and diversity are hailed as the right thing to do...mentally ill people tend to be outcasts. It's terrible, says Houran, who is also a former instructor of clinical psychiatry at the Southern Illinois School of Medicine.\n\nThe minute someone knows you have a certain mental disorder, they assume it means that you're not capable of love, or that you're dangerous or unstable. Those are myths. Given the right care, people with mental illnesses and other medical conditions can lead very normal, functioning lives.\n\nSome mental illnesses -- certain mood or personality disorders, for instance -- could cause problems in fledgling relationships, Houran acknowledges. And especially if the relationship progresses to thoughts of marriage and kids, two partners who each have bipolar disorder, for example, could find themselves debating whether it's safe or wise to have children.\n\nHowever, says Houran, in most cases these considerations aren't enough to forestall a relationship. Even under the best of circumstances, people still have major relationship challenges, he says.\n\nFor Houran, this outgrowth of illness-specific dating sites and services is a boon. Niche sites are growing in popularity because they allow people with these very specific needs or interests to connect in a way that's not possible on the big dating sites, he says.\n\nThe big dating sites are akin to Wal-Mart. You have a lot of quantity, but that doesn't mean you're going to find people with a lot quality in the way you define it. That being said, niche sites by their very construction tend to be very small. So I always advocate [that] people use both.\n\nCopyright Health Magazine 2011

(Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nRihanna claims her father and his business partner fraudulently used her name to make money and she's suing them over it.\n\nThe singer alleges that her father, Ronald Fenty, and his partner, Moses Perkins, falsely represented their company's affiliation with her.\n\nAlthough Mr. Fenty is Rihanna's father, he does not have, and never has had, authority to act on Rihanna's behalf, nor has he ever been authorized to use her name, intellectual property or publicity rights, the suit obtained by CNN reads. Similarly, neither Mr. Perkins nor the Company has any affiliation whatsoever with Rihanna.\n\nThe pair launched Fenty Entertainment, a production and talent company, in 2017.\n\nRihanna's popular Fenty Beauty line of cosmetics also launched in 2017.

As awful as he was to my mom at times, it didn't compare to how great he was as a father.\n\nCNN has reached out to Rihanna, Fenty and Perkins for comment.

(CNN) —\n\nHome is where the heart is…and where we currently spend the vast majority of our time. In addition to navigating an ongoing global pandemic, the winter is also a time when hibernation is normal. However, endless hours spent underneath the same roof and the same four walls can make anyone grow weary and, at times, bored.\n\nThat's why it's essential to fill your space with life's essential ingredient: happiness. Of course, joy looks and feels differently to every human. (After all, Marie Kondo taught us this years ago.) However, there are some universal ways to interject calm, color and bliss into your abode.\n\nBy chatting with a plethora of experts, from life coaches and home organizers to nutritionists, doctors and therapists, we've gathered the ultimate ways to make your home a place you want to be — and, hopefully, a spot that stimulates your mood and optimism.\n\nDisplay your fruits and vegetables\n\nFor Kati Carrapa, a professional organizer, life coach and pastor, happiness comes through aliveness. The most straightforward (and easy!) way to invite color and life into your kitchen is through displaying your fruits and vegetables. Stay simple with standard red apples or lemons, or go bolder with pineapple, dragon fruit or persimmon.\n\nThe colors are all up to you. If you long for exotic fruits and tastes, then go for it, she suggests. [If] you think you need more grounding energy, then go for kale, purple cabbage and carrots. She recommends trying various color combinations to see which ones make you the happiest, and taste the best too.\n\nTry these: Simple Houseware 2-Tier Countertop Fruit Basket ($21.87, originally $27.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Simple Houseware 2-Tier Countertop Fruit Basket\n\nThreshold 2-Tier Gold-Plated Wire Basket ($25; target.com)\n\nPHOTO: Target Threshold 2-Tier Gold-Plated Wire Basket\n\nLight candles in scents you enjoy\n\nOf all of our senses, scent is the one that brings us back to a rose-colored memory the fastest. Maybe it's the smell of the ocean that reminds you of a childhood by the shore or a flower from your wedding bouquet. Whatever it is, create a morning, midday or evening ritual with candles that make you smile, suggests Tia Graham, the founder and chief happiness officer at Arrive at Happy.\n\nCandles can bring back positive memories and emotions. And certain candles have aromatherapy and can alleviate stress and anxiety, she continues. Explore various notes to discover the best mix for you.\n\nTry these: Fimiss Scented Candles Gift Set ($19.99, originally $29.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Fimiss Scented Candles Gift Set\n\nHomesick Beach Cottage Candle ($34; homesick.com)\n\nPHOTO: Homesick Homesick Beach Cottage Candle\n\nMake storage options easy and accessible\n\nCluttered spaces can make us instantly feel anxious or overwhelmed. But even when we see the mess, we can sometimes feel paralyzed to pick it up. How come? According to Pia Thompson, home organizer and owner of Sweet Digs, we consider the easiest place from which to retrieve something instead of the easiest place to return something to. That's why having accessible, comfortable and beautiful storage options will improve the happy factor of any room.\n\nChoose a spot where you usually use the item that is near to similar items and that isn't buried under something else, Thompson continues. Consider this shift in perspective when you are choosing a home for your items, and you will soon see your clutter disappear.\n\nTry this: TheWarmHome Decorative Basket ($16.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon TheWarmHome Decorative Basket\n\nAlways have fresh flowers\n\nAs backed by research, flowers are proven to create joy, improve empathy and make people happier, says Kristina Libby, an artist with the Floral Heart Project. This can be cut stems that you put in your home, flowering plants that you put in multiple rooms or a small garden that you grow outside or on your windowsill, she suggests.\n\nHowever, if you're a fan of gardens, go bigger and add floral wallpaper or hang floral-related art. I am particularly fond of florals in unexpected places: teacups, the riser to a staircase, in a bathroom or a small vase by your bed, she adds.\n\nTry these: Opalhouse Canary Floral Peel & Stick Wallpaper ($34; target.com)\n\nPHOTO: Target Opalhouse Canary Floral Peel & Stick Wallpaper\n\n1-800-Flowers Sunflower Bouquet (starting at $44.99; 1800flowers.com)\n\nPHOTO: 1-800-Flowers 1-800-Flowers Sunflower Bouquet\n\nBromeliad Aechmea Pink ($65; bloomscape.com)\n\nPHOTO: Bloomscape Bromeliad Aechmea Pink\n\nInvest in a quality mirror in low-sun areas\n\nYou may not realize it, but a mirror is an excellent way to direct the natural flow of sunshine in your space. As shamanic practitioner and coach John Moore explains, sunlight impacts our mind, body and spirit. If you do not have a ton of natural vitamin D from outside, he suggests adding mirrors where there aren't windows to open the space.\n\nTry this: CoolXuan Round Hanging Mirror ($30.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon CoolXuan Round Hanging Mirror\n\nCreate a sleep sanctuary\n\nWhile not everyone thinks about their bedroom's health, it can play a crucial role in creating a happy home, according to Elizabeth O'Connor Cole, a well-being educator and founder of Salveo Lifestyle. The place where you lay your head each night should feel like a calm, inviting sanctuary that instantly provides relaxation and Zen. She recommends decluttering, allowing in the fresh air, creating amber lights and investing in high-quality mattresses and bedding.\n\nDitch synthetic pajamas, sheets and pillowcases and upgrade to organic cotton or natural silk, she adds.\n\nTry these: Beckham Hotel Collection Gel Pillows, 2-Pack ($39.99, originally $79.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Beckham Hotel Collection Gel Pillows, 2-Pack\n\nParachute Linen Sheet Set (starting at $149; parachutehome.com)\n\nPHOTO: Parachute Parachute Linen Sheet Set\n\nWashable Silk Tee Set ($198; lunya.co)\n\nPHOTO: Lunya Washable Silk Tee Set\n\nReserve time to bond with loved ones\n\nOne of the most significant contributions to your mental state inside your home is who you share it with. And while you may find the very sound of your partner chewing or your child's singing to be annoying on month 10,000 of lockdown, it's still essential to set aside time for intentional bonding, says author and neuroscientist Dr. Caroline Leaf.\n\nAs humans, we are made for deep, meaningful connection. When we feel connected and part of a community, we boost our mental resilience and toughness, as well as our mood, she explains. Meaningful socialization helps us feel happy and at peace within ourselves, balancing the energy in the brain and helping us build up our cognitive resilience.\n\nWhether you whip up a meal together, play board games or host a movie viewing evening, reserve the time on your calendar so you make it a priority.\n\nTry these: Czech Games Codenames ($14.88, originally $19.95; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Czech Games Codenames\n\nDr. J Professional HI-04 Mini Projector ($89.99, originally $99.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Dr. J Professional HI-04 Mini Projector\n\nPlace crystals strategically around your home\n\nYou may or may not subscribe to New Age ways of thinking, but if there's a chance a small purchase could make you feel more grounded and positive, wouldn't it be worth the shot? According to licensed psychologist Dr. Sarah Schewitz, there is much value in having a token or a totem representing a state of mind you would like to achieve. Whether this totem has actual spiritual properties or not, it's more about the mindset it evokes in you, she says.\n\nFor example, amethyst and rainbow fluorite are both beautiful stones that add a nice decorative flair to your home and are known to create a sense of calm. Alternatively, Schewitz says that adding a crystal to your home office or bedroom nightstand is a nice decorative touch and serves as a reminder of the state of mind you're trying to create when in that area of your home.\n\nTry this: Zatny Premium Healing Crystals Kit ($39.74; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Zatny Premium Healing Crystals Kit\n\nCarve out space for fitness\n\nWe know, we know… You miss the gym and your in-person fitness classes. While there will be a day — hopefully soon! — when we can all gather together to work up a sweat, it's still vital to keep exercise as part of your daily routine now. As certified life coach Adam Jablin puts it, the natural endorphins and serotonin from working out produce feelings of happiness, well-being and confidence. That feel-good energy can be poured into your job, relationships, friendships and self-care practice. If there's a piece of equipment, such as dumbbells, an exercise bar or a bike, that you've been delaying buying, here's your nudge to go for it.\n\nTry these: Tribe Resistance Bands Set Bundled With Loop Bands ($35.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Tribe Resistance Bands Set Bundled With Loop Bands\n\nAmazon Basics Rubber-Encased Hex Dumbbell (starting at $22.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Amazon Basics Rubber-Encased Hex Dumbbell\n\nAdd pops of color\n\nKathryn Goetzke, the chief mood officer of The Mood Factory, says that splashes of yellow in a room can pick up your spirit since we innately associate this color with happiness. If a sunshine-gold color isn't your cup of tea, find an eccentric removable wallpaper to add to an accent wall, suggests Allison Chawla, a licensed psychotherapist, certified life coach and healer.\n\nPick a bathroom and turn the stripe nook into a rainforest with some bright green leaves. Throw a splash of color or some smiling sloths up to remind you that it is a good time to slow down, she continues. Decor, similarly to fashion these days, has quite an 'anything goes' vibe going. And, hey, if it makes you happy, then go for it.\n\nTry these: Opalhouse Tropical Peel & Stick Wallpaper Green ($34; target.com)\n\nPHOTO: Target Opalhouse Tropical Peel & Stick Wallpaper Green\n\nOpalhouse Monkey Play Peel & Stick Wallpaper ($34; target.com)\n\nPHOTO: Target Opalhouse Monkey Play Peel & Stick Wallpaper\n\nAlign your home with your goals\n\nBelieve it or not, your home could help you stick to those New Year's resolutions or overall goals you have for your life. But you have to set up your space for success. To begin, make a list of your current aspirations and then assess how your home helps — or hinders — you from achieving these dreams, suggests Rebecca West, the author of Happy Starts at Home. If you want to write a novel, you should have a designed writing corner. If you're trying to improve your health, remove tempting snacks and make it simple to meal plan.\n\nThis kind of exercise can help you understand the why behind your projects and make sure that you are spending your energy and money wisely as you make changes to your home, she adds.\n\nTry this: Rifle Paper Co.

In fact, Cole says these were often seen as a gift from the gods. There is a good reason for this, as baths are not only cleansing, but they also provide a wonderful combination of comfort, calm and happiness, she explains.\n\nYour bathroom itself can be upgraded with cozy goodies, like a towel warmer, an oil diffuser or a plush bathmat. You can modernize your bubble bath from childhood by investing in salts, oils, dried flowers or even a sage-burning ritual to clear away the negative energy. Light the end of the stick and fan the flame until it's smoking. Wave the sage stick over the bath and around you, Cole suggests. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths before you soak.\n\nTry these: Zadro Ultra-Large Luxury Bucket-Style Towel Warmer ($139.99;bamazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Zadro Ultra-Large Luxury Bucket-Style Towel Warmer\n\nInnoGear Essential Oil Diffuser ($13.59, originally $15.99;bamazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon InnoGear Essential Oil Diffuser\n\nMake sure you like the stuff you use every day\n\nThis may sound obvious, but Schewitz says many people compromise and buy furniture or decorations they aren't very excited about because it saves them a little bit of money. Furniture and home decor items are something you will use and look at daily. Looking at and using items you love sparks joy and gives you a happier experience in your home, she says.\n\nThe same goes with your kitchen goods: Make them fun and colorful so you'll be excited to use them.\n\nTry this: The Pioneer Woman Vintage Floral 12-Piece Dinnerware Set ($49.97, originally $58.10; walmart.com)\n\nPHOTO: Walmart The Pioneer Woman Vintage Floral 12-Piece Dinnerware Set\n\nKeep the music flowing\n\nThough some people enjoy a quiet home, others need a soundtrack to carry them throughout their day. According to Chawla, the right type of music can boost your mood and makes you feel nostalgic, focused or relaxed, helping keep your spirit high. Music soothes the soul, encourages focus, increases libido, warms our hearts — you name it, she explains.

Probably when one flickered out and it needed to be replaced, right? Lighting impacts our mood, and those fluorescent bulbs can be overpowering and intense. That's why Dr. Steven McGough, the director of research and development at Women and Couples Wellness, LLC, suggests omitting daylight bulbs from your house. As he explains, they can confuse your circadian rhythm if you use them after 4 p.m. and into the evening.\n\nInstead, he recommends soft white bulbs (2,700 to 3,000 kelvin) in your bedroom. If possible, have it so you can switch to soft white in your home in the afternoon, he suggests, since this will help mimic how the light changes outside later in the day.

Editor's Note: Rafia Zakaria is the author of The Upstairs Wife: An Intimate History of Pakistan (Beacon 2015) and Veil (Bloomsbury 2017). She is a columnist for Dawn newspaper in Pakistan and The Baffler. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe first time I fell in love, it was from a distance. I was a teenager, and Pakistan, where I lived at the time, had only just emerged from nearly a decade and a half of martial law and Islamization, in which the general in charge had imposed rules based on his definition of Islam.\n\nI had recently and very fleetingly heard of a thing called Valentine's Day and its associations with romantic love. Regardless, I hoped on February 14, 1990, like many still do today, for a miracle. In the particular case, I wanted the boy I was in love with, a gangly character (whom I had never seen any closer than from across the street) to call me on the telephone.\n\nPHOTO: Jeremy Hogan Rafia Zakaria\n\nNot surprisingly, that boy I longed for from across the way never reciprocated. He had probably never heard of Valentine's Day or more likely of me, despite all my doleful staring. As a middle-class Pakistani girl from a conservative family, I was not allowed to speak to boys, let alone fall in love with them. I didn't let this keep me from either, pursuing both love and forbidden conversations with boys with great resourcefulness and assiduity.\n\nI fell in love with the boy who dropped his telephone number in my lap through the open car window while my mother was not looking. I fell in love with a boy whom I beat in a debate competition and the boy who called several evenings in a row demanding to speak to a different Bollywood character each time. Some reciprocated my feelings; most had little clue about Valentine's Day unless I told them.\n\nOf course, they also did not really know me. Falling in love in those pre-Instagram, pre-cell phone days was understood as a mysterious matter, where facts and the onerous getting to know each other played little part. Some of this was understandable. Where marriage was a matter of careful arrangement, love had to be left wild and chaotic, without being hemmed in by the constraints of data or some similar bubble-bursting encumbrance.\n\nThings have changed in Pakistan. Not only is Valentine's Day a pretty big deal now – there are specials at florists and displays at stationery shops and tinsel-wrapped candy everywhere – the encroachment of the semi-arranged marriage, on the realm between love and arranged marriage, seems to have altered the path and pattern of both. These semi-arranged marriages, particularly popular among the growing urban middle class, seek to add a little of love's mystery to the once standard arranged marriage, whose closely chaperoned interactions leave little room for romance and where the two being wed do not know each other at all.\n\nIn the semi-arranged marriage, there may be room for a few solo coffee dates. And the newly paired duo can announce to their friends that they are in love, while their parents can insist that the match was entirely arranged. In other words, parents can find possible spouses who meet a certain combined checklist of qualities identified by both the bride or groom-to-be and the parents. Veto power, however, lies with the young couple.\n\nAdded volume to the Valentine's Day business comes from the virtual realm that has made most everything including love and/or marriage a competitive sport. Cheaply available cell phones are everywhere in Pakistan, and nearly all are equipped with social media, such that everyone can see the presents that those in love are bestowing on one another.\n\nIn addition, celebrating Valentine's Day gives the upwardly mobile urban couple's love the legitimacy of individual choice – with roses, chocolates and jewelry adding a bit of luster to the worn and antiquated patina of an arranged marriage. If the celebration is attended to with some gusto, even an entirely arranged match can be passed off as one in which the parties fell in love without any machinations of their aunt or uncle or the neighbor lady-turned-matchmaker who lives three doors down.\n\nEven in rural Pakistan, where marriages are still generally arranged and love is a separate realm, Valentine's Day is now a known, if not openly, celebrated quantity. Where trysts between lovers can be arranged via the ubiquitous cell phone, any excuse to meet in the sugarcane field – including Valentine's Day – is used. Men and women who may have to endure spouses chosen by mothers, fathers and the village council, one theory goes, are especially entitled to a bit of fun on the side.\n\nLove in Pakistan may seem like a tale from a very distant elsewhere, but one could argue that the slightly waning popularity of Valentine's Day here (or at least the cynicism that hangs over some) is for reasons remarkably similar, if reverse, from those seen in Pakistan.\n\nWhile Pakistanis may have moved from the arranged to the semi-arranged sort of marriage, Americans have moved from the love by accidental chance or serendipity to a more calculated – if not algorithmic-driven – sort of love. In the data-driven, virtually-infused and forever-impatient realm of finding a partner, social media and the internet provide a ton of information faster than the spark of attraction.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nFor those actively and intentionally looking for love, a dizzying array of apps, many with the ability to match a staggering set of data points – looks, income, language, location – can help with pairing with far greater precision than the most enterprising set of Pakistani parents. In some, bucket lists and credit reports can be exchanged even before the trouble of a first meeting. Why waste a couple of hours when artificial intelligence can tally up the possibility of true love using hundreds of variables? Mystery is the enemy here and data is the friend; love is made (like Valentine's Day) utterly predictable.\n\nIn Pakistan, the United States and likely anywhere on our data-driven globe, the role of Valentine's Day is changing. In the West, marketing departments of dating apps can rely on the fact that many more will sign up for their love-on-demand services on or around that day. In Pakistan, even those betrothed who have spoken barely a sentence to each other will send cards, flowers and chocolates.\n\nIn different ways, love is a status symbol, a badge of desirability. And Valentine's Day is a perfect showcase to make sure that everyone in the virtual audience knows it.

(CNN) Having already aired director Ava DuVernay's documentary 13th, about the legacy of the 13th Amendment, Netflix ups the ante by devoting a six-part series to the 14th with Amend: The Fight for America. It's an ambitious project that mixes various techniques, stars and historians to enliven the history and connect it to the present, with its most conspicuous weakness being the contributions of host and producer Will Smith.\n\nEnacted in 1868, the 14th Amendment has become one of the most-litigated amendments in US history. Its key provisions , promising equal protection for all persons, have proven remarkably elastic, becoming the foundation not only for civil rights but women's rights, marriage equality (both involving mixed-race and gay couples) and immigrants.\n\nAmend employs multiple methods in bringing that history to life and powerfully connecting it to the battles of the 21st century, with the rise of extremist forces rooted in white supremacy. Those narrative wrinkles include animation and dramatic readings, with a gaudy list of actors like Mahershala Ali and Samuel L. Jackson presenting the words of Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King Jr., respectively.\n\nThe early episodes take a deep dive into Reconstruction, the rise of Ku Klux Klan and the Jim Crow era installing a form of legal apartheid, as NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund president Sherrilyn Ifill notes.\n\nThe timeliest material charts a direct path from the racial backlash then into the heart of modern politics, detailing the importance of the Supreme Court in codifying (and later overturning) discrimination, the use of home-grown American terrorism against African-Americans and the extent to which violence was used to mount a political counter-revolution against Reconstruction, as historian David Blight explains.\n\nRead More
London (CNN) Britain's royal family was facing a once-in-a-generation crisis on Monday after Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, rocked the institution with a litany of devastating allegations in their eagerly awaited interview with Oprah Winfrey.\n\nOver the course of the two-hour special , the couple -- who despite their royal split still sit five relatives away from the throne -- painted a picture of a family so stubbornly rooted in its ways that it left a young, bi-racial couple alone to fend off racist abuse and their own troubled mental health, forcing them into silence and ultimately leaving them with no option but to flee the palace's clutches.\n\nMeghan said she was so isolated and lonely while working as a royal that she contemplated suicide , telling Winfrey she just didn't want to be alive anymore. The couple were intensely critical of the way the institution treated them, and Meghan revealed a staggering allegation of racism from a member of the clan that threatens to throw its reputation into crisis.\n\nHarry meanwhile admitted his relationships with his father and heir to the throne, Prince Charles , and his brother, Prince William , have come under severe strain in recent years, and suggested the institution may have planted stories in the media that cast him and Meghan in a negative light.\n\n'I just didn't want to be alive anymore'\n\nThe palace faced storms on multiple fronts by sunrise in London on Monday.\n\nThe interview had been relentlessly previewed in the media over recent days, drawing comparisons with a royal tell-all given by Harry's mother, Princess Diana , in 1995, which shed light on the breakdown of her marriage to Charles.\n\nBut the revelations in Sunday's broadcast may have dwarfed even those in magnitude, as Harry and Meghan's scorched-earth confessional posed problem after problem for palace staffers and senior royals.\n\nPerhaps the most pertinent was Meghan's allegation that an unnamed family member had asked about Archie's skin color and what that would mean or look like. She said those discussions were relayed to her from Harry.\n\nHarry declined to name the family member but said he was a bit shocked by the conversation. Winfrey said on CBS on Monday morning that it was not his grandmother nor his grandfather that were part of those conversations. In Britain, the shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said Buckingham Palace should launch an investigation.\n\nPalace officials are also scrambling to respond to claims from both Duke and Duchess that their pleas for help with their mental wellbeing and security were ignored by the institution.\n\nFighting back tears at one point, Meghan said her thoughts of suicide were incredibly difficult to bear, and she was reticent to share them with her husband. But I knew that if I didn't say it, that I would do it -- and I just didn't want to be alive anymore, she said.\n\nHarry , whose mother Diana was killed when he was a boy, said he was terrified by his wife's admission. The prince, who is sixth in line to the throne, said there is a culture of suffering in silence in the royal family. But Meghan's race and the abuse she endured made the situation even more difficult for the couple, and their perceived lack of support ultimately led, above all other factors, to their dramatic decision to quit as working royals in January 2020.\n\nHow to get help: In the US, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world.\n\nThey described in emotional detail the most difficult moments -- Meghan revealing her thoughts to Harry hours before they were due to go to an event; the Prince arriving home from work each day to find his wife crying while breastfeeding their newborn -- and said a lack of support and lack of understanding were the reasons they chose to step away.\n\nMeghan said the situation was exacerbated by often racist and outdated, colonial undertones that repeatedly appeared in coverage of the couple in Britain's notoriously vitriolic tabloids . Both described a toxic blend of press intrusion, bitterness on social media and isolation from a support structure.\n\nHarry added that he pushed the issue with the royal family. He told Winfrey he believed there were many opportunities for the palace to show some public support in the face of continued racial abuse in the press, yet no one from my family ever said anything. That hurts.\n\nI regret believing them when they said I would be protected, Meghan told Winfrey.\n\nCNN has reached out to the royal family for comment.\n\nHarry reveals serious rifts in the family\n\nIf there was even the faintest suggestion that Harry and Meghan could someday rejoin the royal family's mission, Sunday's broadcast likely extinguished it for good. The interview laid bare the depths of division between the pair and the rest of the family, a chasm that would have been unimaginable when they married in Windsor just three years ago.\n\nThey told Winfrey that the family had been welcoming towards Meghan at first, and that when they married, they were committed to their roles.\n\nBut things quickly changed. Harry told Winfrey his relationship with his father Charles reached the point where the heir to the throne stopped taking his calls, so angered by the pair's decision to leave as working royals in 2020. There's a lot to work through there, Harry said. I feel really let down, because he's been through something similar -- he knows what pain feels like.\n\nOn his brother, William -- with whom Harry grew up, and whose shared childhood was meticulously followed by the media -- the Prince implied that communication is virtually non-existent. We're on different paths, he said, adding that the relationship is space at the moment, and that time heals all things -- hopefully.\n\nPerhaps the only silver lining for the family is that its leader survived the interview relatively unscathed. Harry and Meghan both spoke effusively of the Queen, describing her as caring and kind from the beginning.\n\nMy grandmother and I have a really good relationship, and an understanding and I have a deep respect for her, Harry said. Meghan said she has spoken to her frequently in the past year, including on the day that Prince Philip was admitted to hospital last month.\n\nMeghan added that despite the ordeal, it was important to differentiate the royal family from the people running the institution.\n\nShe discussed rumors of a dispute with Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. Meghan said reports she made Kate cry over the dresses of flower girls at her wedding were untrue, and it was in fact the Duchess of Sussex who cried. But there was no confrontation, Meghan said, describing her sister-in-law as a good person.\n\nBut the evidently strained family dynamic will overshadow the royals' upcoming engagements. No statements have yet been issued by any of their communications teams in the wake of the interview.\n\nMeghan and Harry (right) with the Queen, Prince Charles and other royals in 2019. During their Oprah interview, Harry detailed a breakdown in relationships with several of his senior relatives.\n\nBreathless reaction in Britain\n\nAs the hours ticked by and the dust from the broadcast settled on Monday, Buckingham Palace remained silent. But the British media leapt to cover the fallout, with some newspapers publishing extra early editions overnight in order to feature the interview on their front pages.\n\nAs has so often been the case with the couple, coverage ranged from the measured to the hysterical. The Daily Mail ran a headline reading Kate Made Me Cry on its 2 a.m. edition, before leading on Meghan's accusation of racism later in the morning. The tabloid's website also included a prominent banner that read: I WANTED TO KILL MYSELF.\n\nThe Sun featured a new nickname for Meghan amid her rift with the royal family: Megxile, and the Daily Express dismissed the broadcast as a self-serving TV chat with Oprah.\n\nA selection of front pages in the UK on Monday.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, several journalists used Boris Johnson's press conference on Covid-19 to ask for his thoughts on the Oprah interview. The Prime Minister declined to weigh in, aside from saying he'd always had the highest admiration for the Queen and the unifying role that she plays in our country.\n\nThe media's treatment of the royal couple formed a significant part of the interview, with the pair both taking aim at sections of the press.\n\nHarry said the palace is in fear of its media coverage, meaning they had little freedom while part of the family.\n\nTo simplify it, it's a case of if you as a family member are willing to wine, dine and give full access to these reporters, then you will get better press, Harry said. There is a level of control by fear that has existed for generations.\n\nThe interview was broadcast in Britain at 9 p.m. Monday, with terrestrial broadcaster ITV winning the race to acquire rights. But its main talking points were already being dissected in detail by Brits and in the media long before its UK airing.\n\nCharles Anson, a former press secretary to the Queen, said on Monday the couple raised issues that need to be looked at carefully, but claimed to the BBC that there wasn't a strand of racism within the royal household.\n\nBut Julie Montagu, Viscountess Hinchingbrooke, told the BBC that their revelations were astounding, and that as an American woman who married into British aristocracy, she could relate to Meghan's descriptions. You don't really know until you're in it, and I think that she made that very well known last night in her interview, she said.\n\nCNN will soon launch Royal News, a weekly newsletter bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what's happening behind palace walls.

(CNN) The brother of the stepfather of two missing Idaho children released a statement asking for him to come forward and cooperate with police.\n\nChad Daybell and his wife Lori Vallow, the children's mother, left the state. Vallow has refused to cooperate with authorities, police said in a statement on December 30. The children, Joshua JJ Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 17, have not been seen or heard from since September\n\nDaybell's brother, Matt Daybell, said in a statement to CNN affiliate East Idaho News Friday that he has not been close to Chad Daybell since they were children.\n\nMy immediate family has had little association with Chad the last many years due to our concerns with his religious claims and particular books he had chosen to publish, including his own, Matt Daybell's statement read. I plead again for Chad to come forward and cooperate with the investigation so that this very difficult situation might be resolved.\n\nMatt Daybell said in a statement Friday he has neither seen nor directly spoken to his brother since the memorial of Chad Daybell's previous wife in October.\n\nRelatives of missing kids offer $20,000 reward\n\nJJ's biological grandparents, Kay and Larry Woodcock of Louisiana, held a news conference last week in Idaho to offer a $20,000 reward for information on the whereabouts of JJ or Tylee Ryan.\n\nKay Woodcock made a public plea to their mother.\n\nPlease, just let us know where the kids are, she said. It's not difficult. It will end all this, as far as the kids are concerned.\n\nKay and Larry Woodcock are offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of their grandson, Joshua JJ Vallow, and his sister, Tylee Ryan.\n\nThe children's disappearance is part of a complex past 12 months for the family -- a time frame in which police have investigated two deaths, one of which authorities say still is under investigation.\n\nPolice determined the children were missing in late November -- four months after Lori Vallow's estranged husband was shot dead in their former home state, Arizona, and shortly after Vallow moved with the children to Idaho and remarried.\n\nVallow's estranged husband was shot and killed in July during a fight with Vallow's brother. According to a petition for dissolution of marriage filed in February , Vallow's former husband said Vallow recently become infatuated and at times obsessive about near death experiences and spiritual visions.\n\nPolice conducted a welfare check for JJ -- Vallow's adopted son with her late husband -- on November 26 at their home in Rexburg, Idaho, after relatives raised concern about not hearing from him since September.\n\nDuring the welfare check, both Vallow and her new husband, Chad Daybell, told investigators the boy was staying with a family friend in Arizona, police said.\n\nBut police determined that he wasn't staying with a family friend. When police returned November 27 to execute a search warrant, investigators determined Daybell and Vallow had fled the home, and also didn't appear to have taken JJ with them, according to authorities.\n\nInvestigators learned that Tylee hadn't been seen since September, though she'd most recently lived with Vallow and JJ in Rexburg.\n\nPolice investigate whether the disappearances are connected to a woman's death\n\nThe case is complicated further by the death of Daybell's previous wife, Tammy Daybell, in Idaho in October. Her death initially was believed to be natural, but Rexburg police announced last month that it was suspicious, and her remains were exhumed.\n\nDaybell and Vallow married a few weeks after Tammy Daybell's death, police say.\n\nRexburg police have said they're investigating whether that death and the kids' disappearances are connected.\n\nInvestigators don't believe the children are with Lori Vallow, but they think she knows where they are or what happened to them, Rexburg police said.\n\nAn attorney for the family, Sean Bartholick, released a statement to East Idaho News on December 23 saying that while he is in contact with Vallow and her husband, Chad Daybell, he does not have information about the children. CNN has made multiple attempts to reach Bartholick but has not received a response.\n\nLinks to a religious content website\n\nChad Daybell had connections to a website called Preparing a People, a religious content provider that describes itself as as series of lecture events focusing on self-reliance and personal preparation, featuring several Latter-Day Saints speakers.\n\nPublishers of the site, Michael and Nancy James, released a statement December 26 emphasizing that while Daybell, and to a lesser extent Vallow, were featured in the series, neither was an owner or a founder.\n\nMichael and Nancy James said they decided to pull content featuring either Daybell or Vallow in light of Tammy Daybell's death and the disappearance of the children.
(CNN) The World Bank has postponed its decision on granting Tanzania a $500 million loan, following pressure from activists who oppose the country's policy of banning pregnant girls and young mothers from attending state school.\n\nThe bank's executive board was meant to meet on Tuesday to consider the loan, but the meeting was postponed after one member requested a delay on Monday, a source at the bank told CNN.\n\nSources did not say why the meeting was postponed. However, the request to delay came in after the bank held a last-minute emergency meeting with Tanzanian activists and international human rights organizations earlier on Monday.\n\nLast week, Tanzanian civil society groups sent a letter, seen by CNN, to the executive board urging them to stop the loan until the country passes a law that guarantees the rights of pregnant girls to attend regular secondary schools and ends mandatory pregnancy tests.\n\nCNN visited three Tanzanian schools in 2018 where girls from grades eight and up were given compulsory pregnancy tests\n\nRead More
