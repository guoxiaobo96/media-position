(LifeWire) -- Fifty years ago this Saturday, Laika -- a sweet-tempered stray plucked off the streets of Moscow -- was thrust into the global spotlight when she became the first living creature sent into space.\n\nA Newfoundland, like this champion named Josh, saved the life of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nWhen Sputnik 2's canine passenger (nicknamed Muttnik by the media) hit orbit, the Soviet Union grabbed the edge over the U.S. in the space race, a crux of competition during the Cold War.\n\nSadly, Laika's history-making voyage ended prematurely: In their rush to be first, Soviet scientists had made no provisions for her safe return.\n\nShe died before reaching orbit, and before any real data was gleaned about sustaining life in that environment, says Dr. Stanley Coren, professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia and author of The Pawprints of History: Dogs and the Course of Human Events.\n\nBut if little scientific knowledge was gleaned from Laika's journey, her mark on world events is undeniable. We were behind the Russians, says Coren. The U.S. quickly switched focus to putting a living being on the moon.\n\nLaika is just one of the many canines to have left a furry legacy behind. Coren names 10 other dogs and the roles they played in history.\n\nNos. 1 and 2. Strelka and Belka's successful orbit\n\nLaika was the first dog sent into space, but Strelka (Little Arrow) and Belka (Squirrel) -- launched on Sputnik 5 in 1960 for a one-day mission -- were the first to return alive. As a result, much more was learned from their mission. Strelka later gave birth to a litter of puppies, one of which, Pushinka, was given to President John F. Kennedy's daughter, Caroline.\n\nNo. 3. How Peritas saved civilization\n\nWithout his dog, Peritas, Alexander the Great might have been Alexander the So-So. When the warrior was swarmed by the troops of Persia's Darius III, Peritas leapt and bit the lip of an elephant charging his master. Alexander lived to pursue his famed conquest, forging the empire underlying Western civilization as we know it.\n\nNo. 4. Charlie, Kennedy's Cuban Missile Crisis companion\n\nAt the height of 1962's Cuban missile crisis, President Kennedy had his son's Welsh terrier Charlie summoned to the chaotic War Room. The president held the terrier in his lap, petting him and appearing, by all accounts, to relax. Eventually he announced that he was ready to make some decisions -- those that de-escalated the conflict.\n\nNo. 5. Jofi, the first therapy dog\n\nSigmund Freud usually kept a chow named Jofi in his office during psychotherapy sessions, believing the dog comforted the patients. Freud's notes on these interactions, detailed in his diaries, form the basis of modern-day pet-assisted therapy. Dog returned to fire victims »\n\nNo. 6. Urian bites Pope, separates church and state\n\nHenry VIII sent Cardinal Wolsey to meet with Pope Clement VII, hoping the pontiff would grant the ruler an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. When the pope extended his bare toe to be kissed (as was the custom) by Wolsey, the Cardinal's dog, Urian, sprang forward and bit the pope. Clement flew into a rage, the divorce was off and Henry -- to ensure the annulment the Catholic Church refused to grant -- later established the Church of England.\n\nNo. 7. Newfoundland saves Napoleon\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte owed his life to a nameless Newfoundland. As Bonaparte fled the island of Elba in 1815, where he was exiled, choppy seas pitched him overboard. A fisherman's dog jumped in after the drowning despot and kept him afloat. Napoleon lived to experience his own defeat at the Battle of Waterloo.\n\nNo. 8. Nixon professes love for Checkers\n\nIn his 1952 Checkers speech, Richard Nixon -- then a candidate for vice president who was accused of pawing $18,000 in illegal campaign contributions -- admitted to accepting an American cocker spaniel, Checkers, as a gift.\n\nAnd you know, the kids, like all kids, loved the dog, and I just want to say this, right now, that regardless of what they say about it, we are going to keep it, Nixon said during his famous speech.\n\nHis heartfelt proclamation swayed public opinion and prolonged Nixon's political career.\n\nNo. 9. Peps, Wagner's harshest critic\n\nWithout Peps, composer Richard Wagner's Cavalier King Charles spaniel, that helicopter scene in the film Apocalypse Now (scored to The Ride of the Valkyries) might sound very different. Wagner would have Peps sit on a special chair as he played his latest compositions and, based upon the dog's reactions, he'd keep or toss each passage.\n\nNo. 10. Donnchadh and the American Revolution\n\nIn 1306, when Edward I of England sought to bring down Robert the Bruce (and his ploy to rule Scotland), his men used Robert's own dog, Donnchadh, to find him.\n\nThough the animal led them to their target, he then turned and defended his master, who lived to become king of Scotland and produce a daughter who married into the Stuart family. Many generations later, the irrational actions of Robert the Bruce's direct descendant, King George III, would cause the American colonists to rebel.\n\nModern medicine attributes King George's apparent madness to porphyria, a genetically transmitted disease that researchers trace back to the Scottish Stuarts.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nIt's been a difficult week in Britain. The Brexit mess deepened, the auto industry shed more jobs, and both major political parties saw significant splits, as liberal centrists within them left to form a new group.\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy of Kate Maltby Kate Maltby\n\nYet hope is on the horizon. At long last, we have a true queen, acclaimed in Britain, with a shot at global domination. She's not Elizabeth Windsor; she's not even Meghan Markle. I'm talking, of course, about Olivia Colman, winner of last week's Best Actress BAFTA and up for Best Actress in a Leading Role this Sunday at the Oscars.\n\nMany American readers will never have heard of Colman before this Oscar season. But in the UK, she is beloved. You'll have a good sense of why if you watch her nominated turn in Yorgos Lanthimos' The Favourite, as a miserable, miscarriage-riven Queen Anne, shifting from one intense relationship, with Rachel Weisz's Sarah Churchill, who dominates her with a possessive love, to Emma Stone's Abigail Hill, who cynically flatters her.\n\nThis version of Queen Anne is chronically insecure; she's also addicted to hot chocolate and capable of childlike glee (Oh, it is fun to be queen sometimes!, she squeaks, as she officiates over a spontaneous and advantageous midnight marriage for Abigail, much as you or I might preside over an impromptu midnight feast). In other words, she's what any of us might become, were we just a bit more indulged.\n\nColman has made a career out of playing unattractive characters in unattractive worlds. That includes in the physical sense – which is not to say she's physically unattractive, but she's refreshingly unbothered about finding her best angles or taking roles with glam makeover budgets. Many of her roles have explored, subtly and lightly, the relationship between women's bodies, our social status, and our well-being.\n\nIn The Favourite, Anne may hold the political power of a monarch, but inhabiting a disabled and obese frame, she is enthralled by the slimmer, athletic bodies of Sarah and Abigail. Being queen can't stop her physical insecurities. I heard the word fat! Fat and ugly, she weeps at one point. (Anne, no one but me would dare and I did not, replies Weisz's ever-poised Sarah.)\n\nIn the cult sitcom Peep Show, Colman played Sophie, first a love interest and then a frequent target for mockery by the two show's male leads, Mark and Jeremy. She arrived in the show's first episode as Mark's unobtainable office crush, well-made up and charming. As the seasons continued, she was revealed to be lazy, gratingly tactless and increasingly embittered, as her relationship with Mark rose and fell through the highs of consummation, a plateau of toleration born of mutual desperation and eventually to the post-divorce lows of recriminatory co-parenting.\n\nAnd so her physical appearance deteriorated too. Her blonde highlights disappeared, her clothes became baggier, even her front teeth seemed to become more prominent, as Colman shifted the character's posture. And yet, like most of us, all she wanted was to be loved.\n\nBecause at the heart of Colman's characters, there is always a deep vulnerability. British audiences laughed at Sophie's awfulness throughout Peep Show, but when Mark tried to leave her on their wedding day, our hearts bled for her and we despised him.\n\n(Broadchurch spoiler alert coming up.) We wept for Colman too, in the TV mini-series Broadchurch, when she played a tough policewoman who finds that her husband is the child-killer she's been hunting. (David Tennant played her cop colleague.) Her characters very rarely get a fair deal out of life. Even, as in The Favourite, when they are queens. Yet they're always oddly likeable. That's one reason we love her.\n\nColman's career bloomed later than some: she was just shy of 30 when she took on her supporting role in Peep Show. That may be why we Brits still like to root for her as an underdog, although nowadays she's clearly not: last year the Radio Times named her the most powerful person in British TV. Next year, she cements that status by taking over Claire Foy's role in Netflix' The Crown. If you're watching, expect to see that trademark vulnerability, matched with the shrewdest of observational humor about the British class system.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nProbably, Colman's British fans will be disappointed on Oscar night. Glenn Close is a strong favorite with the bookies, and as primarily a UK TV actress, Colman doesn't have the track record of work within Hollywood to guarantee name recognition among the Academy's industry voters.\n\nBut here in Britain, we'll be cheering like mad for a national treasure. Come on Hollywood, take pity on our Brexit-plagued island, and give us this win.

A judge on Monday told Baldwin he must remain in drug rehabilitation for at least the next three months and not get arrested again for a year. If at the end of one year you have stayed out of trouble, stayed drug free, the record will be sealed, the judge said. Baldwin had earlier pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct charges.\n\nWillis\n\nNEW YORK (CNN) -- In the latest issue of George magazine, actor Bruce Willis makes some interesting comments on religion and politics. Willis, whose movie Armageddon releases July 1, says modern religion is the end trail of mythology. But there are people who interpret the Bible literally. Literally! Willis is quoted as saying. I choose not to believe that's the way. And that's what makes America cool, you know? Willis also reveals that he switched from Democrat to Republican in 1992, but didn't vote in the 1996 election because he considered the Republican candidate, Bob Dole, a nitwit.\n\nLOS ANGELES (CNN) -- The city of Los Angeles welcomed back the Grammys on Tuesday as the awards show announced it is moving back from New York after a spat with organizers and the mayor of the Big Apple.

The two remain close friends, but need to split to tend to their individual careers, it said.
Washington (CNN) -- Martin Ginsburg, husband of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, has died of cancer at age 78.\n\nA statement from the Supreme Court said Ginsburg died Sunday at his Washington home, due to complications from metastatic cancer. The court said a private ceremony will be held at Arlington National Cemetery, but no date was given.\n\nGinsburg, known as Marty to his friends and family, was the outgoing, jovial opposite of his soft-spoken, diminutive wife, but the couple maintained a strong, happy marriage over 56 years.\n\nTheir wedding anniversary was four days ago. The Supreme Court will wrap up its work for the term Monday, and recess for the summer. Justice Ginsburg was on the bench as recently as Thursday as rulings were announced.\n\nUntil his recent illness, Ginsburg worked as a lawyer at the Washington law firm Fried Frank, and as a professor at Georgetown Law Center.\n\nHe was constant presence at his wife's side at many social and court-related events. Ginsburg was known inside the court for cooking meals for the justices, their families, and for his wife's law clerks, a skill he picked up when discovering his wife possessed few culinary talents. That became a running joke in the family, and one which the justice regaled audiences with over the years, somewhat sheepishly.\n\nProfessor Ginsburg is a regular contributor to the lighter side of life at the Supreme Court, said the justice in March 2009. Mainly he performs in the kitchen, for the quarterly spouses' lunches held at the Court and, occasionally in past years, at a dinner for the entire Court family -- justices, their spouses, and widows of former Court members. In the beginning, when I was the newest justice, my dear husband offered aid in lightening my load.\n\nRuth Ginsburg, who joined the Supreme Court in 1993, long credited her husband's open-mindedness for the success she has enjoyed in her legal, academic, and judicial career, especially at a time decades ago when women were encouraged to stay home and devote their energies to supporting their spouses.\n\nMartin David Ginsburg was born in 1932 and grew up in Long Island, New York. He met his future wife on a blind date at Cornell University, and they married in 1954. After he served a stint in the military, the couple both attended Harvard Law School. During his third year, Ginsburg developed a rare form of testicular cancer and underwent two surgeries. He credited his recovery in part to wife's ability to juggle caring for him, their young daughter, and their dual legal studies.\n\nHe later worked as a lawyer in New York and a professor at Columbia University's law school, where Ruth Ginsburg had transferred and graduated. Unlike her husband, the future justice was unable to find a job at her alma mater or any decent offers at a law firm, so she began teaching at Rutgers University, and developed a national reputation taking on gender discrimination cases.\n\nHe was known for quietly helping build and organize political support for his wife's appointments to those top government jobs. The justice has called her husband her best friend and biggest booster.\n\nA supportive husband who is willing to share duties and responsibilities is a must for any woman who hopes to combine marriage and a career, she recently told a forum on professional opportunities for female lawyers. \n\nThrough his friendship with billionaire businessman and onetime presidential candidate Ross Perot, a special position -- or chair in academic circles -- was created at Georgetown for the study of tax law, and named in Martin Ginsburg's honor.\n\nIt was less than successful, however, as the professor himself explained in his professional resume. In 1986, someone who probably prefers never to be identified endowed a Chair in Taxation in his name at Georgetown, wrote Ginsburg. No one appears willing to occupy the Ginsburg Chair, and it remains vacant, a fact he always laughed about.\n\nThe Ginsburgs had two children, Jane -- a professor at Columbia -- James, an independent record producer in Chicago, and four grandchildren.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden is not the right Democratic candidate for 2020. And yet, he may soon enter the Democratic race.\n\nThus far, what has been most remarkable is how diverse the field is shaping up to be. This is not your traditional slate of Democratic candidates. Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Peter Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang and several others are already up and running. And more are likely to follow.\n\nThe composition of the Democratic field represents the diversity of the country. With so many serious frontrunners who are not, for a change, older white men, the Democrats are showing that they are a party representing the future of the country. In contrast to the kind of rhetoric that has come from President Donald Trump, an ode to the whiteness and masculinity of a limited American political tradition, the Democrats are making a strong statement about what their party is all about.\n\nAnd their opening speeches reflect that reality as well. They have revolved around issues such as racial justice, gender equity, immigration rights and more. Even a candidate like Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is being tagged as the moderate with bipartisan appeal, proclaimed: Stop the fear-mongering and stop the hate. We may come from different places. We may pray in different ways. We may look different. And love different. But all live in the same country of shared dreams.\n\nThen comes Biden. The former vice president has every right to run and certainly has a great deal to offer. During his career in the Senate and in the White House, Biden was a strong champion of the middle class. He pushed for the kinds of policies that Trump, despite all his promises to the forgotten Americans, never pursued. As vice president, he headed the Middle Class Task Force, which championed policies such as capping student loan payments and improving retirement security. He was even ahead of President Barack Obama on the issue of same-sex marriage.\n\nAlso, as an older white male (who would be 78 years old in January 2021), there are a number of Democrats who see him as the safe choice, the only person who will be able to withstand the President's testosterone-filled campaign. And CNN polling shows that right now most believe he would do best in a matchup against the President.\n\nBut is Biden really the best answer for the party? There is good reason for Democrats to be skeptical and to consider supporting other candidates.\n\nMost problematic is the fact that Biden has run for the presidency several times, and each time he has struggled under the intense spotlight. When it comes time to hit the campaign trail, Biden has never been able to generate the level of support that is necessary to win. His tendency to make gaffes has also hurt him. And, in our frenzied news cycle with endless outlets and few filters on information, Biden's style will cause problems again.\n\nOf course, these issues didn't stop Trump in 2016. But unlike Trump, it is unclear that without a comparable partisan media outlet (Fox News) and unyielding partisan loyalty, that Biden would survive. While MSNBC could offer a boost to Biden, social scientists have shown that the conservative media has a much stronger hold on conservative viewers than liberal outlets. Conservatives also tend to be more ideologically homogenous and loyal than their counterparts on the left. In other words, Democrats have seen the challenges that the inevitable frontrunner faces, as the election actually takes shape.\n\nMore important, though, is the moment in which we are living. Trump has run a political operation from the White House that has revolved around a vision of white nationalism that challenges the values of pluralism, diversity and inclusion. His statement after Charlottesville forever marked his term in office. And the President's perpetual struggle to build a wall perfectly captures what he hopes to achieve – with his central goal being about keeping people out rather than bringing them in.\n\nWith so many strong candidates already lined up to run in the Democratic primaries, many of whom who have launched their runs with the kind of gravitas and excitement that bodes well for a presidential campaign, there is a risk of someone like Biden being in the race – someone with the potential to suck up all the oxygen in the room. Uncle Joe could quickly take away media attention and campaign funds from Democrats who would perform better in the general election. If Biden was the nominee, he would also throw cold water on the excitement and energy that exists among younger Democrats about the direction of their party.\n\nThe Democrats should not assume that an older, moderate white man is inevitably the strongest candidate. Even Bernie Sanders offers a fresh perspective with his left of center, Democratic Socialist positions (he would also be notable as a Jewish-American nominee). It is possible to see the virtue of a ticket that embodies diversity from the top down. All of the candidates who are currently running would enable the Democrats to showcase the difference in what the party represents compared to the GOP. As a new article in The New York Times shows, the GOP is bleeding young voters with each passing day of the Trump presidency.\n\nWith Biden at the top of the ticket, it would be much more difficult to generate enthusiasm among African-Americans, Latinos or younger voters, for instance, who will be looking to Democrats to prove that they will offer something fundamentally different. While there are early polls showing substantial numbers of African-Americans backing Biden and Sanders, these don't measure the excitement that might be generated on the campaign trail once the other candidates are better known and once their political skills have been proven.\n\nAnd Biden's pivotal role on the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act, which was foundational to the expansion of the mass incarceration system, will come back to haunt him. Like Hillary Clinton, he will have to reckon with his vote authorizing President George W. Bush to use military force in Iraq, baggage that the younger generation of Democrats won't be carrying onto the campaign trail.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nMeanwhile, many educated, suburban women are looking for a candidate who will take seriously the message of the #metoo movement. This is a social movement that has rocked American society, bringing attention to the horrendous ways in which sexism and sexual assault continue to play out in many of our major industries and in our private lives. They won't be happy to hear about his role in the 1991 Clarence Thomas hearings, where he was one of the many senators who did not take seriously the sexual harassment complaints of Anita Hill. He was part of the reason that 1992 saw a surge in female candidates.\n\nThe most successful Democrat in recent decades was Barack Obama, who mobilized a powerful electoral coalition because of the change he represented for the Democratic Party – not because he was the party's safe choice.\n\nOf course, Biden has a right to run – should he so choose. But before Democrats go overboard in shifting their financial and organizational resources, as well as endorsements, to the former vice president, they should think long and hard about whether they want the face of their party to be someone who represents the past – or the future.

(CNN) A planned UK tour by US evangelist Franklin Graham is in question after every venue booked by the preacher canceled planned appearances, following an outcry over his homophobic and Islamophobic comments.\n\nGraham -- the son of preacher Billy Graham -- has called Islam evil, attacked laws increasing rights for transgender people, and told his followers that the legalization of same-sex marriage was orchestrated by Satan\n\nNow, every venue booked by Graham as part of a lengthy summer tour of the UK has told him not to come.\n\nAn arena in Newcastle upon Tyne became the seventh and final venue to cancel his scheduled appearance on Wednesday. The move follows similar decisions by venues in other British cities, including Birmingham, Liverpool and Sheffield.\n\nGraham, one of the most high-profile speakers in the US, is the president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and an outspoken supporter of US President Donald Trump , whose election he believes was enabled by God.

Washington (CNN) Conservative attorney George Conway called Wednesday for a more thorough investigation in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump , telling CNN, this is a trial where they should want to hear the evidence.\n\nSpeaking with CNN's Jake Tapper, Conway argued that if everyone's so sure that the evidence will exonerate Trump, then the Republican-led Senate should hear from witnesses , including former national security adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nRepublicans have so far resisted such efforts, including the subpoenaing of documents, to which Conway said, There's no justification not to.\n\nSenators are obligated to hear all of the evidence, not some of it or none of it, Conway said.\n\nAnd if there's evidence that's not in the record already, they should be going out and allowing the subpoena to be issued in the name of the chief justice of the United States for that evidence. That's what a trial is. That's what this is supposed to be for.\n\nA Washington lawyer who was considered for multiple Justice Department posts early in Trump's tenure, Conway has emerged as a prominent critic of the President in spite of his marriage to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, one of Trump's closest aides.\n\nWhat are they afraid of? They're going to hear evidence that they don't like? They must be afraid of something, Conway told Tapper, referring to Republicans' refusals on witnesses and evidence. And that's the thing that I find most disturbing about it, is they don't want to hear the evidence because they know the truth. They know he's guilty. And they don't want to hear the evidence because they don't want the American people to see it too.\n\nConway said he believed House Democrats' impeachment managers were conducting themselves in a professional manner, unlike Trump's defense attorneys.\n\nThe managers were prepared, they were thoughtful, they were factual, they were logical, they were dignified, Conway said Wednesday. Trump's lawyers, on the other hand, were dissembling, distorting and even lying.\n\nHe added that by doing so, Trump's lawyers were being disrespectful of the American public.\n\nThe depth to which Trump's lawyers will go to make these deceptive arguments, I mean, they're treating the American public, they're treating the Senate like they're morons. It's just outrageous.\n\nConway added that the charges against Trump -- abuse of power and obstruction of Congress -- are much, much more serious than the perjury and obstruction of justice charges President Bill Clinton faced during his impeachment.\n\nClinton lied under oath, but it was in a civil case that had nothing to do with the powers of his office, said Conway, who played a role in bringing Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky to light and helped write legal briefs for Paula Jones' legal team.\n\nConway has become one of the most outspoken and notable critics of Trump's presidency. He was part of a group of political insiders opposed to Trump who last year launched a PAC aimed at thwarting the President's 2020 reelection chances and prevent his congressional enablers from winning reelection.\n\nConway recently donated to one of Trump's 2020 Republican challengers, former Illinois Rep.

The Brexit mess deepened, the auto industry shed more jobs, and both major political parties saw significant splits, as liberal centrists within them left to form a new group.\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy of Kate Maltby Kate Maltby\n\nYet hope is on the horizon. At long last, we have a true queen, acclaimed in Britain, with a shot at global domination. She's not Elizabeth Windsor; she's not even Meghan Markle. I'm talking, of course, about Olivia Colman, winner of last week's Best Actress BAFTA and up for Best Actress in a Leading Role this Sunday at the Oscars.\n\nMany American readers will never have heard of Colman before this Oscar season. But in the UK, she is beloved. You'll have a good sense of why if you watch her nominated turn in Yorgos Lanthimos' The Favourite, as a miserable, miscarriage-riven Queen Anne, shifting from one intense relationship, with Rachel Weisz's Sarah Churchill, who dominates her with a possessive love, to Emma Stone's Abigail Hill, who cynically flatters her.\n\nThis version of Queen Anne is chronically insecure; she's also addicted to hot chocolate and capable of childlike glee (Oh, it is fun to be queen sometimes!, she squeaks, as she officiates over a spontaneous and advantageous midnight marriage for Abigail, much as you or I might preside over an impromptu midnight feast). In other words, she's what any of us might become, were we just a bit more indulged.\n\nColman has made a career out of playing unattractive characters in unattractive worlds. That includes in the physical sense – which is not to say she's physically unattractive, but she's refreshingly unbothered about finding her best angles or taking roles with glam makeover budgets. Many of her roles have explored, subtly and lightly, the relationship between women's bodies, our social status, and our well-being.\n\nIn The Favourite, Anne may hold the political power of a monarch, but inhabiting a disabled and obese frame, she is enthralled by the slimmer, athletic bodies of Sarah and Abigail. Being queen can't stop her physical insecurities. I heard the word fat! Fat and ugly, she weeps at one point. (Anne, no one but me would dare and I did not, replies Weisz's ever-poised Sarah.)\n\nIn the cult sitcom Peep Show, Colman played Sophie, first a love interest and then a frequent target for mockery by the two show's male leads, Mark and Jeremy. She arrived in the show's first episode as Mark's unobtainable office crush, well-made up and charming. As the seasons continued, she was revealed to be lazy, gratingly tactless and increasingly embittered, as her relationship with Mark rose and fell through the highs of consummation, a plateau of toleration born of mutual desperation and eventually to the post-divorce lows of recriminatory co-parenting.\n\nAnd so her physical appearance deteriorated too. Her blonde highlights disappeared, her clothes became baggier, even her front teeth seemed to become more prominent, as Colman shifted the character's posture. And yet, like most of us, all she wanted was to be loved.\n\nBecause at the heart of Colman's characters, there is always a deep vulnerability. British audiences laughed at Sophie's awfulness throughout Peep Show, but when Mark tried to leave her on their wedding day, our hearts bled for her and we despised him.\n\n(Broadchurch spoiler alert coming up.) We wept for Colman too, in the TV mini-series Broadchurch, when she played a tough policewoman who finds that her husband is the child-killer she's been hunting. (David Tennant played her cop colleague.) Her characters very rarely get a fair deal out of life. Even, as in The Favourite, when they are queens. Yet they're always oddly likeable. That's one reason we love her.\n\nColman's career bloomed later than some: she was just shy of 30 when she took on her supporting role in Peep Show. That may be why we Brits still like to root for her as an underdog, although nowadays she's clearly not: last year the Radio Times named her the most powerful person in British TV. Next year, she cements that status by taking over Claire Foy's role in Netflix' The Crown. If you're watching, expect to see that trademark vulnerability, matched with the shrewdest of observational humor about the British class system.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nProbably, Colman's British fans will be disappointed on Oscar night. Glenn Close is a strong favorite with the bookies, and as primarily a UK TV actress, Colman doesn't have the track record of work within Hollywood to guarantee name recognition among the Academy's industry voters.\n\nBut here in Britain, we'll be cheering like mad for a national treasure. Come on Hollywood, take pity on our Brexit-plagued island, and give us this win.

The organization reversed its ban on gay Scouts in 2013 and four years later, the BSA opened up membership to transgender youth. While Tillerson has a reputation as a BSA reformer, he has been criticized by gay rights groups because, under his leadership, Exxon continued to resist calls to implement policies protecting LGBTQ employees from harassment.

Tillerson refuses to confirm or deny the allegation.\n\nMarch 13, 2018 - Is fired by Trump.\n\nDecember 7, 2018 - Tillerson calls Trump undisciplined during an interview with former CBS News' Bob Schieffer. When the President would say, 'Here's what I want to do and here's how I want to do it.' And I'd have to say to him, 'Well Mr. President, I understand what you want to do, but you can't do it that way. It violates the law. It violates treaty,' Tillerson says.\n\nMay 21, 2019 - Tillerson meets with Democratic chair Rep. Eliot Engel and ranking Republican Rep. Michael McCaul from the House Foreign Affairs Committee and their senior staff for an interview that focuses primarily on his time in the Trump administration.\n\nJanuary 11, 2021 - In a lengthy interview published in Foreign Policy, Tillerson paints a scathing picture of Trump as someone who made uninformed decisions that were not based in reality. His understanding of global events, his understanding of global history, his understanding of US history was really limited. It's really hard to have a conversation with someone who doesn't even understand the concept for why we're talking about this, Tillerson said in the interview conducted just prior to the US Capitol insurrection.

(CNN) —\n\nFormer first lady Laura Bush is a grandmother, a former librarian and a fierce fighter for women's rights. Nearly 10 years since she and her husband, former President George W. Bush, left the White House, Bush remains committed to the mission she began after 9/11: empowering women in Afghanistan. She and Afghan first lady Rula Ghani agreed to sit down with me in a rare interview in the Afghan Embassy in Washington.\n\nAfter our conversation of nearly an hour, part of which included three young Afghans, the two women traveled to Capitol Hill to urge lawmakers to continue their support for Afghanistan and its women. But it was clear their bond extends beyond that shared cause.\n\nFriends since 2015, the two women laughed and chatted warmly, traded ideas about Afghanistan, and finished sentences in unison. Beneath their poised and approachable exteriors, it was also clear that the former and current first ladies share a steely determination to make headway in the fight to improve the lives of Afghan women.\n\nFor Bush, the work started 16 years ago this month, when she took over her husband's weekly radio address – the first solo appearance by a first lady – to call attention to the oppression of women and children under the Taliban in the wake of the attacks of September 11, 2001. All these years later, Bush is still fighting for change.\n\nAfter September 11th, when the spotlight turned on Afghanistan, American women were shocked, really, at the plight of the life of women there, Bush told me. Women couldn't walk on the street alone and weren't allowed to be educated.\n\nAnd what you see when half of a population is left out, like it was then in Afghanistan, is a failed country, she said.\n\nNow, Ghani added, you start seeing women in government organizations, you start seeing them in the private sector … many more girls studying, so women are a little bit everywhere. There are more women in positions of power than at any other time in history, and more than 2.5 million girls in school, according to the UN.\n\nBut what's really important, Ghani said, is that they're not just being visible, they're also starting to speak up. Since the dark days of 2001, women have progressed tremendously.\n\nBush's work could be one factor in that progress. After making Afghan women a focus during her White House years, she and former President Bush established the Dallas-based Bush Institute, which includes the Afghan Women's Project. Mrs. Bush has used the Project to advocate for sustained US support for Afghan women and to spotlight their successes.\n\nShe has a fellow fighter in the Lebanese-born Ghani, who holds three university degrees, speaks five languages and is breaking barriers on her own terms.\n\nWhen President Ashraf Ghani gave his 2014 inaugural speech at the presidential palace, he choked up thanking his wife for her support and announced that she would take on a public role. That a male leader in Afghanistan would thank his spouse – let alone go on to promote her work and appear with her publicly – made news around the world.\n\nHe opened the door for me and I went through that door and this is what I'm doing in return, Ghani said. I'm opening the door for all these women.\n\nBut when she returned to Kabul in 2001, Ghani encountered a starkly different Afghanistan than the country she knew in the '70s.\n\nDisposable beings\n\nIt was very disturbing, she said. I was used to seeing very strong women. Some of them stayed home, some of them worked outside the home, but they were very respected. And what really annoyed me the most is the lack of respect towards women. It's as if they had become disposable beings.\n\nBoth Bush and Ghani repeatedly returned to one theme. You'd be surprised at how strong Afghans are, how strong Afghan women and men are, Bush said, comparing them to Texans: Strong, with a big, sort of unforgiving … terrain, country, that builds strong people.\n\nThe former first lady's first exposure to Afghanistan came in sixth grade. We each made a country report and my country report was Afghanistan, she said, as she and Ghani laughed. I just picked a country that seemed the most remote and interesting country. I never expected to visit Afghanistan or really hear about it again.\n\nAlong the way, she learned that Afghanistan has a rich, long and fascinating heritage.\n\nGhani leaned in. I think what Mrs. Bush pointed out is that it's not a country without a history, it's a country with … And here the two women seamlessly finished the sentence together: a very long history.\n\nPerhaps with that in mind, Bush told Ghani that, it would be great if Afghanistan could become a tourism place, once its more secure. For now, it remains the site of the United States' longest running war.\n\nTheir obvious camaraderie can only help the work Bush and Ghani do as honorary co-chairs of the US-Afghan Women's Council, which works to support Afghan women and girl's education, healthcare, economic empowerment and leadership.\n\nOn her own, Bush has made four trips to Afghanistan, helped produce the George W. Bush Institute book, We are Afghan Women: Voices of Hope, and helped launch the American University of Afghanistan, which opened its doors in 2006.\n\nOnaba Payab was the first female valedictorian to graduate from that university.\n\nAs she and two other young Afghan women joined our conversation, Bush and Ghani greeted them warmly, with Bush calling out, how are you, darlin'?\n\nPayab, Manizha Wafeq and Manizha Naderi – a Fulbright scholar, the head of the Afghanistan Women Chamber of Commerce, and the executive director of a non-profit serving women – are three examples of what Afghan women can achieve today. But it's not just about women helping women. Men are just as important in this fight, the young women said.\n\nChange is coming\n\nIn the context of a society like Afghanistan, it's very important to have the support of a male [family] member, Wafeq said. We really need their support in order to move forward and progress, and I'm very happy that that attitudinal change is coming and we have witnessed it.\n\nWafeq credits her father with making sure she got an education and supporting her when she got her first job at age 16, surrounded by men. It was very tough, the harassment, she said. My father was the one who kept telling me that, 'you can do it.'\n\nPayab, the valedictorian, says the stigma once attached to educating girls is going away, but the thing is that it takes time.\n\nThere are still huge hurdles, to be sure. About 14,000 US troops remain in Afghanistan, alongside 6,000 foreign troops. Despite efforts by the NATO-led coalition, the Taliban remains a threat. This year it has been steadily gaining territory, fueled by cash earned from opium and heroin production. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that opium trade doubled in 2016 from the year before, to about $3 billion – about 16% of Afghanistan's GDP.\n\nWomen and girls in Afghanistan continue to face persistent discrimination, violence, street harassment, forced and child marriage, severe restrictions on working and studying outside the home, and limited access to justice, the UN says. And according to a Global Rights study, 87% of women in Afghanistan experience physical, sexual or psychological violence during their lifetime, with 62% experiencing multiple forms.\n\nManizha Naderi came to the US as a refugee when she was young – but as she got older, she wanted to go home and help women deal with those stresses. She now serves as the executive director of Women for Afghan Women, where the majority of women seeking shelter come.\n\nAfghanistan was reborn in 2002, Naderi said. But she cautions that, you can't build a country in 15 or 16 years. We need a generation, if not more.\n\nI was so overwhelmed by the strength of these young women – I've never been to Afghanistan, but maybe one day, in the not-too-distant future, I'll have a chance to see more examples of this resilience at work.\n\nAs we wrapped up, I turned to Mrs. Bush with a question that I just had to ask. You've been listening to all of this and you've talked about the resilience of Afghan women, I said. Where do you think this resilience comes from?\n\nI think it's just a basic strength that women and men have, she said. And fortunately, they've been able to use that, now that things have changed in Afghanistan.\n\nCNN's Nicole Gaouette contributed to this report.

Washington (CNN) Right before Pete Buttigieg ended his presidential campaign Sunday night, his husband, Chasten, told the story of how it began.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, my husband came home from work and told me, well, he asked me, 'What do you think about running for president?' And I laughed. Not at him but at life, a visibly emotional Chasten Buttigieg told a group of supporters gathered in South Bend, Indiana. Because life gave me some interesting experiences on my way to find Pete.\n\nHe continued, After falling in love with Pete, Pete got me to believe in myself again. And I told Pete to run because I knew there were other kids sitting out there in this country who needed to believe in themselves too.\n\nChasten Buttigieg is often private about how he came out, but he recalled in an interview with The Washington Post in 2019 how his family reacted poorly to him informing them he was gay, including one of his brothers saying, No brother of mine. Buttigieg said that he felt like he couldn't stay at his home after the experience and slept both at a few friends' houses and in his car in the parking lot of the community college he attended.\n\nHe eventually made up with his family and his mother asked him to come back home. And when the Buttigiegs were married, Chasten said his parents walked him down the aisle.\n\nRead More

(CNN) When Patricia Dowd passed away last February, no one knew it was from Covid-19.\n\nShe was 57 and very active, her brother said. Dowd had come down with flu-like symptoms but didn't qualify for a Covid-19 test because they were scarce and restricted at the time\n\nMonths later, a tissue sample and testing helped confirm her death was caused by Covid-19 -- marking the first known Covid-19 death in the US.\n\nIn the one year since, more than 450,000 other families have suffered the shock and devastation of losing a loved one to coronavirus. Here are some of their stories:\n\nAn ER doctor saved lives and the mental health of colleagues\n\nDr. Frank Gabrin, 60, was the first known emergency physician to die of Covid-19 in the US.\n\nAs two-time cancer survivor, Dr. Frank Gabrin devoted his career to saving others -- even if it meant risking his life.\n\nIn March, as coronavirus spread rapidly in the Northeast, many doctors and nurses said they were terrified of working with insufficient personal protective equipment\n\nGabrin, who worked in New Jersey and New York, told friends he was worried , too. But he kept working, fueled by a lifelong passion for helping others.\n\nMarch 24, 2020 Covid-19 has killed 1,000 people in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University\n\nHe described his own battles with emotional exhaustion in the high-stress field.\n\nI fell victim to compassion fatigue, which went untreated and blossomed into full-blown professional burnout, Gabrin wrote.\n\nI now believe that compassion fatigue is a misnomer and that the real name for this condition should be empathetic overload, Gabrin said.\n\nI also believe that compassion fatigue and burnout need never occur, and if they do, there is a clear path back to solid emotional health. I believe that I have found the path that will quickly bring us all back from burnout and I am extremely passionate about sharing what I have learned with all of you.\n\nJUST WATCHED Dr. Frank Gabrin died in his husband's arms before help could arrive.

The doctor died in his husband's arms before help could arrive.\n\nGabrin became the first known emergency physician to die of Covid-19 in the US.\n\nHis death marked a profound loss for both patients and colleagues in the medical field, wrote Dr. Robert Suter , president of the American College of Osteopathic Emergency Physicians.\n\nHe was a shining example of selfless professionalism, an advocate for physician wellness, and a champion of treating patients with compassion and empathy, Suter said.\n\nA couple married for 71 years died 2 days apart\n\nIt was love at first sight when Daniel and Valerie Zane met on a blind date more than 70 years ago, their daughter said.\n\nDaniel Zane was a World War II veteran who ran across an open field under enemy fire to give first aid to a fellow soldier.\n\nThat's who he was, his family said: a man of steadfast bravery in the face of terrifying danger.\n\nApril 11, 2020 Covid-19 has killed 25,000 people in the US\n\nMore than seven decades later, he faced another immense battle. This one took his life, two days after his wife passed.\n\nOn April 17, Daniel Zane died from Covid-19 complications, his family said. He was 94.\n\nTwo days earlier, his wife Valerie passed away at age 91. She suffered from Parkinson's disease and dementia but had not been tested for Covid-19.\n\nTheir love story started almost 75 years ago, when they met on a blind date.\n\nThis was love at first sight for him, daughter Nancie Zane said. Her dad used to say his eyes popped out of his head when met his future wife.\n\nBut Valerie played it cool and made Daniel wait -- saying she was busy for the next six weeks. Three years later, they got married.\n\nIn their final days, Daniel Zane lived in the same Pennsylvania senior living facility as his wife in Pennsylvania. He was in the independent living unit, while she was in the skilled nursing unit because she needed more care.\n\nAs the pandemic intensified, he decided to move into his wife's nursing unit to help take care of her, his daughters said.\n\nIt seemed like another reflection of his commitment and bravery, Nancie Zane said.

I have a much deeper appreciation for all of the other families who have gone through this. The hundreds of thousands of families. And until it personally touches you, I don't care how much we can have a sympathetic heart. It's different when you've been there and you've lost someone.

Jones stated that US President Donald Trump called him today to congratulate him on his victory. (Photo by Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nAn Alabama man whose lesbian daughter killed herself took a final stand Tuesday morning against Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore as polls opened across his state.\n\nMoore, who has denied accusations of molesting a 14-year-old girl and pursuing relationships with other teens when he was in his 30s, should be in the psych ward somewhere with a psychiatrist trying to help him get better, Nathan Mathis told CNN.\n\nPhotos of Mathis protesting Monday night while holding a picture of his late daughter outside Moore's final campaign rally quickly took off on Twitter. Appearing Tuesday on CNN's New Day, Mathis continued to rail against Moore, who is known for staunch opposition to LGBT rights.\n\nI feel guilty about my daughter taking her own life, about what I said, Mathis told anchor Alisyn Camerota, referring to his own previous anti-gay stance, which he addressed in a 2012 letter to The Dothan Eagle.\n\nMathis accused Moore of hypocrisy for judging the LGBT community, in light of the allegations against him.\n\nHe don't need to be in Washington DC, Mathis said.\n\n'I realize how wrong that was'\n\nMathis said he learned first-hand how damaging anti-LGBT rhetoric can be, and he credited that revelation for his own change of heart.\n\nWhat happened to me could happen to you. It could happen to anybody that's watching this program, he said. It could be your child, your grandchild, your great-grandchild. Are you going to vote for a man that calls your child or grandchild a pervert just because they're born gay?\n\nMy daughter was a good person, he said. My daughter was not no damn pervert, as Roy Moore called her. And Roy Moore, by going at little teenage girls, he does not deserve to be the in United States Senate. It's just that simple.\n\nIn 2005, Moore said that homosexual conduct should be illegal. In September 2016, he was suspended without pay for the rest of his term as Alabama chief justice for directing probate judges to enforce the state's ban on same-sex marriage following the landmark Supreme Court ruling that made the institution legal in all 50 states.

Catherine Clinton is the author of Mrs. Lincoln: A Life and Harriet Tubman: The Road to Freedom. She holds the Denman Chair of American History at the University of Texas in San Antonio and is professor emerita at Queen's University Belfast. The views expressed in this commentary are hers. Read more opinion on CNN. For more on the life of the 16th president, watch Lincoln: Divided We Stand Sundays at 10 p.m. ET/PT.\n\n(CNN) When the wife of the 16th President entered the White House in 1861, there were two big hints that her era as First Lady would be different.\n\nFor one, Mary Lincoln was the first spouse of a US president to be given the sobriquet of First Lady, a signal of how much the role and duties of the president's wife had increased in significance.\n\nThe other, of course, was that she was becoming first lady of a country on the verge of war. Within weeks of her move into the White House, Union troops were stationed in the East Room\n\nNeither of these factors, however, hinted at how controversial a figure Mary Lincoln would become. Criticized for being a spendthrift and dismissed as hysterical, Mary Lincoln's tenure as first lady and her role in Abraham Lincoln's presidency remain divisive to this day.\n\nA mercurial, vain personality whose weaknesses periodically outnumbered her strengths, Mary Lincoln's manner and temperament exacerbated problems from her earliest days in Washington. Yet she was also a politically shrewd and outspoken partner to her husband, unafraid to step outside the boundaries of gender convention when women were expected to confine themselves to the nursery and the parlor.\n\nAs a result, historians have spent more than a century debating the personal and political contributions of this complex figure -- including her part in turning Abraham Lincoln into one of the greatest presidents who ever lived.\n\nDevoted ambition\n\nVivacious and autocratic, Mary showed she was an astute observer of the political chess game from childhood. Born in Kentucky, she met Abraham after a move to Springfield, Illinois, and wed the politically ambitious lawyer in 1842.\n\nHer 12 years of formal education ensured she was as intellectually curious as the largely self-taught Abraham, and she provided him with the stability he had craved since his youth. They both lost their mothers at an early age, suffering a sense of displacement that was healed by starting a family. Mary gave birth to four sons, all reportedly spoiled by their doting parents\n\nJUST WATCHED Watch a sneak peek of CNN's new series 'Lincoln' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Watch a sneak peek of CNN's new series 'Lincoln' 00:52\n\nEarly on in their partnership, Mary volunteered sharp opinions on potential alliances, patronage and strategies. Whatever her shortcomings, Mary proved a devoted helpmeet during her husband's political rise: He would read aloud to her his courtroom summaries and would later recite his stump speeches over their Springfield breakfast table. Mary might be seen sitting in the gallery of the Illinois state house to hear debates, or mailing unsolicited letters with pros and cons about political appointments during her husband's presidential campaign.\n\nShe channeled her own ambitions into her husband's career, so much so that when the news of his election as President arrived at the Springfield telegraph office in November 1860, Lincoln left for home explaining , Well, gentlemen, there is a little woman at our house who is probably more interested in this dispatch than I am.\n\nThe start of a spiral\n\nAs much as Mary wanted to be the wife of a president , the consequences of this election were dire — for the country, as well as the Lincolns. Mary Lincoln became desperately fearful for her husband's health and safety, and it didn't help that half of her siblings or in-laws were in the newly formed Confederate army. While Mary was fiercely loyal to her husband and viewed her Rebel relatives as treasonous, her mail was inspected before it was delivered, coming and going -- an indignity no previous presidential spouse had endured.\n\nDuring her first weeks in Washington, the new first lady became a curiosity; as British journalist William Russell reported , If she but drives down Pennsylvania Avenue, the electric wire trills the news to every hamlet in the Union.\n\nMary Todd Lincoln, wife of Abraham Lincoln, dressed for his inauguration.\n\nYet no matter the criticisms she faced -- and there were many, particularly from an elite Washington society that saw her as an upstart from the prairie -- Mary held a haughty disdain for currying favor. When sh e devoted her energies to visiting hospita ls, two to three times a week by the winter of 1862, she eschewed the publicity that would have been in her own interest. A White House staffer suggested that if she were worldly-wise she would carry newspaper correspondents ... every time she went and ... bring the writers back to the White House, and give them some cake. But while Mary Lincoln was in need of better press, she was unwilling to feed them cake to get it.\n\nA stunning series of personal tragedies only complicated her public persona. The death of her beloved son Willie in 1862 propelled her on a downward spiral, as did a head injury from a carriage accident in 1863. The subsequent assassination of her husband in April 1865 was the final push into an accelerated period of decline. As she mourned, she earned little sympathy from a nation critical of her extravagance, distrustful of her allegiances and mocking of her theatrical personality.\n\nJUST WATCHED Politicians know there's power in the name 'Lincoln' Replay More Videos ...

Was her idea to improve the White House as a show of strength to foreign dignitaries so questionable?\n\nWere her bouts of keening grief and depression, considering she lost three children and her husband was murdered sitting next to her, so unexpected?\n\nJUST WATCHED What many get wrong about Lincoln Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What many get wrong about Lincoln 00:47\n\nIn truth, Mary Lincoln's sins have been greatly exaggerated during the mythmaking about her over the past century, growing so large as to overshadow her early political contributions. It would seem that she is still weighed on scales rigged by sexism, scales that belittle those women who fall outside the boundaries to which they were (and still are) expected to conform. During her own lifetime, William Herndon, her husband's law partner and biographer, fabricated falsehoods to injure and embarrass her.\n\nIn the end, Mary Lincoln's legacy may not be able to overcome the forces which cloud our assessments about her talents. Yet it is crucial to understand that the partnership Mary and Abraham forged not only nurtured Lincoln's rise, but also fostered his permanent status in the pantheon of great American leaders.
(CNN) —\n\nFifty Shades Freed should mark the merciful end of the movie trilogy unleashed by E.L. James' novels, and there's plenty of artfully-lit airbrushed sex – and unintended guffaws – for those with a taste for midnight-movie-style chewy badness. Otherwise, the safe word should be avoid.\n\nHaving finished the second chapter with a proposal, the third opens with a wedding, a whirlwind trip to exotic locales, and a reminder that marriage doesn't automatically mean the end of passion – at least, for newlyweds with their own well-equipped, garishly decorated playroom.\n\nPretty soon, however, the honeymoon's over, as the central couple tries to adjust to marital bliss. Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) wants to maintain her career in publishing, but must deal with a wealthy husband, Christian (Jamie Dornan), who's overprotective, jealous and controlling. And while it might sound like a high-class problem, there's the business of managing all those ever-present servants, who insist on calling her Mrs. Grey, mirroring the formal way they address her spouse.\n\nThe adaptation, which reunites director James Foley and writer Niall Leonard, dutifully goes through the motions, a description that also applies to the key performances. What can't be overstated, alas, is just how boring and tedious it all is.\n\nAs with the first sequel, Fifty Shades Darker, there's barely enough story to sustain a whole movie, which likely explains Foley's reliance on musical montages to fill the void.\n\nThat makes a subplot tacked on to put Anastasia and others in peril – the seeds of which were planted in the last film – feel all the more strained and absurd. Focusing on the challenges to the relationship raised by Christian's particular needs would seemingly be enough, without these flourishes that, more than anything, resemble a later-season episode of Falcon Crest.\n\nBecause the book was such a sensation, the enthusiasm that greeted the first film made it something of an event. The second, notably, yielded diminishing returns – taking in about two-thirds the worldwide box-office haul of its predecessor – and one suspects after an initial flurry of interest in its timed-for-Valentine's-Day release, enthusiasm for the third will quickly peter out as well.\n\nUniversal has had some fun with its marketing campaign, using the tagline, Don't miss the climax. It's a shame, though, that the posters exhibit considerably more ingenuity than the film itself.\n\nThe title, at least, does get one thing right: Everyone associated with the Fifty Shades franchise should feel somewhat liberated by moving on, now that Christian and Anastasia's story is, effectively, tied up.\n\nFifty Shades Freed opens Feb. 9 in the U.S. It's rated R.
They married in 2014 and still live in Baghdad, where Nahla teaches Arabic to foreign students. Aqeel has helped Osaid to grow in confidence and recently they all traveled to Europe for a long-awaited family trip. Nahla's love and appreciation for Aqeel during that traumatic time is conveyed beautifully in her letter to him.\n\nNahla wasn't expecting to fall in love again, but then she found Aqeel. When they met in 2009, at a gathering for Iraqi women organized by an NGO, it was love at first glance.\n\nShe was left widowed at the height of the Iraq civil war with her young autistic son, Osaid. CNN met her a year later in 2008, when she was working at a radio station, and has followed her story ever since.\n\nI remember a blue-colored sheet covering something. At one end the pigtails of a little girl with red ribbons, on the other a tiny foot. The sheet was drenched in blood, she says.\n\nSuddenly this scorched thing is the same thing that used to be a beating heart, standing next to you in life, she said, pain etched across her face.\n\nNahla al-Nadawi's first husband was killed by a car bomb in Baghdad in April 2007. The suicide bomber detonated at a checkpoint on al-Jadiryah Bridge, killing 10 people. When Nahla received her husband's body from the morgue at the Yarmouk Hospital, it was a completely burnt skeleton, she said.\n\nTo my sweetheart Aqeel,\n\nRemember the first time we met? I was in black, holding the hand of my 7 years old boy. At that time, both Osaid (my son) and myself were miserable people, after we lost his dad in a bombing that took place on the AlJadiriyah Bridge in Baghdad in April 2007. Tens of people were killed on that day. We received my husband's body from the morgue at the Yarmouk Hospital. It was a completely burnt skeleton.\n\nThis was not the only reason we were miserable. My son was autistic, as you know. At that time, Iraq, our country, was just coming out of a terrible civil war caused by political differences and fights over authority and power. Remember, Aqeel, how Baghdad at that time entered into an era of violence?The streets have turned into cemeteries with dead bodies thrown everywhere.\n\nAmongst all of this, I was going through ajourney of struggle against autism with my son. We felt lonely, despite the fact that we had many members of our family and friends around us. We were afraid of losing the fight, until you showed up in our life.\n\nOur love story started with that first glance, but our marriage came late. We were so afraid of our differences and our fights, which are caused by our two different backgrounds and the generations each of us comes from. Both of us carry heavy legacies of personal struggles, like any other Iraqi who lives through previous political regimes.\n\nDays have gone by, and our love continued to grow. We accepted our differences, and our fights decreased. Six years later, we found commonalities between us, and that's when we decided to get married. You embraced me with passion, gave me energy to love again. You were Osaid's new father, gave him confidence, and took him from childhood to adulthood. You taught him swimming and shaving. You took him through the streets of Baghdad in the car or just for a walk. You were discovering the new safe Baghdad, but at the same time remained cautious and worried.\n\nTo my soul mate and beloved husband Aqeel:\n\nAll days are worthy because of your love, but Valentine's is so special. It gives us an opportunity to express our feelings to those we love. I understand the core of love is bigger than individuals and their love stories, but it can be expressed through their experiences. Our story could be one of many expressing love and its warmth. With all that, I will continue to dream of a love letter that we write together; you, Osaid, and me, on Valentines' day. A letter that tells the stories of young Iraqis who work together to carry our beloved country away from wars and battles to new landscapes, where kids are playing and laughing, while enjoying safety. This new place will also see beautiful young Iraqi women planting and getting ready for the crops season, singing beautiful songs they inherited from their old ( Sumerian ) grandmothers, who discovered agriculture in the earlier history, and spread it to the rest of the world.\n\nI know you are dreaming of writing this letter with me, and until then, my love to you will continue forever.\n\nNahla
Welcome to Included, a weekly round-up on the top stories about culture and identity in business and tech.\n\nThis week, we look at America's lost Einsteins, the anti-discrimination measures American Airlines are taking, and more.\n\nWho gets to be the next Einstein?\n\niPhones, new drugs to save lives, the internet -- All these inventions help us lead richer, more productive lives.\n\nBut a new study by The Equal Opportunity Project at Stanford University shows that not everyone has an equal opportunity to innovate.\n\nThere are many 'lost Einsteins' -- people who would have had high-impact inventions had they become inventors -- among the under-represented groups, researchers wrote.\n\nWho gets to be inventors is determined by factors beyond one's innate abilities. Disparities in geography, socio-economic status, gender and race also play a large role.\n\nChildren from high income families are ten times more likely to become inventors than children from low income families, the researchers found.\n\nFurthermore, only 18% of inventors are female. Researchers say, at that rate, it'll take 118 years for us to have as many female inventors as male inventors.\n\nIf we could bring in this pool of women, kids from low-income families and minorities, we would have four times as much innovation in the U.S. as we currently do, the report's author, Raj Chetty, said on Marketplace.\n\nAmerican Airlines now requires anti-racism training\n\nAmerican Airlines has introduced implicit bias training after being called out by the NAACP for a pattern of disturbing incidents reported by African-American passengers.\n\nThe warning prompted the carrier to start setting up both in-person and online courses, which will be mandatory for all employees in 2018.\n\nThe company says it has also met with NAACP representatives after the group's advisory warned that a number of black passengers had been forced out of their seats or flights.\n\nWe viewed the feedback as an opportunity, CEO Doug Parker said. We are proud of the diversity and inclusion initiatives already in place at American, but we know we can do even better.\n\nRelated: Google notches a win in gender discrimination lawsuit\n\nMassage Envy wants a do-over\n\nThe massage chain has announced reforms after a BuzzFeed News report revealed that more than 180 people had lodged sexual assault lawsuits, police reports and state board complaints against the company.\n\nAmong the new rules: yearly background checks for massage therapists; allowing an anti-sexual-violence organization to review company policies; and requiring franchise owners to provide any customer who comes forward with a private room to call law enforcement.\n\nBut will it be enough to win back clients' trust? The company, which has recently faced calls for a boycott, admitted this week that membership numbers have dropped.\n\nJust added @MassageEnvy to the #GrabYourWallet boycott list: https://t.co/od2s2OzgfB It won't come off until the company introduces robust policies aimed at surfacing & investigating sexual assault claims versus covering them up. pic.twitter.com/NZu8FRJ7fk — Shannon Coulter (@shannoncoulter) November 27, 2017\n\nCertainly in this environment, it's forced us to re-look and rethink if we're doing enough, said Massage Envy CEO Joe Magnacca.\n\nRelated: Mark Halperin and Charlie Rose accusers form advocacy group\n\nQuote of the week\n\nWhat I typically found was that if [potential funders] had daughters or had been raised with sisters, they understood what it was and if they didn't, they kind of couldn't believe that women actually fought like that, which was an interesting window into why some stories can't get told, Greta Gerwig, who makes her directorial debut in Lady Bird, told The New York Times.

(CNN) — For its size, it packs a serious punch.\n\nAvery Island -- not actually an island but a salt dome in southern Louisiana -- is the home of one of the most popular hot sauces in the world.\n\nA few drops of its famous Tabasco is enough to liven up any meal.\n\nSurrounded by bayou, salt marsh and swamp, and about 2.5 miles across at its widest point, Avery Island has been the home of Tabasco sauce since the 1800s.\n\nEvery bottle of the fiery foodstuff, made from the tabasco chili pepper, is still made on the island, which is named after the family who've owned it for more than 200 years\n\nTabasco sauce was dreamed up by Edmund McIlhenny, an Avery clan member by marriage, who moved to the area after losing everything in the Civil War.\n\nBirth of Tabasco\n\nCNN Travel takes a look at the making of tabasco sauce -- a fiery condiment produced on Avery Island in Louisiana.\n\nMy great, great grandfather was a banker, an entrepreneur and a monster chili head and he didn't like the way food tasted, says Anthony Tony Simmons, the president and CEO of the McIlhenny Company, which is now in its fifth generation as a family-run business.\n\nHe created Tabasco to enliven the flavor of his own food.\n\nWhile it's unclear exactly where he obtained the capsicum frutescens var. tabasco pepper seeds that became the main ingredient in Tabasco sauce, they are thought to have come from Mexico or Central America.\n\nRumor has it the seeds, which are the only type of chili pepper whose fruits are not dry on the inside, were handed to him by an unnamed man who simply said, Try these. This is a very hot pepper.\n\nWhatever the case, McIlhenny planted them in his garden and they bore a pepper plant with a strong spicy flavor he couldn't get enough of.\n\nMcIlhenny created what would become known as Tabasco sauce by grinding the peppers into a mash, mixing them with the natural rock salt from the island and aging the concoction for a month in jars.\n\nThe next stage was to add vinegar, before aging the mixture for another month. He'd then strain the mixture, pour it into used cologne bottles and distribute it to family and friends.\n\nThe businessman founded the McIlhenny Company in 1868 after his relatives convinced him to produce the sauce commercially.\n\nRecipe for success\n\nThe McIlhenny Company produces over 700,000 bottles of the condiment every day. McIlhenny Company\n\nMcIlhenny created a Tabasco bible which the manufacturers continue to follow today.\n\nThe sauce is now sold in 187 countries and bottled in 22 languages and dialects, with its ingredients remaining much the same all these years later.\n\nThe only major difference is that the aging time has stretched from 30 days in jars to three years in used bourbon barrels.\n\nAlso, some of the pepper seeds are now shipped off to growing fields in Latin America and returned to the island for processing once they've sprouted.\n\nThe peppers are handpicked when they're about chest high level, with employees painstakingly checking the shade of each one with a color stick.\n\nWe can only pick the brightest fully ripe red pepper because Tabasco is a natural product, Simmons explains.\n\nThe only way I can control the color on the bottle is by picking the fully ripe red pepper.\n\nSimmons personally taste-tests the sauce when it's in its raw state to ensure it has aged to perfection.\n\nI put a little bit on the tip of my tongue and keep it there and roll it around a little bit for you know 30 seconds or so and then spit it out, he says.\n\nYou don't want to actually swallow the mash and the seeds. It's pretty hot. It's got a pretty good burn.\n\nHe takes the process very seriously.\n\nI'm only as good as the last bottle we produced as far as the consumers are concerned, he says.\n\nFit for royalty\n\nTabasco sauce remains a firm favorite in kitchens across the world, and it received the royal seal of approval when the McIlhenny Company was given an official warrant assigning it an official supplier to the British royal household.\n\nDespite its enduring popularity, Simmons say he's surprised by the amount of people who think they haven't tasted the condiment before.\n\nYou know, a lot of times people say, 'Oh Tony, I know who you are and what your product is, Tabasco, but I've never had it. I don't use hot food.'\n\nAnd I always ask them the same question: 'Do you go out to dinner? You have no idea how much Tabasco you consume,' he says.\n\nThe McIlhenny Company Tabasco plant is open to the public, and visitors can take a guided or self-guided tour of the factory, which has an on-site museum.

(CNN) —\n\nOne thing that can upgrade your bathing experience immediately? A new towel.\n\nThat's why we set out to find the best bath towels on the market, settling on a pool of nine top-reviewed and editor-favorite options to test for ourselves. After taking too many showers and baths to count, plus washing and drying loads of towels again and again, we found four standouts. Note that our top three nonbudget towels scored equally high marks — and because we understand that towel preference is a very subjective matter, we're calling out all of them as top picks, as each is a different style of towel but one that proved highly functional in absorption, drying time and durability.\n\nIf it's a traditional, super-thick, super-fluffy towel experience you're after — and being enveloped by the comfort of fluff definitely appeals right now — Frontgate's Resort Cotton Towel is the one to truly embrace. Reminiscent of a fine hotel spa experience, these towels encase their user in a high-weight terry luxury that feels like you're lounging in a bathrobe waiting for room service.\n\nThose after a less fuzzy, snuggly experience in a towel are likely to love Boll & Branch's chic Plush Bath Towels. They're heavy-duty in absorbency yet magically lightweight and feel great to dry off with. They're also produced cleanly and sustainably by this eco-forward company.\n\nA combo of a terry and waffle-weave towel, Pact's Waffle Bath Towel quickly rose to the top of the testing pile. Ecologically produced and aesthetically pleasing, the surface of Pact's towel is highly absorbent and soft to the touch but offers textural friction that elevates its use to a daily exfoliation session — think of it as a mini spa trip in towel form.\n\nAt $8 apiece, Target's Threshold Performance Bath Towels cost a literal fraction of the price of most other towels in our pool and felt relatively good against the skin and effectively absorbent. They're OEKO-TEX certified to standard 100 (more on this below) and are available in a whopping 30 colors, more than any other towel brand we tested.\n\nBest plush bath towel: Frontgate Resort Cotton Bath Towel ($34; frontgate.com)\n\nPHOTO: Elizabeth Wallace/CNN Frontgate Resort Cotton Bath Towel\n\nFresh out of the box, Frontgate's Resort Cotton Bath Towel was among the most luxurious-feeling in our testing pool. Thick, soft and snuggly, this product truly feels like a fine hotel bathing experience. At a generous 58 inches by 30 inches, it looks the part too, with a lush surface punctuated by a nice 2-inch-long trim near each towel end.\n\nThese towels, crafted from 100% pure long-staple Turkish cotton, are a heavier weight at 700 grams per square meter, or GSM. (Read more about GSM below.) While we found the towel to be substantial and comfortable to the touch, it also isn't weigh-you-down heavy. This may be attributed to Frontgate's zero twist manufacturing process, said to plump and stabilize the yarn while exposing more of the fiber, the result being a product both super soft yet still lightweight. Both children and adults who used this towel in our testing found it exceedingly plush, and very effective and absorbent, drying users completely in under a minute.\n\nGiven the towel's high GSM, unsurprisingly it wasn't completely dry after just an hour hanging, but it did seem to dry faster than some of its heavier-weight towels in this mix, feeling pretty well dried after three to four hours spread out across a towel rack. It launders beautifully, with no loose threads to speak of after the numerous washes.\n\nFrontgate towels come in 22 colors (bested in our pool only by the number of colors available for Target's and RH's towels), with a bath sheet option of 70 inches by 42 inches as well. And a fun bonus: They're monogrammable and would make a beautifully personalized gift. You can only buy the towels individually, but they're about a quarter more affordable than our two other nonbudget winners, which adds even more to their value.\n\nBest luxury bath towel: Boll & Branch Plush Bath Towel ($45; bollandbranch.com)\n\nPHOTO: Elizabeth Wallace/CNN Boll & Branch Plush Bath Towel\n\nAlready a fan of the Boll & Branch brand since we tested the company's flannel sheets this past fall, we were excited to see this towel arrive in the mail, with the same modern stylish packaging and logo, tied up neatly with a white ribbon like a little gift.\n\nCrafted from 100% organic cotton and made ethically in India, Boll & Branch's Plush Towel is a bit bigger than most at 58 inches by 30 inches, so there's a little more luxury to love. And they're made from two-ply organic cotton, of a hefty 700 GSM weight like the Frontgate, so they feel substantial without seeming heavy; they're constructed with low-twist yarns that fluff up, making them extra soft. Boll & Branch's definition of plush, though, isn't fluffy or cloying; it's a rougher-hewn texture in a design that feels contemporary and chic — one that some may prefer to a more traditional, fluffier bath towel.\n\nThis towel dried us quickly and effectively, feeling utterly comfortable to the touch but much less fuzzy and pillowy than Frontgate's plush version. We could imagine lying around in Boll & Branch's offering long after we've gotten out of the shower, lounging like a guest at a 5-star hotel. It's thicker than some of the super-thin brands we tested, so it didn't dry as fast as every option in our pool, but it was about average in hang-drying time, falling in the three- to four-hour range.\n\nBoll & Branch towels are Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certified and OEKO-TEX certified to standard 100. (More below on what these certifications mean and what testing agencies do.) The brand is also committed to using only 100% organic cotton, reducing water usage in its production by 91% and to only producing its wares in factories that pay a fair wage with responsible working conditions.\n\nBoll & Branch Plush Towels come in five different earth tones that any respectable interior designer would proudly order up for you. These are an excellent choice for anyone who prioritizes aesthetics and function and is willing to pay a little more to upgrade their bath experience.\n\nBest waffle bath towel: Pact Waffle Bath Towel ($42; wearepact.com)\n\nPHOTO: Elizabeth Wallace/CNN Pact Waffle Bath Towel\n\nIf you've never used a waffle towel, get ready to have your bath-arena worldview changed. We learned that in addition to the traditional terry cloth options many of us have grown accustomed to using, there are newer, thinner options out there, ones with different textures that make toweling off an entirely different experience. Waffle-weave towels, believed to be more absorbent because of their honeycomblike indentations, draw in moisture from the surface, thus arguably drying more quickly and effectively than a traditional woven terry.\n\nWe tested a couple of these unique waffle-weave towels (scroll down for our thoughts on the others), and while there's a lot to like, they may not be for everyone — e.g., people who prefer the comfort of a thick and fluffy towel. For us, Pact's Waffle Bath Towels were the perfect marriage of a traditional high-end cotton bath towel and a waffle-weave one.\n\nWith a raised hexagonal-patterned texture and a clean, modern hem, it looks minimalist and striking, and it feels equally pleasing. Lighter weight than both Frontgate and Boll & Branch's offerings and still highly absorbent, it feels like it's actively whisking away the water, but it's still comfortable against the skin and not at all scratchy. It's a more rough-hewn texture, so it's not a snuggly, fluffy option like many of the other brands we tested — again, personal preference may come into play.\n\nIt feels durable but also refreshingly lightweight for a high-end towel. It's also more compact than many of the other terry towels we tested, so it's easier to handle in all ways, from tossing in the wash to storing, making it a great option for travel. And the waffle weave makes for a textured surface that feels fantastic — sort of an every-time-you-dry exfoliating cloth for both face and body, a particular treat during chapping winter months. After several washes, it held up perfectly, looking the same as it did fresh out of the box. At 55 inches by 27 inches for the bath towel size, it's expansive without feeling overwhelming, weighty or overly long. The towel is offered also in a bath sheet size, and can be purchased individually or as a set in seven calming colors.\n\nWhat's more, Pact is a company we can get behind ecologically: The towels are crafted from 100% pure organic cotton terry and are fair trade certified (i.e., made in fair trade factories that ensure safe working conditions and support local communities). The company prides itself on its towels as well as its clothing, being fashioned from organic cotton, whose production saves water and uses no toxic chemicals. Towels and other products are shipped in 98% postconsumer recycled materials, and Pact has partnered with an eco-tech company to help offset the carbon footprint of its products. Overall, we found this to be an incredible towel whose sustainable creation was the icing on the cake.\n\nBest value bath towel: Target Threshold Performance Bath Towel ($8; target.com)\n\nPHOTO: Target Target Threshold Performance Bath Towel\n\nWe've long been fans of Target's Threshold brand for all things wallet-friendly, and we found its bath towel to be no exception. OEKO-TEX certified to standard 100, it feels well made for a towel under $10, not to mention comfortable against the skin, falling into the more roughly textured category. A generously sized bath towel, at 54 inches by 30 inches, it dried us effectively after a bath, and hang-drying time was about average.\n\nWe saw a few loose threads after a wash and dry cycle, but this towel generally felt durable, particularly for its tiny price tag. One of our editors, in fact, has used hers for years and can attest to its ability to stand up to hundreds of wash cycles. While it does lose a bit of its softness over the years, that's to be expected for a towel that's just 8 bucks.\n\nThis towel is available in 30 colors (including two stripe patterns), the widest availability out of all the options we tested. It comes in both a bath towel and bath sheet size (the latter measuring a body-enveloping 33 inches by 63 inches), and you can also buy matching washcloths and hand towels à la carte. For all of these reasons, it's truly a solid option for those on a tight budget.\n\nWhat to keep in mind when shopping for bath towels\n\nWaffle weave: Waffle-weave towels have raised threads that form a 3D honeycomb-pattern surface. They are believed to be more absorbent because the honeycomb indentations draw in moisture from the surface, thus arguably drying you more quickly and effectively than a traditional woven terry. That greater surface area weave also means a faster-drying towel, especially helpful in smaller or less well-ventilated bathrooms — so goodbye to musty, still-damp bath towels the next day. These towels are so different experientially than traditional terry cotton options; you'll find they're immediately absorbent without feeling heavy or fluffy in any way. Plus, their flat-weave structure results in a texture with a lot of benefits: It makes them lighter and less bulky than terry cotton, and thus easier to carry, store, transport and launder.\n\nGrams per square meter (GSM): A measurement of the density of a towel, sort of like what thread count is for sheets, that ranges from 300 to 900, 700 being on the heavier-weight end.\n\nGOTS certified: The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) is a worldwide textile processing standard for organic fibers that's backed up by third-party certification throughout the entire supply chain.\n\nOEKO-TEX certified to standard 100: Every component of the article with this label has been tested for harmful substances by an independent partner.\n\nMade Safe certified: Made Safe, billed as the United States' first nontoxic seal for household products used every day, prohibits the use of 6,500 ingredients considered not safe.\n\nTurkish cotton: Grown exclusively in the Aegean region of Turkey, Turkish cotton is a premium cotton with extra-long fibers, which results in stronger, smoother threads, which makes for softer, fluffier, more absorbent towels over time.\n\nHow we tested\n\nPHOTO: Elizabeth Wallace/CNN Best bath towels\n\nWe researched the top bath towels on the market, prioritizing function, quality and value. After scouring the internet and mixing in some editor favorites, we settled on a final pool of nine to put to the test.\n\nWe opened each towel, noting our first impressions of how it looked, felt and even smelled. We took multiple showers and dried off with each towel at least three times. We also had family members try each towel and offer their second and third opinions. We machine-washed and dried each towel multiple times, and reused it after each fresh laundering. Our testing process was intensive, lasting nearly two months. We assessed each towel according to the following criteria:\n\nQuality/feel\n\nTexture: We took note of how the towel felt against the skin — if it was soft, rough, clingy, of high-quality feel, etc.\n\nDurability : We observed how each towel held up after machine-washing and drying, a minimum of five times. We assessed and recorded if it shrunk, shredded, created lint or loose threads, or faded. We noted if, after drying, each towel felt as soft and fluffy as it initially did, or if it had flattened or changed shape at all.\n\nAppearance : We took note of how aesthetically appealing the towel is — if the fabric looked high-end and if the design was appealing or noticeable at all.\n\nMaterial: We looked into how the towel was made, and if it was crafted using organic and/or ethically sourced material.\n\nFunction\n\nAbsorbency : We noted how well each towel dried our hair and skin, observing how effectively it absorbed water.\n\nDrying ability: After using each towel and spreading and hanging it on a towel rack, we noted how long it took to dry after use.\n\nOptions\n\nColors : We considered how many shades the towel is available in.\n\nSizes: We noted whether it's available in more than one size, and if it can be purchased as part of a set.\n\nHow we rated\n\nBased on the categories and testing procedures listed above, we gave all towels a score in each subcategory, combined those numbers for a maximum score in each category, then totaled those numbers for a final overall score. We broke down the scores as follows:\n\nQuality/feel had a total of 45 points : texture (15 points), durability (15 points), appearance (10 points) and material (5 points).\n\nFunction had a maximum of 40 points : absorbency (20 points) and drying ability (20 points).\n\nOptions had a maximum of 15 points: colors (10 points) and sizes (5 points).\n\nOther towels we tested\n\nPottery Barn Hydrocotton Organic Quick-Dry Towel ($29.50; potterybarn.com)\n\nPHOTO: Pottery Barn Pottery Barn Hydrocotton Organic Quick-Dry Towel\n\nPottery Barn's Hydrocotton Organic Quick-Dry Towel employs a weaving process that creates fine, untwisted loops said to be more absorbent than traditional terry — and we did indeed find this to be among the fastest drying of the towels we tested while also feeling super fluffy. Crafted from 100% organic cotton at 550 GSM, it's also fantastically plush.\n\nThis thick, quick-drying towel didn't ultimately snag a winning spot on our list, however, because it felt just slightly less luxurious than some of the other brands. We did appreciate its relatively midlevel price point considering the fact the towel is GOTS certified, feels well made and is available in 16 colors. This towel is noticeably less bulky than some of the other plush options we tested, so if quick-drying is at the top of your priority list in a towel and you're willing to sacrifice a higher-quality feel, we think this is a fine option at a good price.\n\nParachute Waffle Towel ($39; parachute.com)\n\nPHOTO: Parachute Parachute Waffle Towel\n\nWhen we tested linen sheets, Parachute's were our favorites, and we've long considered the brand synonymous with quality. So we were excited to try this waffle towel, loomed from 100% long-staple Turkish cotton at a featherweight 240 GSM (much lighter than most terry towels in the 300 to 900 range). Straight out of the box, the Parachute towel felt soft, luxurious and, dare we say, bouncy. It functioned well, drying as effectively as any other brand we tested, if not better and faster, and certainly felt high-quality to the touch. And because of the lightweight factor of the waffle weave, the Parachute did dry faster, within about two hours of use, after being hung on the towel rack.\n\nA couple of factors we did not find ideal: The bath towel felt larger than standard size, even though it wasn't. It measures 56 inches by 30 inches, but, possibly because it feels like it expands due to the springy texture of the fabric, it felt like there was almost too much length for a person who may be shorter than average. Wrapped around the head, there seemed to be a lot of excess towel hanging down during the drying and dressing stage. (The hand towel, for the record, also seems longer than standard, and while this wouldn't be an issue we'd mention normally, it hung down on our towel ring longer than other towels we've used, and the slinkiness of the weave left it almost slippery — we repeatedly found the towel slipped off the ring and right onto the floor.)\n\nA second issue is the apparent fragility of this fabric. While the honeycomb weave is a pleasure to touch and use, it felt more precarious than a standard terry cotton towel. The towel snagged after the first wash and dry cycle — we did follow the care directions, which did not specify washing on delicate — leaving a few loose threads or small nicks in the fabric. This may be customary and not a big deal, but it's worth mentioning for those who live and bathe in more active homes (e.g., those with small children or pets who may get a hold of said snaggable fabrics with less cautious hands/paws).\n\nLastly, the Parachute Waffle Towels come in just three colors — white, gray and charcoal — and while that may be customary for a more minimalist bath decor line, the brand lost a few points for that limitation. It's available only in bath towel size, no bath sheet (as we mentioned, though, the standard bath towel feels bigger than others). For those who love a more modern, European bathroom decor style and are willing to spend a teensy bit more care on laundering and towel storage, though? These may be a solid option for you.\n\nOnsen Bath Towel ($50; onsen.com)\n\nPHOTO: Onsen Onsen Bath Towel\n\nOnsen was created by a half-Japanese founder inspired by his heritage, and by living and working in Japan, to make high-quality home goods. He was turned off by traditional terry towels that had stayed wet or grown musty and wanted to create a lighter, thinner, quicker-drying towel like the ones he'd used in Japan. From the likes of the bath towel we tested, he's succeeded.\n\nOur Onsen towel was gorgeous: Minimalist and chic, it's made from 100% Supima cotton, a fine-grade cotton with extra-long fibers that can be spun into much softer products. The brand also notes that the Supima cotton (and thus, the towels) gets better over time as the waffle weave gets deeper and thirstier, aka softer and more absorbent. Supima is grown in select family farms that allow for supply chain traceability, and are farmed with less chemicals and coatings than traditional cotton, making Onsen towels, also OEKO-TEX certified, an ecologically sound choice.\n\nThey dried as thoroughly or better than any of the other towels we tested, and felt so absorbent and soft against the skin. The standard bath towel size is generous too, at 31 inches by 57 inches. As much as we loved the Onsen towel, like the Parachute Waffle Towel, it also needed some tender loving care in the most basic of ways. On our way to the shower for its first use, the towel snagged on our bathroom door and pulled a thread. It got tangled in something else we were carrying later, and again snagged. It was hard not to feel like any wrong move with this towel would damage it — and made us wonder if waffle-weave towels may be more prone to snagging in general, which is not ideal for every towel user. If you're a bit more cautious, though, you're likely to love these. They come in seven beautiful shades and are only sold individually, but we imagine you'll want to invest (and they are an investment) in more than one.\n\nRH 802-Gram Turkish Towel Collection ($46; rh.com)\n\nPHOTO: RH RH 802-Gram Turkish Towel Collection\n\nL\n\noomed from premium cotton to an 802-gram weight, this towel was among the heaviest in our testing pool. RH's Turkish beauties are described on its site as exceptionally dense and soft, and especially suited for colder weather. In fact, on one recent frosty morning with temps dipping below 20 degrees Fahrenheit, RH's 802-grammers felt like being wrapped fresh from the shower in a giant plush blanket. The towel dried quickly and thoroughly, and was so cozy we wouldn't have minded climbing back into bed with it. Some might find the thick weight of the towel too thick, however — there's a sense of being wrapped in a life-size plush toy in towel form — but if you like this style, this one's pure luxury.\n\nUpon first use, we did feel some of the towel's fibers shedding onto our skin, which is apparently normal in thicker plush towels, and shedding reduces after subsequent washes and dries. This weight of towel also, fairly enough, takes longer to dry than the thinner options, naturally. Those two factors kept this one from being one of our very top winners, but it was a close finalist. The towel is also available in a whopping 25 color options, and in both bath towel and bath sheet sizes.\n\nBrooklinen Super-Plush Bath Towels, Set of 2 ($69; brooklinen.com)\n\nPHOTO: Brooklinen Brooklinen Super-Plush Bath Towels, Set of 2\n\nThere's a level of quality you know you're getting with Brooklinen (the brand's linen sheets were also among our top picks when we tested those), and part of that is the thoughtful and appealing package — the towels, like the sheets, come with a very cute canvas Brooklinen logo tote. Gift aside, though, the towels are also a high-caliber product: Indeed super plush, and very thick, and of generous size (58 inches by 30 inches for a bath towel, with bath sheets obviously bigger).\n\nThey're nice-looking on the towel rack and feel great against the skin, thanks to being crafted from 100% Turkish cotton and described as spa quality of extra thickness. We've established already that the level of plush a consumer wants in their towel is relative, and this one was closer to the Frontgate type. That is to say, one person in this household likened drying themselves with this to drying off with a stuffed animal. You can't buy these individually, only for $69 for a set of two — that limitation, plus the heavy-plush factor, were two detractors that ratcheted this one down to just below our winner's circle of bath towels. To that point, Brooklinen does offer classic, waffle and ultra-thin bath towel options, so if you're already loyal to this brand, you're likely to find one you'll love, and at a pretty good price point for the quality.\n\nCoyuchi Mediterranean Organic Towels ($58; coyuchi.com)\n\nPHOTO: Coyuchi Coyuchi Mediterranean Organic Towels\n\nCoyuchi's site explains that in Turkey, where bathing has been raised to an art, flat-weave towels are the traditional choice. The brand's Mediterranean Organic Towel is the response to that, and it's a pretty incredible, if possibly polarizing, one. Woven from yarn-dyed 100% organic cotton from the Aegean region of Turkey in a high-low-style weave and edged with a hand-knotted fringe, the towels are ultra thin. They're GOTS and Made Safe certified, and feel like a quality, sustainable product that you'd be happy to have hanging in your home.\n\nThey're also quite nice-looking: clean, fresh, spare, but with a hand-done feel. And that high-low-weave texture promises excellent absorption — and delivers. We found ourselves thoroughly dry within a few moments. And then, because of that efficient weave and super-thin texture, the towel also dries nearly as quickly as a dish towel in your kitchen.\n\nAnd here's the part that not everyone might love: Drying yourself with a Coyuchi also feels like drying yourself with a giant dish towel (or maybe a kitchen table runner that's 54 inches long). It's a different and interesting sensation, and not one we're sure we love for a cold winter morning in a chilly home. Off the Aegean coast on a beautiful summer night before a drink on a terrace somewhere, however, this might be entirely light and delightful.\n\nThe lightweight factor makes it terrific for travel and storage, and in theory, for laundering — it certainly takes less time to dry than a heavy terry towel. However, we found that the fringe once got caught in the lint screen, and when washed with other, heavier items, the Coyuchi towel got balled up like a thin T-shirt trapped inside a fitted sheet in the dryer, so it emerged all wrinkly. The brand recommends washing on delicate and hanging to dry, which is maybe more care than some people wish to give their towels. If you want a sustainable, minimal-gorgeous product that promises many years of use, you're willing to pay upward of $50 for a bath towel and you like a lighter drying experience, though, this may very well meet all of your needs.\n\nAmazon Basics Quick-Dry Towels, Set of 2 ($19.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Amazon Basics Quick-Dry Towels, Set of 2\n\nThe Amazon Basics Quick-Dry Towel is a lightweight product that achieves what it's advertised to do: After being hung over a banister for a mere two hours, it felt nearly fully dry. Made in an OEKO-TEX Standard 100 factory to meet independent environmental standards, these towels were absorbent and effective enough at drying. They come in eight bright or more muted colors and can be purchased in three-piece or eight-piece sets, including washcloths and hand towels, as well as in bath sheet sizes (though the standard bath towel size of 54 inches by 30 inches felt plenty sizable to us). These didn't rank higher in our testing, though, because they felt flimsy compared with the other towels we tested — something the price reflects, at less than $20 for a set of two. We also noted some loose threads in these towels after a few washes.\n\nRead more from CNN Underscored's hands-on testing:

(CNN) —\n\nFresh from siding with a baker who declined to make a cake to celebrate the wedding of a same-sex couple, the Supreme Court met behind closed doors on Thursday to consider a similar case concerning a florist in Washington state who declined to make a floral arrangement for a customer's same-sex wedding.\n\nHow the justices act on the petition in the case, called Arlene Flowers v. Washington, could offer hints about how quickly other such challenges pitting religious liberty versus LGBT rights return to the high court. If, for example, the justices vote to take up Arlene Flowers for next term, then they could reignite a raging debate that wasn't resolved in the narrow opinion they issued last Monday.\n\nIn siding with the baker, Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for a 7-2 majority, tailored his opinion to the specifics of the case at hand instead of issuing a broad ruling that could have impacted businesses across the country. Kennedy focused on the fact that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission had shown animus toward the baker's religious beliefs during an early proceeding in the case.\n\nThe commission's hostility was inconsistent with the First Amendment's guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion, Kennedy said.\n\nBut before the ink was dry, the ACLU, representing the gay couple behind the challenge, claimed that they had lost the battle but won the war.\n\nWriting an op-ed in the Washington Post, David Cole, the national director of the ACLU, emphasized that the court's holding was specific to the case at hand, and that the justices did not rule on arguments put forward by the baker arguing that Colorado had violated the baker's rights by compelling him to make one of his custom cakes in violation of his free speech rights. Cole wrote he had feared a much broader ruling.\n\nKennedy, could not have been more clear in rejecting the argument that there is a First Amendment right to discriminate, Cole wrote.\n\nThe case the court is considering\n\nBut a lawyer for the baker, Kristen Waggoner, praised Kennedy's opinion and believes it could apply to another one of her clients, Barronelle Stutzman, whose case is pending before the Supreme Court.\n\nStutzman refused to make a floral arrangement for long-time client Robert Ingersoll's same-sex wedding. In a statement, she said that while she serves everyone, she cannot create a custom floral arrangements that celebrates events or express messages at odds with my faith.\n\nShe has lost at the lower court level, but following the Masterpiece ruling on Monday, Waggoner said that Stutzman's case also touches on similar animus by the state.\n\nShe accused the Washington Attorney General of repeatedly and overtly demeaning her client's faith.\n\nIn Masterpiece Cakeshop, the US Supreme Court denounced government hostility towards the religious beliefs about marriage held by creative professionals like Jack Phillips and Barronelle Stutzman,she said. Such hostility exists when the government treats those people of faith worse than other business owners.\n\nAs the justices consider whether to take up the Arlene Flowers case that had been put on hold pending the result of Masterpiece, they have several options.\n\nThey could agree to hear it for next term, which would mean at least four justices might think that they have the votes for a broader First Amendment decision. Or they could deny to take it up which would let stand the lower court opinion and perhaps send a signal that the issue should percolate further in the lower courts. Or they could send the case back down to the lower court to consider it in light of the Masterpiece ruling.\n\nLawyer Joshua Matz, who filed a brief in support of the couple in Masterpiece, thinks the court will likely deny review.\n\nThe potential implications of a broad ruling on these free speech and religious exercise claims are extraordinary, Matz said.\n\nBased on their usual practice of allowing reflection and further development after issuing significant opinions like Masterpiece, it is doubtful that the Justices will immediately dive back into these treacherous waters, he said.\n\nIn his opinion, Kennedy warned that more challenges were inevitable.\n\nThe outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts, all in the context of recognizing that these disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market, he wrote.

Twenty-two-month-old Cooper Harris died after being left in the sweltering back seat of a car in June 2014 while his father, Justin Ross Harris, was at work. What seemed like a tragic accident took a shocking turn when, three months later, a Georgia grand jury indicted Harris on charges of murder. The case so far has been an emotional one, with the defense saying Harris was a loving father who experienced a tragic – but not unheard of – breach of memory. The prosecution, on the other hand, says Harris knew his son was in the car, and may have had personal reasons for wanting the boy out of his life. PHOTO: AFP/Getty Images Related Article Everything you need to know about hot car deaths While the case centers on Cooper's death, prosecutors plan to introduce evidence to support allegations that the churchgoing 35-year-old regularly sought sexual fulfillment outside his marriage and maintained a sordid online presence. Jury selection in Harris' trial is scheduled to start today. In May, Judge Mary Staley agreed to move the trial from Cobb County in metro Atlanta, saying that the defense made a substantive showing that extensive publicity may have prejudiced jurors. Harris' trial will be heard in Brunswick, a south Georgia coastal city, about 300 miles away from Cobb County. Here's an overview of the case. The death of Cooper Harris On June 18, 2014, Justin Ross Harris, then 33, strapped his son Cooper into his rear-facing carseat in the back seat of the car. Harris then drove the pair from their Marietta, Georgia, home to a nearby Chick-fil-A. Afterward, instead of dropping Cooper off at his day care, which was minutes from the restaurant, Harris continued to The Home Depot corporate headquarters where he worked. At 9:25 a.m. Harris arrived at work, leaving Cooper strapped in his car seat. Related Video Who is the father charged in child death? Later that morning, Harris and some co-workers left the corporate campus to go to lunch. Upon returning at approximately 12:45 that afternoon, Harris went to his car and opened the door to put away some lightbulbs he had bought during the lunch break. The defense says Harris did not notice his son, still in the backseat. According to medical examiners, Cooper was likely already dead. Sometime after 4 p.m., when Harris was driving toward a theater where he was supposed to see a movie, Harris says he noticed his son. Related Article Hot-car deaths spike as 21st child dies in overheated car this year\n\nHarris pulled into a shopping center parking lot roughly seven minutes after leaving the Home Depot campus. He pulled Cooper's lifeless body from the car. His screams attracted a crowd of onlookers, some of whom called 911 and others of whom attempted to help Harris administer first aid to Cooper.\n\nWitnesses said Harris was hyperventilating and screaming. Cobb County police Detective Phillip Stoddard testified that Harris swore at police when they arrived at the scene. Harris attempted to call his then-wife and Cooper's mother, Leanna Harris, but he did not get an answer.\n\nMeanwhile, Leanna Harris was already headed to the day care where her husband was supposed to have dropped off Cooper. When she learned Cooper had never arrived, witnesses said she came to an immediate conclusion.\n\nRoss must have left him in the car, she's reported as saying. There's no other explanation. Ross must have left him in the car.\n\nAt 10 p.m., Justin Ross Harris was arrested. An autopsy later confirmed that Cooper Harris died of hyperthermia.\n\nSuspicions and indictment\n\nEvery year, there are dozens of recorded cases of parents accidentally leaving their children in the back of cars. At first, news of Cooper's death seemed to be part of this phenomenon.\n\nHowever, in September, a grand jury returned an eight-count indictment against Justin Ross Harris. The charges included malice murder, two counts of felony murder and cruelty to children in the first degree.\n\nSome of the charges in Harris' indictment stemmed not from Cooper's death, but from Harris' alleged habit of sending sexual text messages to underage girls. According to prosecutors, Harris was having these illicit chats with as many as six women on the day his son died.\n\nInvestigators found Harris made online searches in the days before Cooper's death related directly to babies in hot cars, and one search for how to survive prison.\n\nWhen Harris was being held at the police precinct the day of Cooper's death, Detective Stoddard said he seemed preoccupied with his own fate.\n\nIt was all about him: 'I can't believe this is happening to me. Why am I being punished for this?'\n\nStoddard also said Leanna Harris asked her husband, Did you say too much?\n\nInvestigators for the prosecution questioned details of the incident. They conducted tests that showed Harris could have seen Cooper in the back seat of the car from his position in the front seat. They also discovered Harris received a group email that day from Cooper's day care that apparently failed to jog his memory.\n\nUpon signing off on the indictment, Cobb County Chief Magistrate Frank Cox also remarked that Harris should have noticed that the stench in the car was overwhelming upon entering the car that afternoon.\n\nInfidelity and online activity\n\nStrange Web searches weren't the only remarkable things about Justin Ross Harris' online life. An investigation into his Internet habits found Harris was active on several dating sites, as well as messaging apps like Kik and Whisper.\n\nOn Whisper, an app that encourages people to tell secrets, Stoddard testified that Harris wrote I miss having time to myself and said he hated being married with kids. Harris also visited a child-free message board on Reddit.\n\nAt a hearing in February, the prosecution alleged Harris met with prostitutes and other women in the days before his son died. The assistant district attorney in the case said Harris' sexual behavior interrupted time he spent with Cooper, citing a time when Harris allegedly sent pictures of his genitalia to women while attending an Atlanta Braves baseball game with his son.\n\nDivorce and second indictment\n\nEvidence showed Leanna Harris was previously aware of her husband's infidelity. She filed for divorce in February 2016, saying the marriage is irretrievably broken.\n\nIn March 2016, the Cobb County district attorney indicted Harris on eight additional counts related to his sexual activity with minors, including two counts of sexual exploitation of minors.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nCobb District Attorney Vic Reynolds said his team was disappointed in the change of venue, but that, whenever and wherever this case is set for trial, the state will be ready.\n\nBoth the prosecution and defense will now meet to see if they can agree on a venue within the state of Georgia. If they can't agree, the decision again falls to the judge. The Harrises lived in Cobb County.\n\nIf Harris is convicted of murder, he faces life in prison. The prosecution has chosen not to seek the death penalty.\n\nCNN's John Newsome contributed to this report.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden is not the right Democratic candidate for 2020. And yet, he may soon enter the Democratic race.\n\nThus far, what has been most remarkable is how diverse the field is shaping up to be. This is not your traditional slate of Democratic candidates. Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Peter Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang and several others are already up and running. And more are likely to follow.\n\nThe composition of the Democratic field represents the diversity of the country. With so many serious frontrunners who are not, for a change, older white men, the Democrats are showing that they are a party representing the future of the country. In contrast to the kind of rhetoric that has come from President Donald Trump, an ode to the whiteness and masculinity of a limited American political tradition, the Democrats are making a strong statement about what their party is all about.\n\nAnd their opening speeches reflect that reality as well. They have revolved around issues such as racial justice, gender equity, immigration rights and more. Even a candidate like Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is being tagged as the moderate with bipartisan appeal, proclaimed: Stop the fear-mongering and stop the hate. We may come from different places. We may pray in different ways. We may look different. And love different. But all live in the same country of shared dreams.\n\nThen comes Biden. The former vice president has every right to run and certainly has a great deal to offer. During his career in the Senate and in the White House, Biden was a strong champion of the middle class. He pushed for the kinds of policies that Trump, despite all his promises to the forgotten Americans, never pursued. As vice president, he headed the Middle Class Task Force, which championed policies such as capping student loan payments and improving retirement security. He was even ahead of President Barack Obama on the issue of same-sex marriage.\n\nAlso, as an older white male (who would be 78 years old in January 2021), there are a number of Democrats who see him as the safe choice, the only person who will be able to withstand the President's testosterone-filled campaign. And CNN polling shows that right now most believe he would do best in a matchup against the President.\n\nBut is Biden really the best answer for the party? There is good reason for Democrats to be skeptical and to consider supporting other candidates.\n\nMost problematic is the fact that Biden has run for the presidency several times, and each time he has struggled under the intense spotlight. When it comes time to hit the campaign trail, Biden has never been able to generate the level of support that is necessary to win. His tendency to make gaffes has also hurt him. And, in our frenzied news cycle with endless outlets and few filters on information, Biden's style will cause problems again.\n\nOf course, these issues didn't stop Trump in 2016. But unlike Trump, it is unclear that without a comparable partisan media outlet (Fox News) and unyielding partisan loyalty, that Biden would survive. While MSNBC could offer a boost to Biden, social scientists have shown that the conservative media has a much stronger hold on conservative viewers than liberal outlets. Conservatives also tend to be more ideologically homogenous and loyal than their counterparts on the left. In other words, Democrats have seen the challenges that the inevitable frontrunner faces, as the election actually takes shape.\n\nMore important, though, is the moment in which we are living. Trump has run a political operation from the White House that has revolved around a vision of white nationalism that challenges the values of pluralism, diversity and inclusion. His statement after Charlottesville forever marked his term in office. And the President's perpetual struggle to build a wall perfectly captures what he hopes to achieve – with his central goal being about keeping people out rather than bringing them in.\n\nWith so many strong candidates already lined up to run in the Democratic primaries, many of whom who have launched their runs with the kind of gravitas and excitement that bodes well for a presidential campaign, there is a risk of someone like Biden being in the race – someone with the potential to suck up all the oxygen in the room. Uncle Joe could quickly take away media attention and campaign funds from Democrats who would perform better in the general election. If Biden was the nominee, he would also throw cold water on the excitement and energy that exists among younger Democrats about the direction of their party.\n\nThe Democrats should not assume that an older, moderate white man is inevitably the strongest candidate. Even Bernie Sanders offers a fresh perspective with his left of center, Democratic Socialist positions (he would also be notable as a Jewish-American nominee). It is possible to see the virtue of a ticket that embodies diversity from the top down. All of the candidates who are currently running would enable the Democrats to showcase the difference in what the party represents compared to the GOP. As a new article in The New York Times shows, the GOP is bleeding young voters with each passing day of the Trump presidency.\n\nWith Biden at the top of the ticket, it would be much more difficult to generate enthusiasm among African-Americans, Latinos or younger voters, for instance, who will be looking to Democrats to prove that they will offer something fundamentally different. While there are early polls showing substantial numbers of African-Americans backing Biden and Sanders, these don't measure the excitement that might be generated on the campaign trail once the other candidates are better known and once their political skills have been proven.\n\nAnd Biden's pivotal role on the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act, which was foundational to the expansion of the mass incarceration system, will come back to haunt him. Like Hillary Clinton, he will have to reckon with his vote authorizing President George W. Bush to use military force in Iraq, baggage that the younger generation of Democrats won't be carrying onto the campaign trail.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nMeanwhile, many educated, suburban women are looking for a candidate who will take seriously the message of the #metoo movement. This is a social movement that has rocked American society, bringing attention to the horrendous ways in which sexism and sexual assault continue to play out in many of our major industries and in our private lives. They won't be happy to hear about his role in the 1991 Clarence Thomas hearings, where he was one of the many senators who did not take seriously the sexual harassment complaints of Anita Hill. He was part of the reason that 1992 saw a surge in female candidates.\n\nThe most successful Democrat in recent decades was Barack Obama, who mobilized a powerful electoral coalition because of the change he represented for the Democratic Party – not because he was the party's safe choice.\n\nOf course, Biden has a right to run – should he so choose. But before Democrats go overboard in shifting their financial and organizational resources, as well as endorsements, to the former vice president, they should think long and hard about whether they want the face of their party to be someone who represents the past – or the future.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\nWOLF BLITZER: We're counting down the final seconds of trading on Wall Street where the Dow -- listen to it -- it's ending right now on a record high. Listen to the bells. Topping the previous milestone, look at this -- 14,254. That's not necessarily the final number, but it is a high.\n\n\n\nCNN's business chief correspondent, Ali Velshi, CNN's business correspondent Christine Romans, they are all standing by.\n\n\n\nBut let's go over to Alison Kosik. She's over at the New York Stock Exchange right now.\n\n\n\nAlison, what's the reaction?\n\n\n\nALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: What's funny is as excited as the headlines make this out to be, with the Dow hitting and not just hitting but blowing pats an all-time high, Wolf, and making history today, despite all of that, I just didn't see the excitement on the floor today. No confetti, no cheers.\n\n\n\nAnd it's really the numbers that tell the story. When you look at the board at the other numbers, the volume of trading that happened here on the floor today, the numbers of trades was actually really low. And one trader puts it this way. Usually when the markets get to these new highs, you see tripled the volume. Instead, we're seeing less than usually today, so it's really lacking the excitement.\n\n\n\nBut, yes, no doubt about it, it's a huge milestone even though much of the rally is being fed by the Fed's stimulus. The Federal Reserve is pumping $85 billion into the economy. It's buying up treasuries. It's buying up mortgage-backed securities every month. What's that doing it is pushing interest rates lower and it's essentially moving investors from the bond market right into the stock market where really it's the best game in town to make money.\n\n\n\nNow, skeptics know that the Fed isn't going to keep juicing the economy forever. It's a big part of the reason we didn't see the champagne bottles popping today. The mood is very different today compared to where we were when we were at this level back in 2007. Traders on the floor today are pretty sarcastic about the excitement about this, Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Hold on a second, Alison. I want to bring in Christine Romans into this conversation.\n\n\n\nChristine, there seems to be a disconnect between the state of the economy right now and the state of Wall Street.\n\n\n\nCHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: There's a lot of conflicting signals about what is going on in the economy right now and quite frankly and there's lot of theatrics in Washington.\n\n\n\nWhat's happening on Wall Street is companies -- the Dow is 30 stocks. Those 30 stocks are representative of what is happening for those 30 companies. They got a lot of cash on the books, they got a lot of money in the bank and they got profits coming in from overseas and they're doing better.\n\n\n\nSo that's why you're seeing those stocks doing well. And that's the 30 stocks. But your 401(k) probably more likely is represented by the S&P 500. That's 500 different stocks. But, remember, Wolf, 53 percent of Americans, according to the most recent Gallup poll on this, 53 percent of Americans own stock, say they are exposed to the stock market. There are a lot of people who looked at this milestone and say, this means nothing for me. I don't have a job or I'm not comfortable in my job or I don't have a 401(k) or stocks and so this is really symbolic for the investing class, not necessarily for Main Street, Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Let me bring Ali into this conversation .\n\n\n\nThere seems to be, Ali, a disconnect between Wall Street and what's going on here in Washington, the forced spending cuts, the deadline for making sure that the government does not shut down. A debt ceiling has got to be raised again pretty soon. So what's going on? Would any of those issues devalue this rally?\n\n\n\nALI VELSHI, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Remember, we're talking about $85 billion in cuts with the forced budget cuts going into effect over the next seven months. The Fed, as Alison pointed out, puts $85 billion or thereabouts into the economy every single month.\n\n\n\nThat's the money they print. Take a look at this. Christine was just talking about the people who are not affected by this. And 53 percent of people own stocks. The other 47 percent do benefit. This is a chart of job creation all the way since the beginning of 2009. These are companies. This is private sectors hiring people.\n\n\n\nIt's not been like the stock market where the stock market has gone sort of like this. The job market has kind of sputtered around a little bit, but these jobs are coming from the private sector and that, back to your question, Wolf, is where the problem comes in.\n\n\n\nWe have already seen layoff notices, furlough notices going out. We heard at Lockheed Martin that there will layoffs. Where you're seeing iffy job creation around here, you could start to see that go down while the stock market continues its surge forward. That's the disconnect. There's a disconnect between the economy which most people think of more as jobs and GDP, plus the stock market and what the government is doing.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Ali, Christine, Alison, guys, thanks very much. Much more on this story coming up later.\n\n\n\nBut there's other news we're following, including the treacherous driving conditions right now on Midwest roads and the Mid-Atlantic region, including right here in nation's capital, Washington, D.C., next in line. A major winter storm is blasting eastward and for millions and millions of people in its path, this will be their biggest snowfall of the season.\n\n\n\nOur meteorologist, Alexandra Steele, is at the CNN Severe Weather Center. She's tracking the storm for us.\n\n\n\nBut first let's go to Chicago right now. CNN's Ted Rowlands is there on the streets. The snow is already falling.\n\n\n\nWhat's the latest expectation there, Ted?\n\n\n\nTED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, it's been snowing all day. The wind has picked up now creating more problems. The bottom line, this storm is hammering much of the Midwest.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nROWLANDS (voice-over): Across the upper Midwest, driving was treacherous as snow continued to fall throughout the day. Salt trucks in Chicago were out in force trying to keep the freeways open before the evening commute. In some parts of North Dakota and Minnesota, more than a foot of snow is expected to fall.\n\n\n\nAirports are struggling to keep planes flying at O'Hare, where about 900 flights have been canceled. The normally packed United terminal was near empty Tuesday.\n\n\n\nFashion designer Mark Dafang (ph) is trying to get home to Charlotte to deal with a family emergency.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: They say it was canceled so I got a ticket to the flight and now it's canceled again. So, now I have no idea which flight I'm going to go on. So, I'm going to ask them again. Hopefully, I get on a plane and go home. Yes, I want to go home badly.\n\n\n\nROWLANDS: Most schools and many businesses around Chicago were closed Tuesday. Those that had to come into the city were having a tough time getting around.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: These main streets, they look OK, but when you go on the ulterior streets, they are really bad.\n\n\n\nROWLANDS: This is the third major storm to slam the Midwest in as many weeks. While many people say they are ready for spring, a few people we met say they actually like this.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm a skier, so what more can you ask? (END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nROWLANDS: Most people, though, Wolf, don't like it. You see these people walking across the Chicago River, some going to buses and trains. The commute just starting now and it's going to be an ugly one around Chicago tonight.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Not only there, but a whole bunch of other places as well. Ted, thank you.\n\n\n\n(WEATHER UPDATE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: There's a new recommendation for how many U.S. troops should remain in Afghanistan after all troops are supposed to be out at the end of next year. 2014, that's when the majority of the force is supposed to leave, if not all of the troops.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. plans to keep some troops there. The head of the U.S. military's Central Command now telling the Senate Armed Services Committee today that he recommends that 13,600 American service members remain in Afghanistan in 2015 and beyond.\n\n\n\nLast month, when he was still defense secretary, Leon Panetta said up to 12,000 U.S. troops should remain in Afghanistan, remain behind. How much maintaining all of those troops in Afghanistan starting in 2015 will cost U.S. taxpayers, who will foot the bill for all of that, questions that have not been answered, but it will be in the billions and billions of dollars.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a possible presidential contender in 2016 talking immigration with CNN's Jake Tapper. Jeb Bush sits down with Jake.\n\n\n\nPlus, former federal drug chiefs urging the government to crack down on states that have legalized recreational marijuana. We're going to debate the controversial issue this hour right here in THE SITUATION ROOM.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: The Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is said to be in the worst condition since his most recent surgery almost three months ago. And now Venezuelan officials are alleging that the United States, the Obama administration is behind Chavez's poor health and that they are trying to kill them. And they are kicking out at least two U.S. Embassy personnel.\n\n\n\nCNN's Shasta Darlington is joining us the Venezuelan capital of Caracas right now.\n\n\n\nShasta, what's going on? What are you hearing?\n\n\n\nSHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, it's been a pretty interesting day, puzzling to say the least.\n\n\n\nAs you mentioned, we have had this news since last night that Chavez's health has taken a turn for the worse and today the vice president, the man who is in charge with Hugo Chavez is recovering, Vice President Nicolas Maduro, met with top ministers and military brass and then called a press conference.\n\n\n\nWe expected to get more details on his health. And instead what we heard was a rambling one-hour press conference where he accused the U.S. military attaches of plotting to destabilize the government and even accused foreign enemies of causing Chavez's illness.\n\n\n\nTake a listen to this.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nNICOLAS MADURO, VENEZUELAN VICE PRESIDENT (through translator): The situation is one of complication amid the battle of our president for his health. The infection that is being treated now, it is a severe infection. As we told you yesterday that there are complications and worsening of the respiratory function. And the medical team is working flat out and our people are praying to provide and bring God's energy so that he can overcome this difficult moment as he has before.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDARLINGTON: That may not have been actually the one sound bite I was talking about. There was another time when Maduro said foreign enemies had caused this disease and that time and tests would show that foreign enemies were to blame. Again, he also said this was the lowest point in his health since he had undergone surgery and they said there would be an update later this evening about his health situation.\n\n\n\nBut many Venezuelans are sitting back wondering what has happened. They haven't seen him in public for three months and that's what they really want to hear, Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: When he makes this extraordinary allegation that foreign enemies, his words, foreign enemies, were behind this severe infection of Hugo Chavez, in effect he's saying that they tried to kill him, they are trying to kill him. The same breath he says that they are expelling two U.S. embassy officials, two U.S. military attaches.\n\n\n\nThe foreign enemies, is he saying directly, basically, that the United States has tried to kill Hugo Chavez?\n\n\n\nDARLINGTON: No, Wolf, they didn't go so far. They sort of separate these two different ideas. When he was talking about the military attaches, what he said is they had made contact with Venezuela military personnel to try to convince them to become involved in plots to destabilize the armed forces, but he didn't go into detail.\n\n\n\nAnd then as far as the attacking the health of Chavez, again, no details, he spoke of inoculations. He made a reference to Arafat. But all very vague, no details. In the sense, what it seems to me is that he really trying to drum up support from Chavez's very avid, almost religious-like supporters because this is the man, after all, who will have to run in elections if Chavez either dies or isn't capable of assuming the full responsibilities of the presidency, Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: And we should point out, officials here in Washington flatly denied these allegations against these U.S. embassy personnel, the accusations hurled against them for the expulsion of these two Americans.\n\n\n\nAll right. We'll stay in close touch with you, Shasta. Thanks very much.\n\n\n\nHe's one of the most talked about Republican names for the next presidential election and in his new book the former Florida Governor Jeb Bush tackles one of the most contentious issues facing the party, facing the country, we should say at the same time. That would be immigration. He tried to clarify his position in an interview with our chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nJAKE TAPPER, CNN CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: One of the most contentious issues, as you know, is whether or not those in the country illegally now should be provided a path to citizenship. You in the past have supported a path.\n\n\n\nJEB BUSH (R), FORMER FLORIDA GOVERNOR: Yes.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: The book suggests that if you're in the country illegally, you can get a legal status but you can't have a path to citizenship unless you go back to your country and get in the back of the line.\n\n\n\nBUSH: Yes. So, I have supported both, both the path to legalization or the path to citizenship, with the underlying principle being there should be no incentive of people to come illegally at the expense of coming legally. Today, basically, the only path to come to this country other than family reunification is to come illegally. We need to create another category of legal immigration where people -- where there is actually a line.\n\n\n\nSo if you could create that through a path to citizenship, I would support that.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: So you say you've supported both. Where are you --\n\n\n\nBUSH: In other words, instead of saying send people back that are here illegally, which was kind of the mantra of 2006, '07, and '08 amongst Republicans, I've always felt that you could not deal with 11 million people and saying, See you later.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: One of the proposals in your book is that those petitions -- those who petition because their family members are here --\n\n\n\nBUSH: Yes. TAPPER: -- should be narrowed. Family petition should only be for spouses and for minor children. No more cousins, grandmas. Instead, those slots should go to high-skilled labor?\n\n\n\nBUSH: Not just high-skilled but labor in general.\n\n\n\nWe're the only country that has this broad definition of family reunification. We're the only country. No other country in the world does this. And the net effect is we have what's called chain migration. So, if your brother is petitioned -- your adult brother is petitioned and your parents, then their brothers and their parents --\n\n\n\nTAPPER: And it goes on forever.\n\n\n\nBUSH: And it's gone on forever for 30 years and it has crowded out all the other categories to the extent that we really don't have what traditionally has existed in the United States, which is a simple category of I want to come to the United States and pursue my dreams. We don't have that.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: You will be criticized by immigrant groups for a --\n\n\n\nBUSH: Yes.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: -- rather -- you can call it pragmatic, you can call it cold, you can call it self-interested but for changing it so it's no longer: let's help Uncle Julio get in this country because he's a family member --\n\n\n\nBUSH: Right.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: -- and we love him, but instead let's give this slot to somebody who can help the American economy?\n\n\n\nBUSH: There are people who would love to this country who don't have relatives here that could make an immediate contribution. And is it -- is it wrong for our country to have a strategic approach to immigration? I don't think so. I think we should take all of the highly skilled people that we can -- that want to come.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: How do you convince Republicans that they need to be part of this?\n\n\n\nBUSH: I think there is a growing consensus that not that immigration is the driver of people's decisions but it's a gateway issue. It's an issue that does allow Republicans if they are engaged in it to make their case to a broader -- on a broader suite of issues than what we're allowed today. Today, basically, if you keep being against things, particularly something that has -- where you have emotional connectivity, as immigration is for a lot of emerging voting groups, you're not going to have a chance to even make your case.\n\n\n\nSo, I think there's an awareness of that.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: And Jake Tapper is joining us now.\n\n\n\nJake, let's talk a little bit about this interview (AUDIO GAP) your reaction. Listen, for example, the very sharp words just uttered by the Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Listen to this.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. HARRY REID (D-NV), MAJORITY LEADER: What we should do about that is let's wait for a few minutes and see how Jeb Bush changes his mind again. His opinion on immigration is not evolving, it's devolving. He keeps going backward. I think he's frankly made a fool of himself the last 24 hours.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Those are pretty strong words from Harry Reid. In the book, he doesn't support a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants but now he is leaving that open. So what is really going on here?\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Well, a couple of things. First of all, I think the intention of former Governor Jeb Bush was to start a conversation about immigration reform by putting a platform and a plan and a proposal out there in the time between him handing in his book, his manuscript in November and it being published. The conversation kind of evolved beyond where he was and where the conversation was among Republicans in November.\n\n\n\nI think, as he said in the interview, he has supported both, a pathway to citizenship for people in the country illegally and his current proposal does not have that same path to citizenship, it has a path to residency. For him, Jeb Bush argues this isn't about the particular -- he could support either one -- the point is to get an immigration reform bill signed into law.\n\n\n\nBLTIZER: And so, do you think there's a significant difference between where he stands on this and his Floridian, the Florida Senator Marco Rubio who clearly is on board for a pathway to citizenship?\n\n\n\nTAPPER: There is a difference in terms of the proposal that Jeb Bush makes. But I think ultimately if Jeb Bush were in the Senate or were the president, I don't think it would matter. I think he's showing that he's flexible on this issue. Some might call it a flip- flop. Some might have harsher language, as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid does.\n\n\n\nBut the point as far as Jeb Bush is concerned, we need to do something, something needs to be accomplished. He doesn't seem to be bothered by the criticism. His position is: look, the system we have right now does not work. Whatever we come forward and propose as a solution is better than the unworkable reality of today.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: We're going to have more of your interview in our 6:00 p.m. Eastern hour, Jake, including the possibility, a possibility, he's leaving it open, that he might run for presidency in 2016.\n\n\n\nIs there a third Bush potentially in the run for president? We'll talk about that and a lot. You'll be back.\n\n\n\nJake, thanks very much.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Two states have now legalized recreational marijuana use. Some former federal drug chiefs say Washington needs to crack down on those states. Get ready. We have a debate on this specific issue, and that's next.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Eight former heads of the federal government's Drug Enforcement Administration are urging President Obama to crack down on recreational marijuana use. They say the government is running out of time to nullify laws recently passed in Washington state and Colorado that makes pot use illegal.\n\n\n\nIn a letter to senators, the former DEA chiefs say this, We the undersigned strongly support the continued enforcement of federal law prohibiting the cultivation, distribution, sale, possession and use of marijuana -- a dangerous and addictive drug which already has severe harmful effects on American society.\n\n\n\nThe letter goes on to say, Ask for the canard that marijuana is a legitimate medicine, the overwhelming consensus of the accredited medical and scientific communities declare that it is not.\n\n\n\nSo, let's discuss what's going on with the former DEA administrator, Asa Hutchinson, one of the signers of this letter; and Democratic Congressman Jared Polis of Colorado, his state -- home state has approved marijuana use, recreational marijuana use.\n\n\n\nCongressman, first to you. They say it's a dangerous, addictive drug which would have a harmful effect on American society. What do you say?\n\n\n\nREP. JARED POLIS (D), COLORADO: You know what? Same tired rhetoric. We're talking about people who have been on the gravy train of drug war, both in the public side, to the DEA, as well as making millions of dollars through consulting on this drug war. Of course, they are going to be against it.\n\n\n\nIt's not only the criminal cartels that benefit from the drug war, it's also the professional drug warriors. And they are benefiting to the tune of millions and millions of dollars and kids are abusing drugs. So, we need to take actions, like the state of Colorado, to make sure that it's regulated, keep it out of the hands of kids and keep it out of the hands of gangs and criminal cartels.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: So, Asa Hutchinson, as you can see, he supports regulation but not banning marijuana. What's the difference between marijuana and alcohol?\n\n\n\nASA HUTCHINSON, FORMER DEA ADMINISTRATOR: Well, let me just go to where we are right now, the purpose of the letter by eight bipartisan served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, that we have a conflict between state and federal law. There's three options for the Department of Justice. One, you can ignore it, let that conflict exist. Secondly, you can file suit and have a clarification as to whether state action is a violation of federal law. Or three, you could crack down, I suppose, in terms of enforcement actions. I don't believe that should be the case. I think we need a clarification, which would be filing suit, similar to what the Obama administration did against Arizona on the immigration issue. Let's file suit. Let's have a clarification because this conflict cannot continue to exist. What happens in Colorado on this issue is not going to stay in Colorado. It's going to cascade across America, and it needs to be clarified now.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: And I want to get to that because there is a momentum out there in other states as well. You're right on that. But explain why alcohol should be regulated but marijuana is different, and then I'm going to let the congressman respond.\n\n\n\nHUTCHINSON: Well, that is a debate that could be conducted in the halls of Congress. Whenever you're looking at marijuana, it's a harmful drug. If you legalize it, it's going to expand use. Certainly our democracy is not going to fall if you legalize it. It's a question that our country needs to decide, and it's a fair debate. The congressman has a bill where we would nationalize and legalize it across, say, the national basis. That's a fair debate. I'm just saying, let's don't go two directions where you have a state law and state action that directly conflicts with federal action. That's a recipe for disaster in our country.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All, right, Congressman, respond.\n\n\n\nPOLIS: Yes, look. In answer to your question, Wolf, marijuana is a harmful drug. Asa and I agree on that. There's no doubt about it. Alcohol is a harmful drug. Tobacco is a harmful drug. It's a question of how harmful, how addictive, how best to deal with it in society? The policy of prohibition has failed. It's time to replace it with a new policy like the voters of Colorado approved by a 10-point margin.\n\n\n\nLook, ideally, of course. We want to change the law at the national level. In the meantime, the President Obama administration's approach, as articulated through the (INAUDIBLE) memo of essentially establishing lowest enforcement priority for states that have legal sale of medical marijuana and hopefully the next states that have legal sale of regulated marijuana is the best that the Obama administration can do in the meantime.\n\n\n\nSo, of course, they need to focus the limited drug enforcement resources after the real hazard here. And I think Asa and I agree, the meth houses, heroin addiction -- these are real problems, and the law enforcement role in (INAUDIBLE) them is very real. Let's not focus on recreational use in marijuana.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Go ahead and respond, Asa Hutchinson.\n\n\n\nHUTCHINSON: That shouldn't be the federal priority. It's not recreational use. But the federal priority is to enforce federal law. And that does not have to be done by raids. It doesn't have to be done by enforcement actions, but it needs to be clarified, just again like they did in Arizona. There can be a declaratory action in federal court which determines whether the state action that violates federal law should continue or not. That's the proper venue to resolve the issue.\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration and Department of Justice is evaluating this. I think they still can make the decision that they can not just simply turn their back on what's a clear violation of federal law.\n\n\n\nPOLIS: Look, our state of Colorado, the state of Washington, are well along in a thoughtful process, a bipartisan process, a multi- stakeholder process of coming up with sensible regulations about marijuana. The last thing they need is interference or a lawsuit from the federal government.\n\n\n\nBLIZTER: There's a lot of money at stake, Asa Hutchinson in this whole debate. And at a time of financial distress in the country and budget deficits and all of that, spending all this money to prosecute recreational marijuana users, throw some of them in jail -- obviously that's very, very expensive. Can't the federal government use those funds in a smarter way?\n\n\n\nHUTCHINSON: Well, the federal government does not prosecute recreational marijuana users. That is the flat truth. That's a decision up to the states as to how they handle that issue, so take it up with them. In terms of resources, that's not the priority. That is not happening.\n\n\n\nIf you're being looking at tax revenue, that is an argument for regulation and legalization. Let that argument happen in the marketplace. Colorado, you know, did their sovereign choice of passing this initiative. We got ourselves in a box here. We have federal law conflicting with state law, and it should not just simply be left there with no consequence or with no determination of this. And clarification.\n\n\n\nIf this -- if there's no action by the Obama administration within five years, there will be legalization of marijuana across the United States, in my judgment. And so I think what is happening in the Department of Justice, this decision is critically important, not just for Colorado but for Arkansas and Missouri and every state that's going to have to be dealing with this issue in the coming years.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: We're almost out of time. But Congressman Polis, I'll give you the last word. Should state laws in this particular case regulate are marijuana trump federal law?\n\n\n\nPOLIS: Absolutely. We need to change federal law. I agree with Asa. We need to legalize marijuana nationally. But in the meantime, the best thing the federal government can do is just step back, make it clear it's a low-enforcement policy, and let the experiments in the states begin a more rational drug policy for our country.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Jared Polis and Asa Hutchinson, a good debate, a debate that's going to continue. Thanks to both of you for coming in.\n\n\n\nPOLIS: Thank you.\n\n\n\nHUTCHINSON: You it.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: While we're waiting to see when the cardinals at the Vatican will pick a new pope, the Vatican is waiting as well. Coming up, we're going to tell you why the cardinals can't yet start the conclave.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Cardinals at the Vatican are deciding a little bit closer -- they are trying to decide when they will begin the conclave that will choose the next pope. Lisa Sylvester is monitoring that and some of the other top stories in THE SITUATION ROOM right now. They are almost ready but not quite?\n\n\n\nLISA SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Almost but not quite, Wolf. The Vatican is actually awaiting the arrival of the last five cardinals, who can cast a vote for the next pope. But it they won't say when they will get there. Preparations for the conclave are already in full swing. The Sistine Chapel has been closed to the public. American Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston says right now is an important time of prayer and reflection. And the archbishop emeritus of Washington, D.C., Cardinal Theodore McCarrick will join us here in THE SITUATION ROOM in the 6 p.m. hour.\n\n\n\nAnd in other news, a dozen former students face manslaughter charges over the hazing death of a Florida A&M student back in 2011. The parents of Robert Champion say the new charge is appropriate, but a lawyer for one of the students says this is designed to pressure his client into accepting a deal with jail time. The defendents face a maximum of 15 years in prison if convicted.\n\n\n\nAnd you've got to take a look at this. All right. A man who tried to rob a Dunkin Donuts in Connecticut, he got a faceful of hot coffee instead. Yes, the aspiring robber, he asked the cashier to make change for a hundred-dollar bill at a drive-thru. When the worker refused, the man tried to climb in the window to rob the store. The clerk threw a cup, and then a whole pot of coffee at his face. Yes, police are now looking for that suspect. So, don't mess with that clerk! I'm telling you, do not mess with that clerk. Trying to rob a Dunkin Donuts, knowing they have hot coffee?\n\n\n\nBLITZER: I don't necessarily recommend his behavior (INAUDIBLE) he's OK. But God forbid if that guy would have had a gun or something, he could have been in trouble.\n\n\n\nSYLVESTER: Yes. That was one of those, what were you thinking kind of things, Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Fortunately he's okay. I hope they find that bad guy. Thanks very much.\n\n\n\nQuestions swirling around the United States Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg. She's now approaching 80. Here's the question: will she retire? Our senior legal analyst, Jeffrey Toobin, asked her about it. He's standing by live. Stay with us.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: There's a certain delicate balance on the United States Supreme Court right now. Five conservative leading justices, including one who's an occasional swing vote. Four justices who are clearly liberal leaning. Knowing how precious each vote is, court insiders are now keeping an eye on Ruth Bader Ginsburg. If she retires, President Obama could appoint a third justice, another huge part of his legacy.\n\n\n\nJoining us now, our CNN senior legal analyst, Jeffrey Toobin. He's in New York to discuss what's going on. He's the author of the book The Oath: The Obama White House and The Supreme Court. He recently had a chance to speak with Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\n\n\nShe's about to turn 80. You asked her, Jeff, if she's thinking about retiring and let me read to you what she said.\n\n\n\nShe said as long as I can do the job full steam, you can never tell when you're my age. But as long as I think I have the candle power, I will do it, next year for certain. After that, who knows? What do you think? What's going on?\n\n\n\nJEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Well, I think there's a paradox about Justice Ginsburg now because she is at once the top of her game. She is now the senior liberal on the court. She had a very well regarded opinion in the health care case last year.\n\n\n\nShe has united the liberals in many cases. They speak with one voice. But at the same time, she recognized she's turning 80 and she has great regard for Barack Obama. It is clear that there is a real kinship between the two of them.\n\n\n\nAnd I think in President Obama's third year, you notice Justice Ginsburg said not this year, not next year, but I do think in his third year Justice Ginsburg will retire and give President Obama a chance to fill the seat.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: And not wait until the next president who could potentially be a Republican. It would be a very different kind of court if that were -- if she were replaced, let's say, by a conservative-leaning justice. Give us a little thought of how she has shaped the court.\n\n\n\nTOOBIN: Well, you know, the irony about Justice Ginsburg is that she shaped the court more as a lawyer than as a justice. In the 1970s, she was sort of the turgid marshal of the women's rights movement. She brought case after case that really succeeded in creating equal justice under the law for women.\n\n\n\nBut since she joined the court when President Clinton appointed her in 1993, it's been mostly a conservative court. So in most of the big cases, whether it's Citizens United or Bush V. Gore, she's been in the minority.\n\n\n\nYes, she was in the majority in the health care case, but she has not had the good luck to be in a liberal moment as a liberal justice.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Can we assume she will support same-sex marriage, marriage equality in these upcoming decisions?\n\n\n\nTOOBIN: Well, we sort of talked around that issue a lot in my New Yorker story and I think in the defense of marriage act case, the case that challenges the constitutionality of the law that says the federal government will not recognize same-sex marriages, even in states where it's legal, I think it's pretty clear she will vote to declare that law unconstitutional.\n\n\n\nI think the Proposition 8 case, the case that challenges California's ban on same-sex marriage. I think her position is a little harder to tell. She does not believe in grand pronouncements, even liberal grand pronouncements from the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nSo I think if she rules in favor of same-sex marriage, it will only be in California, not some broad ruling for the whole country.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Jeffrey Toobin has written an excellent article in the New Yorker magazine as he always does. Jeff, thanks very much.\n\n\n\nTOOBIN: Thanks, Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Drone strikes on Americans on U.S. soil. It's a shocking scenario, but one that the attorney general of the United States says is possible to imagine. We're going live to the Pentagon.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: A lethal drone strike on an American citizen on U.S. soil. The attorney general of the United States, Eric Holder, won't completely role out such a shocking scenario. Our Pentagon correspondent Chris Lawrence is working that story for us. Chris, what is going on here?\n\n\n\nCHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, this has got to come as a bit shock to a lot of Americans who may not have imagined that the U.S. government could assert this kind of power here inside the United States. Basically, Senator Rand Paul wanted some explanation about how much power the government has to go after citizens. He got that clarification and therefore now so do we.\n\n\n\nIn a letter, the Attorney General Eric Holder wrote to Rand Paul. He said that authorizing a drone strike against an American citizen right here on U.S. soil that would be a hypothetical situation, unlikely to occur and something he hoped no president would ever have to do.\n\n\n\nBut, quote, It is possible, I suppose, to imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the president to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States.\n\n\n\nThe letter goes on to give examples, such as the impending attack on, say, Pearl Harbor from 1941 or the attacks on September 11th, 2001. In a separate letter, the nominee to be the CIA director, John Brennan, said this would not be a mission that the CIA could authorize. It would have to come from the president himself -- Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Hold on a second, Chris, because I want to bring Jeffrey Toobin into this conversation. Jeff, if it's OK, if it's legal for a U.S. drone to kill an American citizen on foreign soil whether in Yemen or Somalia or Afghanistan or someplace else, what is the difference between using a U.S. drone to target an assassination of an American citizen on U.S. soil?\n\n\n\nTOOBIN: Well, it is a different situation. The federal government has more limited powers under the constitution within the United States, but it still has a lot of powers here and if you had a national security situation with that -- with tremendous urgency along the lines of Pearl Harbor or 9/11, you could see a situation where the drone, like a fighter plane, like a very powerful gun could be used in the United States. It's just another weapon and the police have a lot of weapons in this country.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: And let me go back to Chris Lawrence for a moment. There's no indication that the U.S. military has any plans obviously to actually use a drone to target the assassination of anyone in the United States for that matter, as far as you know?\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: No, Wolf. And you know, as I read the attorney general's letter, it specifically says the U.S. government has not carried out drone strikes in the United States and has no plans on doing so.\n\n\n\nIt further says that as the Attorney General Eric Holder says that he would have to examine the particular facts according to whatever particular circumstance came up, he would have to look at them individually and then advise the president specifically on his legal authority in that case.\n\n\n\nAgain, he made a point of saying Senator Rand Paul's question was hypothetical, is hypothetical at this time, but at some point down the road in the future, this may not be a hypothetical question -- Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Chris, hold on a moment. We have some breaking news.\n\n\n\nAll right, Venezuelan television is now reporting that Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela is dead. The news just reported moments ago on Venezuelan television. He has been very, very ill over these past several months, underwent surgery in Cuba before returning to Caracas, the Venezuelan capital.\n\n\n\nAll day there have been news conferences aired on Venezuelan television including from the vice president saying how gravely ill he was and that he was in the worse condition since his surgery in Cuba, but now Venezuelan television is reporting that the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, has passed away.\n\n\n\nThis is something that so many people, not only in Venezuela but throughout Central America, Latin America indeed here in the United States, around the world have been looking -- have been fully expecting, given how gravely ill he is.\n\n\n\nBut there is also some very, very peculiar ramifications that were reported today by the vice president of Venezuela. One, an allegation that, quote, foreign enemies of Venezuela were involved in poisoning, if you will, Hugo Chavez, infecting him severely, leading to his cancer and his now, as we know, death.\n\n\n\nAlso today, two American diplomatic personnel, two U.S. military attaches in Caracas at the U.S. Embassy in Venezuela were expelled from the Venezuelan government for what they claim was inappropriate coordination activities with various elements of the Venezuelan army.\n\n\n\nSo that is the news right now. Hugo Chavez is dead. Juan Carlos Lopez of CNN Espanol is here in THE SITUATION ROOM. This is going to be a huge, huge development because Hugo Chavez was no influential obviously in Venezuela throughout the region, so controversial, especially because of his ties not only with Cuba and the Castro brothers, but also with Iran and the president there, Ahmadinejad.\n\n\n\nJUAN CARLOS LOPEZ, CNN ESPANOL CORRESPONDENT: In a very intense relation, Wolf, with the United States. President Chavez had sought out to create a new axis in the region to drive power away from the United States.\n\n\n\nAccording to Vice President Maduro he died at 4:25 today, about 22 minutes ago, and he had been very ill. He had been transported back to Venezuela. The last thing he said this morning, you were talking about the press conference where they talk about expelling the two military attaches and the whole issue with his disease.\n\n\n\nObviously you could see they were very somber. You could see in their faces and sources were telling us that this was probably the first step or method to tell Venezuelans what was going on. There will be a presidential transition.\n\n\n\nThe Constitution obligates the government to call for a new election. We'll see what's going to happen. The country is very divided. Many believed that the opposition could gain control, but it's still not clear. The government still has support in Venezuela.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: The opposition to the government of Hugo Chavez, which seems to be gaining some significant strength right now, right?\n\n\n\nLOPEZ: That's the question. The town to see if they will be able to convince Venezuelans, especially the poor segments of the country, to vote for them. It was a very close election with the president. If you look at the numbers, it's not that close.\n\n\n\nSo the question is, will they have enough time and will the government with it is programs and everything they have been saying be able to convince people to elect Nicolas Maduro who President Chavez asked while living the Venezuelans to vote for.
(CNN) Virginity tests on sexual assault survivors have been outlawed in Pakistan's most-populous province, in a landmark ruling that's the first of its kind in the country.\n\nThe Lahore High Court in Punjab province on Monday declared the practice illegal, saying it has no medical basis and offends the personal dignity of the female victim and therefore is against the right to life and right to dignity.\n\nSo-called virginity tests, which include inspecting the hymen or inserting two fingers into the vagina, are invasive examinations conducted under the belief that they can determine whether a female is a virgin. They are a long-standing tradition in many regions around the world -- including Pakistan -- to assess a girl or woman's honor or virtue, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe tests are performed for various reasons, such as before marriage or even to asses employment eligibility . But in some regions, the exam is performed on rape victims to determine whether or not a sexual assault occurred.\n\nThe United Nations describes virginity tests as having no scientific or medical basis and considers them a human rights violation. Women and girls can be forced into the tests, which are often times painful, humiliating and traumatic and can suffer psychological, physical and social consequences, especially in cases of rape, according to WHO.\n\nRead More
(CNN) —\n\nSome politicians in India are clamoring for what they believe to be a quick fix to the country's population problem: a two-child policy for Indian citizens.\n\nAs activists and experts scramble to educate the public on the need for contraception and family planning, these politicians want to limit each family to have just two children.\n\nToday, India's population stands at 1.31 billion people, second only to China. Experts estimate India will surpass China in just a few years, according to the United States Census Bureau.\n\nIndia's fertility rate has dropped to 2.3 births per woman in 2016, compared to 3.2 births per woman in 2000, according to government data. But the booming population has been raising concerns for decades due to a rising poverty, decline in jobs and a poor literacy rate.\n\nNo person shall procreate more than two living children after a period of one year from the commencement of this Act, stated a population control bill introduced on the Parliament floor in 2016 by Prahalad Singh Patel, a legislator from the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe bill – which never even came to a vote – listed measures that the Indian government would take if they wanted to check the ever-growing population. If passed, the bill would make it mandatory for individuals to seek permission from officials if they want to have more than two children, permission that could be denied if sufficient cause was not met.\n\nThere is a universal truth you will have to consider. There is water, roads, health, sanitation: how will you give all these facilities if the population keeps increasing, Patel told CNN.\n\nThe bill's introduction opened up a debate, which was followed by more than 100 legislators submitting a letter to the president of India, Ram Nath Kovind, in August and appealing for him to take their demand seriously.\n\nThe land is shrinking and the population is rising. There is no place to build homes. In this situation, there should be some control on population, Ganesh Singh, one of the legislators demanding the implementation told CNN. Now or later, this will have to be done.\n\nBut B. Paswan, head of the department of population policies and programmes at the International Institute for Population Sciences highlighted the proposition is simply not realistic.\n\nNo government can bring any such strong policy in India. People will reject it. The two-child policy is not possible with the socio-economic condition of the country, he said. The change will come with development. It is heading that way already.\n\nDecline without restricting families\n\nThe Indian government does not have any plans to implement a two-child policy since it is a signatory to the International Conference on population and Development declaration. Signed in 1994, the declaration advocates free speech and honors the reproductive rights of couples to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of children.\n\nIndia has been grappling with population control for decades, which has resulted in abject poverty, with government welfare programmes unable to cater to thousands of people earning less than $3 per day.\n\nThere are several factors for the high population. We have a large percentage of the population in the reproductive age group. Only 54% of couples use contraceptives, said Paswan.\n\nOver the years, the government has instead introduced more than a dozen schemes that educate families in rural India on the benefits of family planning, such as financial incentives, awareness campaigns and distribution of contraceptives like condoms and pills, or hold sterilization drives.\n\nIndia spent more than $100 million on family planning in 2015 to 16, with some of these programs resulting in improvement.\n\nAccording to the ministry of health and family welfare, India's rate of total population growth has declined from 21.5% during the 1991 to 2001 period, to 17.6% during the 2001 to 2011 period.\n\nThere are other indicators behind the drop in population: development, increasing education level, increase in the age of marriage, said Paswan.\n\nLearning from China's mistakes\n\nChina eliminated its one-child policy in 2015, changing the law to allow couples to have two children. The country is now moving to remove birth restriction overall as concerns are growing over an aging population and a dropping birth rate. In 2017, the country's fertility was low, at 1.6 children per woman.\n\nChina introduced its one-child policy in 1979 over concerns that the population was increasing at a very fast rate. But the policy has brought its own set of challenges to one of the world's biggest economies, which has had a declining youth population for years while the proportion of the population over age 65 has risen from about 4% to almost 10%.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe policy also had worrying consequences for the gender balance as a desire for male children led to reported abortions and infanticide to ensure a couple's only child was a boy. In 2016 there were 1.15 males for every female in China, one of the most skewed gender ratios in the world.\n\nChina's failure is being taken as a lesson by countries such as India, where development is instead being seen as the key to capping population growth.\n\nChina had [a] one child policy. At the time the policy was very successful. They reduced population growth. They have now stopped the policy, said Paswan. We cannot say if India should implement the two-child policy. No political party will come forward and say that India should adopt it.
(CNN) The Golden Globe winners didn't crystallize much about the state of this year's awards race, which has seemed to lack clear frontrunners from the get-go. But it did tell you a few things about the next five weeks leading to the Oscars, with -- despite host Ricky Gervais' admonishment -- plenty of political commentary from the stars in the forecast.\n\nNothing about that latter part should come as a surprise. It was at the Globes three years ago, after all, where Meryl Streep's speech prompted a Twitter response from newly elected President Trump -- he called her overrated -- reinforcing both that collective Hollywood is no fan of this president, and that when it comes to picking opponents, Republicans generally like nothing better than what they label out-of-touch limousine liberals.\n\nThat situation has only festered in the time since, setting the stage for this year's slightly truncated run-up to the Oscars on Feb. 9. And while it's common to cite animosity toward speechifying by celebrities for the decline in award-show ratings, by now, those prone to tuning out based on ideological grounds are almost surely pretty well baked into the numbers.\n\nGranted, it's difficult to draw too many clear lessons from results at the Globes, which are presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn., a strange group prone to the occasional surprisingly out-there selections.\n\nStill, there are a few broad conclusions that can be gleaned from Sunday's event, and what it might augur for the rest of awards season, with Academy Award nominations due on Jan. 13.\n\nRead More

The candidates will lay out strategies for the 2018 midterm elections, rebuilding the Democratic Party and the DNC's role under the Trump administration.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nPete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old openly gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who served in the Navy during the war in Afghanistan, announced on Wednesday that he is launching an exploratory committee for a 2020 presidential bid.\n\nButtigieg made the announcement in an email to supporters and in a video posted online where he lays out his message of generational change centered on three values: Freedom, security and democracy. In that video, Buttigieg leans into how he took over South Bend when he was 29 years old and claims he turned around what had been referred to as a dying city.\n\nThere's a new generation of voices emerging in our country, walking away from the politics of the past and ready to deliver on our priorities. There is no 'again' in the real world; that's not a bad thing, Buttigieg says in the video. We are ready for a fresh start.\n\nButtigieg's 2020 argument is that he would like to do the same for the country that he did for South Bend, even if he knows the odds are against him, and that the only way to accomplish change like that is through a generational shift in American politics.\n\nWhat will America look like in 2054, when I reach the age of the current president, he asked in his email to supporters. How will we look back on 2020?\n\nButtigieg, who most recently ran for chair of the Democratic National Committee after the 2016 election, has been exploring a presidential bid for over a year, moving closer with a trip to Iowa in December where he was well received by an audience of progressives in Des Moines.\n\nThe mayor, who has little national name recognition and could struggle to get attention in a crowded field including heavyweights like Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\n\nButtigieg followed up his announcement with a news conference in Washington where he told reporters that there has been a total realignment in the politics of this country and that his age would be a selling point in a crowded Democratic field. But he also acknowledged his long odds.\n\nWe are not going to be the most established, we are not going to be the most well-funded, I am obviously not stepping onto this stage as the most famous person in this conversation, he said. But I belong to a party whose characteristic has always been to look for fresh voices, new leadership and big ideas, and I think that is what 2020 is going to be about.\n\nIn an interview with CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Buttigieg said, if you are planning to be here for decades, you just look at the world a little bit differently than older candidates.\n\nI think when you run at this age, your face is your message in a lot of ways, he said. And part of what we are looking at is the idea that it's time for a new generation in American leadership.\n\nButtigieg was born and raised in South Bend and went on to attend Harvard College and later became a Rhodes scholar. After a three-year stint at the consulting firm McKinsey and Company, Buttigieg came back to Indiana and lost a race for state treasurer in 2010. The race helped him with his name recognition in the state, however, and he successfully won his first term as mayor of South Bend in 2011. Buttigieg was first deployed to Afghanistan two years later in 2013.\n\nAnother issue for the mayor's bid is how to pronounce his last name, something that has become a bit of a running joke between he and his husband, Chasten, who tweeted a list of possible pronunciations in 2018 that included boot-edge-edge, buddha-judge and boot-a-judge.\n\nOptions:\n\n\n\nboot-edge-edge\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n\nBuddha-judge\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n\nBoot-a-judge\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n\nBoo-tuh-judge — Chasten Glezman Buttigieg (@Chasten) December 17, 2018\n\n(Buttigieg's name is Maltese and roughly translates to lord of the poultry. He told reporters that people in South Bend call him Mayor Pete and that is fine with me.)\n\nButtigieg, who came out in 2015, will also be the first openly LGBTQ elected official to run for President, according to the LGBTQ Victory Fund.\n\nIn an interview with CNN in December, Buttigieg wondered if his sexuality would be an issue for more conservative Democrats.\n\nThe only way to know is to get out there, he said. I will say I got re-elected with 80% of the vote after I had come out while Mike Pence was governor of Indiana. I don't think these things decide your fate.\n\nBut the party has shifted dramatically on same-sex marriage over the last decade, with a Gallup poll in 2018 finding that 83% of Democrats support it.\n\nAnnise Parker, the openly gay former mayor of Houston and President of LGBTQ Victory Fund, called Buttigieg's announcement a historic and powerful moment for the LGBTQ community and the entire country.\n\nIn such a wide-open presidential race, Mayor Buttigieg would be a welcome contribution to the marketplace of ideas that will determine where our nation is headed in 2020 and beyond, she said. And while he is not running on his sexual orientation, his presence will undoubtedly elevate LGBTQ issues in the Democratic primary.\n\nAnd after his speech in Iowa in December, a number of attendees commented that they appreciated that he embraced who he was and made it part of his broader story.\n\nI like that Mayor Pete guy, one woman standing near the elevator was overheard by CNN. He's gay and going places.\n\nButtigieg told reporters his sexuality was a fact of life and that the race was not just about profile, but he was mindful of the fact that this just might make it a little easier for the next person who comes along.\n\nOne of the things that every person should think about in the run-up to 2020, especially because there are so many people, is that it is not only the outcome, but it is the conduct of campaigns that will make an impact on political life in our country, he said when asked about some of the response to the historic nature of his candidacy. The world is changing, but it is not changing on its own. So, if by bringing forward good ideas I can be part of chipping away at that, that is one more reason to give this a look.\n\nRepublicans quickly blasted Buttigieg's announcement, suggesting his leadership of South Bend does not merit a presidential run.\n\nBefore Buttigieg wastes time on a presidential campaign, he should focus on his town's sea of potholes and sky-high crime rate, said Michael Ahrens, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. His bid isn't just bad news for residents, it's more proof that Democrats are about to endure the most crowded, divisive, and contentious primary in history.\n\nButtigieg's first book, Shortest Way Home, will come out in March and will serve as an explanation for his longshot 2020 bid. The subtitle of the book is One mayor's challenge and a model for America's future, and the youthful-looking Buttigieg is on the cover rolling up his sleeves.\n\nButtigieg told CNN last year that despite his long odds, he felt like he had to give running for president a shot.\n\nA field that is spread very thin probably works to the advantage of a newcomer if you are very good at it, he said with a smile. The only way to find out is to be tested in the field.\n\nThis story has been updated.
(CNN) A post-coup crackdown by Myanmar's military appeared to intensify Monday as security forces revoked the licenses of five independent media companies before a late-night standoff that saw hundreds of young protesters trapped in Yangon.\n\nMilitary junta forces had cornered hundreds of people in Sanchaung township, in the country's biggest city, and threatened to go door to door to hunt them down, Reuters reported. Police fired guns and used stun grenades as protesters sought shelter in nearby buildings.\n\nLocal media reported 27 people were arrested in Sanchaung Monday night. CNN could not independently confirm if any protesters were arrested.\n\nThe move sparked appeals from the US, UK and United Nations for police and military to allow about 200 barricaded protesters to leave the area. Thousands of people turned out in nearby streets and districts in solidarity and defiance of a nighttime curfew.\n\nIn the early hours of Tuesday morning, activists said the trapped protesters were able to leave the Sanchuang district after security forces left and a curfew lifted. Military trucks and security forces were seen leaving around 2 a.m. and protesters began exiting after 4 a.m. Volunteers were on standby to give the fleeing protesters free rides home.\n\nMyanmar has been thrown into turmoil since the military seized power in a February 1 coup, detaining civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and forming a new junta to run the country. For more than a month, protesters across Myanmar have turned out daily in their thousands to resist military rule.\n\nBut security forces have responded with increasing violence and brutality. Witnesses have reported extrajudicial killings and nighttime raids, while footage and photographs show police and the military shooting dead anti-coup protesters and beating detainees. At least 54 people have died in crackdowns on protests, including many teenagers and young people, according to the UN.\n\nIn Sanchaung on Monday, protesters had turned out to celebrate International Women's Day and fly their Htamains (sarongs) as part of the anti-junta movement.\n\nActivist Maung Saungkha said there were cat and mouse exchanges throughout the day between police and protesters, who had run into buildings to hide as security forces tried to disperse them. Around 6 p.m., 200 young protesters realized police had barricaded them into a small area and refused to let them -- or anyone else -- leave, he said.\n\nThree streets had been blocked by police and soldiers. Even though the owners of the building were ordinary people who live in Sanchaung, even these people were not allowed to go out, he said.\n\nPhotos: Protesters resist Myanmar coup Anti-coup protesters pray in Yangon, Myanmar, on Sunday, March 14.

On Monday, the group confirmed on its website that the military revoked its license.\n\nWomen hang a collection of longyi, a traditional clothing widely worn in Myanmar, across a road during a demonstration against the military coup in Yangon on March 8.\n\nDVB was one of several media organizations forced to operate outside the country for years under military rule. Formed in 1992 by democracy activists, the organization ran its operations from Oslo, Norway, relying on a network of underground reporters in Myanmar and a bureau in Chiang Mai, Thailand, that provided a window into what was one of the world's most-isolated nations.\n\nWhen the military began opening up Myanmar in 2011 under the quasi-civilian rule of Thein Sein and embarked on a series of reforms, including abolishing pre-publication censorship, exiled media groups cautiously began returning to the country.\n\nFrom the beginning, our strategy was a 'one foot in one foot out' situation, as we never trusted military. And military never trusted independent media. We are an arranged marriage without love, Toe Zaw Latt said.\n\nPaul Donowitz, Myanmar Campaign Leader at rights group Global Witness, said the media crackdown showed the military was attempting to return the country to its darkest days.\n\nThese five news outlets are a key part of Myanmar's independent media landscape and provide vital information to the people of Myanmar. Independent reporting is all the more important in the current context, helping to counter the military's misinformation campaigns and provide the public and activists with objective accounts of what is really going on in the wake of the coup, he said.\n\nWhen the military took control of the country last month, one of coup leader Gen. Min Aung Hlaing's first acts was to pull the plug on independent TV channels. Since then, journalists have been among the 1,857 people detained by junta forces -- among them two DVB reporters.\n\nThere will clearly be more targeting of journalists on the ground and we expect more arrests. Our main concern is how can we manage our staff safety. At the same time, we need to report, Toe Zaw Latt said.\n\nGoing back into exile could be a possibility, he said, but for now DVB will keep reporting on every platform they can. The coup cant stop our (reporting) ... there is no way we are going to stop right now, he said.
But when Ancestry -- one of the many companies that analyze DNA to unearth a person's genealogical history -- offered to look into his family tree, Bell accepted the vial to collect genetic material and coughed -- er -- spit it up.\n\nAnd he has a few good reasons why: His two daughters with his wife, Melissa, plus a third on the way; and his parents, Janet and Walter, who are going on this family history journey with him.\n\nI think if I (wasn't) married and had kids, maybe I'd be idly curious but I wouldn't be actively curious because I just feel like whatever history says, I know who I am, Bell says. If I'm a half of a percent African-American, that's not going to change how I am in the world.\n\nBut his daughters, ages 3 and 6, are mixed race, and will have a different experience, Bell and his wife say. The thing in this moment that causes me to want to do this is for our daughters, so they can know all that's available to know, Bell says. And I'm excited to see this all laid out on paper so I can show it to my dad and my aunt, Jackie. So they can see it for real because it's clear that even their knowledge is a little bit diffuse.\n\nCNN followed along with the comedian and host of United Shades of America as he and his parents traced their lineage back multiple generations -- something many African Americans aren't able to do since slavery robbed them of the documentation -- such as birth certificates, marriage licenses and deeds to land -- needed to do so.\n\nThe result of this journey is Finding Kamau, a three-part video series you can watch here on CNN.com . Below, the Bells talk more about their decision, the fear that can come with digging into one's past, and what they hope their daughters will take away from it all.\n\nCNN: What made you guys want to invest and go on this journey? Was it a joint decision?\n\nMelissa Bell: Definitely a joint decision, as are most things in this arrangement. And this seems like such a cool way to really dive a lot deeper into where the family comes from and into Kamau's family's history ... I feel like if the knowledge is available, why wouldn't we, right?\n\nKamau Bell: Yeah ... for me, I remember this conversation, (and) I feel like we talked about this at some point and your response was, you know, the girls should know where they come from. For me, the thing in this moment that causes me to want to do this is for our daughters, so they can know all that's available to know.\n\nI mean, anything is possible; there could be some sort of, Oh, my God, we live across the street from my long lost (relative)! Or, You're related to ... or there's this crazy story about ... like, all that's possible. But I've heard so many people who say their identity is caught up in what they think they are and then when they find out what they are, things start to fall apart. And I just feel like maybe for fear of things falling apart I've never looked into it.\n\nMB: Is that something that you have a fear of?\n\nKB: I don't really have a fear because, you know, if I'm a half of a percent African American, that's not gonna change how I am in the world. I don't think black people are gonna be like, He's not one of us anymore. But I think some people get caught up in that (and) I do think that seeing people get caught up in that has led me to be like, Ah, I already know who I am.\n\nI have grown up knowing something about (my family) history. Not that far back, but enough to know on my dad's side, the Bell family line starts from Francis Bell [...] and a guy who owned enslaved people. I think a lot of black people maybe can't even get back that far.\n\nAnd my mom, you know, I've never been back to her family places, but they're all in the South. And she would tell me about her grandparents who believed they're Cherokee.\n\nW. Kamau Bell provided a sample of his saliva to the company Ancestry to trace his genealogical history.\n\nMB: And that's something you've always mentioned, sort of casually, like as a narrative that goes through your mom's side of the family that I'm curious about. I get the sense that you're curious about it.\n\nKB: That's the thing I'm the most curious about. Just because every black person apparently thinks they're Cherokee, so I'm curious to go, Am I actually one of the black people who has Cherokee in them? (Laughs) And if not, no big deal. I'll be fine.\n\nMB: Yeah.\n\nKB: What if I'm 100% black? (Laughs) That'd be amazing. Like, if it somehow worked out that you only got the black DNA from all your relatives.\n\nMB: Is that possible? Does that scientifically work?\n\nKB: I don't know ... But if I was 100% black I would change my bio, my Twitter profile.\n\nMB: It would suddenly be your calling card.\n\nKB: I would change everything. One hundred percent black: I am actually from Wakanda.\n\nCNN: You guys both have talked openly about having mixed race children. Is that part of this investigation, in terms of their awareness of something like that?\n\nKB: Let's say, for example, I'm 1% black. It doesn't matter to how I've lived my life and how I will continue to live my life because mixed race is also a visible identity. It's an identity that people see. People look at our daughters and can see that they are this thing that we've called mixed race. So no matter how black I am, nobody looks at me and goes, Oh. (Laughs) Look at his hair ...\n\nMB: ... He's got a lot of stuff going on.\n\nKB: Yeah, so I think being mixed race is a visible identity. Whatever my DNA says -- I'm certainly of mixed race heritage, I believe -- it is not the same as being what we call in this country mixed race.\n\nAnd our daughters are definitely visibly mixed race, and at the same time, we also tell them they're black, even though Juno at this stage is probably going to be able to get some white people secrets because she'll probably be able to be in the rooms. (Laughs)\n\nMB: Yeah, I think Kamau and I are both aware that our daughters being mixed race means that their experience in the world is going to be significantly different from ours and something we've talked about is taking a lot of our cues from them in terms of how they identify. I think it is interesting to consider how, like, sort of, flushing out the mixed race nature of (Kamau's) heritage may play into the ways that they see themselves in the world.\n\nRight now it is very black and white -- the three of them are black people and I'm a white person; they are mixed race and we are not. And that's not necessarily how it is. We have a three-year-old and a six-year-old, so that's the terms that they can understand. But I imagine as they get older, when we have teenaged daughters instead, it's going to be a lot more nuanced and complicated for them, and I think having this knowledge may round out how they see themselves in the world.\n\nKB: I feel like in their lifetime, there's probably going to be some new word that accounts for people who are actively being a part of multiple cultures.\n\nBecause as much as I have mixed race heritage, on Saint Patrick's Day, I don't feel some sort of like, Well, I know I have Irish slaver in me, so let me go drink some green beer. I don't have that.\n\nBut (our daughter) Sami and her friends are actively participating in multiple cultures and races. The thing that I've been so impressed by with Sami and (our daughter) Juno is that their capacity to understand this stuff is way bigger than we think.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe Lifetime docuseries Surviving R. Kelly sparked renewed interest in allegations of sexual misconduct by the singer.\n\nBut the accusations of abuse, manipulation and inappropriate encounters with girls and young women have been around – and vehemently denied – by Kelly for decades.\n\nJanuary 1992\n\nKelly's debut album, Born into the 90's, is released a year after he signs a deal with Jive Records. It features his group Public Announcement and includes hit singles Honey Love, Slow Dance (Hey Mr. DJ) and She's Got That Vibe. Fans will later note that one of the lyrics on the latter says, Little cute Aaliyah's got it.\n\nNovember 1993\n\nKelly releases his solo album 12 Play. Songs such as Bump n' Grind and Your Body's Callin'  firmly cement his image as an artist specializing in sexual lyrics.\n\nAugust 1994\n\nThe 27-year-old singer reportedly marries his 15-year-old protégé, Aaliyah Haughton. Kelly is the lead songwriter and producer on her debut album, Age Ain't Nothing But a Number.\n\nVibe magazine later publishes a copy of what they report is the couple's marriage license, listing Haughton's age as 18.\n\n20 years ago, Vibe prints marriage certificate of Aaliyah & R.

The song becomes one of the singer's biggest hits.\n\nDecember 2000\n\nJim Derogatis and Abdon M. Pallasch publish their first report in the Chicago Sun-Times on allegations of Kelly having sexual relationships with girls as young as 15.\n\nThe article outlines the Hawkins suit as well as Kelly's marriage to Haughton.\n\nAccording to the story, Chicago police had twice investigated allegations that Kelly was having sex with an underage girl but dropped the investigations because the girl would not cooperate.\n\nA representative for Kelly declines to comment.\n\nJanuary 2001\n\nDerogatis anonymously receives a videotape that appears to show Kelly having sex with a young woman, he later reports in the Sun-Times.\n\nOut of concern that the person on the tape may be underage, it is turned over to Chicago police.\n\nAugust 2001\n\nTracy Sampson, an aspiring rapper and former intern at Epic Records, files a lawsuit against Kelly, claiming he initiated a sexual relationship with her when she was 17.\n\nThe case is settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.\n\nFebruary 2002\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times reports police are investigating Kelly after another sex tape is sent anonymously.\n\nThe girl in the video, now 17, was identified by her aunt, who said that her niece would have been 14 at the time the tape was made, based on her appearance, the paper reported. Kelly can also be heard on the tape referring to the girl by her first name.\n\nKelly denies the allegations.\n\nIt's not true.

The case is later settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.\n\nJune 2002\n\nKelly is indicted on 21 charges related to child pornography resulting from the second anonymously sent videotape of him appearing to have sex with a young girl.\n\nThe singer is arrested at his Florida vacation home.\n\nKelly maintains his innocence and is released on bail.\n\nSeptember 2005\n\nKelly's wife files for an order of protection.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden is not the right Democratic candidate for 2020. And yet, he may soon enter the Democratic race.\n\nThus far, what has been most remarkable is how diverse the field is shaping up to be. This is not your traditional slate of Democratic candidates. Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Peter Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang and several others are already up and running. And more are likely to follow.\n\nThe composition of the Democratic field represents the diversity of the country. With so many serious frontrunners who are not, for a change, older white men, the Democrats are showing that they are a party representing the future of the country. In contrast to the kind of rhetoric that has come from President Donald Trump, an ode to the whiteness and masculinity of a limited American political tradition, the Democrats are making a strong statement about what their party is all about.\n\nAnd their opening speeches reflect that reality as well. They have revolved around issues such as racial justice, gender equity, immigration rights and more. Even a candidate like Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is being tagged as the moderate with bipartisan appeal, proclaimed: Stop the fear-mongering and stop the hate. We may come from different places. We may pray in different ways. We may look different. And love different. But all live in the same country of shared dreams.\n\nThen comes Biden. The former vice president has every right to run and certainly has a great deal to offer. During his career in the Senate and in the White House, Biden was a strong champion of the middle class. He pushed for the kinds of policies that Trump, despite all his promises to the forgotten Americans, never pursued. As vice president, he headed the Middle Class Task Force, which championed policies such as capping student loan payments and improving retirement security. He was even ahead of President Barack Obama on the issue of same-sex marriage.\n\nAlso, as an older white male (who would be 78 years old in January 2021), there are a number of Democrats who see him as the safe choice, the only person who will be able to withstand the President's testosterone-filled campaign. And CNN polling shows that right now most believe he would do best in a matchup against the President.\n\nBut is Biden really the best answer for the party? There is good reason for Democrats to be skeptical and to consider supporting other candidates.\n\nMost problematic is the fact that Biden has run for the presidency several times, and each time he has struggled under the intense spotlight. When it comes time to hit the campaign trail, Biden has never been able to generate the level of support that is necessary to win. His tendency to make gaffes has also hurt him. And, in our frenzied news cycle with endless outlets and few filters on information, Biden's style will cause problems again.\n\nOf course, these issues didn't stop Trump in 2016. But unlike Trump, it is unclear that without a comparable partisan media outlet (Fox News) and unyielding partisan loyalty, that Biden would survive. While MSNBC could offer a boost to Biden, social scientists have shown that the conservative media has a much stronger hold on conservative viewers than liberal outlets. Conservatives also tend to be more ideologically homogenous and loyal than their counterparts on the left. In other words, Democrats have seen the challenges that the inevitable frontrunner faces, as the election actually takes shape.\n\nMore important, though, is the moment in which we are living. Trump has run a political operation from the White House that has revolved around a vision of white nationalism that challenges the values of pluralism, diversity and inclusion. His statement after Charlottesville forever marked his term in office. And the President's perpetual struggle to build a wall perfectly captures what he hopes to achieve – with his central goal being about keeping people out rather than bringing them in.\n\nWith so many strong candidates already lined up to run in the Democratic primaries, many of whom who have launched their runs with the kind of gravitas and excitement that bodes well for a presidential campaign, there is a risk of someone like Biden being in the race – someone with the potential to suck up all the oxygen in the room. Uncle Joe could quickly take away media attention and campaign funds from Democrats who would perform better in the general election. If Biden was the nominee, he would also throw cold water on the excitement and energy that exists among younger Democrats about the direction of their party.\n\nThe Democrats should not assume that an older, moderate white man is inevitably the strongest candidate. Even Bernie Sanders offers a fresh perspective with his left of center, Democratic Socialist positions (he would also be notable as a Jewish-American nominee). It is possible to see the virtue of a ticket that embodies diversity from the top down. All of the candidates who are currently running would enable the Democrats to showcase the difference in what the party represents compared to the GOP. As a new article in The New York Times shows, the GOP is bleeding young voters with each passing day of the Trump presidency.\n\nWith Biden at the top of the ticket, it would be much more difficult to generate enthusiasm among African-Americans, Latinos or younger voters, for instance, who will be looking to Democrats to prove that they will offer something fundamentally different. While there are early polls showing substantial numbers of African-Americans backing Biden and Sanders, these don't measure the excitement that might be generated on the campaign trail once the other candidates are better known and once their political skills have been proven.\n\nAnd Biden's pivotal role on the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act, which was foundational to the expansion of the mass incarceration system, will come back to haunt him. Like Hillary Clinton, he will have to reckon with his vote authorizing President George W. Bush to use military force in Iraq, baggage that the younger generation of Democrats won't be carrying onto the campaign trail.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nMeanwhile, many educated, suburban women are looking for a candidate who will take seriously the message of the #metoo movement. This is a social movement that has rocked American society, bringing attention to the horrendous ways in which sexism and sexual assault continue to play out in many of our major industries and in our private lives. They won't be happy to hear about his role in the 1991 Clarence Thomas hearings, where he was one of the many senators who did not take seriously the sexual harassment complaints of Anita Hill. He was part of the reason that 1992 saw a surge in female candidates.\n\nThe most successful Democrat in recent decades was Barack Obama, who mobilized a powerful electoral coalition because of the change he represented for the Democratic Party – not because he was the party's safe choice.\n\nOf course, Biden has a right to run – should he so choose. But before Democrats go overboard in shifting their financial and organizational resources, as well as endorsements, to the former vice president, they should think long and hard about whether they want the face of their party to be someone who represents the past – or the future.
(CNN) Relatives of two missing Idaho siblings are offering a $20,000 for information leading to their return, even as they urge their mother to reveal what she knows about their whereabouts.\n\nLaw enforcement officers have been searching for Joshua JJ Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 17, since November, after learning that they had not been seen or heard from since September\n\nJJ's biological grandparents, Kay and Larry Woodcock of Louisiana, held a news conference Tuesday in Idaho to offer the reward, and held up a poster of the children while asking the public for information.\n\nKay Woodcock made a public plea to the children's mother, Lori Vallow -- whom police say has left Idaho with her new husband and is refusing to work with investigators.\n\nPlease, just let us know where the kids are. It's not difficult. It will end all this, as far as the kids are concerned, she said.\n\nThe disappearances are part of a complex past 12 months for the family -- a time frame in which police have investigated two deaths, one of which authorities say still is under investigation.\n\nKay and Larry Woodcock are offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of their grandson, Joshua JJ Vallow, and his sister, Tylee Ryan.\n\nWhat police learned after welfare check\n\nPolice determined them to be missing in late November -- four months after Lori Vallow's estranged husband was shot dead in their former home state, Arizona, and shortly after Vallow moved with the children to Idaho and remarried.\n\nJoshua JJ Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 17.\n\nPolice conducted a welfare check for JJ -- Vallow's adopted son with her late husband -- on November 26 at their home in Rexburg, Idaho, after relatives raised concern about not hearing from him since September.\n\nDuring the welfare check, both Vallow and her new husband, Chad Daybell, told investigators that the boy was staying with a family friend in Arizona, police said.\n\nBut police determined that he wasn't staying with a family friend. When police returned November 27 to execute a search warrant, investigators determined Daybell and Vallow had fled the home, and also didn't appear to have taken JJ with them, according to authorities.\n\nInvestigators learned that Tylee hadn't been seen since September, though she'd most recently lived with Vallow and JJ in Rexburg.\n\nPolice investigate whether the disappearances are connected to a woman's death\n\nThe case is complicated further by the death of Daybell's previous wife, Tammy Daybell, in Idaho in October. Her death initially was believed to be natural, but Rexburg police announced last month that it was suspicious , and her remains were exhumed.\n\nDaybell and Vallow married a few weeks after Tammy Daybell's death, police say.\n\nRexburg police have said they're investigating whether that death and the kids' disappearances are connected.\n\nInvestigators don't believe the children are with Lori Vallow, but they think she knows where they are or what happened to them, Rexburg police said.\n\nAuthorities believe that Lori Vallow and her husband Chad Daybell have information about the whereabouts of her children.\n\nShe has refused to cooperate with police and has left the state with her husband, police said in a statement on December 30.\n\nWe publicly call on Lori Vallow/Daybell and Chad Daybell to do the right thing and come forward with the information they have about the location and welfare of Joshua and Tylee, the statement said\n\nAn attorney for the family, Sean Bartholick, released a statement to East Idaho News on December 23 saying that while he is in contact with Vallow and her husband, Chad Daybell, he does not have information about the children. CNN has made multiple attempts to reach Bartholick but has not received a response.\n\nLast week, police said they have learned that Daybell and Vallow told witnesses that Tylee had died a year before her father's death, which investigators say is not true. Daybell told another witness that Vallow had no minor children, according to police.\n\nPolice said they have not filed charges in the case yet because they are focused on finding JJ and Tylee.\n\nLori Vallow's estranged husband expressed concern about her mental state\n\nDivorce documents shed some light on the months before the children went missing.\n\nEarly last year, Charles Vallow was in the process of divorcing Lori Vallow. They were living in Arizona with the children after marrying in 2006.\n\nCharles Vallow was JJ's adoptive father, but also his biological great uncle, and Kay Woodcock's brother, his family says.\n\nAccording to a petition for dissolution of marriage filed in February, Charles Vallow, had requested sole custody of the child and expressed concern about Lori Vallow's mental state.\n\nCharles Vallow was shot and killed in July, during a fight with Lori Vallow's brother Alex Cox, police in Chandler, Arizona, said\n\nDetails about the motive in the killing weren't immediately available. Cox was not charged in the case and died last month, according to CNN affiliate KIFI/KIDK . The cause of death has not been released.\n\nFather states that mother's recent decision-making has caused emotional harm to JJ who has special needs and is unable to understand the circumstances or situation happening, the petition reads.\n\nMother has recently become infatuated and at times obsessive about near death experiences and spiritual visions. Mother has told Father that she is sealed (eternally married) to the ancient Book of Mormon prophet Moroni and that she lived numerous lives on numerous planet prior to this current life, the document says.\n\nMother also informed Father that she is a translated being who cannot taste death sent by God to lead the 144,000 into the Millennium. ... On January 29, 2019, during a phone conversation between the parties and after their physical separation, Mother informed Father that she was a God assigned to carry out the work of the 144,000.\n\nCharles Vallow had sought an order of protection against Lori Vallow, the petition said.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Steven M. Ellsworth and F. Taylor Larson, attorneys who handled the divorce case, told CNN that Charles Vallow had a protective order against Lori Vallow because he had a genuine fear for his life ... due to Lori's mental state and her delusions.\n\nLinks to a religious content website\n\nChad Daybell had connections to a website called Preparing a People, a religious content provider that describes itself as as series of lecture events focusing on self-reliance and personal preparation, featuring several Latter-Day Saints speakers.\n\nPublishers of the site, Michael and Nancy James, released a statement December 26 emphasizing that while Daybell, and to a lesser extent Vallow, were featured in the series, neither was an owner or a founder.\n\nMichael and Nancy James said they decided to pull content featuring either Daybell or Vallow in light of Tammy Daybell's death and the disaapperance of the children.
Are you among the 65% of Americans being kept up at night by money worries? Managing your money can definitely be overwhelming, especially with so much conflicting advice out there.\n\nThe good news is, you don't actually have to do much to get your finances under control. You just have to follow a few simple rules to streamline your spending and tackle all of your biggest money issues.\n\nHere are five basic financial rules to live by that will change your life and put you on the path toward a more prosperous future.\n\n1. Spend less than you earn\n\nMore than 3/4 of full-time workers were living paycheck to paycheck in 2017, and 71% of U.S. workers were in debt according to a CareerBuilder survey.\n\nUnfortunately, it's impossible to ever get ahead if you're spending as much -- or more -- than you're bringing in. To be able to save, you must have money left at the end of the month. This means you need to either increase your income or reduce your spending.\n\nBoosting your income could come from asking for a raise, doing overtime, taking on side gigs, or starting a new business. Spending less than you earn usually requires tracking your spending, setting a budget, and sticking to self-imposed spending limits.\n\nOr, to force yourself to spend less than you earn without hassling with a budget, automate your savings and have money withdrawn directly from your paycheck before you ever see it. You can't spend what you don't have. Just don't get out the credit cards to make up the difference!\n\n2. Institute a 24-hour rule for big purchases\n\nMore than half of all respondents to a 2013 CreditDonkey survey reported regularly feeling guilty after making purchases. Spending a lot of cash on something that doesn't bring joy to your life is a waste.\n\nTo stop the guilt and make sure you're getting your monies worth out of every buy, institute a waiting period of at least 24-hours before you make a big purchase. Your definition of a big purchase will vary depending upon your income. Around $100 is a good number for many families.\n\nThe 24-hour waiting period gives you time to think about whether it's really worth such a big outlay -- do you really need that new iPhone or is there something better you could do with all that money?\n\nA waiting period also gives you time to shop for a better deal. If you can't get the item out of your head and decide to purchase, you may save a few bucks anyway.\n\n3. Get on the same page with your spouse\n\nMoney is the number one cause of relationship stress. Not only does fighting about money make it hard to get along with your spouse, but it also makes it difficult to accomplish financial goals. If you're trying to save or get out of debt and your spouse is hitting the mall, you'll never get ahead.\n\nTo ensure you're on the same page, set aside time for regular money talks. Agree on the big stuff, like how much you want to save and what your big financial goals are for the future -- then find ways to work together to achieve your plans.\n\nIf you're constantly fighting about spending, it may be best for each spouse to have a separate account with a mutually agreed amount of fun money. Make a deal that once the money is gone, spending will stop.\n\n4. Save for a rainy day\n\nEmergencies absolutely are going to happen. In fact, 60% of Americans responding to a 2015 Pew Survey indicated they'd experienced a financial shock during the prior year and the median cost of the most expensive financial shock was $2,000 for these households.\n\nUnfortunately, almost 60% of Americans don't have $500 in the bank to cover an emergency, and more than half of all households reporting a financial shock still hadn't recovered their financial equilibrium six months later.\n\nIf you don't have rainy day savings, you'll perpetually end up in debt when you have to put your emergencies on a credit card. This will derail repayment efforts and make saving harder.\n\nAn ideal goal is to save enough cash to cover around 3-6 months of living expenses. If that sounds insurmountable, start with saving a little money each month until you have at least $1,000. You can grow your emergency fund over time, but at least this will cover most financial disasters without sending you reaching for your credit cards.\n\n5. Prioritize your retirement savings\n\nEven if you don't follow any of these other rules, this is the big one. You absolutely must save for retirement.\n\nYou cannot live on Social Security alone. Unfortunately almost half of all American families have nothing at all saved for retirement, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Once you cannot work any more, there will be nothing you can do -- so you need to act now.\n\nBefore paying for anything else other than the most essential bills, divert a portion of your paycheck toward a workplace 401(k), an IRA, or other tax-advantaged retirement account. Ideally, you should try to work up to saving at least 15% of your income, but start with whatever you can spare. Aggressively increase your savings -- including diverting your raises to your retirement funds -- until you've reached your savings goal.\n\nRelated links:\n\n• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\n\n• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\n\n• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\n\nLiving by these five golden rules of money management is easier said than done, but if you can pull it off, the rewards are worth it. A happier marriage, more financial security, and the ability to stop worrying about money are benefits that will pay big dividends once you get your financial life under control.
Snapchat parent Snap Inc. will release its first earnings report as a public company after the closing bell on Wednesday. But unfortunately for its fans, there are more investors wearing bear face filters than bull ones.\n\nShares of Snap (SNAP) surged 44% in their debut on the New York Stock Exchange and hit a high of $29.44 -- 73% above their offering price of $17 -- on their second day.\n\nBut it's been all downhill, since then. Optimism about the stock, like the disappearing Snapchat message, seems to have a short shelf life. Snap stock is now trading at around $23 -- more than 20% below its peak price.\n\nSnapchat fans could point out that Facebook (FB) also endured a rocky few months immediately after its initial public offering while Twitter (TWTR) surged after its IPO. We all know what happened next. Facebook is now worth nearly $440 billion. Twitter isn't.\n\nSnapchat needs to prove to a skeptical Wall Street that it can continue to grow -- even while Facebook and its Instagram photo sharing subsidiary seem intent on stealing away young users from Snapchat with many copycat features.\n\nSnapchat is still a niche social media company -- and there are concerns that its popularity may already be peaking.\n\nAnalysts are expecting Snap will report a loss for the quarter. It has yet to post a profit. And Wall Street thinks revenue came in at $158 million. That would be a four-fold jump in sales from a year ago -- but it's down from the fourth quarter. Not a good sign.\n\nSnapchat also had just 161 million daily active users at the end of the fourth quarter. Facebook said in its most recent earnings report that it finished the first quarter with 1.28 billion daily active users.\n\nRelated: Facebook's global domination -- it continues to add more and more users\n\nInstagram's newish Stories feature has quickly become very popular. Like Snapchat, Stories allows users to add fun images and text to the photos and present them in a slideshow format as well.\n\nLet's be honest. Adding bunny ears to a photo isn't the most groundbreaking technology. It could be relatively easy for Facebook and Instagram to keep watching Snapchat and then just copy some of that social network's most popular new bells and whistles.\n\nSure, Snapchat executives will likely gush about engagement -- i.e. how much time users spend on the Snapchat app, not CEO Evan Spiegel's upcoming marriage to supermodel Miranda Kerr.\n\nBut Matt Britton, CEO of Crowdtap, a marketing software firm, said that many celebrities are migrating more to Instagram from Snapchat. That means that advertisers will likely follow too.\n\nSnapchat needs to innovate to find new ways to compete more effectively with Instagram, Britton said, adding that the company's augmented reality Spectacles could give the company a leg up against competition.\n\nRelated: Snapchats no longer have to disappear after 10 seconds\n\nBut he noted that Facebook had an easier time rising to dominance because it was up against a competitor in decline -- MySpace. Snap isn't dealing with a weak rival. It's dealing with Facebook at its prime.\n\nDJ Kang, a former hedge fund analyst who is now head of Asia for consumer research firm ValuePenguin, agrees. He thinks that Snapchat stock is overvalued mainly because of the continued threat from Facebook and Instagram.\n\nSnapchat's growth is being cannibalized by Instagram Stories in literally every single market in the world, Kang wrote in a report, adding it's possible that Snapchat could even report a decline in users from the fourth quarter when it reports first quarter results.\n\nRelated: Facebook continues its transformation into Snapchat\n\nThere are also concerns that Snapchat could have a tough time gaining a big foothold in Asia since there already is a similar social network named Snow that is popular there.\n\nKang recommends that investors buy Facebook and short Snap (i.e. bet against the stock -- the process involves borrowing the stock from a broker and selling it with the aim of buying it back after the price falls and profiting from the difference) because he thinks Snap shares could fall as much as 60%.\n\nHe believes Snapchat, currently worth about $26 billion, may eventually wind up trading more in line with where Twitter's stock does. Twitter's current market value is just $13 billion.\n\nAnd Kang isn't the only one who thinks that betting against Snap stock is a smart move. Interestingly, it appears that the company's user base may also be wary of the shares.\n\nRelated: Instagram's Snapchat clone is more popular than Snapchat\n\nMarket research site Investopedia said Tuesday that Snap was the third-most shorted stock in a recent stock picking contest it ran for college students.\n\nBut the most popular stocks bought by these teens and early 20-somethings? Facebook -- along with the other FANG stocks, Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL).\n\nThat could be a problem. If Snap isn't cool enough for members of its core demographic to buy, Snap may find it even tougher to convince older Gen Xers and baby boomers who don't get why the service is even popular in the first place to invest in the stock.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden is not the right Democratic candidate for 2020. And yet, he may soon enter the Democratic race.\n\nThus far, what has been most remarkable is how diverse the field is shaping up to be. This is not your traditional slate of Democratic candidates. Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Peter Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang and several others are already up and running. And more are likely to follow.\n\nThe composition of the Democratic field represents the diversity of the country. With so many serious frontrunners who are not, for a change, older white men, the Democrats are showing that they are a party representing the future of the country. In contrast to the kind of rhetoric that has come from President Donald Trump, an ode to the whiteness and masculinity of a limited American political tradition, the Democrats are making a strong statement about what their party is all about.\n\nAnd their opening speeches reflect that reality as well. They have revolved around issues such as racial justice, gender equity, immigration rights and more. Even a candidate like Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is being tagged as the moderate with bipartisan appeal, proclaimed: Stop the fear-mongering and stop the hate. We may come from different places. We may pray in different ways. We may look different. And love different. But all live in the same country of shared dreams.\n\nThen comes Biden. The former vice president has every right to run and certainly has a great deal to offer. During his career in the Senate and in the White House, Biden was a strong champion of the middle class. He pushed for the kinds of policies that Trump, despite all his promises to the forgotten Americans, never pursued. As vice president, he headed the Middle Class Task Force, which championed policies such as capping student loan payments and improving retirement security. He was even ahead of President Barack Obama on the issue of same-sex marriage.\n\nAlso, as an older white male (who would be 78 years old in January 2021), there are a number of Democrats who see him as the safe choice, the only person who will be able to withstand the President's testosterone-filled campaign. And CNN polling shows that right now most believe he would do best in a matchup against the President.\n\nBut is Biden really the best answer for the party? There is good reason for Democrats to be skeptical and to consider supporting other candidates.\n\nMost problematic is the fact that Biden has run for the presidency several times, and each time he has struggled under the intense spotlight. When it comes time to hit the campaign trail, Biden has never been able to generate the level of support that is necessary to win. His tendency to make gaffes has also hurt him. And, in our frenzied news cycle with endless outlets and few filters on information, Biden's style will cause problems again.\n\nOf course, these issues didn't stop Trump in 2016. But unlike Trump, it is unclear that without a comparable partisan media outlet (Fox News) and unyielding partisan loyalty, that Biden would survive. While MSNBC could offer a boost to Biden, social scientists have shown that the conservative media has a much stronger hold on conservative viewers than liberal outlets. Conservatives also tend to be more ideologically homogenous and loyal than their counterparts on the left. In other words, Democrats have seen the challenges that the inevitable frontrunner faces, as the election actually takes shape.\n\nMore important, though, is the moment in which we are living. Trump has run a political operation from the White House that has revolved around a vision of white nationalism that challenges the values of pluralism, diversity and inclusion. His statement after Charlottesville forever marked his term in office. And the President's perpetual struggle to build a wall perfectly captures what he hopes to achieve – with his central goal being about keeping people out rather than bringing them in.\n\nWith so many strong candidates already lined up to run in the Democratic primaries, many of whom who have launched their runs with the kind of gravitas and excitement that bodes well for a presidential campaign, there is a risk of someone like Biden being in the race – someone with the potential to suck up all the oxygen in the room. Uncle Joe could quickly take away media attention and campaign funds from Democrats who would perform better in the general election. If Biden was the nominee, he would also throw cold water on the excitement and energy that exists among younger Democrats about the direction of their party.\n\nThe Democrats should not assume that an older, moderate white man is inevitably the strongest candidate. Even Bernie Sanders offers a fresh perspective with his left of center, Democratic Socialist positions (he would also be notable as a Jewish-American nominee). It is possible to see the virtue of a ticket that embodies diversity from the top down. All of the candidates who are currently running would enable the Democrats to showcase the difference in what the party represents compared to the GOP. As a new article in The New York Times shows, the GOP is bleeding young voters with each passing day of the Trump presidency.\n\nWith Biden at the top of the ticket, it would be much more difficult to generate enthusiasm among African-Americans, Latinos or younger voters, for instance, who will be looking to Democrats to prove that they will offer something fundamentally different. While there are early polls showing substantial numbers of African-Americans backing Biden and Sanders, these don't measure the excitement that might be generated on the campaign trail once the other candidates are better known and once their political skills have been proven.\n\nAnd Biden's pivotal role on the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act, which was foundational to the expansion of the mass incarceration system, will come back to haunt him. Like Hillary Clinton, he will have to reckon with his vote authorizing President George W. Bush to use military force in Iraq, baggage that the younger generation of Democrats won't be carrying onto the campaign trail.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nMeanwhile, many educated, suburban women are looking for a candidate who will take seriously the message of the #metoo movement. This is a social movement that has rocked American society, bringing attention to the horrendous ways in which sexism and sexual assault continue to play out in many of our major industries and in our private lives. They won't be happy to hear about his role in the 1991 Clarence Thomas hearings, where he was one of the many senators who did not take seriously the sexual harassment complaints of Anita Hill. He was part of the reason that 1992 saw a surge in female candidates.\n\nThe most successful Democrat in recent decades was Barack Obama, who mobilized a powerful electoral coalition because of the change he represented for the Democratic Party – not because he was the party's safe choice.\n\nOf course, Biden has a right to run – should he so choose. But before Democrats go overboard in shifting their financial and organizational resources, as well as endorsements, to the former vice president, they should think long and hard about whether they want the face of their party to be someone who represents the past – or the future.
For more than four years, countries that rely on American foreign aid have been reeling from the profound impact that Donald Trump's reinstatement of the Mexico City policy has had on women.\n\nThe policy, known as the global gag rule among opponents, prevents non-government organizations that provide abortions, give counseling about abortions, or advocate for safe access to abortion from receiving US funding.\n\nBut while the policy is meant to stop abortions, research shows that it has the opposite effect -- and with deadly consequences for women. One 2019 study published in The Lancet found that during previous periods when the policy was in effect, abortions increased by 40% compared to periods where it was rescinded, contraceptive use dropped by 13.5% and pregnancies rose by 12%.\n\nOn Thursday, US President Joe Biden rescinded the policy through a presidential memorandum, with reproductive rights advocates hailing it as a victory for the health and lives of women, girls and people who can become pregnant.\n\nDuring a signing ceremony in the Oval Office, Biden said the move will reverse my predecessor's attack on women's health access.\n\nHe added that the measure relates to protecting women's health at home and abroad, and it reinstates the changes that were made to Title X (a family planning program that prohibits federal funds from being used for abortions) and other things making it harder for women to have access to affordable health care as it relates to their reproductive rights.\n\nWhile the announcement has been welcomed by women's rights groups and their advocates, and they are working toward a permanent repeal, they stress that the collateral damage of the Trump-era policy is vast, and that it will take more than just an announcement to rebuild entire health systems fractured by the policy.\n\nThat's because while previous incarnations of the rule under other Republican presidents primarily targeted family planning programs, Trump's supersized version (the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy) impacted a wide spectrum of US funded health programs , spanning from HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment to malaria, tuberculosis, food, water, and sanitation programs.\n\nIn 2019, Trump took that policy a step further, announcing the withdrawal of funding from any organization that provides funding to other groups that carry out abortions or discuss abortions with their clients.\n\nIn total, the Trump administration's expansion of the rule increased the amount of money affected by the policy by nearly 20-fold, from approximately $600 million to an estimated $12 billion.\n\nThe loss of that funding cannot be overstated, according to organizations who refused to comply with Trump's policy.\n\nMSI Reproductive Choices, a global non-profit that provides family planning advice and sexual health services, is one of them. The group said in a 2020 report that they lost $30 million in funding, money that over the course of Trump's term they say would have served an estimated 8 million women with family planning services that would have prevented an estimated 6 million unintended pregnancies, 1.8 million unsafe abortions and 20,000 maternal deaths.\n\nMSI Reproductive Choices' Ethiopia country director Abebe Shibru, who was the country director for MSI Zimbabwe during most of Trump's term, said the policy undermined the rights of women to exercise their rights to reproductive health.\n\nShibru told CNN that after the policy was reinstated, MSI's outreach locations and services across Zimbabwe were slashed in half, shuttering reproductive health access for millions of disadvantaged women living in the country's most remote areas. It's a scenario that has been unfolding across many parts of Africa, he said, and one that will take time to repair.\n\nYou can't just remove the damage of the last four years, Shibru said. It will take time.\n\nA 'chilling' effect\n\nMelvine Ouyo, a Nairobi-based reproductive health nurse and former clinic director at Family Health Options Kenya agrees, explaining that the effects of the policy didn't just damage maternal health, but also impacted services including malaria, HIV and sanitation -- and drove a wedge between crucial health partnerships, as groups that accepted the policy's conditions became wary of contact with groups that did not. They could not coordinate openly, Ouyo said, explaining that she believes the groups who did accept the policy's conditions were concerned about losing funding.\n\nA United States Agency for International Development (USAID) spokesperson told CNN in November that When a foreign NGO declines to agree to the (Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance) Policy, USAID transitions the activities that NGO would have undertaken, with US funding, to other partners, while minimizing any disruption of care. However, a State Department review from August 2020 found that the policy did disrupt some efforts to treat tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS and to deliver nutritional assistance, among other programs.\n\nOuyo said that the policy created a chilling effect not just in Kenya but across many other countries in Africa.\n\nIt created misunderstanding and lack of trust and made it hard for civil society groups to work in partnership, she said.\n\nOuyo also detailed another unexpected outcome of the policy: self-censorship. Organizations that accepted the conditions of the rule have declined to speak openly about its impact out of concerns that it could jeopardize future funding from the US Agency for International Development (USAID), she said.\n\nIt's an effect that has turned back the clock on reproductive rights and has halted the flow of information about reproductive rights across the globe, even in countries where abortion is legal.\n\nIn Nepal, the legalization of abortion in 2002 is tied to a dramatic drop in maternal mortality. But research by the International Women's Health Coalition (IWHC), which promotes reproductive health rights, found the rule had threatened to reverse those gains.\n\nIn the IWHC's 2019 Crisis in Care report , which documented the impact of the policy with their partners in Kenya, Nepal, Nigeria, and South Africa, a managing director of a global gag rule-compliant organization in Nepal said that as their workers provided counseling services, people would sometimes try to speak with them about abortion, but in such cases, we tell our staff to tell them that they don't know anything about it -- even though abortion is legal on a national level and that staff might know about safe places to access the service.\n\nAnd that's the intended result of the Mexico City Policy's so-called gag, reproductive health advocates say. The rule impedes the ability to share knowledge about the legal status of abortion and how to access safe abortion services through public health systems, with the consequence often resulting in people turning to unsafe abortion practices, reproductive rights groups and researchers say.\n\nOne lawyer said in the IWHC report that in South Africa -- where abortion is also legal, but can be difficult to access -- that the policy just makes a service that was already inaccessible even more inaccessible.\n\nNow that the rule has been rescinded, communicating about safe abortion practices can resume, but being able to do so quickly -- and effectively -- with local partners on the ground will be key, said Nina Besser Doorley, Associate Director of Advocacy and Policy at the IWHC.\n\nDoorley explained that when policy changes in the US, it can be very slow to sort of filter its way out into the field.\n\nSo it's really critical that as the policy is rescinded, that it's also clearly communicated out. That's one other thing I'd say is that this is a long-term problem. And it really leads to long term effects, she said.\n\nAnd the longer that it takes for those lines of communication to reopen, the longer that stigmatization and secrecy around services could linger.\n\nPolicies like this single out abortion and take it out of health care -- and silo and subject it to criteria that are based on ideology and not based on health best practices, Doorley said.\n\nDoorley explained the knock-on effect of the policy on health care networks.\n\nYou can't just reopen the clinic, you can't just rehire the staff. Nina Besser Doorley, Associate Director of Advocacy and Policy, IWHC\n\nA lot of organizations that have lost funding under the policy have had to close clinics that were often the only easily accessible clinic for an entire community. Those people currently have increased barriers to access, given that they need to travel to another place to reach a clinic -- which isn't always a financially or logistically possible. Plus, the clinics that are still open might also be facing financial difficulties as a result of the policy, and have, in turn laid off staff or dropped other services. This can all add to the overall reduction of availability and quality of care for multiple communities, she said.\n\nThey (the Mexico City policy and subsequent expansions of the policy) increase stigma, they single it out and they put it separate from everything else, Doorley added, explaining that clinics build up trust the longer they are in a community. If that relationship is severed by the provider closing, which many have had to do due to lack of funding under the policy, Doorley said, you can't just reopen the clinic, you can't just rehire the staff. It takes time to reestablish presences and communities to rehire staff to rebuild the trust of their relationships, and all of that it's way harder to do.\n\nA US congressional aide who works on global health issues agreed, telling CNN this week that the tail of the Global Gag is very long, and that it's not a matter of flipping a switch and suddenly women...have access to care they didn't have before.\n\nThat is one of the reasons why women's reproductive rights groups are calling on the Biden administration to take a step further.\n\nPlaying with women's rights\n\nPaula Avilla-Guillen, Executive Director at the Women's Equality Center in New York, has joined a chorus of human rights defenders who are calling on Biden to permanently repeal the rule so that it cannot be reinstated by the next president, noting that as the policy has been reinstated and rescinded along political party lines since its inception in 1984, it has left the lives of some of the world's most vulnerable people hanging in the balance of who holds the keys to the White House.\n\nWhat we have seen over the years, is a kind of political play with women's rights globally, by the Democrat and Republican parties, Avilla-Guillen told CNN.\n\nLawmakers and advocates are now working to put a stop to that. On Thursday, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, re-introduced the Global HER Act, a bill to permanently repeal the gag rule. In the US House, Illinois Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky has written legislation to repeal the Helms Amendment, which remains in effect regardless of the party in power. Schakowsky's Abortion is Health Care Everywhere Act was introduced into Congress last year, and she will re-introduce that same bill in February. The Helms Amendment was enacted in 1973 and bars the use of US foreign aid for performing abortions, not just to foreign non-profits, but to governments, multilateral organizations and US non-profits.\n\nSchakowsky also noted the disproportionate impact the Mexico City Policy and the Helms rule have on poor women of color, saying that these policies are clearly founded in racism that these women, these struggling women around the world, mostly black and brown, would not be able to have access to abortion.\n\nEven with these efforts to reverse or end the policies, Avila-Guillen said the damage of the Trump legacy will take time to undo.\n\nBut what the Trump administration did was take one step further -- a few steps forward -- and only emboldened governments with overarching political power to try to restrict women and girls, as opposed to any type of equality in general.\n\nIn October, the Trump administration aimed to seal its commitment to a global fight against abortion rights access, joining a group of largely repressive governments in co-sponsoring an international nonbinding declaration that states there is no international right to abortion, nor any international obligation on the part of States to finance or facilitate abortion.\n\nThe Biden administration said on Thursday that it intends to withdraw co-sponsorship and its signature from the declaration, but it's an example of how Trump's tenure has emboldened authoritarian governments and anti-abortion groups that are still focused on dismantling any gains that women's reproductive rights movement have made, despite the global gag rule, Avila-Guillen says.\n\nShe points to Honduras -- where abortion is banned under any circumstance -- and that ratified a new law into its constitution on Thursday evening that now makes abortion reform nearly impossible.\n\nThe legislation, which also prohibits legislating for equal marriage in the country, was backed by Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández's ruling party, who was recognized by Trump's administration as the winner of a widely disputed election in 2017 that the Organization of American States said was marred with irregularities that called the results into question.\n\nUntil we know how far back we went, we won't know how many steps forward we need to take to catch up. Paula Avilla-Guillen, Executive Director, Women's Equality Center\n\nA lot of the political statements of the Trump administration were saying to these governments that it was ok to enact harsher laws, it was ok not to care about women and girls, Avila-Guillen said.\n\nShe believes that it will take time to fully understand the impact that this version of the global gag rule -- and the wider impact that the Trump administration's rhetoric has had on global gender equality.\n\nUntil we know how far back we went, we won't know how many steps forward we need to take to catch up, she said.
Story highlights Periods of difficulty among couples are common and can be overcome Communication, listening and changing yourself are steps in mending a broken relationship\n\n(CNN) —\n\nYou buy a sports car, start hitting the gym and have an affair: It's the stereotypical midlife crisis, one we've seen played out both onscreen and in real life.\n\nAlthough not everyone acts out middle-age angst in such a way, many of us do experience a reckoning or longing as we approach midlife, the feeling of hitting a wall and wondering if there isn't more to life – and in, particular, to marriage.\n\nI often see this phenomenon in my own practice, as one or both partners begin to question their relationship. Even in younger couples, disagreements over classic issues such as finances, parenthood and sex can lead to concerns that they may not be on the same page regarding many of life's greatest stressors and demands.\n\nBut are such couples headed for divorce, or are they simply mired in difficulties that could be better navigated together?\n\nIn her new book, The Rough Patch: Marriage and the Art of Living Together, psychologist Daphne de Marneffe argues that it's often entirely possible for couples to weather these and other bumps in the road, coming out stronger on the other side.\n\nAccording to de Marneffe, it's not only common but natural for today's couples to experience rough patches. In the past, marriage was often an economic arrangement based on a division of labor and child-rearing. Now, we want a partner in love, too. And we live longer than ever. We aspire to close, intimate marriages, but emotions can be complicated and inconvenient, she explains. We want to have it all in a relationship, but that can be challenging.\n\nHere, she shares some advice for couples trying to get out of midlife rough patches, as well as for younger couples hoping to avoid them altogether.\n\nDevelop your communication skills\n\nGood communication is key, de Marneffe says – not just the ability to discuss critical relationship issues but to know what you want and express that. We get hung up on the idea of having a lot in common with a potential partner, she says. That's all well and good, but your ability to communicate in a healthy way is more important.\n\nYou might be uncomfortable expressing your needs and desires at first, but learning how is the single most beneficial step you can take. And you'll probably save yourselves some unnecessary arguments when you realize that you can't expect your partner to be a mind-reader.\n\nWork on yourself\n\nIt's tempting to expect our partners to change to suit our preferences, but the tough work in marriage starts with yourself: If you don't know what you want or how to articulate that, how can you expect your partner to know? Work at it on your own or with a therapist to learn how to express your emotions.\n\nI'm suggesting a paradigm shift in the way we view relationships, de Marneffe says. It's not all about your partner – it's about changing yourself, too.\n\nTalk about big issues early on\n\nIn The Rough Patch, de Marneffe gives advice for tackling a variety of major relationship demands, including one of the biggest issues for many couples: money.\n\nOf course, when you're newly in love, hashing out finances is hardly sexy. Money seems far too mundane to discuss for couples in the first blush of romance, but it can be a huge source of stress, she says. Good communication skills will help you talk sooner rather than later about difficult subjects, including financial concerns.\n\nLearn to listen\n\nSelf-awareness and self-responsibility are critical ingredients to a successful marriage, de Marneffe says. Even if you're still in the process of working on your own issues, simply expressing that to your partner can make a difference in your relationship.\n\nFor instance, if you tend to interrupt your partner or act dismissive of their feelings, you can acknowledge that you're aware of the problem and are trying to change. You can say, 'I know that how I act affects you, I'm sorry, and I'm working on it,'  she says. Your partner will feel heard and understood – and that's what we all want.\n\nRedefine success\n\nIf you've both given it your best shot and have concluded that you're not just in a rough patch, there's no shame in parting ways. Not every divorce is a failure, de Marneffe says. Some divorcing couples understand each other better than some married couples do. If you can come to a compassionate and responsible decision about your relationship, sometimes that's better for everyone.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe Rough Patch can be beneficial for both single people and couples.

You can stream every moment on your mobile phone, laptop, or wherever you get CNN, starting at 5 a.m. ET on Saturday, May 19.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding has been overshadowed by her father's reported decision not to attend, but another relation is emerging as a player in the royal drama.\n\nMeghan's half-sister Samantha Markle made headlines this week after she said their father, Thomas Markle, would not attend the wedding on Saturday because of embarrassment over a series of staged photographs, which she encouraged him to take.\n\nSince then he's reportedly changed his mind about attending the ceremony more than once, and now seems set to miss it to undergo scheduled heart surgery.\n\nIn recent days, Samantha Markle has given a series of television interviews and earned the moniker of media vulture from Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan.\n\n01:59 - Source: HLN Piers Morgan calls Markle's half-sister a 'vulture'\n\nA child from Thomas Markle's first marriage, Samantha Markle is a 53-year-old mother of three and a former actress and model who lives in Florida. She uses a wheelchair because she suffers from multiple sclerosis, according to a report in the UK's Sun newspaper.\n\nSeventeen years older than Meghan, Samantha Markle has claimed she raised her half-sister for 12 years when they were growing up in California, but that has been disputed by other family sources, the report added.\n\nThe elder half-sister is also known as Samantha Grant, but recently changed her name back to Markle, according to the Guardian.\n\nDescribed in the British media as estranged from her half-sibling, Samantha Markle has said she has not met the royal bride-to-be for a decade. In recent interviews she said that she last spoke to Meghan by phone three or four years ago.\n\n01:27 - Source: CNN TMZ: Markle's dad says he can't attend wedding\n\nSamantha Markle first made news in 2016 when she told the Sun her sister had long had her eye set on Prince Harry because she was ambitious to become a princess and had a soft spot for gingers.\n\nSince then she has regularly commented on the forthcoming marriage, criticizing Meghan for not inviting her and other family members to the wedding and not offering financial help to her reportedly bankrupt father. She has also rebutted Prince Harry's claim that the royal family were the family (Meghan) never had.\n\nBut she has also praised Meghan for her intelligence and beauty and criticized her brother – Meghan's half-brother – Thomas Markle, Jr., for telling Prince Harry in an open letter that if the marriage goes ahead it will be the biggest mistake of his life.\n\nSamantha Markle is reportedly writing an autobiography titled The Diary of Princess Pushy's Sister, which will include details about about her half-sister. British media reports say she will be in Windsor for the wedding as a guest of a television broadcaster.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe Supreme Court won't hear the major religious liberty case until Tuesday, but already hopeful spectators and line-holders are bearing colder temperatures equipped with sleeping bags, coolers and lawn chairs hoping to secure a rare seat in the majestic chamber for what could be one of the most important cases of the term.\n\nAt issue is a Colorado baker who refused to make a cake to celebrate a same-sex couple's marriage because he believes that God designed marriage to be between a man and a woman.\n\nThe case pits the religious liberty claims of Jack Phillips, who owns Masterpiece Cakeshop, against the couple, David Mullins and Charlie Craig, who say Phillips' actions amount to discrimination.\n\nLGBT rights advocates fear that if the Supreme Court ultimately sides with Phillips, it will diminish its own opinion from two years ago that cleared the way for same-sex marriage nationwide. Both sides agree that a ruling in favor of Masterpiece would also open the door to claims from others who engage in professional services – wedding florists, for example – to claim that their religious liberty exempts them from public accommodation laws applicable to other businesses.\n\nIt was back in 1993 that Phillips opened the bakery, knowing at the outset that there would be certain cakes he would decline to make in order to abide by his religious beliefs. I didn't want to use my artistic talents to create something that went against my Christian faith, he said in an interview, noting that he has declined to make cakes to celebrate Halloween.\n\nFlash-forward to 2012, when same-sex marriage was not yet legal in Colorado, but two men walked into the bakery.\n\nThe conversation was fairly short, Philips remembered. I went over and greeted them. We sat down at the desk where I had my wedding books open.\n\nThe men told Phillips they wanted a cake to celebrate their planned wedding, which would be performed in another state. Phillips said he knew right away that he couldn't create the product they were looking for without violating his faith.\n\nThe Bible says, 'In the beginning there was male and female,'  he said. He offered to make any other baked goods for the men.\n\nAt which point they both stormed out and left, Phillips said.\n\nThe couple filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which ruled in their favor, citing a state anti-discrimination law. Phillips took his case to the Colorado Court of Appeals, arguing that requiring him to provide a wedding cake for the couple violated his constitutional right to freedom of speech and free exercise of religion. The court held that the state anti-discrimination law was neutral and generally applicable and did not compel Masterpiece to support or endorse any particular religious view. It simply prohibited Phillips from discriminating against potential customers on account of their sexual orientation.\n\nPhillips then took his case to the Supreme Court and the justices agreed to take it up after mulling it for several weeks.\n\nIn court papers, Kristen K. Waggoner, a lawyer from the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom who is representing Phillips, argued that the First Amendment guarantees him the right to decline to make wedding cakes that celebrate marriages that are in conflict with his religious beliefs. She argued that Phillips is protected by two parts of the First Amendment: its protections of religious exercise and free speech. While she argued that the free exercise clause forbids the commission from targeting Phillips and like-minded believers for punishment, she reserved the bulk of her brief for the free speech clause, perhaps targeting potential swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has at times shown an expansive view of free speech.\n\nWaggoner argued that a person viewing one of Phillips' custom wedding cakes – his artistic expression – would understand that it celebrates and expresses support for the couple's marriage. She said the Supreme Court's compelled speech doctrine forbids the commission from demanding that artists design custom expression that conveys ideas they deem objectionable.\n\nIn the interview, Phillips said, I feel I'm being compelled to create artwork for an event – an inherently religious event – that goes against my faith, and I'm being compelled to do so under penalty of jail time and fines.\n\nNot surprisingly, Mullins and Craig see the case through an entirely different lens: discrimination.\n\nThis case is about more than us, and it's not about cakes, Mullins said in an interview. It's about the right of gay people to receive equal service.\n\nThis isn't about artistic expression, said Craig. I don't feel like we asked for a piece of art, or for him to make a statement, we simply asked him for a cake, and he denied that to us simply because of who we are.\n\nThe couple is being represented in court by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nIn essence, the bakery seeks a constitutional right to hang a sign in its shop window proclaiming, 'Wedding Cakes for Heterosexuals Only,'  the ACLU's David D. Cole wrote in briefs.\n\nCole said that whether a cake is an artistic expression is not at issue. The question, rather, is whether the Constitution grants businesses open to the public the right to violate laws against discrimination in the commercial marketplace if the business happens to sell an artistic product.\n\nThe answer, Cole contends, is no.\n\nTwenty other states and the District of Columbia likewise expressly prohibit places of public accommodation from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nThe Trump administration sides with Phillips in the case, arguing that it falls within the small set of applications of content-neutral laws that merit heightened scrutiny from the courts. A custom wedding cake is not an ordinary baked good; its function is more communicative and artistic than utilitarian, Solicitor General Noel Francisco argued. Accordingly, the government may not enact content-based laws commanding a speaker to engage in protected expression: An artist cannot be forced to paint, a musician cannot be forced to play, and a poet cannot be forced to write.\n\nBut the government lawyers did draw a line when it comes to race, arguing that laws targeting race-based discrimination may survive heightened First Amendment scrutiny in part because racial bias is a familiar and recurring evil that poses unique historical, constitutional and institutional concerns.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nReligion didn't come up when Jack Phillips, a Christian baker in Colorado, told a gay couple he wouldn't make their wedding cake in the summer of 2012. Shaken and embarrassed, Charlie Craig and David Mullins say they quickly left the shop without seeking an explanation.\n\nBut Craig's mother, Debbie Munn, had been with the couple and wanted to know why Phillips had refused their business. She called him first thing the next morning.\n\nHe shared his faith, and I shared mine, said Munn, who attends a nondenominational church in Wyoming. Within a minute I knew there was nothing more to be said.\n\nAfter five years of litigation, the dispute between the gay couple and Christian baker reached the Supreme Court on Tuesday. But while lawyers debated the legal issues in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, a different set questions could be asked about the conversation between Phillips and Munn.\n\nMainly, what is it about religion that makes it such a conversation-ender?\n\nIn the last few years, moral psychologists have tried to explain why good people can be so bitterly divided by politics and religion, to paraphrase the subtitle of one popular book. Are religious beliefs so deeply held that they brook no dissent? Or, as some psychologists have argued, does faith include a healthy dose of self-interest masquerading as morality?\n\nReligion is more than a source of conflict, of course. Faith offers solace and a sense of solidarity for billions around the world. But this week, the combative side of religion was hard to escape, whether you were in Washington, Tuscaloosa or Tel Aviv.\n\nIn Alabama, Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore tried to rally conservative Christians by casting his opponents as socialists who put man above God. Stumping for Moore, Steve Bannon, a former adviser to President Donald Trump, said Mitt Romney hid behind (his) religion when he served as a Mormon missionary rather than enter the draft for the Vietnam War. Romney had criticized Republicans for backing Moore despite allegations that Moore had harassed and molested teenaged girls when he was in his 30s. Moore has denied the allegations.\n\nOn the world stage, Trump announced that the United States would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, inciting a potent mix of emotions among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Some splits erupted within religious communities themselves, pitting Christian against Christian, and Jew against Jew.\n\nThe Masterpiece Cakeshop case is not nearly as incendiary as Jerusalem's status, but it poses similar questions about religious groups' willingness to compromise on deeply held principles.\n\nIf the scene outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday was any indication, the answer seemed doubtful.\n\nOn one side stood about 100 protesters who listened to conservative speakers quote the Bible and rail against the secular establishment. They chanted We back Jack! and waved signs that said Free Speech Should be a Piece of Cake. A musical group called the Free the Cake Baker Squad played a ditty called Cakey Breaky Heart on acoustic guitars.\n\nTwenty yards away stood another group, also of about 100 people, who listened to liberal speakers, some of whom also quoted the Bible and railed against bigotry and discrimination. They held posters saying It's Not About the Cake and danced to Curtis Mayfield's soul classic Move On Up.\n\nBoth sides accused the other of intolerance, of trying to impose their moral views on the rest of the country.\n\nFor a while, a man stood between the two groups of protesters, calmly holding a large umbrella that read, Bow to Jesus. Repent America. Time is Running Out.\n\n'Jesus talked about Sodom'\n\nThe Rev. Raedorah Stewart stood with the protesters backing the gay couple. She wore lavender glasses to match her purple vestments and described herself as a queer woman in her 60s. She's also the faculty director of the Writing Center at Wesley Theological Seminary and a minister at Covenant Baptist United Church of Christ in Washington.\n\nStewart said she has experienced bigotry because of her race and sexuality. She was skeptical about finding middle ground with the conservative protesters.\n\nThere is no compromise in determining who is human and deserves justice. I would not seek to persuade them other than to say, 'You are made in the image of God, and I am made in the image of God, and we are both entitled to equal rights.'\n\nStewart said she also has encountered suspicion from LGBT people who are skeptical about religious believers, especially ministers. Sometimes they don't see me as a queer person, she said, even though am I no Bible-thumper.\n\nWhat would Stewart do if she had a business and white supremacists wanted her to make a sign for their rally, an analogy some conservatives have made to Phillips' cake shop?\n\nI would make the sign, I would take their money, and I would use it to support my ministry.\n\nThe Rev. Glen Bayly, a retired minister in the Christian & Missionary Alliance, an evangelical denomination, stood with the conservative protesters, holding a sign supporting Jack Phillips. Bayly lives in Mifflinburg, Pennsylvania, where he hosts a radio show called The Lion's Den University Report about Christians' experiences – often negative, as the biblical title alludes – at secular universities.\n\nLike Stewart, Bayly was skeptical about compromising with protesters on the other side.\n\nOf course they are offended when you're saying that their lifestyle is sinful, but that's where the conversation has to start.\n\nBayly said the dividing line between liberals and conservatives is the Bible, which he believes clearly prohibits homosexuality. Jesus talked about Sodom and the Day of Judgment, he said, citing a passage from the Gospel of Matthew.\n\nGesturing at the Supreme Court, he continued, No matter what happens today, those justices are not the supreme judge. God is the supreme judge.\n\nWhat about Stewart's argument that all humans are made in the image and likeness of God and should therefore be treated equally?\n\nThey're talking about equality over there a lot, he said. That's a spiritual concept. It doesn't mean we're all alike in every way. Some of us are taller, some are shorter, some are murderers. We make value judgments every day.\n\nWhile neither Stewart nor Bayly saw much room for political compromise, they did believe in personal – if not political – conversions.\n\nStewart said her mother, an avid Bible-reader, was generally accepting of her sexuality and her calling as a minister, but she was concerned about her daughter's salvation. She told me that she worried that I would preach others into heaven, but I would go to hell.\n\nOver time, though, Stewart said her mother's theology changed, and she moved from a conservative Baptist church to Stewart's Covenant Baptist UCC, which calls itself a radically inclusive congregation.\n\nDo I hold out hope for more change? Yes. What transforms is love.\n\nBayly's conversion story moved in the opposite direction. He was handing out tracts titled, I Was 'Gay': The Testimony of Stephen Bennett.\n\nIn the tract, Bennett, who Bayly said was a friend of his, describes an emotional and sometimes painful path from homosexuality to heterosexual marriage. Through praying and reading the Bible with Christian friends, Bennett writes, he slowly made his way to the God-ordained path of heterosexuality.\n\nMy story is a dream come true, Bennett says in the tract. I no longer struggle whatsoever with homosexual thoughts, feelings or actions. I am a heterosexual man through and through, the exact way God created me to be.\n\nBayly said he tried to hand out the tract to some of the LGBT protesters who wandered over to the conservative side. He didn't find many takers.\n\n'Goodies and power'\n\nSeveral years ago, researchers conducted a study to see if self-interest could change people's moral views. In three experiments, participants played a game in which they were paid money based on the principles of equality (everybody gets the same amount) or equity (the payouts are determined by how hard one works).\n\nThe participants given less work said it was more moral to divide the money equally among everyone. Those assigned more work said the opposite, that equity was the proper principle to follow. The study also found that people quickly changed their position depending on whether they stood to benefit.\n\nIn the few minutes between reading the game instructions and discovering their own role – and hence, where their interests lie – people's reported moral judgments changed in line with their self-interest, the researchers wrote.\n\nMoral psychology is a complex discipline, and scholars acknowledge that ideology plays an important role. But some argue that studies like these indicate that beliefs are just one factor in people's moral decisions, which are more fluid than we think.\n\nWhat we think are bedrock principles are not really bedrocks, said Robert Kurzban, a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the researchers behind the equality-equity game. As situations change, people have different perceptions, and they measure the costs and benefits of holding moral commitments.\n\nConsider white evangelicals' willingness to support politicians who act immorally in their personal lives, Kurzban said. In 2011, just 30% said they would do so, but in 2016, when Donald Trump became the GOP presidential nominee, that number leapt to 72%.\n\nYou have to ask, were their answers in 2011 suspect, or did their interests change because they wanted this guy who would give them goodies and power? said Kurzban, co-author of the book The Hidden Agenda of the Political Mind: How Self-Interest Shapes Our Opinions and Why We Won't Admit It.\n\nEvangelicals might argue – and many have – that the desire for goodies and power was driven by their beliefs that abortion is immoral and religious freedom should be protected, positions advocated by Trump.\n\nBut it's also possible to see religious freedom concerns as driven by self-interest – the right to practice one's faith without state interference, Kurzban said. In fact, it's possible to see both sides of the Masterpiece Cakeshop case as self-interested.\n\nLGBT people have obvious reasons to protest state-sanctioned discrimination, which, in addition to causing emotional distress, limits their ability to buy goods, get medical care and participate as full members of society. Conservative Christians, in addition to their principles, also have self-interests to protect, including the ability to act on those principles without being forced out of business.\n\nSo maybe it's not the bedrock beliefs espoused by protesters like Stewart and Bayly that make the Masterpiece Cakeshop case so difficult to decide. Maybe it's the Solomonic, split-the-baby task of determining whose self-interests should win out. It seems like a zero-sum game, inflamed by the partisanship that makes small compromises seem like big defeats. You can see that in Roy Moore's candidacy, the battle over the Holy Land, and any number of religious hot spots around the world.\n\nReligion seems to present insoluble problems, Kurzban said. But it's not because of religion. You have to look behind that, and think about the real, tangible things at stake.

(UK Pool via AP)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan have kissed for the first time as a married couple after a joyous and modern wedding full of firsts for Britain's royal family.\n\nNow known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the newlyweds emerged from their ceremony in St. George's Chapel and shared a short kiss on the grounds of Windsor Castle, before descending hand-in-hand down the chapel stairs to be whisked off in a horse-drawn carriage.\n\nPHOTO: Ben Birchhall/AP Harry and Meghan kiss on the steps of St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.\n\nThe couple had married in front of of hundreds of guests, including British celebrities and many from across the Atlantic, such as Oprah Winfrey, Serena Williams, and George and Amal Clooney.\n\nCouples do not typically kiss in Church of England wedding ceremonies, but it has been tradition for royal couples to kiss publicly soon after for the world to see.\n\nThe couple was first seen publicly kissing in May last year, when Meghan went to watch Harry play a charity polo match in Berkshire. They were photographed in the car park embracing and kissing before the match.\n\nThe couple's marriage is the culmination of a romance that began in 2016, when the two went on a blind date in London set up by a mutual friend.\n\nMeghan visited Harry during his trip to Botswana later that same year, and it was in October 2016 that rumors emerged that the pair were dating.\n\nThe couple announced their engagement in November last year, the world got a glimpse of the engagement ring, made from a large Botswana diamond and two smaller diamonds that belonged to Harry's late mother, Princess Diana.

Comcast's decision to buy DreamWorks Animation is already being questioned in some quarters.\n\nBut the company's move adds a valuable source of new material it can exploit. It also reflects the nature of the very modern media giant -- less distributor of TV and movies than a voracious content-monetizing machine.\n\nDisney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger paved the way toward Comcast's latest acquisition with its gradual collection of Pixar, Marvel and most recently Lucasfilm. Those deals were also second-guessed for their price tags, but that overlooks the wide array of benefits these companies hope to wring from them.\n\nRelated: Comcast buys DreamWorks in deal valued at $3.8 billion\n\nComcast, with its mix of broadcast and cable networks, a movie studio and theme parks, comes closer to approximating Disney's corporate structure than any other major player in the industry.\n\nAnd Disney's success can't have been lost on Comcast's brain trust. Disney has used Lucasfilm and Marvel not merely to build blockbuster franchises like Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but to power merchandising sales, create spin-off series and load up the theme parks with rides. (Disclosure: My wife works for a division of Disney.)\n\nTellingly, Comcast's Universal has enjoyed a theme-park attendance surge with its Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction, which recently added a second front in Los Angeles after a successful introduction in Orlando. But Comcast (CMCSA) doesn't own that property, having licensed it, meaning it can't fully share in the bounty as all those brooms fly off its shelves.\n\nSimilarly, while Universal has already enjoyed success with animation thanks to the Despicable Me franchise, Disney has demonstrated that having more than one animation engine churning out family entertainment can work. That's especially true if Comcast continues DreamWorks' push into television, a medium with lower costs than movies but significant rewards in keeping children's fare top of mind with little consumers.\n\nRelated: Who will be the next CEO of Disney?\n\nAt $3.8 billion, Comcast appears to be paying a premium for DreamWorks. Nevertheless, the deal reflects a logical mind-set about cashing in on such enterprises: It's better to own than to rent.\n\nMoreover, Comcast's NBC has already been in business with DreamWorks for some time. It airs Shrek animated specials, in much the same way that Disney has used ABC to keep the Toy Story franchise alive and selling, well, toys.\n\nAs with any corporate marriage of this magnitude, the devil is in the details, and more specifically, the creative decisions the studio makes going forward.\n\nYet having already made a sizable investment in the content business, Comcast has decided that bringing Shrek and company into the family is one more step toward living profitably ever after.\n\nAll told, it's not a bad bet.
An Indonesian teen is caned in public in Banda Aceh as punishment for being caught cuddling with her boyfriend.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nTwo 18-year-olds were publicly flogged Thursday in the conservative Indonesian state of Aceh for displaying affection.\n\nThe college student and her boyfriend each received 17 lashes for publicly cuddling, which is a violation of the state's strict interpretation of Sharia law, according to a government spokesman.\n\nThe punishments were administered in front of a mosque in the provincial capital Banda Aceh.\n\nVideo of the event shows a masked individual striking the two teenagers, one after the other, across the upper back in front of a crowd, members of which were taking cellphone videos.\n\nPHOTO: CHAIDEER MAHYUDDIN/AFP/AFP/Getty Images The woman's boyfriend, also a teenager, is whipped as punishment for the public affection.\n\nA 35-year-old man was also whipped 20 times, as part of his punishment for being intimate with a woman in a grocery store which she owned.\n\nThe 40-year-old woman involved in the incident avoided the caning – for now – after medical professionals deemed her unfit to undergo physical punishment. That part of her sentence has been postponed.\n\nThe man and two teenagers had all served 98-day jail sentences ahead of the corporal punishment.\n\nStrict Islamic laws\n\nUnlike the rest of Indonesia, Aceh province follows strict Islamic laws, which make sexual activity outside marriage illegal and prohibit same-sex relations.\n\nThe state's Sharia criminal code went into effect in September 2015. Aceh is the only one of Indonesia's 34 provinces that can legally implement Sharia, according to rights advocacy group Human Rights Watch.\n\nIn recent months, the conservative province has flogged numerous people for un-Islamic activities, including gay sex, adultery and drunkenness.\n\nLast summer, 15 people, including five women, were punished with public caning for violating Sharia law.\n\nTwo men accused of being gay received 87 lashes each for gay sex, while nine others were sentenced up to 26 lashes for adultery. Four people were caned for being drunk, including one woman who received 27 lashes.\n\nAt the time, the governor of the province, Irwandi Yusuf, decreed that corporal sentences be carried out within the city's prison.\n\nHowever, the head of Banda Aceh's religious police, Muhammad Hidayat, said that the recent sentences were carried out publicly because of a lack of detailed instructions concerning the decree.\n\nCNN's Edy Amin contributed to this report.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThere is nothing like a political upset to energize the party out of power.\n\nAnd Tuesday night's election was a whopper of an upset – a huge energizer for not just the Democratic Party, but also for women who have been victims of sexual assault.\n\nPHOTO: Jeff Mauritzen Jen Psaki\n\nYes, Roy Moore was a deeply flawed candidate long before he was accused of sexual abuse, allegations he denies. But Alabama is a deep red state that has not elected a Democrat since 1992, and that Democrat, Richard Shelby, became a Republican just two years later.\n\nDoug Jones ran a smart, Alabama-focused campaign, and stayed out of the national spotlight. He smartly focused on African-American turnout in the closing weeks and it worked.\n\nAs special elections go, this is an earthquake that will have repercussions far into 2018.\n\nWhat will they be?\n\nFirst, Democrats are going to feel emboldened to run in states and districts next year where traditionally they would have no business running. This carries some danger because Democrats are still behind Republicans in fundraising on the national level. Democrats' time, energy and money should be focused on an expanded list of races where they have the best chance of winning.\n\nThere is no doubt now that both the Senate and the House are in play for 2018. The Jones win will help Democrats with fundraising and candidate recruitment. And even in states, like Alabama, where the turnout wheels have been rusty, it is clear that the energy and the enthusiasm is there to be tapped into.\n\nSecond, this is a win for the establishment Republicans. And a loss for Steve Bannon – and more importantly Donald Trump. Trump put himself out there for Roy Moore – not just with presidential tweets, but with a trip to an adjoining media market. This loss is far worse for Trump's political power and for Steve Bannon's political wisdom than was the Republicans' loss in the Virginia governor's race last month.\n\nBut it is still a mixed bag for Mitch McConnell and Republican leaders. Yes, it weakens the insurgency they faced in the Republican Party, but leaves them down a Senate seat at a time when they can't afford it. It also weakens the wing of the party that was actually energizing Republicans, the Trump-Bannon wing.\n\nThird, this is a win for the victims of sexual assault who bravely spoke out in Alabama. It will no doubt embolden other women to speak out against men in power who they say assaulted them. And on the political front, Democratic Senators like Kirsten Gillibrand, who have in the last week raised the stakes on Donald Trump and made clear that Democrats are going to have a zero tolerance policy for sexual harassment and sexual assault, now have the wind at their backs.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nFinally, it is a win for morality and human decency. The candidate accused of sexual abuse, who opposed gay marriage and consensual homosexual relationships, who questioned whether Muslims could serve in the United State Congress, lost.\n\nAnd the candidate who talked not about Donald Trump, but about the importance of the CHIP program, a program that helps provide health insurance to tens of thousands of children every year that Congress has failed to fund, was the winner.\n\nIn a tough political year for morality, let's hope this is a sign of things to come next year.
(CNN) Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday declared the presidency was no job for a woman because of their emotional differences to men, and dismissed speculation his daughter would succeed him next year.\n\nMy daughter is not running. I have told Inday not to run because I pity (her) knowing she will have to go through what I am going through, Duterte said at the launch of a highway project, referring to his daughter Sara by her nickname.\n\nThis is not for women. You know, the emotional setup of a woman and a man is totally different. You will become a fool here. So... that is the sad story.\n\nThe Philippines has had two female presidents, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and Corazon Aquino.\n\nDuterte, 75, is notorious for comments often deemed offensive, sexist and misogynistic, but his office typically calls his remarks harmless jokes. He remains hugely popular among female voters in the Philippines.\n\nRead More

Aired 8-8:30p ET\n\nAired October 10, 2019 - 20:00 ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\n[20:00:00]\n\n\n\nANDERSON COOPER, CNN: And good evening. Welcome to this historic night on CNN. A Democratic presidential town hall dedicated to equality in America. I'm Anderson Cooper. Thanks for joining us. For generation, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered Americans have had to live and love in the shadows. We could be arrested, we could be imprisoned, locked up in institutions. It was just four years ago that the Supreme Court made it possible for us to marry, but the fight for equality is certainly not over.\n\n\n\nJust this week, the Supreme Court is considering whether LGBTQ people can be fired from their jobs because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Laws based on outdated science continue to discriminate against people with HIV and violence against lesbian, gay, and transgendered people is still all too common. Tonight we're partnering with the human rights campaign to give members of the LGBTQ community and their allies, the chance to directly ask the presidential candidates questions. Soon you're going to hear from Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, former congressman Beto O'Rourke, Senator Amy Klobuchar, former Housing Secretary Julian Castro, and businessman Tom Steyer. But joining me right now is former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nHow are you doing, sir?\n\n\n\nJOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Nice to see you.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Hey, everybody. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: It's good to see you. I want to start right away with questions from the audience. Someone, actually I believe you know, you've met before. Judy Shepard is here.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Hey, Judy. How you?\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Hi, Mr. Vice president.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: For those watching at home who may not know, Judy, her son Matthew was murdered when he was just 21 years old. He was tied to a fence and robbed and beaten and then left for dead by two men that he had met in a bar. Judy and her husband Dennis started the Matthew Shepard foundation. They now travel around the country speaking out about how to make community more accepting. Judy, your question, please.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nThanks. Mr. Vice president, our son Matthew was murdered in 1998. While we have since passed federal hate crime legislation, we know that more needs to be done. And this administration is fueling hatred amongst LGBTQ people, people of color, immigrants, and so many more. What will you do as president to help reduce violence and hate crimes against LGBTQ people and other marginalized communities?\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBIDEN: First of all, Judy, it's good to see you. It really is good to see you. I don't want to ruin a reputation, but I consider Judy a friend.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. Feeling is mutual, sir.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Judy, I think there are a whole range of things. First of all, think of what has happened between 2012 and 2016, the progress made, and what's happened just since 2016 and now. The president has pulled back almost every single solitary administratively positive thing we did from the Affordable Care Act, to Title IX, just across the board. And there's a number of things we have to do. First and foremost, I think we have to pass the Equality Act. That's important.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nThat's important because it would change a whole range of things. And by the way, I suspect, Anderson, this is going to one forum you're going to get very little disagreement among the Democratic candidates. I'm proud of the position they all have, because every one of us -- if there is differences, they're just in degree and emotional concern. Number one.\n\n\n\nNumber two, what we had before to deal with hate crimes was we had a position in our administration within the department of -- both Department of Justice as well as within Homeland Security, a provision to keep watch on these groups that we know are out there, like terrorist groups -- they're similar -- know are out there to be able to follow -- without violating their first amendment rights -- to be able to follow what they're doing and follow up on threats that come forward, because they come forward in many different form (ph).\n\n\n\nNumber three, what we have to do is we have to make sure that we make title -- this is a civil rights issue. It's covered by, in my view and the court may not agree, this is a civil rights issue, protected by civil rights, the Civil Rights Act, and we should be focusing on how to enforce that. My Justice Department, I guess any one of the Democrats' Justice Department will in fact do that. Lastly, I think that it's really important that we start early. We\n\n\n\nstart early and we begin to acquaint all our children. My son Bo, who you knew, met, who died, my son started an organization to deal with children of abuse, bullying, and also those engaged in LGBTQ issues, particularly young people. And what he did was begin to try to educate the population about what's going on. Look, all of you, I'm not saying -- you may not all be members of the community, but all of you understand that if the American people knew what was really going on in my view, Anderson, things would be different.\n\n\n\nOne of my arguments is that we don't -- and when we talk about being able to get married on Sunday and get -- or Saturday and get fired on Monday, the vast majority of American people don't think that's possible. The vast majority of people don't know that that is possible. They know you can't be fired because you're African- American , you can't be fired because you're this, that or the other, but they don't know that. And one of the things I will do as president of the united states is constantly remind people of what the facts are, because...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nNo, I really mean it. Because so many of you have taken extraordinary, extraordinary steps to make sure we moved as far as we have, and one of the things that people don't know, try it out, try it out next time you're in a restaurant. You're sitting there and you're waiting on or you meet the maitre'd and say by the way, let me ask you a question. Do you think somebody got married on Monday they could get fired on Tuesday?\n\n\n\nThey're going to look at you and tell you no. They don't know it. The American people are better than we give them credit for. But we allow -- we allow the homophobes to be able to control the agenda because they let this -- no, I really mean it. I really, truly mean it. Try it. Try it. People don't know it. And so I would constantly talk about and educate the public. Part of the responsibility of a president is to convince, is to persuade, to be able to let people know what is actually going on out there.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Let me ask you about that, because in 2012, you were the vice president. The Obama administration hadn't yet publicly backed marriage equality. You made headlines. You said that you were absolutely comfortable with, quote, men marrying men, women marrying women, adding that you're, quote, entitled to the exact same rights. I'm wondering in that moment made you say that at that time? Because you were ahead of your president.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: You know, it caused no consternation at all.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nLook, one of the things that I made clear at the outset before we went into office, Barack -- I say Barack, not because he is not my president. He is the president, but I don't want to confuse him with the other guy when I say president, OK? But Barack knew my position. I was raised by a dad who was, AS real simple basic issue. I remember getting out of a car when I was trying to be dropped off at the local city hall to get a job to be the only white employee in the east side of town in the neighborhood, in the projects as a lifeguard. And as I got out, there were two guys in the corner in Rodney Square, they call it, which is the sort of corporate capital of the world. It's where the chancery court and all that is. And these two guys, well dressed -- this is back in 1960 -- probably 1963, and I'm revealing that I'm almost as old as you. I'm kidding.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nCOOPER: You have more pepper in your hair than I do.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: I have a hell of a lot less hair. But look, as my dad was dropping me off so I could go around the block and run and get the application. And two well dressed men kissed one another as I was opening the door. And I hadn't seen that before. And I turned around and one walked off to the DuPont building, one walked off to what used to be called the Hercules Corporation. And I looked at my dad, and he looked at me and said it's simple, honey. They love each other. It's just basic. There is nothing complicated about it. That's how I was raised, for real. And so for me...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\n...for me -- and Barack knew that. Barack knew that. And he knew that if I was going to be a good boy until the administration moved unless I was asked, but you know me too well. You know that, you know, no one ever doubts I mean what I say. The problem is I sometimes say all that I mean.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nSo when I was asked on Meet the Press what I thought -- and by the way, I just (ph) came from the same household I talked about, two guys that had these two beautiful children, men married here in California, and they have these two beautiful little kids. And I just saw them about two hours ago, and with their children.\n\n\n\nOne is playing football now at age 13, the little girl is 15 who introduced me to a crowd at her home. And it's just the way they looked at their parents. And afterwards, and I got asked the question by the former director of the HRC, Chad Griffin, he was at this event, and this is back in '12. And he looked at me and he said what do you think of us? And I said I don't think of you any different I think of anybody else. And I went on to say that I did not have any problem whatsoever, whatsoever with same-sex marriage. It never even crossed my mind.\n\n\n\nAnd had it (ph), I would be divorced because Jill is way ahead of that already. That's my wife, Jill. But all kidding aside, and so, it was sort of already out, if you would say, I was already there. And so when I went on Meet the Press, the next week -- I think it was the next week -- I answered the question honestly, and everybody thought that I had jumped the gun on the president. I didn't know the president was and his staff was thinking about -- in fact the president moving right after the election. And I got to tell you, he's a great guy -- I went in on Monday, and all the national press is saying Biden is really going to get nailed when he walks in and sees the president every morning. He got up, and he walked over to me and he said well, you told me. He gave me a kiss. I swear to god.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nSo anyway, but it was -- look, folks, it's kind of basic stuff, who you love.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: I want to introduce Shannon Scott (ph). She served in the U.S. Air force, including two combat tours in Iraq and is on the national board of governors.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nShe's also on the executive committee for the human rights campaign. Shannon, thank you for your service and your question.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. Good evening, Mr. Vice president.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Good evening.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: As Anderson said, I served over ten years in the United States military and two combat tours in Iraq, and after that service, I was forced to make one of the most difficult decisions I've ever been forced to make, and that was to choose between serving my country and my true identity as a transgender woman. This was indeed one of the most difficult decisions I've ever made. If you are elected, what will you do to support the estimated 15,000 troops putting their lives on the line every day to protect us?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: If I were president, you would not have to choose. Not a joke. You would not have to choose. The fact of the matter is that we're in a position where transgender men and women are in a position where they should be able to do anything anybody else in the world can do. There should be no difference. I mean it sincerely.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nYou know, you know my friend Sarah McBride. Sarah worked for my son as attorney general of the state of Delaware. When Sarah decided it with us time for her to come forward, and she came out. My son, being raised in the same family I was with my dad and the rest, my son immediately moved to make sure the barriers for transgendered people in Delaware were eliminated, because that's who we are. There is not a single solitary thing -- and we should be doing everything from making sure they don't deal with Title IX and cut Planned Parenthood back and can't have access. We should be -- there are so many things we did in our administration that increased the prospect of you being able to get every single solitary service anyone could get, including under the ACA covered by insurance, making sure you have to be, and making sure any surgery that was required would be viewed as necessary. And so we -- the whole thing has to change. I mean, it really does.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE) And by the way, thank you for your tour. My son served a year in Iraq. You served two combat tours, and by the way, guess what? You know why we're going to win this? We're going to win this fight? It's (ph) because there are a lot of women like you who are in the Congress now for combat pilots, for combat people, who are changing it. It will happen, I promise you.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Let me ask you -- as a senator in the '90s, I know you had reservations about Don't Ask, Don't Tell. But you ultimately voted for a larger defense spending bill that included Don't Ask, Don't Tell. as vice president, you obviously supported the repeal of the law. Do you regret helping get it passed in the first place?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Well, look, I voted against it as part of the bill. OK? And it was introduced by a guy who was trying to do something good. Introduced by a gay man in the United States senate, Barney Frank. And he was trying to figure out how to at least get by the issue of not having to do something and be automatically excluded. I didn't think it was a good idea, so I voted no. But then it became part of an entire defense appropriation bill that was a gigantic bill, and I voted for the bill. That's the kind of things that everybody had. For example, everybody talked -- well, anyway. I voted for the bill.\n\n\n\nBut when I got a chance, as vice president of the United States along with the president, who by the way was the head of everybody when he said -- I'll never forget. He asked me -- he brought in the joint chiefs and he said -- I said why don't you insist that they in fact change the policy today? And he said then it won't last, we've got to convince them it makes sense. And he was right. You usually impetuous me, I wanted to change the policy then and there by executive order. But you though what he did? He in fact said let them study it. And guess what? When the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff came out strongly, strongly in favor of eliminating Don't Ask, Don't Tell, and allowing anyone to be in the military regardless of their sexual orientation or preference, the fact of the matter, it nailed it down. Even Trump hasn't tried to do away with that piece yet.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: I want you to meet -- this is Lane Amadan (ph), a television producer.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Uh-oh.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Hello. With the extremely high prices with the extremely high prices of prep and other drugs that help prevent the transmission of HIV, what is your plan to make it more accessible, particularly to those in the most vulnerable communities and those without health insurance?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Under the Affordable Care Act, which I still think is a way for us to go, I build on that by providing the public option if I'm president of the United States. There is a provision we had that by 2021, it will be available to anyone who is, has insurance, and all will be eligible for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. It will be available in and the insurance companies must pay for it. Must pay for it. Because, look, folks, this is crazy, think about it. Why in god's name even if you're homophobic, why in god's name would you not want the elimination and/or the reduction of the significant change in AIDS?\n\n\n\nIt makes no sense. It makes no sense even for the homophobic guy out there or woman. No, I mean, think about it in just sort of rational terms. Why would you not want to see, why would you not want to see the reduction, elimination or change in AIDS? And so I would make sure that it is -- and secondly, it is important that -- excuse me, I thought he was -- under the Affordable Care Act, it will be made available and the insurance companies will have to cover it in my proposal. If you want more detail, I can go into more detail.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: We're going get another guest. Zack Zikowski (ph) out here in a minute. Before we do, I just want to ask, the Supreme Court heard arguments as you know about whether the Civil Rights Act protects LGBTQ workers from being fired over their sexual orientation or gender identity. Are there specific protections your administration would put in place to make sure that LGBTQ citizens are protected in from workplace discrimination?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: If the Supreme Court ruled that they're not protected?\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Yes.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Yes, we would pass the Equality Act right off the bat, number one. Because guess what? What's going to happen, again, most people don't know. Most people think you are covered. The average person thinks you're covered, that it is, you can't discriminate like this. And so if the Supreme Court goes ahead and rules, which a lot of us fear they may, and says it is not covered by the Civil Rights Act, which I believe as a constitutional -- I taught constitutional law for 21 years in law cool as a constitutional professor, I believe it clearly is covered, clearly is covered. But in the event that they rule otherwise, then we have a platform which to say, look what they just did, look what's happening now, point out the downside and all the pain that comes from it not being covered and say, now we're going to pass the Equality Act. We should do it anyway, but that would be the jump -- I hope we don't get there, but I believe that's the way we would proceed.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: I want you to meet Zack Zikowski (ph), an entertainment television producer and a violinist with the Santa Monica Symphony. Zack (ph)?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Zack (ph), I have no talent.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: I recently visited a country where homosexuality is illegal and could result in the death penalty. What is your stance on LGBTQ rights when it comes to our relationships with other countries that may have very different cultural beliefs? Should we be actively promoting acceptance of LGBTQ people across the globe? And should we continue to provide aid and trade with countries that persecute gay people?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Yes and no.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nAnd let me explain what I mean by that. If you notice, in some of your varying form, I've been the most outspoken critic, starting with Chechnya and every single country who has passed laws that relate to whether or not you, in fact -- it's a crime, you can be stoned to death, you can be punished, et cetera, et cetera, if you are gay, number one.\n\n\n\nNumber two, in my State Department, not a joke, we will have a special office that's devoted directly to promoting LGBTQ rights around the world. Around the world.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nNow, two other things. Interesting phenomenon. I know I heard a question about -- asked about the Catholic schools and Catholicism. Guess the first nation in the world to change their constitution to allow gay marriage? Ireland. Ireland, OK? Number one.\n\n\n\nNumber two, look what's happened as well in India. I was in India promoting a proposal when I was vice president that I had to have universal women's -- the Violence Against Women Act made a condition upon which aid goes to other countries, deny aid if they don't provide it. And at the time -- I'm not saying I'm the reason why India changed, but my vocal opposition and our vocal opposition to the way they in fact dealt with LGBTQ populations was, in fact, part of the reason I think they changed.\n\n\n\nLastly, I would, in fact, curtail aid, curtail foreign assistance to countries who, in fact, engage in -- engage in this kind of behavior, just like I would if I were dealing with China and what they're doing to the Uighurs, a million Uighurs out -- you know, Muslims. So what's the difference?\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nIt is pure, unadulterated prejudice.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: So a country like Saudi Arabia?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Saudi Arabia, same thing. By the way, they have very little social redeeming value. No, I've been blunt about it. I've been very, very blunt about it. Very blunt about it. I know they are supposedly our ally and all the rest. And I'm -- look, there are certain things that we cannot tolerate. We cannot be part of propping up governments who abuse in any fundamental -- culture is never a rationale for pain. Never a rationale for prejudice. It really isn't.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCOOPER: I want you to meet -- this is Christopher Hucks-Ortiz who leads the social services division for Dignity Health at St. Mary Medical Center right here in Los Angeles. Christopher, welcome. BIDEN: Looks like you just stepped out of Gentleman's Quarterly here.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I tried.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nMy question for you this evening, sir, is that it has been said that when white America gets a cold, black America gets pneumonia. Health disparities across this country have resulted in higher rates of HIV acquisition among black people than any other group. What would you do as president to help change this narrative, especially in the South, where 50 percent of all new diagnoses occur?\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBIDEN: A number of things. But let's start off right off the bat. First of all, we have to make sure that there is no ability for hospitals and/or any health care provider to discriminate based upon whether or not you have HIV or whether or not you are gay or lesbian or transgender. You -- that is a violation of the law. That should not be allowed under any circumstances, number one.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nNo, for real. And my Justice Department would move to prosecute those folks who did that, number one.\n\n\n\nNumber two, it's really important that we, in fact, begin to educate people about what's going on. Because, for example, when I came out and -- I came out -- when I publicly stated...\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nCOOPER: That would be news, if you...\n\n\n\nBIDEN: I got something to tell you.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: I kind of figured it out a while ago.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nBIDEN: OK. Don't jump, folks. You're way up there. When I -- when all the talk about how I'd stepped across the line saying that I support gay marriage and I thought it was constitutionally eligible, and so on and so forth, there was a lot of talk about how I -- among some, not the president, some in our administration, I may cost the election and all that kind of stuff.\n\n\n\nAnd I made a bet. I won't mention the individuals, but people you know in the administration, and I said I'll make you a bet. I'll make you a bet, like almost everything, the American public's way ahead of us, that well over half the American public supports gay marriage already.\n\n\n\nThat week, a poll was taken, the first one I'd seen, showing that -- I think it was 57 percent of all Americans supported gay marriage. The generic point I'm making here is, folks, the vast majority of people in America are not homophobic. They're just afraid. They don't understand. They don't know. They don't know what to do or say.\n\n\n\nLet me give you one closing example. Let's say that -- I see my guest I'm supposed to be -- and, by the way, a guy who knows more about this than everybody, Pete is about to come up here and talk about it, because -- by the way, imagine. I mean, I -- when I sit and think about it, what about my sons, my daughter, my granddaughters, my grandson? What happens if they are at age 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and they know there's something different about themselves and they have to come out? What do they say if they're not going to be accepted? What happens?\n\n\n\nThink about Los Angeles here. If you had a business lunch 8, 10 years ago, and there were six or seven people at the lunch, and a gay waiter came up and said something that identified himself being gay, in fact, if one of the people made fun of that waiter, the vast majority of people wouldn't have said anything at the table. Today you'd all look at him and say, if you're straight as can be, look at him and say, what the hell is the matter with you? And he'd never be invited back.\n\n\n\nThe point is, they're not afraid now to stand up and say -- because guess what? We learn. Our brothers, our sisters, our -- the girl we went out with in high school, the guy you know -- no, I'm serious. Think about it. The idea it's normal. It's normalized. It's not anything strange. It's not strange. That's the generic point.\n\n\n\nAnd the more people know that, the more they understand it -- remember, Anderson, back 15, 20 years ago, we talked about this in -- in San Francisco was all about, well, you know, gay -- gay bath houses. And everybody -- it's all about around-the-clock sex. It's all -- come on, man. Gay couples are more likely to say together longer than heterosexual couples.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCOOPER: We're going to leave it there, Mr. Vice President.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Thank you.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Great. We'll be right back with Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Thank you all very much.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: And then Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris.\n\n\n\n[20:30:00]

He was 95.\n\nThe veteran died early Sunday in Newport, Rhode Island, just two days before his 96th birthday, daughter Sharon Molleur told CNN. He will be buried at St. Columba Cemetery in his hometown of Middletown, Rhode Island, she said.\n\nWhen I look at that photograph, I just think of my dad's service, and how happy he was that it was all over, Molleur said.\n\nPHOTO: Victor Jorgensen/U.S. Navy/AP On August 14, 1945, a sailor kisses an unsuspecting woman in New York's Times Square.\n\nThough Mendonsa never persuaded Life magazine, which first published Alfred Eisenstaedt's photo, that he was the man in the picture, several sources over the years – including the authors of The Kissing Sailor: The Mystery Behind the Photo that Ended World War II – have concluded the smooching seaman is Mendonsa. The authors cited facial recognition technology and high-tech forensic reconstructions.\n\nIn a 2015 interview, Mendonsa told CNN that he never failed to convince anyone of the fact.\n\nAnd when I get through showing you the photos … if you don't admit that, I'd say you're a phony bastard, he told a reporter who visited his Middletown home.\n\n'We're all drinking and raising hell'\n\nThe picture, which has sparked numerous homages as well as admonitions from those who say it represents an unwanted sexual advance, was truly a product of its time.\n\nIt was taken August 14, 1945, shortly after news of Japan's surrender – aka Victory Over Japan Day or V-J Day – spread through New York's streets, a prelude to World War II's imminent end. Even the caption Life placed under the photo, known alternatively as V-J Day in Times Square, speaks to the sexism tolerated in newsrooms during the era.\n\nPHOTO: Mario Tama/Getty Images Carl Muscarello and Edith Shain, who also claimed to be in the photo, re-created their moment in 2005.\n\nIn the middle of New York's Times Square a white-clad girl clutches her purse and skirt as an uninhibited sailor plants his lips squarely on hers, the caption says, describing the 21-year-old woman who, decades later, would be identified as Greta Friedman.\n\nMendonsa was on leave after a stint in the Pacific, he told CNN in 2015, and was on a first date with Rita Petry, who was related to his younger sister's new husband.\n\nWhile taking in a matinee, a crowd outside Radio City Music Hall began pounding on the theater doors, shouting, The war is over! – a cry that resonated through the building.\n\nMendonsa and Petry walked outside to find thousands of revelers in the streets. They stopped at a bar.\n\nThe booze was flying, and I popped quite a few, he recalled. We're all drinking and raising hell.\n\nAfter leaving the bar, they found themselves in Times Square.\n\nSo we get into Times Square and the war ends and I see the nurse, he remembers. I had a few drinks, and it was just plain instinct, I guess.

As Petry, with whom he would spend more than 70 years in marriage, looked on, Mendonsa planted one on the woman in white.\n\nI was in the background, grinning like a mutt, Petry told CNN in a 2005 interview. It didn't matter to me.\n\n'It wasn't that much of a kiss'\n\nMendonsa, 22 at the time, said he was overwhelmed with emotion upon hearing news of Japan's surrender – For Chrissake, the war is over! he remembered thinking – and he grabbed Friedman, who he mistook for a nurse, because he'd seen the nurses in action during the war and was appreciative of their work to save and heal his fellow troops.\n\nIt's a sentiment his daughter recalls hearing from her father.\n\nThey ran out of the theater and began celebrating. Everyone was kissing everyone, Molleur said Monday. He was so thankful for all the nurses that had helped all the wounded soldiers.\n\n02:42 - Source: CNN 70 years later, the 'Kissing Sailor' tells all\n\nFriedman never saw the photo until the 1960s, and she recognized her hair, clothing and figure, she told the Veterans History Project in 2005.\n\nSuddenly, I was grabbed by a sailor, she recalled.

Kelly/The Daily Progress via AP)\n\nStory highlights The lawsuit seeks an injunction barring these white nationalist groups from staging future rallies in the city It was filed in federal district court in Virginia Wednesday night\n\n(CNN) —\n\nNearly a dozen people are suing white supremacists who were protesting in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the summer, alleging emotional and physical trauma from the protesters' threats and violence.\n\nIn the first lawsuit stemming from the protests that left one woman dead and dozens injured, the 11 plaintiffs – some of whom are unnamed, citing their own security concerns – claim they were injured, harassed, intimidated and assaulted by the white supremacist groups in the city.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in federal district court in Virginia Wednesday night.\n\nTwenty-five individuals and groups have been named as defendants for allegedly terrorizing the residents of the city, including alleged white nationalist ringleaders Jason Kessler and Richard Spencer.\n\nThe lawsuit is being led by high-profile attorneys Roberta Kaplan and Karen Dunn. Kaplan successfully argued for Edith Windsor in the landmark Supreme Court case striking down the Defense of Marriage Act, granting same-sex married couples federal recognition for the first time. Dunn is a former assistant US Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nTheir lives were ruptured in this horribly dramatic and gruesome way, Kaplan said. As of now, very few of them are able to return to tranquility and safety that many of us have taken for granted. It hasn't stopped, so part of the goal of the lawsuit is to stop it. We're hoping to give them back their peace.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks an injunction barring these white nationalist groups from staging future rallies in Charlottesville, as well as damages for the plaintiffs' personal injuries.\n\nThis wasn't an isolated incident that happened one weekend, Dunn said. The people responsible said they'd be back and they've already returned.\n\nSpencer was back in the city Saturday night, leading a tiki-torch- lit rally at Emancipation Park for several dozen followers. The visit didn't result in any violence, but he pledged to return again. The intimidation isn't confined to the city's public spaces: all schools in Charlottesville were on modified lockdown Wednesday after the FBI discovered chatter on social media warning that the city's public schools could be the next target after referencing the recent attack in Las Vegas.\n\nThe lawsuit relies partly on federal civil rights claims as well as a Virginia law that creates a civil cause of action for anyone subject to acts of intimidation or violence if motivated by racial, religious, or ethnic animosity.\n\nIt's unfortunate that statutes that were passed to deal with the rise of the KKK, and burning crosses and lynchings in the south, are being used again in 2017 for people with torches trying to torture and intimidate black people and Jews and other minorities, Kaplan said.\n\nCity officials have previously lamented that they don't have much power to stop these rallies, citing free speech. After Spencer's tiki-torch display on Saturday, however, Charlottesville Mayor Mike Singer wrote on Twitter: You're not welcome here! Go home! Meantime we're looking at all our legal options.

Transcript: Bush, Kerry debate domestic policies\n\n\n\n\n\nTEMPE, Arizona (CNN) -- The following is a running transcript of the final debate between President George W. Bush and Sen. John Kerry held Wednesday night at Arizona State University.\n\nCBS News anchor Bob Schieffer moderated the debate that focused on domestic policy.\n\nAll answers are linked to the questions in the box to the right.\n\nQuestion 1: Will our children be as safe as we were?\n\nSCHIEFFER: Gentleman, welcome to you both.\n\nBy coin toss, the first question goes to Sen. Kerry.\n\nSenator, I want to set the stage for this discussion by asking the question that I think hangs over all of our politics today and is probably on the minds of many people watching this debate tonight.\n\nAnd that is, will our children and grandchildren ever live in a world as safe and secure as the world in which we grew up?\n\nKERRY: Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight.\n\nThank you, Arizona State, for welcoming us.\n\nAnd thank you to the Presidential Commission for undertaking this enormous task. We're proud to be here.\n\nMr. President, I'm glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people.\n\nWill we ever be safe and secure again? Yes. We absolutely must be. That's the goal.\n\nNow, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it.\n\nI believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away. And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be.\n\nThe measurement is not: Are we safer? The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be? And there are a host of options that this president had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America containers are inspected. Only 95 percent of them -- 95 percent come in today uninspected. That's not good enough.\n\nPeople who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is. That's not good enough. Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them. Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program.\n\nSo we can do a better job of homeland security. I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists.\n\nI will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them. We'll do whatever is necessary to be safe.\n\nBut I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President, you have 90 seconds.\n\nBUSH: Thank you very much.\n\nI want to thank Arizona State as well.\n\nYes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world.\n\nI have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the al Qaeda, wherever it exists -- and we're making progress; three-quarters of al Qaeda leaders have been brought to justice -- but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account.\n\nAs a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend. And the first voter was a 19-year-old woman. Think about that. Freedom is on the march.\n\nWe held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan.\n\nMy opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling.\n\nI think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous. I don't think you can secure America for the long run if you don't have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people.\n\nAt home, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland. I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources. My opponent voted against it.\n\nWe're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports.\n\nBut absolutely we can be secure in the long run. It just takes good, strong leadership.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Anything to add, Senator Kerry?\n\nKERRY: Yes. When the president had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he took his focus off of them, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Osama bin Laden escaped.\n\nSix months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, Where is Osama bin Laden?\n\nHe said, I don't know. I don't really think about him very much. I'm not that concerned.\n\nWe need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President?\n\nBUSH: Gosh, I just don't think I ever said I'm not worried about Osama bin Laden. It's kind of one of those exaggerations.\n\nOf course we're worried about Osama bin Laden. We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden. We're using every asset at our disposal to get Osama bin Laden.\n\nMy opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement. No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nQuestion 2: How did the U.S. end up with a flu vaccine shortage?\n\nSCHIEFFER: New question, Mr. President, to you.\n\nWe are talking about protecting ourselves from the unexpected, but the flu season is suddenly upon us. Flu kills thousands of people every year.\n\nSuddenly we find ourselves with a severe shortage of flu vaccine. How did that happen?\n\nBUSH: Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated. And so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country.\n\nWe're working with Canada to hopefully -- that they'll produce a -- help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season.\n\nMy call to our fellow Americans is if you're healthy, if you're younger, don't get a flu shot this year. Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young.\n\nThe CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly.\n\nI haven't gotten a flu shot, and I don't intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated.\n\nWe have a problem with litigation in the United States of America. Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine.\n\nOne of the reasons I'm such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren't afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law.\n\nBut the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Sen. Kerry?\n\nKERRY: This really underscores the problem with the American health-care system. It's not working for the American family. And it's gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years.\n\nFive million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country. You've got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all. 82,000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bush's watch. 223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all.\n\nAll across our country -- go to Ohio, 1.4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000, Wisconsites lost it under President Bush.\n\nThis president has turned his back on the wellness of America. And there is no system. In fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover Americans.\n\nChildren across our country don't have health care. We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it.\n\nI have a plan to cover all Americans. We're going to make it affordable and accessible. We're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President, would you like to add something?\n\nBUSH: I would. Thank you.\n\nI want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you can't pay for.\n\nHe just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get. That costs the government $7,700 per family. If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, [it] would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years.\n\nIt's an empty promise. It's called bait and switch.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Time's up.\n\nBUSH: Thank you.\n\nKERRY: Actually, it's not an empty promise.\n\nIt's really interesting, because the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan. He said, if it's good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice.\n\nWhat we do is we have choice. I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Other senators, other congressmen choose other programs.\n\nBut the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it. Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves. We're not giving this away for nothing.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nQuestion 3: With rising costs, how do you keep from raising taxes?\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\n\nSen. Kerry, a new question. Let's talk about economic security. You pledged during the last debate that you would not raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of everything is going up, and we all know it. Health care costs, as you all talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war.\n\nMy question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children?\n\nKERRY: I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go.\n\nDuring the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules. If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how.\n\nPresident Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this.\n\nHe's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1.6 million jobs lost. He's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today.\n\nNow, I'm going to reverse that. I'm going to change that. We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.\n\nEvery plan that I have laid out -- my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans -- I've shown exactly how I'm going to pay for those.\n\nAnd we start -- we don't do it exclusively -- but we start by rolling back George Bush's unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get.\n\nWe shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job.\n\nThey just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China.\n\nI'm going to stand up and fight for the American worker. And I am going to do it in a way that's fiscally sound. I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education.\n\nI have a manufacturing jobs credit. We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas. We raise the student loans. I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks.\n\nThis president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President?\n\nBUSH: Well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record.\n\n[He's] been a senator for 20 years. He voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times.\n\nHe talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4.2 trillion.\n\nHe talks about PAY-GO. I'll tell you what PAY-GO means, when you're a senator from Massachusetts, when you're a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends.\n\nHe's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.\n\nThere is a tax gap. And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap? The middle class.\n\nI propose a detailed budget, Bob. I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years. It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nQuestion 4: What do you say to someone who lost his job?\n\nSCHIEFFER: Let's go to a new question, Mr. President. Two minutes. And let's continue on jobs.\n\nYou know, there are all kind of statistics out there, but I want to bring it down to an individual.\n\nMr. President, what do you say to someone in this country who has lost his job to someone overseas who's being paid a fraction of what that job paid here in the United States?\n\nBUSH: I'd say, Bob, I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century. And here's some help for you to go get an education. Here's some help for you to go to a community college.\n\nWe've expanded trade adjustment assistance. We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.\n\nYou know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing. We talk about fiscal matters. But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works.\n\nI went to Washington to solve problems. And I saw a problem in the public education system in America.\n\nThey were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics.\n\nAnd so we said: Let's raise the standards. We're spending more money, but let's raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it's too late.\n\nNo, education is how to help the person who's lost a job. Education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive.\n\nGot four more years, I've got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma.\n\nAnd so the person you talked to, I say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.\n\nAnd that's what I would say to that person.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Sen. Kerry?\n\nKERRY: I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally.\n\nLet me come back in one moment to that, but I want to speak for a second, if I can, to what the president said about fiscal responsibility.\n\nBeing lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nThis president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see. Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year.\n\nBut guess what, America? The wages of Americans have gone down. The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we're losing.\n\nAnd the president just walks on by this problem. The fact is that he's cut job-training money. $1 billion was cut. They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year.\n\nThey've cut the Pell Grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college.\n\nThey've cut the training money. They've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed.\n\nI'm going to do those things, because that's what's right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect.\n\nQuestion 5: Is Bush entirely to blame for loss of jobs?\n\nSCHIEFFER: New question to you, Sen. Kerry, two minutes. And it's still on jobs.\n\nYou know, many experts say that a president really doesn't have much control over jobs. For example, if someone invents a machine that does the work of five people, that's progress. That's not the president's fault.\n\nSo I ask you, is it fair to blame the administration entirely for this loss of jobs?\n\nKERRY: I don't blame them entirely for it. I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it.\n\nOutsourcing is going to happen.\n\nI've acknowledged that in union halls across the country. I've had shop stewards stand up and say, Will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing?\n\nAnd I've looked them in the eye and I've said, No, I can't do that.\n\nWhat I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job.\n\nToday, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas. You get to defer your taxes.\n\nSo if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America.\n\nThat's not smart.\n\nI don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job.\n\nAnd when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent. And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.\n\nThe second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field. This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies. He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I'd been talking about it for months.\n\nThe fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation. There are companies that wanted to petition the administration. They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.\n\nThe fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven't stood up and fought for.\n\nI'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker. And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job. That's what the American worker wants. And if we do that, we can have an impact.\n\nPlus, we need fiscal discipline. Restore fiscal discipline, we'll do a lot better.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President?\n\nBUSH: Whew!\n\nLet me start with the Pell Grants. In his last litany of misstatements he said we cut Pell Grants. We've increased Pell Grants by a million students. That's a fact.\n\nYou know, he talks to the workers. Let me talk to the workers.\n\nYou've got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed.\n\nIf you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit. That's money in your pocket.\n\nIf you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty. The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage.\n\nWe created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans. A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief.\n\nIt's your money. The way my opponent talks, he said, We're going to spend the government's money. No, we're spending your money. And when you have more money in your pocket, you're able to better afford things you want.\n\nI believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives.\n\nMy opponent talks about fiscal sanity. His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric.\n\nHe voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Sen. Kerry?\n\nKERRY: Bob, anybody can play with these votes. Everybody knows that.\n\nI have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times. I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for. I voted for IRA tax cuts. I voted for small-business tax cuts.\n\nBut you know why the Pell Grants have gone up in their numbers? Because more people qualify for them because they don't have money.\n\nBut they're not getting the $5,100 the president promised them. They're getting less money.\n\nWe have more people who qualify. That's not what we want.\n\nBUSH: Senator, no one's playing with your votes. You voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times.\n\nHe voted to violate the budget cap 277 times. You know, there's a main stream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank. As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nQuestion 6: Do you believe homosexuality is a choice?\n\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President, let's get back to economic issues. But let's shift to some other questions here.\n\nBoth of you are opposed to gay marriage. But to understand how you have come to that conclusion, I want to ask you a more basic question.\n\nDo you believe homosexuality is a choice?\n\nBUSH: You know, Bob, I don't know. I just don't know. I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity. It's important that we do that.\n\nAnd I also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live.\n\nAnd that's to be honored.\n\nBut as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage.\n\nI believe in the sanctity of marriage. I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman.\n\nI proposed a constitutional amendment. The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution.\n\nIt has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process. After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution.\n\nI'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States. You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act.\n\nMy opponent was against it. It basically protected states from the action of one state to another. It also defined marriage as between a man and woman.\n\nBut I'm concerned that that will get overturned. And if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don't think that's in our nation's interests.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Sen. Kerry?\n\nKERRY: We're all God's children, Bob. And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as.\n\nI think if you talk to anybody, it's not choice. I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it.\n\nAnd I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them.\n\nI think we have to respect that.\n\nThe president and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. I believe that. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman.\n\nBut I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace. You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.\n\nYou can't disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital. You have to allow people to transfer property, which is why I'm for partnership rights and so forth.\n\nNow, with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the states have always been able to manage those laws. And they're proving today, every state, that they can manage them adequately.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nQuestion 7: How does Kerry handle criticism from Catholic archbishops?\n\nSCHIEFFER: Sen. Kerry, a new question for you.\n\nThe New York Times reports that some Catholic archbishops are telling their church members that it would be a sin to vote for a candidate like you because you support a woman's right to choose an abortion and unlimited stem-cell research.\n\nWhat is your reaction to that?\n\nKERRY: I respect their views. I completely respect their views. I am a Catholic. And I grew up learning how to respect those views. But I disagree with them, as do many.\n\nI believe that I can't legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith. What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith.\n\nI believe that choice is a woman's choice. It's between a woman, God and her doctor. And that's why I support that.\n\nNow, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe president has never said whether or not he would do that. But we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to.\n\nI will not. I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.\n\nNow, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic. I was an altar boy. I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.\n\nAnd as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, I'm not running to be a Catholic president. I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic.\n\nMy faith affects everything that I do, in truth. There's a great passage of the Bible that says, What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds? Faith without works is dead.\n\nAnd I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people.\n\nThat's why I fight against poverty. That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.\n\nThat's why I fight for equality and justice. All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith.\n\nBut I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own. And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President?\n\nBUSH: I think it's important to promote a culture of life. I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters.\n\nI believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.\n\nTake, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion. It's a brutal practice. People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice. It made a lot of sense. My opponent, in that he's out of the mainstream, voted against that law.\n\nWhat I'm saying is is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.\n\nThe last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs. That's great. I appreciate that very much. All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion.\n\n(Continued)

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThis week, on Martin Luther King Day, Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris announced that she will run for president in 2020. Almost immediately, headlines appeared declaring her the female Barack Obama. Like many other prominent women, she is – wrongly and inaccurately to boot – best known as a derivative of a more-famous predecessor.\n\nPHOTO: Holly Thomas Holly Thomas\n\nThere are similarities between Harris and Obama, to be sure. Both are Democrats, both have a background in law, both have a mixed-race background. There is an obvious convenience to the comparison. It neatly captures the public imagination at a time when Harris is yet to be world famous, but is charismatic, on the rise and prepared to challenge President Donald Trump, while Obama's name continues to conjure a nostalgic, anti-Trump emotion.\n\nIt makes superficial sense. But it's also symptomatic of a lazy habit that infantilizes high-profile women in America and abroad, and skims over the personal details and unique circumstances that shaped them.\n\nKamala Harris is the first Indian-American woman to have a seat in the US Senate. She was also the first woman, black, Indian-American or South Asian, to serve as district attorney of San Francisco, and as California's attorney general. The most famous instance of public sexism she faced before announcing her presidential bid occurred in 2013, when none other than Barack Obama called her the best-looking attorney general. Obama later apologized to Harris after the remark was widely criticized (rightly) as sexist.\n\nThe two are very different political beings. Obama, with some liberal moves such as reduced sentences for drug offenses aside, did not make prison reform a priority, and was against mass incarceration. But the prison system is a subject close to Harris' heart.\n\nDespite personal reservations, she promised to defend the death penalty in California as attorney general, and proved herself an often harsh prosecutor, favoring long periods of imprisonment. In other areas, Harris has positioned herself further to the left than the former President. Those only aware of her overlap with Obama might make assumptions about her attitudes elsewhere, which would turn out to be untrue.\n\nHarris is far from the only female politician to receive this media treatment – and that treatment isn't always limited to comparisons to more famous men (though admittedly that's overwhelmingly the case when it comes to world leaders).\n\nTake Theresa May. Coverage of the British Prime Minister is regularly peppered with references to Margaret Thatcher. Throughout her negotiations over the Brexit deal in Brussels, Belgium, in December, newspapers referred to May's handbag-wielding Maggie moments – Thatcher's handbag being the mythical weapon with which she would supposedly clobber her opposition.\n\nConsidering Margaret Thatcher was in favor of Europe, fought for Britain's interests within the EU, and for Britain to strengthen its position as a member of the EU, this likeness is especially ironic.\n\nTheresa May's Brexit strategy has been to make determined noises while championing a cause – leaving the EU – she campaigned and voted against, and she consistently makes zero productive headway with it. Her predecessor David Cameron's negotiation of the ultimately null EU reform deal in 2016 was far more Thatcheresque in its intention and execution (even if the referendum he called subsequently was not). Coverage of his doings, however, didn't call him Maggie – or indeed, refer to other male PMs who went before him. When he acted in his own name, he was treated as such.\n\nThe fudging of political personalities can be derogatory in both directions, depending on individual sympathies. When Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer succeeded Angela Merkel as leader of Germany's Christian Democratic Union last year, she noted the commentary describing her as a mini Merkel, or Merkel 2.0.\n\nI have read a lot about what I am and who I am, she told her party. Mini, a copy, simply 'more of the same.' Dear delegates, I stand before you as I am and as life made me, and I am proud of that.\n\nThe attention paid to Kramp-Karrenbauer's likeness to Merkel distracts from the future implications of her attitudes for the country, and indeed, Europe at large. Kramp-Karrenbauer is extremely conservative on same-sex marriage, and has likened it to incest in the past. Her stance on migration is also vastly stricter than Merkel's, and she has made it clear she is keen to dial down the more liberal attitude exhibited by the party in the last decade.\n\nWhile Merkel's political career was catalyzed by the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification, Kramp-Karrenbauer's has been forged in the wake of Merkel's. That by definition gives her an adapted frame of reference, which merits its own scrutiny.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nEvery politician – every person – is a product of their own time and place. In the coming months, it looks quite possible that Kamala Harris might win Obama's endorsement of her bid for president.\n\nIf she does, the comparisons between the two are likely to reignite. As with May and Kramp-Karrenbauer, those watching would do better to pay attention to the political landscape Harris is working within now, rather than any nostalgic connotations. The president whose footsteps are most pertinent to Harris, the president who she will be measured against should she prevail against her fellow Democratic candidates, is Donald Trump.\n\nIf she finds herself competing with him, the very least Harris deserves, the very least the voting public deserves, is to be judged as an adult in her own right, running under her own name.

Just a short time ago, the president said he's exploring all options, including issuing an executive order.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have four or five ways we can do it. It's one of the ways that we're thinking about doing it very seriously. We're doing well on the census.\n\n\n\nWe could also add an addition on. So we can start the printing now and maybe do an addendum after we get a positive decision. So we're working on a lot of things, including an executive order.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nKEILAR: This is coming as a source tells CNN the president thinks the Justice Department threw in the towel too early after the Supreme Court ruled against including this question on the census last week. The source says the president has made it clear he wants to fight. And the clock is ticking as the DOJ faces a 2:00 p.m. Eastern deadline\n\n\n\nto tell a federal judge what it plans to do. But as for now, an official tells CNN, the census will continue to be printed without that citizenship question on it.\n\n\n\nAnd now CNN's exclusive interview with vice president -- former Vice President Joe Biden. The Democratic presidential frontrunner sat down with our own Chris Cuomo and he was pressed on a range of issues, including President Trump's friendship with North Korea, the ongoing trade war with China, whether he thinks he can actually take on President Trump and, of course, that debate moment with Senator Kamala Harris. The issue of busing is where we begin.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: I was talking with you and Jill. You said you were expecting to have a target on your back.

Did you see the questions about your past positions from the perspective of race being as relevant as they are?\n\n\n\nJOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No. And I don't think they're relevant because they're taken out of context.\n\n\n\nWhat I didn't see is people who know me. I mean they know me well. It's not like it's somebody who just came out of the blue and didn't know anything. But it's so easy to go back and go back 30, 40, 50 years and take a context and take it completely out of context.\n\n\n\nAnd, I mean, you know, I -- I get all this information about other people's past and what they've done and not done. And, you know, I'm just not going to go there. If we keep doing that, that's -- I mean we should be debating what we do from here.\n\n\n\nFor example, this whole thing about race and busing. Well, you know, I think if you take a look, our positions aren't any different as we're finding out.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: With Senator Harris --\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Yes.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Who said she sees it as a tool, not a must in all circumstances.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Yes. Well, look at my record and --\n\n\n\nCUOMO: I don't think busing is about policy, Mr. Vice President.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: No, it's not.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: I think it was about principle. When you look back at your record on it, you were not in favor of busing. It was a different time. There were different applications. Why not just own it and say --\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Well, by the way, here's the thing, Chris, no -- CUOMO: I was against it but now I've changed.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: I was -- I was in favor of busing that was dejure busing. That is, if a court ruled that there was a law passed or circumstance that a county, a city, a state did that prevented black folks from being somewhere, then that's wrong, you should bus. I even went so far in the middle of that busing controversy with saying I'd use helicopters if that was necessary to make the point. And we really got, you know, town meeting that was -- got very hot. But what the issue is now is, for example, and it was then, voluntary busing. We supported it. We supported it then. And, by the way, Barack and I, as president and vice president, we provided money for voluntary busing if cities wanted to do it.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: I'm not questioning any of that.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: No, no --\n\n\n\nCUOMO: I'm saying that when you look back in the '70s, you said, I think busing doesn't work. It's an asinine concept.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Well, by the way --\n\n\n\nCUOMO: You tried to pass bills that weren't for it.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Busing did not work. You had overwhelming response from the African-American community in my state. My state is the eighth largest black population in the country as a percent of population. They weren't -- they did not support it. They did not support it.\n\n\n\nLook, the question is, how do you equalize education in every area? And I put forward the most -- the most aggressive plan to do that and I've been pushing it for a long time. For example, in, you know, Title I schools, schools that are disadvantaged, we should -- I proposed we go from $15 billion a year to $45 billion a year. We should bring people in and have preschool from three, four, five years old, before kindergarten. We should have -- look, every child out there, every child out there is capable, but they live in circumstances that make it difficult. From the time they get to school they've heard three, four million fewer words spoken. They're at a disadvantage.\n\n\n\n[13:05:04] CUOMO: I totally accept all of that.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Well, I -- well, that's number one. But, number two, the idea right now, 65 out of 100 jobs in a study I did for the president point out you need something beyond a high school degree.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: That's true.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: So what are we doing? We're sitting around here as if it's an insoluble problem.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: I'm -- I get it on the policy. I never have viewed the busing back and forth in that debate as about policy or application of how to affect civil rights. It's about consistency and proving if you'll be better than what we're dealing with now in the White House, which is people won't tell the truth about things. If busing didn't work, then it made sense that you weren't for it back then.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: But I --\n\n\n\nCUOMO: But why say you were for it?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Well, no --\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Why not just be straight about it and move on?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: OK, because there's three different pieces. I was for voluntary busing. Number one. I was for busing where the courts showed that, in fact, a legislative body took an action preventing black folks from going to a school. That is dejure -- I know you know, dejure segregation. The difficult piece is, this is 50 years ago, people don't understand the context.\n\n\n\nThe third one is, do you have an administration, through their non- elected officials, the Department of Housing, decide every school should be equally balanced across the board? That's a different issue. And the way to deal with that problem is what I did from the time I was a kid. I got out of -- I got out of law school, came back, had a great job, became a public defender. I fought for putting housing and -- low-income housing in suburbia. I talked about eliminating red line and I talked about school districts should be consolidated in ways that made sense so, in fact --\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Why didn't you fight it like this in the debate?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Be -- in 30 seconds?\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Hey --\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Come on, man.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: What happens most in a debate, Mr. Vice President? People blow their time cue.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Well --\n\n\n\nCUOMO: You're the only person I've ever seen on a debate stage say I'm out of time.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Well, we've never had a place where you have 30 seconds, man. What I didn't want to do is get in that scrum. Do you think the American public looked at that debate, take me out of it, and thought, boy, I really -- I really like the way that's being conducted. They're really showing themselves to do really well. Come on, man.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: But they -- they're going come after you.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Sure they're going come after me.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Were you prepared for them to come after you?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: I was prepared for them to come after me, but I wasn't prepared for the person coming at me the way she came at -- she knew Beau. She knows me. I don't -- well, anyway, I -- but here's the deal, what I do know, and this is the good and the bad news. The American people think they know me and they know me. Since that occurred, I had the most sought after endorsement for the mayor of Atlanta, a black woman, who's a great leader, Mayor Bottoms, endorse me. I've had numerous members of the Black Caucus endorse me. I've --\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Are you worried about the poll slippage with African-Americans after the debate?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: No, no, these -- these folks just came. I'm making the point to you, I don't see it. People know who I am. I don't believe there's anybody out there that believes that I have anything other than a keen and consistent interest in making sure every child has -- these are all our children.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Here's the tough -- here's the question, did you re-watch the debate?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: No, I didn't.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Why not?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Well, I didn't have an opportunity to re-watch it. And, besides, you know, my measure is how people react outside, getting on a train, getting on a plane, walking through an airport, walking in a parade, just going to the grocery store. I got no sense, I really mean it, no sense.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Here's the tough question for Democrats. They need a warrior, OK, because not too aggrandize, not to lionize, but this president knows how to fight in the ring one on one. Kamala Harris is friendly fire. Cory Booker is friendly fire. How can Democrats have confidence that you can take on the biggest and the baddest when you're having trouble sparring in party?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: I don't think I'm having trouble sparring. It's how you want to spar. Look, I'm the guy at the time everybody talks about things that are changed. I took on same-sex marriage. I took on a whole range of issues. I took on arms control. I took on dealing with Russia with the -- with the arms control agreement. I took on Putin in terms of Iraq -- I mean, excuse me, in terms of what was going on in Ukraine. I've taken on these leaders around the world. I'm the guy that's gone in and met -- I've taken on all these leaders. I -- I mean I -- this is ironic. I've never been accused of being -- not being able to spar. I've been accused of being too aggressive.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: But the game has changed.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Well --\n\n\n\nCUOMO: And you think that what's happening with Harris is anything compared to what would happened with you and this president?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: No, but everybody knows who this guy is. Come on, man. Come on.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: How do you beat him? BIDEN: I beat him by just pointing out who I am and who he is and what\n\n\n\nwe're for and what he's against. This guy is a divider in chief. This guy is acting with racist policies. This guy is moving to foment hate, to split. That's the only way he can sustain himself.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Nothing about him worries you?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Oh, yes, well, sure, it worries me in the sense that I'm looking forward to this, man. You walk behind me in a debate, come here, man. Don't you think I -- you know me too well. I mean I -- the idea that I'd be intimidated by Donald Trump? He's the bully that I knew my whole life. He's the bully that I've always stood up to. He's the bully that used to make fun when I was a kid and stutter and I'd smacked him in the mouth.\n\n\n\n[13:10:19] Look, this is not -- but that -- they -- I think the American people want a president who has some dignity, who has a value set, who is actually trying to restore the soul of this country so when they turn on the television they look up and their kids say, I want to be like that guy or that woman.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: There are domestic agenda items I want to tick through.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: (INAUDIBLE).\n\n\n\nCUOMO: But you have made a big point of saying the threat here with the current administration is abroad.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: (INAUDIBLE).\n\n\n\nCUOMO: What exactly bothers you abroad?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: What bothers me abroad is, look, the idea that we can go it alone with no alliances for the next 20 or 30 years is a disaster. How are we going to deal with stateless terrorism without doing what I've been able to do with the president, put together coalitions of 50, 60 nations to take it on? I come out of a generation where we were trying to be the policemen of the world. We can't go in every place. We need allies. He is absolutely dissing them. He's embracing thugs. He's embracing Kim Jong-un, who is a thug. He's embracing Putin, who is a -- who is a flat dictator. He's embracing people who, in fact -- and he's stiff-arming our friends. He's threatening NATO, to pull out of NATO. I mean, come on.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: He says he's gotten NATO to give in more money for their defense because of his tactics.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Oh, give me a break. Oh, come on, man. And, by the way, the idea that NATO think -- let me put it this way. If he wins re- election, I promise you, there will be no NATO in four years or five years.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: You think there will be no more NATO if he's re-elected.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: No more NATO. Look, I went to the -- the conference in -- that we have. It's called the Vercunda Conference (ph). It used to be. The first speech stood up, the chancellor, the former chancellor of Germany stands up. She says, we have to go it alone. We can't count on the United States.\n\n\n\nWhy did we set up NATO, Chris? So no one nation could abuse the power in the region in Europe that would suck us in, in the way they did in World War I and World War II. It's being crushed.\n\n\n\nLook at what's happening with Putin. While he -- while Putin is trying to undo our elections, he is undoing elections in -- in Europe. Look what's happened in Hungary. Look what's happened in Poland. Look what's happened in (INAUDIBLE). Look what's happening. You think that would happen on my watch or Barack's watch? You can't answer that, but I promise you it wouldn't have. And it didn't.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: So with North Korea, the idea of reaching out, President Obama, Vice President Biden wanted to do more than that. The Republicans used to whack you on the head. You can't be nice to people who are our enemies. Hadn't this president done what you wanted to do by reaching out to Kim?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: He did the exact opposite. He gave Kim everything that he wanted, legitimacy. He gave Kim -- he ended our relationship, as a practical matter with South Korea and Japan as a united front and let China off the hook. He put us in a position where we say, by the way, I love the man. I know what he's doing. He hasn't done a thing. He hasn't done a thing, Kim Jong-un. And what have we done? We've suspended exercises.\n\n\n\nLook, I come out of the arms control era. Guess what, there's two ways you do this, you work or you defend and you say, hey, man, don't screw with us. You move, this is what's going to happen. This is going to happen.\n\n\n\nBut, in the meantime, what you do is you deal with your allies and also those who don't -- aren't with you. Do you think China wants any part of North Korea becoming a nuclear power?\n\n\n\nCUOMO: So what do you do differently with North Korea and China?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: With regard to North Korea -- with China, I make it clear that we're going to move our defenses up, as we did before, and we're going to make sure we have the capacity to deal with it near term. I'm going to let South Korea and Japan know we're there for them. We are their nuclear umbrella. We're there for them. And China, understand, if you don't want us in your throat here, if you don't want us in your face, do something.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Do you stop the trade battle with China? Do you go back to TPP?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: By the way, the idea that this trade battle makes any sense, is benefitting anybody, is absolutely ludicrous. And just ask the farmers here or around the world. Their -- I mean around the United States and the manufacturers. It's killing us.\n\n\n\nWhat we should do is we deal with China -- I had a conversation with Xi before I -- Xi Jinping before I left. And he said, well, you know, remember they set up their no-fly zone and -- I said, we're not going to pay attention to it. He said, what do you want me to do, just withdraw it? And I said, no, but just understand, we're just going to fly through. We flew a B-52 through it. We are a Pacific power. We're not going anywhere, understand. And that's the reason why you have security is because we've allowed stability in the region. They get it. But what they're doing now is we're not dealing with China's problem for (ph) us. China's problem is they're stealing intellectual secrets.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Yes.\n\n\n\n[13:15:01] BIDEN: Their cyber security. Deal the same way. You say you've got to invest here in the United States and you want to be able to invest here, and we're -- and you say we want to invest in China but you've got to have a 51 percent owner? No deal, man. Deal for a deal. (INAUDIBLE).\n\n\n\nCUOMO: This administration is fighting that same fight, isn't it?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: But they're not. No. They're fighting in trade. Trump thinks it's about trade deficits and trade surpluses. It's not about that.\n\n\n\nLook, while he's like tweeting, China is going to own the 5G market. While in fact he -- they're spending billions on artificial intelligence. What are we doing? They're doing a whole lot of things that make no sense for us to stand still.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: What would you do differently with North Korea? Would you slam the door on them again?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: With North -- yes, I'd make it real clear. Look, you want to talk, you want to deal with us, you want sanctions lifted, show me something ahead of time. Show me.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: They haven't tested a bad missile.\n\n\n\nBIDEN: They haven't tested -- and the reason why they haven't tested is they have it all done. They're sitting there with missiles that are -- have capacity and nuclear capacity right now. So they're not giving up anything.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nKEILAR: President Trump responding to that, responding to Chris' interview with former Vice President Joe Biden, calling him a bully. Hear what the president has to say, next.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[13:21:03] KEILAR: Well, you just watched part one of our exclusive interview with Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\n\nWith us now, CNN's senior political analyst Ryan Lizza and New York Times reporter Astead Herndon, who is with us.\n\n\n\nSo he was defending himself on race. He was trying certainly to repair some of the damage that Kamala Harris inflicted during the debate.\n\n\n\nRYAN LIZZA, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, I found one of the most interesting moments when he was almost personally offended that Harris brought this up by mentioning her long friendship with Beau Biden. And I know -- I think Kamala Harris has actually talked about that relationship. And he didn't dwell on that for a long time, but he sort of threw it out there. You know, he didn't think she would go there, I'm paraphrasing him, because -- one reason was because she had a relationship with his deceased son, Beau.\n\n\n\nKEILAR: Is it like a -- is it a --\n\n\n\nLIZZA: And that makes this much more personal than I can remember any primary fight. I mean he's in a huge field of candidates. He's been in politics a long time. He has to know that everything he's ever said or done or voted on is fair game. And so I don't know if this is just political or if he's genuinely offended by this friendship that she and Beau had, and that's why he's surprised.\n\n\n\nBut, boy, this makes this a much more personal fight than a political fight at this point -- than a policy fight at this point.\n\n\n\nKEILAR: He seemed genuinely offended --\n\n\n\nLIZZA: He did.\n\n\n\nKEILAR: Because he cut himself off.\n\n\n\nLIZZA: He did.\n\n\n\nKEILAR: I think he realized he was actually saying very much what he felt.\n\n\n\nLIZZA: Yes.\n\n\n\nKEILAR: And then he said his -- anyway, right? That's what he --\n\n\n\nLIZZA: And I think it's --\n\n\n\nKEILAR: Anyway is sort of what he says when he's editing himself.\n\n\n\nLIZZA: And I'd be very curious to see what the Harris campaign says about that because Biden essentially is hinting here, and I'm curious to see what Astead thinks of this, is hinting here at, you know, because of that friendship, maybe this issue is off limits.\n\n\n\nKEILAR: Well, Astead, let's listen to that moment. We'll play again what Biden said about being confronted by Kamala Harris.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: They're going come after you.\n\n\n\nJOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Sure they're going come after me.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Were you prepared for them to come after you?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: I was prepared for them to come after me, but I wasn't prepared for the person coming at me the way she came at -- she knew Beau. She knows me.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nKEILAR: It's -- it's -- what did you think? I mean it seems to me that he felt attacked by his son's good friend.\n\n\n\nASTEAD HERNDON, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, I think that that was a really interesting kind of offhand comment that clearly when you say something like that, that's going to get folks' attention. That, you know, Joe Biden is someone who prizes those personal relationships and we know that Senator Harris has talked about how she respected his son.\n\n\n\nBut it should not be a surprise that people are coming after his record. I mean Senator Harris was someone who kind of prizes that legion of older black voters that Joe Biden currently has a stranglehold on and so she was using that debate moment to try to go at him directly.\n\n\n\nNow, was he surprised at the kind of personal way she did it, invoking her own story, the way the campaign came with t-shirts with her childhood photo on after, maybe that took the campaign by surprise. But certainly the issue should not be a surprise for Biden. He knew that he was going to be the target on that stage.\n\n\n\nBut I, you know, I think it's important to remember here that Senator Harris has -- has praised the vice president. She started the kind of speech on the debate by saying I respect you, but then she took it to a place that really has Joe Biden on the back foot as someone who thinks of himself as a civil rights advocate, who has been a real aid and public servant to African-American communities. So this strikes at his whole identity and the way he views his political brand.\n\n\n\nKEILAR: All right, real quickly, Ryan, did you think this interview -- a one-on-one interview is a better venue for Biden than the debate stage?\n\n\n\nLIZZA: I think clearly. Yes. Yes.\n\n\n\nKEILAR: Clearly.\n\n\n\nLIZZA: Yes. Yes.\n\n\n\nKEILAR: And, Astead, what do you think?\n\n\n\nHERNDON: One hundred percent.\n\n\n\nKEILAR: A hundred percent.\n\n\n\nOK. So, and why -- why is that? Is that just that sort of -- his ability to sort of have a one-on-one relation -- he wanted to stay above the fray it seemed like. No one likes what Kamala Harris called a food fight is what he seemed to be saying.\n\n\n\n[13:25:04] LIZZA: Well, first, he's got a good rapport with Chris that, you know, they know each other. And he's able -- look, he doesn't have nine other people sniping at him. He has a chance to answer with longer statements.\n\n\n\nI thought it was a little strange that he said, you know, he -- oh, you only get 30 seconds to respond. But, I mean, that's the nature of a debate. Everyone knows that. It's not going to be much different when he takes on Trump because, look, there's so many levels of what Harris did here. There's just the pure policy level, was he wrong to oppose federally mandated desegregation via busing back in the '70s? That's one thing. But the other thing, I think maybe even the broader issue is, is he made Biden -- she -- excuse me, she made Biden look unprepared, right? You know --\n\n\n\nKEILAR: That's right. And he said -- he even said I wasn't prepared for that, right? I think he was expecting a different kind of attack.\n\n\n\nLIZZA: Right.\n\n\n\nKEILAR: Now, taking on President Trump, to that point, Ryan, one of the things that stood out to me in this was that he raised the specter of physically taking on President Trump. So you'll recall, in that 2016 town hall debate that Donald Trump had with Hillary Clinton, and I think we actually may have a picture of this, that he was standing kind of menacingly behind Hillary Clinton. It became a meme, right? And he actually said here, you know, if Trump were to walk behind me, and the head -- there's the head-on shot, right? He basically said, you know, if Trump were to walk behind me, hinting at that, what did you think, Astead?\n\n\n\nHERNDON: Yes, we've seen Vice President Biden do this before, kind of hint at the fact, you know, his brand is kind of a tougher guy and he said, he said I think last year they had a back-and-forth about the kind of physical confrontation again.\n\n\n\nI think to the broader point, this is him again trying to play to that electability kind of figurative that he wants to present himself as, as the person who can match Trump on his own turf and best him at that.\n\n\n\nWhat I think, though, is the risk here is that this is a Democratic electorate that while Vice President Biden may have enjoyed that reputation months ago as kind of the only person who can deal with Trump on that plane, I think that is what the debate has changed. To Ryan's point, Senator Harris was able to kind of bring him down to earth and look just like those other candidates. And so I think we see in polling now the kind of -- the question of who can best take on Trump, Senator Warren, Senator Harris are seeing bumps in that -- in that question, and that strikes at the real heart of Vice President Biden's campaign and even in statements like that.\n\n\n\nKEILAR: All right, Astead Herndon, thank you so much.\n\n\n\nRyan Lizza, thank you for your analysis. Time is running out and the president is growing frustrated, now threatening an executive order to keep the citizenship question on the census with a court deadline to explain the administration's plans for the census just minutes away now.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(CNN) —\n\nThe more cerebral quadrants of science fiction often exist uneasily with the demands of movie-making, and so it is with Annihilation, a taut, challenging work by writer-director Alex Garland that, alas, doesn't yield a payoff completely worthy of the journey.\n\nNatalie Portman headlines as Lena, a biologist whose husband (Oscar Isaac, in what nerds will identify as a Star Wars cross-trilogy marriage) has gone missing on a military mission. It turns out that he had disappeared into something called The Shimmer, a strange, perhaps alien expanse – ensconced within what's known as Area X – that's slowly but inexorably growing, threatening the world along with it.\n\nAdapted from Jeff VanderMeer's book (and already the subject of some controversy amid charges of whitewashing in its casting), Annihilation is a notably female-centric film, as Lena embarks on her expedition into The Shimmer with an all-women group, well aware that it's a bit like an ethereal roach motel – researchers go in, but they haven't come out.\n\nIn its tone and stylized look, Annihilation brings to mind Arrival, another recent science-fiction film that dabbled in big ideas. But unlike that movie, Garland – who made an impressive debut with Ex Machina, also co-starring Isaac – can't muster the same level of emotional resonance, despite a framing device that flashes back to Lena's life before all this began.\n\nFortunately, Lena takes an intriguing bunch with her, joining specialists in various fields played by Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tuva Novotny. The bizarre landscape they must navigate – trying to reach the point where The Shimmer originated, and thus unlock some answers – is fraught with peril, creating an odd sense of tension, leavened by occasional moments of dark humor thanks to the sheer absurdity of the obstacles they encounter.\n\nThe timing surely feels right for this sort of female-led enterprise. What's lacking, perhaps inevitably, is a well-articulated grasp of the threat, as Garland settles for a sort of on-the-fly tutorial in the microbiological underpinnings of what might be happening. Through it all, Portman is tough, pained and emotionally numbed, desperate for answers but also seeking redemption for reasons that finally become clearer, frankly, than almost anything else in the movie.\n\nThere's nothing wrong, obviously, with science fiction that isn't spoon-fed to the audience, a half-century after Stanley Kubrick demonstrated that with 2001: A Space Odyssey. Annihilation certainly dares to be cryptic, and for most of the trip, has the audience on edge. Ultimately, though, when your movie is built around deciphering an apocalyptic threat, it would be nice to leave feeling like you know more than you did when you first sat down.\n\nBroken down to the basics, Garland has delivered another movie that's worth seeing.

Written by Marina Garcia-Vasquez\n\nLenne Chai's wedding photos, seemingly taken in the not-too-distant past, exude all the merriment of a typical Singaporean wedding.\n\nBut this isn't a real marriage. In fact, the scenes staged by the photographer -- two women tying the knot, before toasting their guests and cutting a cake -- aren't actually legal in the city-state.\n\nChai's fictional photo series A Singaporean 377A Wedding was inspired by Section 377A of Singapore's penal code, which, since the 1930s, has criminalized homosexuality with punishments of up to two years in prison.\n\nLenne Chai\n\nThe law only applies to gay men, but it represents the wider struggle faced by the country's entire LGBTQ+ community, Chai said in a phone interview. The photographer, who identifies as a bisexual female, added that the images depict the type of dreamy nuptials that her conservative family would never permit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 14 Lenne Chai's A Singaporean 377A Wedding. Credit: Lenne Chai\n\nThere's no way a traditional Chinese wedding would have two women as the lead, said Chai. Older Chinese would think that was crazy or disrespectful. I wanted to show that possibility in a way that was happy and exuberant. And to highlight how ridiculous it is that (same-sex marriage) is completely impossible.\n\nThe repeal of 377A (would be) the first step to, hopefully, a more inclusive Singapore someday, she added. Without removing 377A first, it's impossible for us to get to a point where queer people can have civil unions in Singapore, and eventually marriages.\n\nBorn in Singapore but based in New York, Chai has shot fashion spreads for publications including Elle, Harper's Bazaar and Nylon. While she considers her work more commercial than editorial, many of the 28-year-old's images fuse fashion photography with political commentary.\n\nTake, for example, a photo shoot titled Orientalism, featuring two Asian models bending in surreal formations, which prompted Chai to ask herself: Do you think it's possible to appropriate your own culture?\n\nChai choreographed models for Korean brand Iise's Spring/Summer 2019 collection, with a composition inspired by the composition of Caravaggio paintings and influenced by the frequent anti-government protests that the designers witnessed outside Seoul's Gyeongbokgung Palace.\n\nIn Chai's high-spirited wedding photos, we see a beautifully arranged Chinese banquet with every detail accounted for -- accent flowers, double happiness signs, noodle dishes signifying longevity, champagne toasts and guests dressed to the nines.\n\nThe set-up was inspired by Chai's parents' own wedding photos from the 1980s, though they have been injected with the artist's own sense of decadence. As with traditional weddings, the two brides appear to have changed outfits between courses, from emerald and saffron powersuits to dresses made of brocade, organza and satin.\n\nI referenced my family albums, down to the actions that they're doing (and) even the props we used, like how they put Fanta orange in wine glasses or plastic cups.\n\nfrom her parent's generation had been allowed to openly marry. Chai says her use of color and composition was also inspired by an '80s aesthetic that imagines an alternate Singaporean history of liberation, freedom and acceptance. The series, which was shot in 2018 and recently exhibited at Singapore's Objectifs Centre for Photography and Film, is intended to show what life might have been like if same-sex couplesfrom her parent's generation had been allowed to openly marry.\n\nLenne Chai\n\nThe married couple portrayed in the series are both professional actors, while Chai cast some of the other models from the local LGBTQ+ community.\n\nI didn't want to cast girls who look like what people (would expect) a gay couple looks like: a butch or pretty girl, Chai said. So that's why I wanted to cast a traditional-looking girl.\n\nThe photographer also took special care to represent the full spectrum of Singapore's racial diversity: Chinese, Indian, Malay and mixed-race Singaporeans.\n\nI hope that when people see this series, it shifts the conversation about what's moral or immoral, Chai said. Singaporeans are very religious, and also coming from an Asian cultural standpoint. My genuine hope is to shift the conversation more toward empathy.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Bridgerton, the first TV series made by Shondaland for Netflix, hit both Britain and the USA on December 25, 2020. A period drama set in London of 1813, the show is based on bestselling American novels, and offers a vision of Britain as only Americans could see it. Yet Brits, as enthusiastically as American viewers, have lapped up this soapy fantasy .\n\nThe show was lucky with its launch date. By late December, America was reeling from post-election crisis to pre-inauguration crisis, its citizens desperate for escapism. But on Christmas Day itself, Brits were in particular need of the magic Bridgerton offers. Five days earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had abruptly canceled the nation's promised Christmas relaxation of quarantine regulations. Young people living in London were disproportionately affected, prevented by overnight changes in quarantine zoning from traveling to their families outside the city. So instead of turkey and charades, Britain's millennials kicked back with Netflix.\n\nBridgerton offers viewers eight hours of candy-colored entertainment. (For some Brits of my acquaintance, that eight hours constituted their sole Christmas Day activity.) The story of Daphne, a beautiful debutante in Regency London, this is milquetoast Jane Austen fan fiction. There is some weeping and wailing about the possibility of spinsterhood or scandal, but nothing disquieting happens for long to anyone we care about. The chief crisis of our heroine's life involves her having to choose between a Prince and a Duke.\n\nLike the heroine of a fairy tale, Daphne is introduced from the opener as the fairest in the land, singled out by the Queen of 200 young ladies as the winner of the debutante beauty pageant, and declared the incomparable by the anonymous gossip columnist Lady Whistledown. She will face challenges -- both these fairy tale deities will temporarily withdraw their favor -- but we know that beauty and charm will always win.\n\nAcross the street we meet an evil stepmother, Lady Featherington, who primps up her two charmless elder daughters in lurid feathers and belittles her intellectual youngest, Penelope. We know, as surely as we know that only Cinderella's foot will fit the glass slipper, that these ugly sisters will end the season unmarried.\n\nAt times of economic pain, big media sells us fairy tales. The 1937 Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, released to wild success during one of the worst years of the Great Depression , is regularly cited as an example of this phenomenon. When the theorists Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer coined the term  culture industry , they were writing about the ways that big corporates shape our imagination: the Walt Disney Company sold the song Some Day My Prince Will Come to millions of young working class women struggling for a better life.\n\nAdjoa Andoh as Lady Danbury in 'Bridgerton.'\n\nFor women in 1937, that better life meant marriage and a male breadwinner. Like Snow White, Bridgerton finds British and American viewers at our most despairing. Like Snow White, it peddles dreams to a target audience of working class women. Some of the cast and crew of Bridgerton have tried to claim progressive credentials for their show. Certainly, its racially diverse casting is to be applauded: a major step toward black British actors finally getting a chance to play the great period drama roles they deserve. (Adjoa Andoh, for example, was born to play a Regency Grande Dame). But the happy-ever-after Bridgerton sells to its female viewers still consists of marriage and men. This is Snow White with added orgasms ; social conservatism dressed up in progressive breeches.\n\nWhy audiences can't get enough of the land of Austen\n\nAs for breeches and orgasms, why does the Regency world carry such appeal as a period backdrop? There is something culturally specific about this era which is deeply ingrained in contemporary female fantasy. The Bridgerton TV series is based on Julia Quinn's bestselling romance novels of the same name. The eight stories which follow Daphne and her siblings form only a part of the expansive Quinn universe. Her devoted fanbase has produced a rich and varied archive of its own fan fiction, much of it more nuanced and perspicacious than the frothy show you'll find on Netflix.\n\nIf there is a female gaze, Bridgerton is looking to define and cater to it. Sex scenes are shot to appeal to women who date men; they focus almost exclusively on the heaving torsos of Regé-Jean Page, who plays Daphne's love interest Simon, and Jonathan Bailey, who pursues his own panting storylines as Daphne's promiscuous brother Anthony. Simon is conveniently given a confidante in the person of his muscular boxing trainer, which offers ample opportunity for the two men to bounce about a boxing ring, shirtless and sweating. Is this feminism, or just female friendly?\n\nContemporary culture has long fetishized men in Regency dress (or undress). When the BBC adapted Pride and Prejudice in 1995, they invented the iconic scene in which Colin Firth, as Mr. Darcy, strips down to his undershirt and dives into a lake on his grounds. As recently as 2016, women lined up in Washington, DC, to view the very same shirt in a display at the Folger Shakespeare Library. What any of it had to do with Shakespeare was unclear. It is a truth universally acknowledged that men who dress like Austen's heroes are dreamy.\n\nJennifer Ehle and Colin Firth in 'Pride and Prejudice.'\n\nYet if Austen's heroes are dreamy, they don't emerge from fairy tales. Women tend to identify with Austen's heroines, and thus it's an easy step to find themselves loving Austen's men. But much of the reason modern women identify with Austen's heroines that they face real challenges to which 21st century women can still relate. For Austen's women, marriage is an economic prospect, and often the only economic prospect which allows an escape from poverty -- or at best, lifelong financial dependence on a reluctant relative. That is no longer true for women in the developed world, but their marital and sexual choices still face pressures and scrutiny unique to their sex.\n\nWhat Elizabeth Bennet could teach Daphne about economics -- and sexual consent\n\nBridgerton, as a cultural phenomenon encompassing both novels and TV series, seizes on women's great affection for Austen's books and shamelessly targets her fan base. Perhaps if you've ever identified with Elizabeth Bennett, you'll fall for any actor in Regency uniform. But while the landscape of Austen is peppered with tragic figures of women who've lost out in life, in Bridgerton, no one we like ever makes a long-term mistake. Marina Thompson, a Featherington country cousin with more wealth than first appears, does have to settle for respectable marriage in the absence of passion. But as she's already attempted to entrap a naive young man into falsely accepting paternity of her baby, our sympathy is limited. There is cosmic order in her story's neat ending, far happier than the messy lives of most unmarried pregnant women in the era.\n\nMeanwhile Daphne is a more fiscally naive heroine than any in Austen. In the first episode, she scolds her sisters for mocking her social success: my success on the marriage mart influences all of your prospects. We will all need to find love one day. In two sentences, this script has rejected every observation Austen ever made about Regency social norms. For Austen, marriage is an economic bargain in which love has little to do with worldly success; for Daphne it is a popularity contest in which worldly success and love will naturally come together.\n\nRegé-Jean Page as Simon Basset in 'Bridgerton'\n\nDaphne does get everything she wants. This includes cajoling her Duke, the dashing Simon, into embracing fatherhood, despite his lifelong wish not to have children. Bridgerton presents this development as an act of psychological healing by Daphne -- for who would actively choose childlessness, this show suggests, except as a symptom of unresolved childhood trauma? Yet this seeming cure involves a bedroom act that at worst can be called rape, at best reproductive coercion. She forcibly violates his expressed wish to use the (unreliable) withdrawal method.\n\nSexual consent doesn't cease to matter when it is violated by an attractive young woman. Daphne's justifications and Simon's eventual forgiveness send a poor message to anyone trapped in an abusive sexual relationship. None of this is feminist. Daphne's act perpetuates old stereotypes of women as seed-stealing succubae. Marina's treatment of Colin similarly signals that men should be careful of women's deceit.\n\nSuch conservatism would not have been out of place in the 1930s. Nor would Bridgerton's solid heterosexuality. There's a token gay character who features in a sub-plot to a subplot. When Daphne's brother Benedict explores London's art scene, he makes a friend and fleetingly walks in on the man embracing his lover in the side-room of an orgy. But Benedict rushes away to partake instead in a two-woman threesome -- a classic heterosexual male fantasy. Some Bridgerton fans are hopeful that Daphne's rebellious sister Eloise may turn out to be a lesbian in later series -- if so, it will be a departure from the novel series.\n\nIn the end, to escape is still bliss\n\nNonetheless, Bridgerton gives us escapism, and we need escapism today. If you're British, the anti-naturalism of this fantasy is particularly obvious. In the show's opening shots, we are presented with the most famous vistas of the city of Bath -- and yet we're told we're in the city of London. Buckingham Palace is shown with unsubtly CGI'd scaffolding. Anachronistic names pop up everywhere -- Nigel for a Regency aristocrat? Really? -- and instead of period music, Daphne and Simon's sex scenes are set to stringed orchestrations of Taylor Swift. These aren't errors, or the business of pedantic historians to dispute. They are features, not bugs.\n\nThis antipathy towards accuracy doesn't preclude a sense of historicism. Like the Quinn novels, the dialogue of TV adaptation is peppered with references to popular myths about the Regency era -- in the opening lines, one character suggests the use of lead and arsenic as effective makeup. A handful of genuine references to Regency social history are used and reused over and again: there incessant mentions of immature characters being 'barely out of leading strings', i.e. Regency baby-walkers . The purpose of such clangers is not historical accuracy: it is to hang a sign reading: We are not in 2020 anymore.\n\nBridgerton revels in the fantastical nature of its own world building: this is a world of extravagant wigs and crowded parties; a world in catering for a glamorous wedding can be laid on at three days notice; a world which has achieved racial restitution and equality, without any indication of the struggle and trauma taken to achieve this. In a brief expository scene, never referenced once in the rest of the series, Simon's godmother tells him that racial harmony arrived in Britain after King George chose to marry a black woman. It is as simplistic an idea as any fairy tale -- whatever your view of Queen Charlotte , whose distant African ancestry has in recent years put her cultural identity under the microscope , no racial progress is ever made that fast. One doubts Meghan Markle shares its confidence in royal open-mindedness. But what a wonderful fairy tale for us momentarily to believe possible.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nBut this is an American fantasy of Britain. Unlike the historical members of the Regency ton, who reveled in informal nicknames and scatological jokes, our aristocratic siblings use cold and formal language with each other. Fathers and sons perpetuate in cycles of emotional abuse; no one is capable of communicating their emotions. Even the hopeful vision of racial diversity is limited by an American lens: there are no lead actors of South Asian heritage, which is contemporary Britain's largest ethnic minority.\n\nIt is also, like most American fantasies of Britain, a conservative fantasy. Our heroines are aristocrats: there are no storylines for servants, no lead character drawn from the working class. As in a fairy tale, happiness is granted to the beautiful and innocent: Lady Featherington and her ugly daughters end the show outplayed and unhappy. Perhaps this is what we need to get us through 2021, but if so, we are in a very bad place.\n\nAn earlier version of this op-ed incorrectly referred to a character on Bridgerton as Andrew. The character's name is Anthony.
(CNN) —\n\nZaynub Afinnih lives thousands of miles away from Sudan, but the story of a 19-year-old woman who was sentenced to death there for killing her rapist inspired her to start a global campaign calling for justice.\n\nI don't know her … I've never spoken to her, the 16-year-old activist told CNN from her family's home in Rouen, France. But she is my sister in humanity. I can't let her die for defending herself against the man who raped her.\n\nNoura Hussein was imprisoned in Omdurman, Sudan, last year after fatally stabbing the man she was forced to marry, who she says raped her as his relatives held her down.\n\nThe harrowing details of her case have set social media ablaze and captured international attention with the hashtags #JusticeforNoura and #SaveNoura.\n\nAfinnih first came across Hussein's story on Instagram, and then read more about her in a blog post. She said she was shocked by the story.\n\nPHOTO: Change.org An illustration used in the change.org campaign for Noura Hussein.\n\nIt was just horrific. I couldn't read the story and go back about my normal day, Hussein said. After that I made the petition. I felt like I had to do something.\n\nFrom the ground-floor flat she shares with her Nigerian mother, two sisters, and brother, Afinnih decided to create a change.org petition appealing to the Sudanese government to save Hussein's life.\n\nThe petition has gone viral, garnering more than 700,000 signatures so far.\n\nAfter starting the petition from the bunk bed of her bedroom, Afinnih shared it with her followers on Instagram and Twitter, calling on her friends to do the same.\n\nShe's a hero, Afinnih said of Hussein. She's representing all the women who have been oppressed in their lives.\n\nHussein's family compelled her to marry at 15 – one year younger than Afinnih – but she refused and ran away for three years. Her father forced her to complete the wedding ceremony last April. After refusing to have sex with her husband on their honeymoon, she says he raped her as his brother and two cousins restrained her.\n\nCalls for mercy mount\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy Dr. Adil Mohamed Al-Imam Noura Hussein on her wedding night.\n\nSince Hussein was sentenced on May 10, calls for mercy have mounted internationally.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres demanded Sudan stop any attempt to execute Hussein, and urged respect for her claim of self defense against attempted rape.\n\nSaying that Guterres was following the case closely, UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told CNN that the UN calls for halting any steps being taken toward her execution, which, on the basis of the information made available to us, would violate international human rights law and standards, thus constituting an arbitrary execution.\n\nAmnesty International has collected 174,000 letters from people around the world asking for her release – they've sent 150,000 of those letters to Sudan's Ministry of Justice, Amnesty International's Deputy Regional Director for East Africa Seif Magango told CNN on Thursday.\n\nAmnesty is waiting for a response, he adds.\n\nREAD MORE: Lawyer for Sudanese teen who killed her rapist facing intimidation\n\nWhat we ask the international community is to stand with us to free Noura, he said. She doesn't deserve to die for defending herself.\n\nA representative from the US State Department told CNN it echo(es) the statements of many in the international community and within Sudan, condemning early and forced marriage and violence against women and girls.\n\nWe have raised this case with the government of Sudan, and note that it is still going through a judicial process; we look forward to an appropriate resolution of her case, consistent with Sudan's international human rights obligations.\n\nThe Sudanese government has not responded to CNN requests for comment on the case.\n\nCNN's Euan McKirdy contributed to this report.
Written by Jonathan Glancey, CNN\n\nCNN Style is the international digital news partner for the RIBA International Prize.\n\nThe RIBA International List 2018, announced today, is a biennial selection of some of the world's best new or recently completed buildings in a bedazzling variety of forms, functions and styles.\n\nSomewhere among these 62 individual buildings drawn from 29 countries are the four that will eventually be scrutinized by the 2018 RIBA International Prize grand jury.\n\nThe 2018 list, said RIBA president Ben Derbyshire, illustrates the meaningful impact and transformative quality that well-designed buildings can have on communities, wherever they are in the world. This is the award for buildings that sets the gold standard for architectural achievement.\n\nThere are nine categories of buildings embracing public and private offices, places of worship, private homes and museums, apartment blocks, assembly plants, buildings responding to conflict and natural disasters, and new architectural landscapes.\n\nBremer Landesbank Headquarters in Bremen, Germany Credit: Courtesy Hélène Binet\n\nWithin these categories are a numinous mosque like no other on the fringe of Istanbul; a thatched visitor center set in the sand dunes of Jutland, from where millions of migrating birds can be observed; and a pair of vertical forest apartment blocks in a revitalized industrial quarter of Milan.\n\nA sense of place\n\nWadden Sea Centre in Ribe, Denmark Credit: Courtesy Adam Mørk\n\nMany nominated buildings appear to be part and parcel of the landscape they inhabit. Although a big new building, the Wadden Sea Centre on the Danish coast by Dorte Mandrup Architects , for example, has a feeling of happy inevitability about it: this is the landscape it ought to belong to.\n\nEqually, the low-lying and gently undulating form of Lisbon's new Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology (MAAT), designed by London's AL_A firm, feels a natural part of the Tagus riverside, even though its design is radically new. At one end, the museum dips into the Tagus in a sequence of long, broad steps for sitting on or walking along that reveal themselves at low tide.\n\nMuseum of Art, Architecture and Technology in Lisbon, Portugal Credit: Courtesy Francisco Nogueira\n\nWe like to think of MAAT, said AL-A founder and principal Amanda Levete , as more of a place than a building. It does have presence, but it's not bombastic. It's a place to meet, to congregate, to encounter new ideas in art, architecture and technology.\n\nAs for the Sancaklar Mosque on the outskirts of Istanbul, Emre Arolat Architecture (EAA) have shaped a place of worship in a prairie-like landscape overlooking Lake Büyükçekmece. Because a mosque has no preordained form, EAA have created an essentially underground place of worship, adorned and decorated by sunlight brought in slits and chutes into elemental and meditative spaces.\n\nBeyazit State Library in Istanbul, Turkey Credit: Courtesy Emre Dorter\n\nIn Istanbul itself, Tabanlioglu Architects have converted the former soup kitchen and caravanserai of the early-16th-century Beyazit Mosque into the magnificent Beyazit State Library, an exemplary illustration of how modern architects can reuse historic buildings.\n\nPast meets present\n\nCity Hall Deventer in the Netherlands Credit: Courtesy Scagliola Brakkee\n\nThe RIBA list also shows that crafted brick buildings with a sense of warmth and a degree of historical familiarity are returning to city centers where sleek, icy steel-and-glass designs have been dominant.\n\nThe new Deventer City Hall in the Netherlands by Neutelings Riedijk Architects , and the Bremer Landesbank headquarters in Bremen, Germany by Caruso St John are two buildings that show modern office buildings can be a part of their own era while comfortably rubbing shoulders -- or cornices -- with their medieval and Renaissance predecessors.\n\nOne of the three Barcelona Line 9 metro stations designed by Garcés-De Seta-Bonet Credit: Courtesy Adrià Goula\n\nThree new raw and cavernous metro stations along Barcelona's Line 9 -- a herculean engineering project -- take us further back into history to geology. Designed by Garcés-De Seta-Bonet , the haunting Amadeu Torner, Parc Logístic and Mercabarna stations do nothing to hide passengers from the thrilling reality of bravura excavations made under the Catalan capital. Served by the latest in design, from lighting to seating and signage, the marriage between raw nature and 21st-century technology is deeply affecting.\n\nIn contrast to these heroic urban projects are low-cost buildings shaped in developing regions or those where natural disasters have struck. Small budgets, however, preclude neither structural dignity nor architectural imagination.\n\nAmong several such nominees is the Lanka Learning Center by feat.collective on the east coast of Sri Lanka, where the goal was to create a place where disadvantaged children of different ethnic and religious affiliations can come together through various communal educational and sporting activities, and thus to make a better future possible, according to a statement. It does this simply and well with a protective circle of low-key, low-energy buildings that feel they belong here quite naturally.\n\nLanka Learning Center in Sri Lanka Credit: Courtesy Barbara Vetter/Vincent Heiland\n\nWhile it is hard to compare a low-cost school innocent of steel frames, air conditioning and even glass with highly engineered Catalan metro stations or even a sophisticated thatched visitors' center on the Jutland coast, this is the challenge judges and jurors of the RIBA International Prize 2018 are tasked with. The grand jury's final decision, however, will have to wait until December 2018.\n\nTop: Sancaklar Mosque. Courtesy Cemal Emden

Look no further than how the marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle has captivated the globe, giving many of us a brief respite from the chaos of divisive politics and rabid warmongering we hear every day.\n\nSince childhood, reading has been my favorite escape, a safe place to dream when the problems of the world got too heavy. But lately it seems those problems have intruded into my reading refuge.\n\nAnd I'm not the only bookworm feeling out of sorts.\n\nThe romantic saga, set in the Scottish Highlands, was published in 1999.\n\nDavis, who is white, filed an ethics complaint with RWA against Milan, claiming she had lost a book deal due to Milan's criticisms. Davis has since backtracked, telling the Guardian that her claim about suffering professional harm was not accurate. Milan was censured by the RWA board, given a one-year suspension from the group, and a lifetime ban from any leadership positions. After two complaints filed, a lengthy investigation and a report delivered to the Board, they dismissed all but one of the infractions against Milan.\n\nMembers revolted over Milan's harsh punishment. A twitter storm ensued: #IStandWithCourtney.\n\nI'm not surprised by the controversy, current board member Hanna Rhys Barnes told me, adding, As a woman of color, I joined the organization to help make a difference and bring questions of equality, diversity and fairness to the forefront, but fairness and equality are not the same to me. Barnes avoided explaining what she meant by this, or answering direct questions about racism within the group or in the romance book publishing industry. Barnes said she's definitely remaining with the organization after her term ends this summer.\n\nFamed author Nora Roberts has strong feelings about RWA. Roberts jumped into the fray early , supporting Milan's right to call out racism within RWA and the publishing industry. A longtime LGBTQ ally, Roberts wrote on a recent blog post that she quit RWA back in 2005 when the leadership drafted an edict defining romance as only between one man and one woman. (Since then, the Rainbow Romance Writers , a group for LGBTQ authors in the genre, has become part of RWA, which has also rejected language defining romance as heterosexual.) Of the current controversy, she wrote that although she isn't on Twitter and hasn't been in RWA since 2005, it's been impossible not to be aware of the horrendous situation involving RWA, its leadership and Courtney Milan which, as it escalated, brought to light a long-standing and systemic marginalization of authors of color, of LGBTQ authors, by the organization ... I regret all the years I didn't hear, didn't see, didn't listen, remained unaware of all the sad and unfair things that are now coming to light.\n\nAnd though Milan's suspension was quickly revoked , along with all other sanctions against her, it wasn't fast enough to stop the outrage.\n\nIronically, RWA was co-founded in 1981 by a black woman, Vivian Stephens, a former editor at Harlequin Books and editor Dell publishing. Stephens was a trailblazer who helped create a lucrative career path for black and brown women who write romantic fiction novels.\n\nAmerican women went through a sexual revolution, Stephens told Black Enterprise Magazine in 1982. Every woman is not a 21-year old virgin.\n\nStephens, seeing a lack of representation for black women writers in publishing, wanted all voices to be valued. And she didn't just focus on black storytellers. While an editor at Dell publishing in the 1970s, Stephens made it her mission to buy romantic stories from Asian, Latino and Native American women writers.\n\nAnd for readers like myself, Stephens' work has made a huge difference. Not every love story starts with a blonde-haired beauty with blue eyes and her green-eyed cowboy. And though that may be obvious today, up until the 1980s it was nearly impossible to find a book that told a heartfelt love story about women who looked like me.\n\nIndeed, it wasn't until best-selling authors such as Zane and Terry McMillan , two black women, who captured my attention nearly 20 years ago with steamy, romantic love stories that authentically captured black culture, that I even bothered to read a romance fiction at all. (Even now, I admit historical fiction and mysteries remain my favorite genres.)\n\nGiven a choice, I'd much rather live out my own passion than read about someone else's romantic fantasies. Yet, I get the cult-like attraction to authors like Zane and the wildly famous Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James\n\nShamefully, despite Stephens' early work to recognize the talents of writers of color, until last year , no black woman in 36 years had ever won the group's annual RITA award. Finally, in 2019, RITAs were awarded to two black authors, Kennedy Ryan and M. Malone. And Nisha Sharma was the first South Asian winner.\n\nThis type of blatant exclusion and discrimination of the very writers that the organization was founded to support is why many black and brown writers shun RWA.\n\nOne of them, Brenda L. Thomas, author of several romantic fiction books published by Simon & Schuster, has never been a RWA member but said she's closely following the fallout. She told me that postponing the RITA contest , the US's top prize for romance fiction, until next year is not enough to convince her that the organization is serious about standing up against racism in the industry.\n\nThey have to go beyond the typical corporate quick fixes used when racial controversies arise like hiring a diversity expert to step in, which the group has done.\n\nThomas, who told me she has also published under boutique firms like Brown Girls Books, wants editors and authors to take more responsibility for their work, so no one could deem it a racist mess.\n\nShe's urging them to work harder, to do the research needed to create truly diverse characters.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.

(CNN) Rep. Tulsi Gabbard in the early 2000s touted working for her father's anti-gay organization, which mobilized to pass a measure against same-sex marriage in Hawaii and promoted controversial conversion therapy.\n\nGabbard, a Democrat from Hawaii, said Friday in an interview with CNN's Van Jones that she will seek her party's nomination for president in 2020. Her past views and activism in opposition to LGBT rights in the late 90s and early 2000s, which put her out of step with most of the Democratic Party at the time, have come under more intense scrutiny since her announcement.\n\nAlthough Gabbard's positions on LGBT rights have shifted dramatically in more recent years (she signed a 2013 amicus brief supporting Edith Windsor's challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act), the extent of Gabbard's past anti-gay activism has already drawn criticism from prominent Democrats and will likely be a major issue for her as she seeks the party's nomination.\n\nSee more\n\nIn a statement to CNN provided after the initial publication of this story, Gabbard said, First, let me say I regret the positions I took in the past, and the things I said. I'm grateful for those in the LGBTQ+ community who have shared their aloha with me throughout my personal journey.\n\nShe continued, Over the past six years in Congress, I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to help work toward passing legislation that ensures equal rights and protections on LGBTQ+ issues, such as the Equality Act, the repeal of DOMA, Restore Honor to Service members Act, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, the Safe Schools Improvement Act and the Equality for All Resolution. Much work remains to ensure equality and civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ Americans and if elected President, I will continue to fight for equal rights for all.\n\nFour days after CNN KFile's report published, Gabbard further apologized, releasing a four-minute-long video on YouTube saying, In my past, I said and believed things that were wrong, and worse, they were very hurtful to people in the LGBTQ community and to their loved ones.\n\nGabbard's past positions can be traced back to the early 2000s, when she first sought public office.\n\nDuring her run for state legislature in 2002, Gabbard told the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, Working with my father, Mike Gabbard, and others to pass a constitutional amendment to protect traditional marriage, I learned that real leaders are willing to make personal sacrifices for the common good. I will bring that attitude of public service to the legislature. The quote, which CNN's KFile found during a review of Gabbard's early career, shows how closely she aligned herself with her father's mission at the time.\n\nGabbard's father ran The Alliance for Traditional Marriage, a political action committee aimed at opposing pro-gay lawmakers and legislation that organized and spent more than $100,000 to pass an amendment in 1998 that gave the Hawaii state legislature power to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples. The amendment to the state's constitution passed.\n\nGabbard was 17 at the time of the vote and cited working with her father and the organization during her run for the state legislature in Hawaii four years later when she was age 21. Gabbard would win her race, becoming the youngest woman elected to the Hawaii state legislature.\n\nGabbard's father Mike was a prominent anti-gay activist in Hawaii. He was also the director of Stop Promoting Homosexuality and also served on the steering committees of the National Campaign to Protect Marriage and the Hawaii-based coalition, Save Traditional Marriage. He also once hosted an anti-gay radio show, Let's Talk Straight Hawaii.\n\nThe Alliance for Traditional Marriage called homosexuality unhealthy, abnormal behavior that should not be promoted or accepted in society.\n\nListed among Gabbard's past work in the profile by the Honolulu newspaper was her work at The Alliance for Traditional Marriage.\n\nA CNN KFile review of the organization's website, which is archived on the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, uncovers the organization supported controversial gay conversion therapy, which treats homosexuality as a mental illness that can be fixed. The practice is opposed by the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association and has been banned for use on minors in 14 states and D.C., including Hawaii in 2018.\n\nOur win in Hawaii, along with Alaska's victory, sends a very clear message to the homosexual movement-we do not want homosexual marriage advocates forcing their values on our communities, Tulsi's father Mike wrote in a message on the website of the group shortly after the passage of the constitutional amendment in 1998.\n\nSee more\n\nIt is now a time for healing and moving on, he added. While we must continue to monitor and respond to homosexual activists whose ultimate goal is societal acceptance of homosexuality on an equal basis as heterosexuality, we must also renew our efforts to reach out with love and compassion to those who are addicted to homosexual behavior, and encourage them to seek help through the National Association of Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH), 'ex-gay' ministries such as Exodus International, Courage, Homosexuals Anonymous and Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays (P-FOX).\n\nTulsi Gabbard herself is quoted in a 2000 press release from The Alliance for Traditional Marriage. In it, she attacks gay rights activists who were opposed to her mother Carol's bid for the state's board of education.\n\nThis war of deception and hatred against my mom is being waged by homosexual activists because they know, that if elected, she will not allow them to force their values down the throats of the children in our schools, Gabbard is quoted as saying.\n\nTulsi Gabbard's anti-gay efforts continued after she became a state representative.\n\nShortly after Gabbard announced her presidential ambitions Friday, her testimony at a hearing opposing a civil unions bill in 2004 resurfaced.\n\nTo try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, Gabbard said at the time. As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists.\n\nThe resurfaced comments drew condemnation from former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, the first governor in America to support civil unions and who sought the Democratic nomination in 2004.\n\nI was on the other side of this argument wearing a bulletproof vest while she was saying this, Dean tweeted.\n\nIn 2012, when running for Congress, Gabbard apologized to LGBT activists in Hawaii for her past comments.\n\nI want to apologize for statements that I have made in the past that have been very divisive and even disrespectful to those within the LGBT community, Gabbard said. I know that those comments have been hurtful and I sincerely offer my apology to you and hope that you will accept it.\n\nSince joining Congress in 2013, Gabbard has supported efforts to promote LGBT equality, including co-sponsoring pro-LGBT legislation like The Equality Act, a bill to amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to protect LGBT individuals.\n\nI grew up in a very kind of conservative household. A multi-ethnic, multi-racial, multi-faith home, Gabbard said in New Hampshire in December, speaking to her shift. Diverse in our makeup and diverse in our views. And I held views growing up that I no longer hold.\n\nCiting her time deployed overseas, Gabbard said she saw the destructive effect of having governments who act as moral arbiters for their people.\n\nThat caused me to really deeply reflect and be introspective on the values and beliefs that I had grown up with what I was experiencing there, she said. And then coming back and eventually running for office again. And the conflict that I saw there, in standing for, believing strongly in, and fighting for these ideals of freedom and liberty that we hold dear in this country. It means that equality, that our laws, our government must apply that respect for every single individual. For people who choose to love or marry someone -- whether they be of the same gender or not, that respect, and that freedom for every woman to be able to make her own choice about her body and her family and her future. So it was a process that I went through that changed my views in many ways and in many big ways to the views that I hold today.
Ex-teacher weds student\n\nLetourneau served seven years for raping boy, now 22\n\n\n\n\n\n(CNN) -- A teacher who served more than seven years in prison for raping one of her sixth-grade students is now married to that former student.\n\nThey already have two children.\n\nMary Kay Letourneau, 43, married Vili Fualaau, now 22, in Woodinville, Washington, outside Seattle Friday.\n\nLetourneau was released from prison in August after serving seven and a half years for raping a child. Fualaau was 13 -- and a student in Letourneau's class -- when the two began a sexual relationship.\n\nShe gave birth to their daughter shortly after her 1997 conviction.\n\nShe served six months and was released on probation, but was ordered to serve her full sentence after she and Fualaau were found together in a van, in violation of a no-contact order.\n\nShe gave birth to their second daughter while in prison.\n\nLetourneau told CNN's Larry King last year that their daughters regularly visited her in prison while living with Fualaau's mother. She said her relationship with her four children from her previous marriage was not as close.\n\nLetourneau told King she did not know having a sexual relationship with Fualaau was a felony.\n\nIt just -- I knew it just didn't -- just wasn't normal, she said. It's not that I wouldn't have still had feelings, or that he wouldn't still have feelings, but ... I don't know how anyone does something knowing something's a felony.\n\nDuring her October appearance on Larry King Live Letourneau said she planned to begin volunteering in a program to aid incarcerated women and said she may look for a paid job as a legal research assistant or a teacher at a community college.\n\nShe said Fualaau, who never finished high school, was not working.
(CNN) A multi-million dollar World Bank education loan to Tanzania is back on the table for possible approval next week after it was pulled over a year ago amid concerns about the country's policy of banning pregnant girls and young mothers from attending state school.\n\nThe revamped $500 million loan pledges to provide pregnant girls and new mothers with Alternative Education Pathways but falls short of calling for a reversal of the ban.\n\nThe meeting of the executive board to consider the loan will take place on Tuesday. Bella Bird, the World Bank's Country Director for Tanzania, Burundi, Malawi and Somalia, is set to step down on Friday, according to a source at the bank.\n\nTanzanian activists have written a letter, seen by CNN, to the executive board urging them to stop the loan until the country passes a law that guarantees the rights of pregnant girls to attend regular secondary schools and ends mandatory pregnancy tests. CNN visited three Tanzanian schools in 2018 where girls from grades eight and up were given compulsory pregnancy tests\n\nTanzania uses a morality clause in a 2002 education law to give schools the legal framework needed to expel pregnant students -- the practice originally dates back to the 1960s. The law has been more widely applied since President John Pombe Magufuli took office in 2015.\n\nA $300 million educational loan to Tanzania was withdrawn in 2018 over concerns about expelling pregnant girls and the introduction of a law that made it a crime to question official statistics.\n\nThe Tanzanian government amended the statistics law last year, but stopped short of any formal changes to the way it treats pregnant girls.\n\nA World Bank spokesman for Tanzania said that since 2018 the bank has worked with the Tanzanian government to find a solution. He said the purpose of the reworked loan program was to enhance the quality and provision of education.\n\nThe program has been redesigned ... to ensure girls and boys who drop out, including pregnant girls, have alternate education options for themselves.\n\nAsked why the bank didn't require a guarantee that girls who get pregnant would be allowed to continue in state school if they wish to, the spokesman repeated the current solution was a result of an agreement between the World Bank and Magufuli.\n\nThe Tanzanian government declined to comment to CNN.\n\nAccording to a World Bank document outlining the loan, about 5,500 girls were not able to continue their secondary education due to adolescent pregnancy and young motherhood in 2017.\n\nAround a quarter of Tanzanian girls aged between 15 and 19 are mothers or pregnant. According to the United Nations Population Fund, the percentage of teenage girls who have given birth or who were pregnant increased to 27% in 2016 from 23% in 2010.\n\nChild marriage, as young as 15, which has been barred since 2016, remains an issue -- 36% of women aged 25-49 have been married before they turned 18, according to official data from 2016, the latest available.\n\nOpposition leader Zitto Kabwe told CNN that the new loan would enable the stigma around pregnant girls in Tanzania to continue.\n\nThe way the loan is been structured [means] the young girls who get pregnant for whatever reason will be put in separate schools, he told CNN. This is not right. I am wondering how can the World Bank allow this.\n\nKabwe also sent the World Bank a letter about the loan, highlighting the worsening human and gender rights situation in the country. Kabwe asked the bank to suspend lending to the government until basic checks and balances are restored in Tanzania.\n\nElin Martínez, senior researcher at the Children's Rights Division at Human Rights Watch, called the reworked program a workaround.\n\nThe government has not fulfilled the promises and the conditions that were set last year, she said. We thought that the World Bank was not going to proceed with that loan until the government adopted a policy where it actually explicitly said 'we will end the discrimination against girls.'\n\nThat has not happened. [The government] will not remove the discriminatory ban, that's quite clear now.
Return to Transcripts main page CNN CAPITAL GANG Supreme Court Upholds Affirmative Action; Separate Versions of Medicaid Reform Pass House, Senate; Dean Announces Run for Presidency Aired June 28, 2003 - 19:00 ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. ANNOUNCER: Live from Washington, THE CAPITAL GANG.\n\nMARK SHIELDS, HOST: Welcome to THE CAPITAL GANG.\n\n\n\nI'm Mark Shields with the full GANG, Al Hunt, Robert Novak, Kate O'Beirne, and Margaret Carlson.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court in a five-to-four vote affirmed the constitutionality of race as a factor in admissions at the University of Michigan Law School.\n\n\n\nThe majority opinion, by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, said, quote, Effective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in the civic life of our nation is essential if the dream of one nation, indivisible, is to be realized, end quote.\n\n\n\nDissenting, Justice Clarence Thomas said, quote, The majority upholds the law school's racial discrimination not be interpreting the people's Constitution but by responding to a faddish slogan of the cognoscenti, end quote.\n\n\n\nThe high court next ruled six to three against the Texas sodomy law. Speaking for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said of the high court's past support of antisodomy laws, quote, Its continuance as precedent demeans the lives of homosexual persons, end quote.\n\n\n\nThe dissent by Justice Antonin Scalia said, quote, The court has taken sides in the culture war, end quote.\n\n\n\nKate O'Beirne, what message is -- or messages is the Supreme Court sending in these two decisions?\n\n\n\nKATE O'BEIRNE, CAPITAL GANG: Well, I think one overriding message is clearly for the majority in these cases on this Supreme Court. The Constitution doesn't just live, it mutates. And the reason why Justice Sandra Day O'Connor is so key to these decisions is, she judges on such an ad hoc basis. She's not guided by either clear legal principles, because she changes them over time, or by precedent.\n\n\n\nIt also tells us that the courts, as subject to elite opinion, as fellow elites in the culture, the public really doesn't like racial preferences. They support affirmative action, but not race preferences, although the elites do. And they, of course, upheld race preferences in the Michigan case, not affirmative action. And it also says that if something becomes controversial, like the antisodomy laws, they'll change their precedent, in just 17 years ago. They're not content to leave that to the democratic process. People have changed their minds, which is why only 13 states have such laws, and they're largely unenforced. But they want to jump into that kind of democratic wrangling with a tough issue and preempt the public's action.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: We are blessed here on THE CAPITAL GANG with two women attorneys. Kate O'Beirne, having heard, now about Margaret Carlson?\n\n\n\nMARGARET CARLSON, CAPITAL GANG: Sandra Day O'Connor said that equal protection means that you cannot have a law that applies differently to heterosexuals and homosexuals. So she does follow the Constitution in that regard.\n\n\n\nAnd, you know, life is messy. And these two decisions are a little bit messy. But they come to the right conclusion. And Justice Kennedy, who's no flaming liberal, said that you cannot uphold a law, which was in Bowers (ph), which says that you're going to criminalize private behavior, whether or not, as Kate points out, those laws are enforced. The ones that remain aren't enforced.\n\n\n\nHowever, in Texas, the door was kicked down and two people arrested for the very thing that this said.\n\n\n\nAnd as for affirmative action, what was interesting is the difference in the way Justice Thomas perceives affirmative action, in his -- how it turned out for him, and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. She said, Hey, I wouldn't be a justice if it weren't for affirmative action. It inflames and angers Justice Thomas that people think he's got the job because of affirmative action, when, in fact, he wouldn't have the job if not.\n\n\n\nI wish somebody'd ask him that question.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Bob Novak.\n\n\n\nROBERT NOVAK, CAPITAL GANG: I wondered how long it would take before somebody attacked Clarence Thomas, which I think is just reprehensible. I can't really improve much at all on what Kate said. I agree with everything she said.\n\n\n\nJust suffice to say that they -- the court acts as a superlegislature, decides what is -- what -- rules what the law should be on homosexuality, what the law should be on affirmative action, and doesn't worry about the Constitution.\n\n\n\nThat's what this -- the disgrace is. And, of course, yes, if the sodomy law of Texas is going to be changed, which it should be, it should be done by the Texas legislature, not by the U.S. Supreme Court. There is nothing in the Constitution about it. In fact, on the equal protection clause, Margaret, none of the other justices agreed with Justice O'Connor, who really is a disgrace on that court.\n\n\n\nI would say right now that the next justice on the court's going to be probably the White House counsel, Alberto Gonzales, and I think he'll fit right into this mold on the court. Be better than O'Connor, but who wouldn't?\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Al Hunt.\n\n\n\nAL HUNT, CAPITAL GANG: Two good decisions this week, Mark. The sodomy case, it was decided on due process, Bob, which is actually broader than equal protection. Justice Scalia said that they're choosing sides in the culture war. He's chosen sides all along. He's a great gay-basher.\n\n\n\nAnd on affirmative action, Mark, couple things. There's nothing in Sandra Day O'Connor's wise decision that mandates affirmative action. Nothing. It simply says that if a university wants to use racial preferences for diversity, it can do it.\n\n\n\nAnd the history demonstrated it's worked, it's worked in the United States military, it's worked in the service academies, for which Ted Olson had no answer, and it's worked with the University of Michigan, one of the best law schools in the country.\n\n\n\nFinally, Mark, there's this argument, if it weren't for these affirmative action on race, that higher education would be an academic meritocracy. Nonsense. There are preferences given for rich kids, preferences given for legacies, preference given for athletes.\n\n\n\nBut some people don't want to focus on that, they just want to focus on race.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Margaret Carlson, just go back to what Bob Novak said. The president himself praised...\n\n\n\nCARLSON: Sandra Day O'Connor.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: ... Justice O'Connor's decision as careful and balanced. And there was -- if anything, there was a resounding silence from conservatives on Capitol Hill over the sodomy decision. I mean, what does this mean politically? Does this mean that they've taken a leave on these important issues to the conservative base?\n\n\n\nCARLSON: Well, as Justice Scalia said, he's taken sides in the culture wars, and President Bush has taken the side of affirmative action is a good thing for a compassionate conservative to embrace, as is giving gays, tolerating gays in our society.\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: Let the record show, the military, the American military, does not use race preferences, because it's not the same as affirmative action. And when the publics have a chance, even in liberal states like California and the state of Washington, to vote down race preferences, they do so.\n\n\n\nThere's very little evidence that they lead to the kind of (UNINTELLIGIBLE) understanding that Justice O'Connor talks about at Michigan, where they have segregated dorms and black-only graduations. And of course it's only one kind of diversity they talk about. When 91 percent of Ivy League law professors voted for Al Gore and Ralph Nader, I'd say they have a far bigger diversity problem on American elite campuses than whether or not...\n\n\n\nNOVAK: You know...\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: ... you have a requisite number of black kids in the class.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) the president -- you mentioned President Bush. President Bush joined the prevailing opinion on the court with mostly Republican appointed justices on the court. And in fact, his toning down of Solicitor General Ted Olson's original brief on affirmative action on the orders of Alberto Gonzales and President Bush, indicated that this is the kind of decision the president wanted.\n\n\n\nI just think it's the wrong decision.\n\n\n\nHUNT: Let the record also show that the United States service academies, Annapolis, West Point, and the Air Force Academy, practice exactly the same kind of affirmative action the University of Michigan Law School does. They do it through the prep schools. There's no difference.\n\n\n\nAnd the United States military not only practices it, Colin Powell, the most visible beneficiary, says he was a absolute product of affirmative action. When they sent a bunch of promotions in 1978 and Clifford Adams (UNINTELLIGIBLE) sent them back and said, You can do better, and we got Colin Powell.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Let me just say that I thought the most compelling brief that was filed was filed on behalf of the military. (UNINTELLIGIBLE) signed by Norman Schwarzkopf and Dennis Blair (UNINTELLIGIBLE) chief of naval of operations. I mean, making the case that the United States military is a remarkable institution where there is no discrimination, and at the same time, there is no special treatment, and...\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: Exactly, which is not what race preferences are.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: ... (UNINTELLIGIBLE) -- no, but, I mean, but the reality is...\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: The military is a meritocracy.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: ... the reality -- the reality -- there is a meritocracy, but the reality is, you have to have people on that route and on that trail to have a chance...\n\n\n\nCARLSON: Yes.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: ... to succeed.\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: ... the prep schools, which is fine...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK) CARLSON: Yes.\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: ... that's affirmative action.\n\n\n\nCARLSON: Yes.\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: The service academies cannot have the same kind of acceptance scheme that the University of Michigan Law School has, because it's a holistic scheme that nobody...\n\n\n\nCARLSON: (UNINTELLIGIBLE)\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: ... quite (UNINTELLIGIBLE).\n\n\n\nHUNT: Well, that's funny, Kate, because they say they do.\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: Well...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nHUNT: They filed a brief and said they did.\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: ... they also...\n\n\n\nHUNT: I don't think the service...\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: ... they also denied...\n\n\n\nHUNT: ... I don't think the service academy...\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: ... (UNINTELLIGIBLE) now they have...\n\n\n\nHUNT: ... I don't think the...\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: ... segregated dorms.\n\n\n\nHUNT: I don't think the service academies would lie.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Last word, Al Hunt.\n\n\n\nGANG of five will be back with whether government help for buying prescription drugs is finally at hand for seniors. As a senior, I'm asking.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Welcome back.\n\n\n\nSeparate prescription drug Medicare bills passed the House and the Senate. The Senate consensus nearly broke down when Republicans included a means testing provision.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. TED KENNEDY (D), MASSACHUSETTS: The kind of Medicare system that our seniors rely on day in and day out will be destroyed. (END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: But the provision was eliminated. The bill passed by a vote of 76 to 21, despite conservative and liberal arguments against it.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: For anyone who believes this bill will cost a maximum of $400 billion over the next 10 years, I've got some ocean front property in Gila Bend, Arizona, to sell you.\n\n\n\nSEN. BOB GRAHAM (D), FLORIDA: Many of those who most need prescription drug coverage today simply will not live long enough to get any benefits under this plan.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: The House bill passed by just a one-vote margin after a bitter partisan debate.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER: The Democrats have come to this floor as servants of the people. The Republicans have come to this floor as handmaidens of the prescription drug industry.\n\n\n\nREP. TOM DELAY (R-TX), MAJORITY LEADER: Medicare is too important for partisan politics.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Reluctant Republican support to pass the bill was rounded up by the speaker.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nREP. DENNIS HASTERT (R), SPEAKER: This is a defining moment for this Congress, and it's too late for obstruction, it's too late for nit-picking...\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Bob Novak, how will these two competing bills be put together in final form?\n\n\n\nNOVAK: Not very easily. This may be one of the most fascinating conferences ever. The conservatives have been fobbed in the Senate, saying, We're going to fix it in conference. But if they fix it in conference and make it closer to the House bill, which is a bad bill too, in my opinion, then they're going to stand a chance of losing the Democratic votes there.\n\n\n\nSo it's a very delicate process.\n\n\n\nThe important thing is that the Republicans, with the blessing and fast push by the White House, have embarked on a new entitlement. It is distasteful to the most effective conservatives in both houses, who voted no. Not many voted no, but they were the best people. And it is a very sorry day, I think, for the conservative cause.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: I mean, that's very helpful, Al, we know who the best people are.\n\n\n\nCARLSON: (UNINTELLIGIBLE).\n\n\n\nHUNT: I'm stunned that Tom DeLay is not one of the best people, Bob. You really have done a -- you've done a 180. You're right, though, about the House bill being a bad bill. And I think it's...\n\n\n\nNOVAK: They're both bad.\n\n\n\nHUNT: ... I think it doesn't go nearly far enough. I think the Senate bill is imperfect, but you can at least improve upon it. But the House bill, the House showed that the principal conservatives are paper tigers. Now, only 18 conservatives voted against this expansion of government.\n\n\n\nMark, I think that this is going to be a tough conference, but I think that both sides are petrified for it not to happen. The one thing I hope the Democrats in the Senate will do is, put Edward Kennedy on that conference, because I think Edward Kennedy has a veto power over whatever they finally approve.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Kate O'Beirne, I have a question. George Bush won a smashing victory last November, and the Republican agenda since he came back was essentially extension of unemployment benefits, creation of homeland security, and prescription drugs.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: What happened to the tax cuts?\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: That's not -- But that -- but, I mean, beyond that, beyond the tax cut. But that -- those were the three things that he said he wanted in the second term -- in the second session of Congress. I'm just asking, that doesn't sound like a conservative agenda.\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: Well, the White House will remind you that in 2000, George Bush ran on a promise to deliver a prescription drug benefit.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Yes, he did.\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: And, of course, the challenge conservatives face in the House, who very much wanted to oppose this bill, is, if you don't vote for the bill, nobody listens to any kind of modification you want to make to it. And because this bill is an inevitability, many of them think it's worth voting for so you can change something about it.\n\n\n\nLook, lots of bets are being placed. The Republican White House is betting they're going to be rewarded for delivering a benefit like this, and they're betting it will, this reform, will increase the role of the private market. Ted Kennedy's betting the private market features will fail. The Democratic candidates for president are betting the reform will be unpopular. They voted no. The only safe bet is what John McCain talked about, it's going to cost a whole lot more money than current estimates. That's the only safe bet.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Picking up on Kate's part, Margaret, though, we're talking about -- they finessed 2004, because the bill doesn't...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: ... 2006.\n\n\n\nCARLSON: The first, the -- yes.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: So you get by the presidential election, the next election, so it won't be that kind of revolt we saw against catastrophic coverage.\n\n\n\nCARLSON: Catastrophic. And there could be, because there's a -- what the call a doughnut in there, where seniors end up paying a huge amount before the catastrophic amounts kick in on this. And in the details of this bill, which, you know, even Bob might be hard-pressed to enumerate, could lie a lot of trouble for both sides, whoever wants to claim victory for this bill.\n\n\n\nI mean, it's not going to be reduced easily to a sound bite. Senator Kennedy, it looks like his bill, Bush will embrace it. Those two are together. Where are the conservatives? And when seniors start to complain, if they do, over the amounts they're going to have to pay, and if they're pushed, as the House bill would do, into private plans, you might have that Rostenkowski revolt.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: I think...\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Let me just ask Bob Novak this. Bob, Jeff Garron (ph), the Democratic pollster, is a very true guy, he's done a lot of polling (UNINTELLIGIBLE)...\n\n\n\nNOVAK: He's a big Democrat, so...\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: I said, Democratic, I said, Democratic pollster. He said there are two things that seniors want. They want predictability and simplicity. And that this legislation involves complexity and unpredictability, and...\n\n\n\nNOVAK: Well, that, I heard that on the Senate floor over and over again. But the most, the most, the most...\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Oh, sorry, Bob.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: ... the most...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCARLSON: You're boring him, Mark. NOVAK: ... the most, the most interesting...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nNOVAK: ... thing was that this bipartisan great huge majority, which I always distrust bipartisan bills, somebody sold out if there's a bipartisan bill, but it almost came undone on what issue? Why did Teddy Kennedy get ready for a filibuster? Because of means testing, of saying that the rich people, like Mark Shields, would have to -- would not get the same benefits as poor people.\n\n\n\nWhy was Teddy Kennedy opposed to that? Because he loves the rich? No, because they know that this -- if you get this on a basis of a means testing, which it should be, it cut -- it begins to look like welfare, which it is.\n\n\n\nCARLSON: Exactly, and that's what...\n\n\n\nHUNT: I love to hear to hear Bob Novak...\n\n\n\nCARLSON: Yes.\n\n\n\nHUNT: I love to hear Bob Novak...\n\n\n\nCARLSON: And (UNINTELLIGIBLE)...\n\n\n\nHUNT: ... preaching class warfare...\n\n\n\nCARLSON: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) and Mark...\n\n\n\nHUNT: ... go, Brother Novak.\n\n\n\nCARLSON: ... and Mark -- and Mark...\n\n\n\nHUNT: And I want to tell you one more thing too...\n\n\n\nCARLSON: Yes, wait...\n\n\n\nHUNT: ... is, if you get this baby enacted, if this gets on the table, Kate is right, it is going to be good. I think Bush will get credit in 2004.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Yes, he will.\n\n\n\nHUNT: But afterwards, they'll go through the (UNINTELLIGIBLE) thing, and you can build on this, and John McCain and Kate are right.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: It'll be huge.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nNOVAK: It'll be huge.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nHUNT: ... tax cut. CARLSON: But this is why Kennedy did that, is that Republicans have vowed at one time or another to make Medicare wither on the vine and make it for the very sick and the very poor. And if you means- test it, it's the beginning.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: It should be means-tested.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: I hate bipartisan bills like the Civil Rights Act of 19...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCARLSON: Oh, how (UNINTELLIGIBLE).\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Next on Capital Gang, can Howard Dean be nominated for president?\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Welcome back.\n\n\n\nFormer Vermont governor Howard Dean officially announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nHOWARD DEAN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I speak not only for my candidacy, I speak for a new American century and a new generation of Americans, both young people and young at heart...\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: The day before his announcement, he was asked by NBC's Tim Russert about his previous advocacy of reduced Social Security and Medicare benefits.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, MEET THE PRESS, NBC)\n\n\n\nDEAN: That was the middle of har -- I mean, I don't recall saying that, but I'm sure I did.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: At a Democratic fund raiser later in the week, Dean joked about his own combative reputation.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDEAN: Let me say how delighted I am to have all my opponents here in one room, so I can apologize to each and every one of you...\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Dean finished first this week in an online poll.\n\n\n\nMargaret Carlson, is it time to take Howard Dean seriously as a possible Democratic nominee for president?\n\n\n\nCARLSON: Seriously, in that it may be Dean versus one of the others. He's second in New Hampshire, third in Iowa. He raised over $2 million largely on the Internet in one quarter.\n\n\n\nHe's got a few things going against him. For a straight talker, he doesn't always give a straight answer, and some of that was obvious on Tim Russert, when he said things like he -- It's good that I apologized, but he quibbled over whether had had to apologize to Bob Graham.\n\n\n\nAnd then saying he'd have people for that sort of thing for the questions he didn't have an answer to, which worked for George Bush in 2000, but I don't think works now after 9/11, when you really want your presidents not to be frat boys but to be really serious.\n\n\n\nAnd he does have the anti-war problem, and, you know, even the most antiwar people kind of agree that it's good thing that Saddam Hussein is gone, and he said, Oh, I suppose that's a good thing. That hurt him.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Kate O'Beirne.\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: I don't disagree with Margaret about his prospects. Much can happen, but I sort of like Howard Dean's chances. She's also right, his back -- his defenders and fans call him a true believer. He's more of an equivicator. I mean, he's flipping around on balanced budget amendment and Social Security and the death penalty and gay marriage.\n\n\n\nSo he's not much of a straight talker. And he comes across as angry and prickly. But look, the Democratic base is angry, and I think he well represents their mood, and there are a whole lot of them pessimistic about the chances of any Democrat knocking off a popular George Bush, and I think Howard Dean appeals to the death with dignity Democrats who would rather go down with a true believer, as they see it, like Howard Dean, than a Bush-lite candidate.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: You know, I hear a lot of talk in town about this Bush reelection. Bush's reelect score now is down to 50 in the polls, which is hardly the kind of thing that you'd say the guy's going to Mount Rushmore in his second term.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: (UNINTELLIGIBLE)...\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: Well, but Ronald Reagan's at this point...\n\n\n\nNOVAK: He's got, he's got...\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: ... in his term.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: ... an approval rating over 65. (UNINTELLIGIBLE) I don't think George Bush's reelection is assured by any means.\n\n\n\nHUNT: Oh, no. NOVAK: But I do, I do believe that the Howard Dean thing is just absolutely one of the most delightful developments, because the party establishment hates him, that's why they're so...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nNOVAK: ... they're so -- yes, they're so sensitive to his criticism. He's an outsider, he's a guy from the people's republic of Vermont. I mean, the interesting thing to me is that he may win the New Hampshire primary. And if he wins the New Hampshire primary, anything can happen.\n\n\n\nHUNT: Boy, I hope this doesn't mean that Bob's deserting Al Sharpton.\n\n\n\nBut Robert's absolutely right, the political establishment hates him. You know, he was criticized on that Meet the Press performance, for instance, for saying that, he was asked how many active duty troops we had, he said between 1 and 2 million, we have 1.5...\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Yes.\n\n\n\nHUNT: ... how many do we have in Iraq, he said 135,000, it was 146. George Bush wouldn't have done anywhere that well three years ago.\n\n\n\nI don't think he'll be a finalist. I think he'll be a factor. The finalist will be Kerry, Gephardt, Lieberman, two of those three. I think the most interesting political question right now is whether Dick Gephardt can get the AFL-CIO endorsement.\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: (UNINTELLIGIBLE)...\n\n\n\nNOVAK: But he's got, he's got more, more oomph than they do, than the guys you mention, don't you agree with that?\n\n\n\nHUNT: I think with the war over...\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Just a second, Bob.\n\n\n\nHUNT: ... (UNINTELLIGIBLE)...\n\n\n\nNOVAK: It's all right.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: You've talked too damn much tonight. Let's just -- I think Howard Dean is the most intriguing candidate thus far. He certainly has lighted the strongest bonfire and got more people involved in his candidacy. And let's be very frank about it, I mean, he was speaking for the followership and membership of the Democratic Party on their opposition to the war against Iraq, and...\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: He sure was.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: ... it ain't looking too bad right now. I think... CARLSON: Well, you know, Democrats want an angry populist, but they don't want a nasty populist, and I think he's going to have to tone that down a little...\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: OK.\n\n\n\nCARLSON: ... to become the Bush fighter. They want, they want somebody going against him.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: And if Bob Novak really enjoys antiestablishment candidates that drive the party establishment, I'm surprised you didn't embrace John McCain more.\n\n\n\nComing up on the second of CAPITAL GANG...\n\n\n\nCARLSON: (UNINTELLIGIBLE).\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: ... our Newsmaker of the Week is the French ambassador in Washington, Jean-David Levitte. Beyond the Beltway looks at Iran as an emerging nuclear power with Howard -- Harvard scholar Jim Walsh. And our Outrage of the Week, that's all after the latest news headlines.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n(NEWSBREAK)\n\n\n\nANNOUNCER: Live from Washington, THE CAPITAL GANG.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Welcome back to the second half of CAPITAL GANG.\n\n\n\nI'm Mark Shields with the full GANG, Al Hunt, Robert Novak, Kate O'Beirne, and Margaret Carlson.\n\n\n\nOur Newsmaker of the Week, Jean-David Levitte, French ambassador to the United States.\n\n\n\nJean-David Levitte, age 57, residence Washington, D.C., law degree and graduate, the Institute of Political Science in Paris.\n\n\n\nEntered French foreign service in 1970, the staff of President Giscard d'Estaing from 1975 to 1981. Staff of President Chirac from 1995 to 2000, ambassador to the United Nations 2000 to 2002, and since then, French ambassador to the United States.\n\n\n\nAl Hunt sat down with Ambassador Levitte at the French embassy in Washington earlier this week.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nHUNT: Mr. Ambassador, U.S.-French relations deteriorated badly over the war with Iraq. Is it still at a low point?\n\n\n\nJEAN-DAVID LEVITTE, FRENCH AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES: No. I think now the situation has improved. The two presidents, President Bush and President Chirac, met in Evian during the G-8 summit. The two leaders have decided to put aside their difference over Iraq, to work together to give a boost to the Middle East process, to work together on the fight against terrorism, which is your number one priority and our number one priority, to try to solve the issues of North Korea and Iran together.\n\n\n\nHUNT: Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is canceling U.S.-French military exercises. He specifically disinvited the French from a September conference of Air Force commanders. Your reaction?\n\n\n\nLEVITTE: We have a wonderful cooperation between the U.S. and French armies in the Balkans, in Afghanistan, where we have troops deployed in Kabul, and special forces with yours on the border with Pakistan. Few days ago, our troops helped 100 American citizens to get out of Liberia.\n\n\n\nHUNT: Have you protested Mr. Rumsfeld's action on the September conference?\n\n\n\nLEVITTE: It is his decision. We'll respect it.\n\n\n\nHUNT: Iraqi reconstruction, will France contribute money?\n\n\n\nLEVITTE: Yes, we will participate, and we have said so, with our European partners, because we need to give a chance to the Iraqi people to rebuild their country, to build democracy. We considered this war was not necessary, but the war is over.\n\n\n\nHUNT: Isn't it only natural, then, that most of the big rebuilding contracts go to American firms?\n\n\n\nLEVITTE: We don't see Iraq as a pie to be shared. For us, it's a burden to be shared. It will be very costly. So it's either the American taxpayer or the world community.\n\n\n\nHUNT: Mr. Ambassador, final Iraq question. Do you believe that the failure so far to find any weapons of mass destruction, especially any nuclear capability, is a vindication of the French position?\n\n\n\nLEVITTE: I would say simply, it's a vindication of the credibility of the U.N. inspections. Now we should have a second look on the credibility of the U.N. inspections. And I think it's important for other issues. Look at Iran, look at North Korea. If we could deploy U.N. inspections in these two countries, it would be a good use for you and for us.\n\n\n\nHUNT: America dominates the world today, militarily, economically, and even politically. Is that inherently a good thing, or is it, in the French view, inherently destabilizing?\n\n\n\nLEVITTE: No, it is not destabilizing. No, what is important to understand is that we are in a dangerous world. So in that world, which is dangerous, it's good news to have the American military might.\n\n\n\nWhat we want to achieve in Europe is a more coherent European capacity in terms of difference. We are too weak. We have to solve the crisis next door to the European borders. Bosnia, Kosovo, are two examples where we failed, and we had to ask you to come to help us.\n\n\n\nNow, economically I would argue that we have a strong European capacity, economic force. We have the euro, and it's good news for America.\n\n\n\nHUNT: On a personal note, you presented your credentials to the White House a little more than six months ago. It's been a very turbulent time. How have you been treated in Washington?\n\n\n\nLEVITTE: It seems to me it was six years ago, but at the same time, I must pay tribute to the courtesy of all my interlocutors. It's wonderful to be an ambassador in Washington. It's wonderful to travel coast to coast to explain the French position, because there is always a respectful and friendly debate. We may disagree, but we are friends.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Al Hunt, was the ambassador being unrealistically optimistic about relations between the United States and France?\n\n\n\nHUNT: Mark, he was being very diplomatic, and he is a very effective diplomat. Tell you something interesting, I think the differences between the United States and France are far more profound than the differences between the United States and Germany.\n\n\n\nIn doing research for this interview, it became clear to me that George Bush actually sort of likes Chirac, and he can't stand Schroeder. Now, this is a guy who personal relations matter. I just -- I don't know what it means, but it's interesting.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Bob Novak.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: I think the United States and France, when all is said and done, with all this biting -- backbiting, have too much in common to stay alienated. And you may even see French troops before too long in Iraq.\n\n\n\nCARLSON: Ambassador Levitte should invite the Congress and, say, THE CAPITAL GANG over for French fries so that can be renamed from freedom fries, and all will be forgiven.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Kate?\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: I'm not sure, Bob, that France and America do have that much in common in the post-cold war world. It does strike me that the French project, regardless of what the ambassador diplomatically says, is to organize the European Union as a counterweight to America power and prestige. That puts him at odds with us.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: We wouldn't have won the Revolution without them. I'm always be grateful to the French for that.\n\n\n\nComing up, the CAPITAL GANG classic, when the Supreme Court ruled against affirmative action in 1997. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Welcome back.\n\n\n\nFive and one-half years ago, the Supreme Court let stand a vote by Californians to prohibit racial preferences imposed by state policy. But the House Judiciary Committee the same week voted down a bill to end racial preferences.\n\n\n\nThe committee's chairman, Republican Henry Hyde of Illinois, was our guest as THE CAPITAL GANG discussed this issue on November 8, 1997.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, November 8, 1997)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Bob Novak, is affirmative action in trouble, or is it making a political comeback?\n\n\n\nNOVAK: Mark, the American people hate racial preferences. It's a great issue for the Republicans, it's a terrible issue for the president. He's on the wrong place. But they're -- it -- with a -- playing a losing hand is dealt a losing hand on this. He is playing the race card.\n\n\n\nREP. HENRY HYDE (R-IL), CHAIR, JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: There is general accord, agreement, among Republicans that quotas and set- asides and preferences are unconstitutional, they're wrong. But they're always saying, This isn't the time to bring it forward.\n\n\n\nHUNT: Affirmative action divides this country right down the middle. California disapproved it 54-46. Houston approved it 54-46.\n\n\n\nWe had a poll last week, Washington Journal poll, 48-43 for. The country divides in half.\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: The days of race preferences are numbered. The public, by 80 percent, hates them. The courts are increasingly suspicious of them. The man who's on the side of Republicans here...\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Al Hunt, is it now obvious that these predictions, and frank predictions, of the death of racial preference were somewhat greatly exaggerated?\n\n\n\nHUNT: Yes, it is, Mark, because affirmative action works, as we can see from George Bush's endorsement of the Supreme Court decision this week.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Bob Novak.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: I think those -- the statements that Kate and I made were exactly right. People still hate racial preferences. But the elite opinion drives the Supreme Court and the media.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Margaret. CARLSON: I think it works. It worked for Justice Thomas, Justice O'Connor. I don't want to speak for Kate, but I wouldn't be on this panel without it, so I think it's a good thing.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Well, you're awfully very attractive and smart, too. And so are you, Kate.\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: Race preferences...\n\n\n\nHUNT: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) Bob?\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: No...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCARLSON: Yes, Bob is so (UNINTELLIGIBLE)...\n\n\n\nNOVAK: (UNINTELLIGIBLE)?\n\n\n\nCARLSON: Yes.\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: Race preferences...\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: If we had any judgment.\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: ... Bob's right, the public doesn't like race preferences. Blacks do not like race preferences. But they're not imposed through the democratic system, they're adopted by the elite. And they necessarily engage in racial stereotyping and a racial stigmatizing that the public wisely rejects.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Last word, Kate O'Beirne.\n\n\n\nNext on CAPITAL GANG, Beyond the Beltway. Is Iran going nuclear? We'll be joined by Jim Walsh of Harvard, an authority on weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Welcome back.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. government continued to voice alarm about Iran.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCONDOLEEZZA RICE, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Iran has certain obligations. And what the United States is saying is that we have long believed that Iran might be using its civilian nuclear program for cover for efforts to build a military program.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Student demonstrations in Iran attracted the attention of the president.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is the beginnings of people expressing themselves toward a free Iran, which I think is positive.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Iranian authorities warned the U.S. not to take military action against Iran.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nMOHAMMAD KHATAMI, PRESIDENT OF IRAN (through translator): We know our right is to get access to advanced nuclear knowledge and its advantages for peace. Therefore, we don't accept any condition...\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Joining us now from Los Angeles is Jim Walsh, executive director of Managing the Atom Project at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.\n\n\n\nThanks for being with us, Jim.\n\n\n\nJIM WALSH, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: Happy to be here, Mark.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Jim, does its nuclear development make Iran a threat to the United States?\n\n\n\nWALSH: Well, if we're talking about nuclear weapons, certainly nuclear weapons are inherently dangerous, and so it's a serious business. But I also think we have to keep it in perspective. We have to put it in context.\n\n\n\nSo is it the most dangerous nuclear threat in the world today? No, I think most of my colleagues would say that Pakistan, which is crawling with terrorists, has nuclear weapons already, and has given nuclear technology to North Korea.\n\n\n\nThat's a bigger nuclear-related risk right now than Iran.\n\n\n\nThe other thing you should ask when you want to put this into context is, how do we weigh the strengths of Iran versus the U.S.? And on every measure, the U.S. is far, far stronger than Iran, 37 times as big a military force as Iran does. We have thousands of nuclear weapons, Iran has zero nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\nSo yes, it's serious, but we shouldn't panic, and we shouldn't provoke a crisis when there isn't need for one.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Bob Novak.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: Do you think, Jim, that the very strong statements by the members of the administration -- we just had one by Dr. Rice -- are serving to provoke a crisis with the Iranian regime?\n\n\n\nWALSH: Well, I do think that they are probably unhelpful. There's been a lot of talk about destabilizing Iran, having American- made solutions to the Iranian problem. And I think that's counterproductive, because what it does, it strengthens the hand of the hard-liners, the folks we want to lose here, it actually helps them.\n\n\n\nAnd the second thing it does is, it increases the incentive that Iran has to seek a nuclear weapon in the first place. So I think even if you want to change that regime, the last thing you want to do is going around talking about it out loud in a really loose way.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Margaret Carlson.\n\n\n\nCARLSON: Jim, by the time the United States took action against Iraq, there were U.N. resolutions that had been violated, Iraq had invaded Kuwait, and Iran, for that matter. Iran has not been an aggressive country, although it -- now it does seem to have a nuclear program that could be converted to military use.\n\n\n\nWhat does the United States have? Does it -- I don't believe there's a U.N. resolution calling for inspections. What framework does the United States have for putting pressure on Iran to cut back on its nuclear program?\n\n\n\nWALSH: Well, it's a good question, Margaret. You know, where is the U.S. leverage here? And it's certainly not in something like trade sanctions, because we don't do a lot of trade with Iran, and we don't recognize them as a country. It's really the nonproliferation regime where we have the most leverage.\n\n\n\nWhy? Because we can request inspections of undeclared facilities. We can require that the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, go police and keep an eye on Iran.\n\n\n\nSo I think that's a powerful tool. And I think we also want to be trying to strengthen the nonproliferation constituencies within Iran. Iran is nothing but a giant argument. These guys argue over everything. There are thousand divisions, a thousand factions, and we want to make sure the factions that oppose nuclear weapons are stronger than those that want nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Kate O'Beirne.\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: Jim, beyond being persuaded of the value of having a nuclear capability, what lessons do you think Iran drew from the recent action in Iraq, that they can count on a divided world to stall around until they do develop a capacity? Or that America will act against world opinion if need be?\n\n\n\nWALSH: Well, it's a great question. I can't really get into the minds of the Iranians. I've met with Iranians to talk about nuclear weapons in Rome and in Vienna, but it's a hard thing to try to speculate on their motivations. It seems to me two things are possible, and we'll just have to see.\n\n\n\nOne is that the U.S. action in Iraq makes them feel more secure and makes them feel like they better not go down the path towards nuclear weapons, or they'll get whacked.\n\n\n\nThe other possibility here, and some people say this is through North Korea, is that the lesson they'll learn is, We better build our nuclear weapon as soon as possible. The mistake that Iraq made was being sort of betwixt and between. We better get our nuclear weapon to protect us.\n\n\n\nI don't know which of those lessons or other lessons they may have learned. But the more we threaten them, I think the greater the incentive that they will seek nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Al Hunt.\n\n\n\nHUNT: Jim, the Russians have been very helpful in getting materials to the Iranian nuclear program. The Bush administration has said recently that the Russians now appreciate the danger and are being more cooperative with our interests in not getting as much material to the -- to Iran. Is that true? And will that make a difference?\n\n\n\nWALSH: Well, I think it is true. I think it will make a difference. But this has been a struggle for some years now. I think President Putin has made clear that he wants to be careful of -- about any transfers or any relationship with Iran with respect to nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\nBut Menadim (ph) and other bureaucratic actors may have different views. So I think it's a tough one, but I think they are serious about it.\n\n\n\nEven more important, I think, is perhaps the role of the Europeans. As I said, we don't do much trade with Iran. They're sort of persona non grata. But the Europeans have a lot of investment in Iran, have a long history of Iranian relations. And the E.U. has called on Iran to adopt a more aggressive set of rules for inspection. And I think the Europeans have a big and a positive role to play here.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Hey, Jim Walsh, thank you very much for being with us. It's been enormously helpful.\n\n\n\nTHE GANG will be back with the Outrages of the Week.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Now for the Outrage of the Week.\n\n\n\nThanks to Democratic Congresswoman Marcy Kaptor of Ohio, we now know that conservatives don't always mean it when they swear allegiance to the free market. How else to explain Title VIII in the House prescription drug bill, which forbid the secretary of health and human services from negotiating with the world's biggest drug companies to get a better price for prescriptions like the VA does for veterans for the nation's seniors?\n\n\n\nMarcy Kaptor is right. By using free market pressure, we could save taxpayers and seniors billions. Bob Novak.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: One senator after another took the floor in praise of Strom Thurmond, dead at age 100. The oldest combat officer in the Normandy invasion, governor of South Carolina, carrying four states for president, elected to the Senate in a write-in, longest speech in Senate history, first Southern senator with a black aide, first Deep Southern Republican senator.\n\n\n\nWell, wait a minute. Didn't his colleagues force Trent Lott out as majority leader because he said nice things about old Strom? Maybe somebody owes Senator Lott an apology.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Margaret Carlson.\n\n\n\nCARLSON: Mark, for less than a rounding error in the tax cut going to millionaires, President Bush could save Americorps' 50,000 volunteers. Two hundred corporation executives ran a full-page ad in The New York Times this week urging just that.\n\n\n\nIn California alone, volunteers, who build low-cost housing, tear down crack dens, and clean up parks, will drop from 6,000 to 825 without new funds.\n\n\n\nOnce derided as welfare for yuppies, the program now has strong bipartisan support in Congress. Bush just needs to recall there's more to being president than cutting taxes.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Kate O'Beirne.\n\n\n\nO'BEIRNE: This week, The New York Times ran a boldfaced lie on its front page, literally. Its obituary marked the death of former Senator Thurmond, who changed his position on race issues decades ago, by falsely labeling him a foe of integration. This politician's support for racial equality was far more consequential than his behavior in the distant past.\n\n\n\nSuch is the treatment of Republicans on race issues. You don't imagine that Senator Robert Byrd's obituary would be titled, Death of a Klansman, do you?\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: Al Hunt.\n\n\n\nHUNT: Mark, Governor Thurmond's 1948 presidential run as an arch-segregationist was shameful. However, unlike some of his peers, Strom in his 30 -- in his last 30 years adapted to a changing and a much better America on race.\n\n\n\nOn a personal note, his much younger wife and my wife were sorority sisters, and he once counseled me that we ought to have a boy, followed by a girl, then a boy, and finally a girl, the way he did.\n\n\n\nWhen I looked baffled, he invited me to come by his office, and he would explain how it's done.\n\n\n\nI regret I never made that visit.\n\n\n\nSHIELDS: This is Mark Shields saying goodbye for THE CAPITAL GANG.\n\n\n\nComing up next, CNN PRESENTS: The Road to Baghdad.

Similarly, neither Mr. Perkins nor the Company has any affiliation whatsoever with Rihanna.\n\nThe pair launched Fenty Entertainment, a production and talent company, in 2017.\n\nRihanna's popular Fenty Beauty line of cosmetics also launched in 2017.

(Photo by Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Fortune)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nTwo years after she signed with the network amid much fanfare, Megyn Kelly and NBC have officially parted ways.\n\nThe split was announced on Friday ending a drawn-out and acrimonious exit that was put in motion in the fall after Kelly defended Halloween costumes that incorporate blackface during a segment on her 9 a.m. talk show.\n\nThe parties have resolved their differences, and Megyn Kelly is no longer an employee of NBC, the network said Friday night.\n\nTalks about ending Megyn Kelly Today started before the blackface remarks, due to underperforming ratings and growing tensions between Kelly and NBC executives. But the Halloween controversy sealed her fate, according to sources familiar with the matter. Her talk show was cancelled within days, and her lawyer began negotiating the terms of her exit.\n\nKelly is halfway through a three-year contract worth a total of $69 million – an eye-popping sum even by the inflated standards of television news.\n\nBowing to the terms of the contract, NBC will pay Kelly the remaining sum of money, believed to total about $30 million, two of the sources said.\n\nKelly will be subject to an industry standard nondisparagement clause, limiting what she can say about her time at NBC and her interactions with NBC executives. Television contracts typically include language to protect both sides in the event of an ugly breakup.\n\nBut representatives for the host and the network declined to comment on the exact terms of her exit.\n\nKelly is not believed to be subject to any noncompete clause, which means that in theory she can join another network right away, the sources said.\n\nBut Kelly does not currently have an agent, and there is no indication that she has another job lined up.\n\nWhen approached by celebrity photographers on the street in New York City on Thursday, and asked will we see you on TV this year, Kelly said. You will definitely see me back on.\n\nA representative for Kelly declined to comment further.\n\nFriday's announcement marks a premature end to a partnership that ultimately failed to elevate the anchor's stature and the network's ratings. And the hostility surrounding her departure stands in sharp contrast to the optimism that greeted her arrival at NBC in January 2017.\n\nAfter 12 years at Fox News, Kelly was one of the most sought-after stars in the television news world, drawing interest from a number of networks. Fox reportedly offered her a new contract worth more than $20 million a year, but Kelly was eager to shed the combative style she honed at the conservative network.\n\nBarbara Walters has retired, Kelly told Variety in 2015, when she was still at Fox. Oprah has moved to the OWN network and is doing a different thing now. So why not me?\n\nAt NBC, Kelly hoped she would be able to fulfill the softer role she had long envisioned for herself. The network had ambitious plans for Kelly, handing her hosting duties for a Sunday evening news magazine and the 9 a.m. hour of the Today show. But the marriage was awkward from the jump.\n\nSunday Night with Megyn Kelly was poorly received and ended after a short run in the summer of 2017. And Megyn Kelly Today was defined by disappointing ratings and awkward moments, with the host sometimes seeming ill-suited for the bubbly world of morning television.\n\nKelly won plaudits for aggressively covering cases of sexual misconduct when the #MeToo movement became an international story in late 2017.\n\nBut her coverage – especially of the case involving Today show co-host Matt Lauer – rankled some of her colleagues.\n\nThis contributed to tensions between Kelly and NBC executives, including NBC News chair Andy Lack, who invested tens of millions of dollars in her hiring.\n\nLast September, Kelly publicly contradicted part of Lack's account about why NBC opted not to air Ronan Farrow's reporting about Harvey Weinstein.\n\nBy that point, there were already questions about how much longer Kelly's 9 a.m. show would last. She had few allies inside NBC, and more than a few detractors.\n\nHer lowest moment came on October 23, when she led an on-air discussion about offensive Halloween costumes.\n\nKelly said it was acceptable when she was a kid to don black face as long as you were dressing up as, like, a character. And she defended a reality TV star who took heat last year for dressing up as Diana Ross.\n\nAnd I don't know, I felt like who doesn't love Diana Ross? Kelly said. She wants to look like Diana Ross for one day. I don't know how, like, that got racist on Halloween.\n\nThe backlash to Kelly was swift and immediate, exceeding the outrage she generated for her remarks years ago about Santa's race. Kelly apologized to her staff that afternoon. And she apologized on her show the following day, saying the country feels so divided and I have no wish to add to that pain and offense.\n\nMany of her Today show colleagues were not satisfied. Kelly drew forceful on-air denunciations from Al Roker and Craig Melvin, two African-American hosts on Today. And Lack condemned Kelly's comments at a town hall, a clear sign that she had lost the support of the executive who helped woo her to the network.\n\nShe didn't appear on the network again. Three days after her blackface remarks on air, NBC announced that it had canceled Megyn Kelly Today.\n\nTalks about the terms of her exit soon turned contentious, with Kelly's attorney Bryan Freedman accusing Lack of leaking details about the negotiations. NBC fired back, saying the network had respected the confidentiality of the process while Freedman has repeatedly commented to the media throughout the negotiations.\n\nBoth sides then reached a quiet resolution, which was announced on Friday night.

Story highlights When she was 12, Muneera Begum was sold into marriage with a 70-year-old man Police say there are hundreds of cases like hers in Hyderabad's Old City These crimes involve a network of human traffickers, including agents, brokers, and clerics\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThat night he took me with him. He forced himself on me. I was crying. [He said] I've bought you, I can do whatever I want. I've given your parents money, I can use you for as long as I like. Keep your mouth shut.\n\nMuneera Begum, now aged 19, lives in Hyderabad, India. She says she was just 12 years old when her parents sold her into a forced marriage with a man from Oman. He was aged 70.\n\nShe calls the so-called wedding night torture.\n\nI wasn't educated and I couldn't understand anything that was going on, she said. I had a childishness in me.\n\nShe says that for two months, he kept her locked in a room, using her repeatedly for sex.\n\nIf he had to go anywhere he would lock me from the inside, come back later and then again that torture would start, she said.\n\nPHOTO: Muhammad Lila Muneera Begum, left, was sold by her mother into a sham marriage.\n\nPolice say there are hundreds of cases like Begum's in Hyderabad's Old City. Young girls from poor neighborhoods, sold by their parents without their consent, to elderly tourists who come here looking for sex.\n\nIn our investigation, we visited a number of shelters, meeting victim after victim, all with horrific stories of physical and sexual abuse. These crimes involve a network of human traffickers, with agents, brokers, and clerics all part of the scheme.\n\nPreying on poor families\n\nAgents are located in several countries in the Middle East and Africa. They know brokers in Hyderabad (the city with the largest Muslim population by percentage in India) who approach poor families and convince them to sell their underage daughters because they need the money.\n\nThe agents have clients, usually elderly men, who then travel to Hyderabad. There, the broker shows them the girls and they choose the ones they want.\n\nRead: Girls smuggled into China and sold as brides\n\nA religious cleric who is also a part of the criminal network then signs a wedding certificate (which has no legal standing) and a post-dated divorce certificate at the same time. But according to one of the most senior religious authorities in Hyderabad, Islamic law requires a girl's consent before she can be married.\n\nAfter a few weeks or months of using the girl for sex, the client leaves her, never to come back. Some of the girls are gang raped. Many are given drugs by their buyers, making them helpless, unable to stop what is happening.\n\n01:06 - Source: CNN #MyFreedomDay: What does freedom mean to you?\n\nIt's hard to understand how a mother could sell her daughter, but Begum's mother explains her decision. She says her family of five live crammed into one tiny room in one of the poorest parts of Hyderabad. She says her husband was an alcoholic and they had no money, and she believed that selling her daughter would improve Begum's life, as well as the family's.\n\nWe thought by doing it we could afford a small house and live there, explained her mother. Our life and our daughter's life would have become good. That's what we thought we should do.\n\n'My dream is that every girl should be happy'\n\nNow Begum has a young daughter, fathered by the man she was forced to marry. When she became pregnant after just two months, he divorced her over the phone. She says she was so distraught, she tried killing herself.\n\nI used to cry a lot, she said. I was in so much pain I thought my life was useless. For the last time I tried to cut my wrist.\n\nThen she was taken in by a local NGO called Shaheen, which helps prevent young girls from being sold into forced marriages.\n\n05:20 - Source: CNN Rescuing girls from sham marriages\n\nShaheen also rescues girls and helps rehabilitate them, teaching them skills like tailoring, applying henna or how to use computers, all to help them become financially independent.\n\nJameela Nishat began Shaheen more than 20 years ago and says she has helped more than 100 girls directly, and almost 1,000 indirectly. My dream is that every girl should be happy and enjoy her life to the maximum, and feel free, she said.\n\nAfter she went to Shaheen, Begum filed a police case and the authorities arrested the middleman involved in selling her. It's taken years to recover, but now, she's vowing to never let anything like that happen to anyone else.\n\nThe way I got caught up, I don't want other girls to face the same [thing], said Begum. In my heart, I feel the pain I faced; the next person shouldn't face that pain.
Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success and co-author with Peter Eisner of The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) This is the big takeaway from the impeachment and trial of Donald Trump: The President can do as he damn well pleases and, when forced to take a stand, lots of senators will let him.\n\nLike Trump, they seemingly believe they can abandon the duty of providing oversight of the executive branch and suffer no consequence. On the campaign trail, we should expect them to follow the President's lead, spouting gibberish to avoid accountability. They'll likely do it with confidence after checking the recent Gallup poll that finds him at a new high of 49% approval.\n\nThe reality we face now is one in which Trump's extreme brand of political leadership, one based on tribalism and impunity, is mainstream. He told us this was coming when, during the 2016 campaign, he declared , I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters.\n\nThis was not so much a metaphor as a declaration of a paradigm shift that he helped to create through a lifetime of norm busting that paved the way for his political takeover.\n\nThe Trump whom America got to know in the 1980s was a conspicuous narcissist who gleefully embodied the greed-is-good mantra of the Reagan years. Next came the sex scandal and family breakup that Trump -- of the 1990s -- turned into tabloid entertainment. Finally, we got The Apprentice Trump of the 2000s who humiliated contestants one by one until the last person standing got the questionable reward of a one-year job working for Trump.\n\nIn each iteration of his personality, Trump turned an ugly trait into a powerful tool and grew his following of fans, who were thrilled by his extremism. Sure, as a rich and famous guy, Trump had the means to make himself exempt from the norms that governed the rest of us. And if you liked him, you could revel in the sight of him breaking all the rules.\n\nIt would be unfair to blame Trump alone for the way that the extreme became acceptable. We can also thank those on Wall Street who made rapacious capitalism the norm and televangelists who demonstrated that nothing -- not marriage, not faith, not the Ten Commandments -- is sacred anymore. In politics, Bill Clinton's personal weakness was joined by the partisan opportunism of House Republicans to give us an impeachment process that was more scandalous than wrongdoing -- lying about an affair -- that it was supposed to punish.\n\nThe Clinton impeachment signaled that the rancorous politics-as-war practiced by the then-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich was here to stay. Gingrich, we should remember, admitted to being an unfaithful husband and seemingly believed he could get away with hypocritically driving Clinton from office because of his moral failing. He almost did it.\n\nAfter Gingrich, came George W. Bush's political adviser Karl Rove, who saw that some Americans were uncomfortable with granting their gay neighbors equal rights and weaponized this anxiety to benefit Bush.\n\nRove didn't invent the culture war brand of politics, but he cleverly helped get anti-equality measures onto state ballots in order to drive his target voters to the polls.\n\nMore recently, current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell demonstrated his disrespect for his colleagues and the office of the President by simply refusing to take up then-President Barack Obama's nomination of the eminently qualified Merrick Garland for a seat on the Supreme Court. McConnell held the spot open so that Trump could fill it, proving his power and shamelessness.\n\nMcConnell, evangelists, stock pumpers and the rest who prioritized winning over decency had roles, too, in setting the stage for presidential candidate Trump. As President, Trump has followed through with a crudely devised and morally repugnant ban on visitors from a number of countries, most of which have a majority Muslim demographic, and by picking fights with athletes who had the temerity to demonstrate their concern for minority rights by quietly kneeling during the National Anthem.\n\nTime and again, the main point of Trump's actions and rhetoric has seemed to be more about the creation of a cult of personality than addressing the nation's needs. At home, he has wasted time and money chasing a phantom voter fraud problem while failing to devote proper attention to the real threat of foreign election interference which Russia employed in an attempt to help Trump gain office in 2016.\n\nAt the impeachment trial, Senate Republicans heard how Trump had abused his office by conditioning war aid to Ukraine on a promise to announce an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. (Trump has denied any quid pro quo.) They heard, too, about the President's stonewalling every effort Congress made to learn what happens inside his administration.\n\nIn refusing to hand over documents and preventing officials from testifying, he obstructed Congress and defied its rightful role as a coequal branch of government. Just as McConnell previously disrespected the executive branch, Trump has disrespected the legislative one.\n\nThe legal version of Trump's get-away-with-anything method came with the hall of mirrors defense raised by the President's team of lawyers. During the proceedings they abandoned the idea that the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was, as Trump claimed perfect, instead saying that even if misconduct occurred it was OK because he believes his reelection is in the national interest.\n\nFinally, came the assertion that Congress should not investigate a stonewalling president without going to court first. On the very day this defense was raised in the Senate, the administration argued the opposite in a nearby courtroom.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThere, a different set of administration lawyers said Congress should not seek evidence by going to court but via impeachment. After hearing about the hypocrisy in the arguments, people in both the Senate and the courthouse guffawed , but the lawyers continued with their arguments.\n\nAt the impeachment trial, the absurdity of Trump's defenses was exceeded by the way GOP senators seized on them to justify refusing to hear witnesses and evidence. The damage they have done to themselves is exceeded by the cynicism they have sewn in a country where trust is already dangerously scarce.\n\nTrump's escape from accountability, enabled by Senate Republicans, is made all the more awful by the fact that it adds proof to the argument that sincerity is for suckers. The danger in this, of course, is in the anger that can follow when people realize they have been had.
(Mental Floss) -- What do you do when you've just hanged someone for murder, and then their victim pops up alive and healthy a few towns away?\n\nJustice went thataway for some people convicted of murders they didn't commit.\n\n1. Not the Marion type\n\nWilliam Jackson Marion and Jack Cameron met at a Kansas boarding house in 1872. The two men became fast friends and traveling companions, using Cameron's team of horses to go from place-to-place to find work.\n\nAlong their journey, the two made a brief stop in Beatrice, Nebraska to visit Marion's in-laws before moving on. After a few days, however, Marion returned solo, sporting clothes that belonged to Cameron and driving Cameron's horses. Then he left town again.\n\nWeeks later, the body of a man was discovered with three bullet holes in his head. He was also wearing the same outfit that Cameron had worn the day he left town. Marion immediately became the prime suspect and a manhunt began. After 10 years of searching, Marion was finally captured in Kansas.\n\nThe trial and conviction of Jack Marion was seriously abbreviated. Marion's verdict was read after just one hour of deliberation, and he was hanged for his crime on March 25, 1887.\n\nFour years later, Jack Cameron reappeared looking for his old friend. Apparently, he had run to Mexico to avoid a shotgun wedding in Kansas, giving his horses and other possessions to Marion. Now he'd come back to reclaim them.\n\nThe story does end on a (slightly) positive note: Thanks to the work of Marion's grandson, Elbert Marion, Nebraska governor Bob Kerrey granted Jack Marion a posthumous pardon in 1987, 100 years after his execution. Mental Floss: 11 notable presidential pardons\n\n2. The Brothers Boorn\n\nIn May of 1812, when Richard Colvin vanished, speculation amongst the townspeople of Manchester, Vermont, was that his brothers-in-law, Jesse and Stephen Boorn, were responsible. Without evidence of foul play, though, no charges were pressed.\n\nSeven years later, the Boorn Brothers' uncle had a dream in which Richard said he'd been killed and his body buried in an old cellar on the Boorn farm. Upon excavation of the cellar, a penknife and a button were found, both identified as Richard's. But the evidence still wasn't enough to charge the Boorn Brothers. Soon after, when a barn on the Boorn farm burned to the ground, many believed it was arson to cover more evidence. But, again, no charges were filed.\n\nThings finally came to a head, however, when a boy discovered bones under a tree near the Boorn home. While in custody, Jesse confessed that he and his brother had killed Richard. But before the trial began, a closer examination of the bones revealed they weren't even human, but those of an animal. The prosecution carried on, however, for they had the damning testimony of Silas Merrill, a forger, who was Jesse's cellmate.\n\nMerrill said Jesse had implicated himself, Stephen, and their father in Colvin's murder. His testimony mentioned the suspected locations of the crime -- the cellar, the barn, and the tree -- all fitting together in a neat little package. For his cooperation in the case, Silas was set free.\n\nAs the evidence mounted, Stephen confessed as well, telling the same story as Silas, but without implicating his father. The Boorn Brothers were convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 1819. Jesse's sentence would later be commuted to life in prison, but Stephen was set to hang.\n\nRather than sit idly by, Stephen placed an ad in different newspapers explaining his predicament. The ad included a description of Richard Colvin. Amazingly, the thing worked! Someone actually tracked Colvin down, who was alive and well in New Jersey.\n\nThe Boorn Brothers were released from prison and petitioned for compensation from the state. But because they had both confessed to the crime, they received nothing but their freedom. The Boorn case became the first documented wrongful murder conviction in American history. Mental Floss: 8 prolific female serial killers\n\n3. She Gets Convicted\n\nZhang Zaiyu disappeared from Hubei Province in 1994. A few months later, a woman's body was found in a lake and Zhang's family identified it as their missing loved one. Her husband She Zaiyu was arrested for murder.\n\nFor 10 days, She was reportedly denied sleep and received severe beatings until he finally confessed to the crime. Once in court, She said the confession had been coerced and that he was not guilty. He was sentenced to death in late 1994, but four years later his sentence was reduced to 15 years because the courts felt there wasn't sufficient evidence for the death penalty.\n\nThen, in March of 2005, Zhang Zaiyu resurfaced in Hubei. Mrs. Zaiyu claimed to have suffered from mental illness and had wandered away from her home in 1994. She wound up in Shandong Province, living there and even marrying another man.\n\nHer identity was confirmed through DNA testing and her first husband was released from prison 11 years after he had been convicted. He then sued the government and received 700,000 yuan (about $102,650) in compensation.\n\nBut more importantly, She's case - and that of Teng Xingshan -- helped bring about changes to the Chinese judicial system in 2005. Now, capital punishment cases are the sole authority of the Supreme People's Court, which requires more oversight and investigation before executions are carried out.\n\n4. The servant and the bloody shirt\n\nOn August 16, 1660, William Harrison left home in Campden, England, to do business in a nearby town. When he didn't return, his servant, John Perry, went to look for him. Perry found Harrison's shirt covered in blood, along with his hat, which had been slashed by a knife. Harrison, however, was nowhere to be found.\n\nAuthorities immediately suspected Perry, and likely tortured him for answers. He confessed to a conspiracy involving himself, his mother, and his brother. According to his statement, Perry claimed that it was his brother who had actually killed Harrison while attempting to rob him.\n\nDespite the fact that all of Perry's relatives proclaimed their innocence, the entire family was convicted and hanged. Mrs. Perry, who'd also been accused of being a witch, was hanged first.\n\nTwo years later, however, William Harrison returned to England claiming that he had been abducted, taken to Turkey, and sold into slavery. He escaped when his master died, and his return was publicly lauded.\n\nWhile Perry's trial didn't do John Perry (or his family) much good, it did have an impact on future cases. John Perry's story set a legal precedent in England - no body, no crime - that lasted for nearly 300 years.\n\n5. The professional job\n\nIn April 1987, the dismembered body of a woman was dragged from the waters of the Mayang River in central Hunan Province. A young woman, Shi Xiaorong, had been declared missing shortly before the body was found, so police believed she was the victim.\n\nAccording to authorities, the dismemberment looked very professional, so local butcher Teng Xinhshan became a prime suspect. It was speculated that Teng had sex with Shi and killed her when she tried to steal his money. Teng claimed he had never met Shi, but was found guilty and sentenced to death anyway. He was executed in 1989.\n\nThen, in 1993, Shi Xiaorong reappeared saying that she had been tricked and sold into marriage in March 1987. When Teng's relatives learned that Shi was still alive, they sued the judiciary. After the case was reopened, Shi testified that she had never even met Teng, and that he had obviously not killed her. Teng was posthumously exonerated in 2006.\n\n6. Puppy love\n\nIn 1999, 14-year old Natasha Ryan vanished from her Queensland home. No body was ever found, and, after years of searching, her family presumed she was dead. Their fears were confirmed in 2002 when incarcerated serial killer, Leonard Fraser, was secretly recorded in his jail cell confessing that Natasha was one of his many victims.\n\nIn the middle of Fraser's 2003 trial for the murder of four women, including Natasha Ryan, the authorities received a tip that Ryan had been living with her boyfriend, Scott Black, since her disappearance. They raided Black's house, which was less than a half-mile away from her parents' home, and found Natasha hiding in a wardrobe. The charges for Natasha's murder were dropped, though Fraser was sentenced to multiple consecutive life sentences for the other three murders. Mental Floss: 5 celebrity kidnapping plots\n\nAs for Natasha and her boyfriend, he was sentenced to one year in prison for perjury for claiming he didn't know Natasha's whereabouts. He was also fined $3000 and had to pay $16,740 of the costs accrued by police while searching for Natasha. Natasha only had to pay $1,000 fine for causing a false police investigation, though she sold her story to Australian tabloids for much, much more.\n\nThe two married in 2008; both of Natasha's parents attended the ceremony.\n\nFor more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com\n\nEntire contents of this article copyright, Mental Floss LLC.

Written by Manveena Suri, CNN New Delhi\n\nWhen it comes to elaborate nuptials, few can rival the mega-weddings of India's super-rich.\n\nRecent months have seen a slew of high-profile ceremonies, from a rare Bollywood-Hollywood union (Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas) to what could be one of history's most expensive weddings (when Isha Ambani, daughter of Asia's richest man, wed Anand Piramal, the son of a billionaire industrialist).\n\nEye-watering amounts of money were spent on haute couture bridal wear, food from the world's top chefs and opulent palace venues. Ambani and Piramal even splashed out on a private show by Beyoncé.\n\nBut it's not just India's elites. In a country where up to 12 million weddings take place a year, the growing middle classes are increasingly putting on lavish ceremonies to emphasize their status.\n\nIndustry sources estimate that the country's wedding industry is worth $40 billion to $50 billion, representing significant growth from the widely-cited $25.5 billion figure reported in 2012. Around half the gold bought in the country each year is for items used at wedding ceremonies.\n\nWhile weddings can be expensive affairs in any country, in India they are especially important as symbols of strength and status, according to sociologist Parul Bhandari, a visiting scholar at St. Edmund's College, University of Cambridge, who researches wedding cultures, marriage trends, gender and social class.\n\nDeepika Padukone married fellow actor Ranveer Singh in 2018. Credit: errikosandreouphoto/Instagram\n\nFor many societies, particularly India, marriages are more than simply a union between two individuals, she said in a phone interview. A marriage marks the coming together of two families, lineages, and at times, larger groups like whole villages or communities ... Marriage is an important rite (of) passage that signals an individual and their family's status -- economic, social, political, royal.\n\nPushing one's financial limits at a wedding can, of course, be seen as an attempt to achieve higher social status and respect within the wider community.\n\nThe Piramal-Ambani wedding constitutes, in every way, the epitome of a 'Big Fat Indian wedding,' she added, referring to a term commonly used to describe high-profile weddings on social media. (It) was indeed a show of power and money, as much as it was about rituals and traditions.\n\nAccording to Bhandari, the rise of extravagant ceremonies is linked to an increasing penchant for consumerism (and) the influence of Bollywood.\n\nFor those who can afford to host in a spectacular palace, the Indian state of Rajasthan, renowned for its royal heritage, has proven an in-demand wedding destination, according to Bhavnesh Sawhney, director of Mumbai-based wedding planners Wedniksha. Its popularity may continue to grow following the publicity of the Ambani-Piramal and Chopra-Jonas weddings, both of which took place in the northwestern state.\n\nThe royal wedding of the 27th titular head of the Wodeyar dynasty, 24-year-old Yaduveer Chamraja Krishnadatta Wodeyar, and Trishika Kumari, of the Dungarpur dynasty of Rajasthan. The ceremony took place at the Amba Vilas Palace. Credit: STR/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRajasthan is known to uphold many ancient traditions, Sawhney said. And the grandeur of its royal forts and palaces not only serve as a beautiful backdrop but also give an authentic cultural touch to a ceremony.\n\nPeople are now going for quality instead of quantity, said Priyanka Gupta, head wedding planner at My Shaadi Wale Wedding, a Bangalore-based wedding planning company.\n\nEarlier, you might have up to a 1,000 guests, now people are cutting down to 200 to 250 of their closest (friends and family) and holding destination weddings (instead).\n\nGupta puts the average amount spent by an upper-class family at $400 per guest, per day. She speculated that the Chopra-Jonas and Ambani-Piramal weddings may have cost up to $2,000 per guest, per day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 13 Umaid Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur, where Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas tied the knot.

It is India's cultural pride that gives rise to intricate planning, he said.\n\nThese lavish and big Indian weddings are never a one-day affair, he added. Most weddings span from a couple of days to a ten-day celebration.\n\nThis is partly because of the various customs involved. While last year's celebrity weddings made headlines for their extravagance, they were all steeped in Hindu tradition. (For the Ambani-Piramal nuptials, Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan took on the role of emcee, explaining the numerous customs to overseas guests.)\n\nAn Indian Bharwad (shepherd) couple participates in a wedding ceremony in Ahmedabad. Credit: SAM PANTHAKY/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHindu weddings account for around 80% of marriage ceremonies in India, with Sikh, Muslim and Christian nuptials accounting for much of the remainder. While there are regional variations, a number of elaborate rituals have become common to almost all Hindu weddings across the country.\n\nFor instance, pre-wedding celebrations usually include a mehndi (henna) ceremony, held the day before the wedding, during which the bride's hands and feet are decorated with intricate patterns. And even if you can't afford Beyoncé, a sangeet (an evening of music and dance) is now a norm among Indian couples.\n\nOn the morning of the wedding, the bride and groom apply haldi (turmeric, which is mixed with milk into a paste) to their hands and face to ward off evil spirits. The wedding ceremony itself often takes place beneath a mandap, a pavilion embellished with opulent drapes and decorations. This is where the bride and groom pledge their vows (known as the saat phere, or seven circles) around the agni, a holy fire considered a witness to the ceremony.\n\nA Rajasthani woman takes part in a mass wedding ceremony during Akshaya Tritiya festivities in Ahmedabad. Credit: SAM PANTHAKY/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe ritual sees the couple walk around the fire seven times reciting the Hindu pledges of marriage that address strength, prosperity, wisdom, health, offspring and friendship, after which the marriage becomes binding.\n\nAt the end of the ritual, the groom applies sindoor (red vermilion powder) along the parting of his bride's hair and ties a mangalsutra (a bridal necklace) around her neck to signify that she's a married woman.\n\nHindu women usually opt for a sari embroidered with intricate patterns, or a lehenga (a type of long skirt) paired with a matching blouse and dupatta (a long shawl-like scarf that's draped over the head and shoulders).\n\nMeghan's Givenchy bridal dress: Expert opinion\n\nMore broadly, red is a favorite for brides -- especially for Hindu ceremonies. The color symbolizes fertility and prosperity, as well as representing Mars, the planet of marriage in Hindu astrology (although a significant number of brides now wear cream, a color commonly used by Western brides, reflecting a growing modern trend for lighter, pastel shades).\n\nThe timing of ceremonies also reflects nationwide trends: Winter wedding season, which usually runs from November to February, is considered an auspicious period in the Hindu calendar. Couples often turn to the stars, and their zodiac signs, to pick a date that will ensure a long and happy marriage.\n\nPublic spectacles\n\nAll of India's recent mega-weddings -- which also included Deepika Padukone's high-profile marriage to fellow actor Ranveer Singh -- sparked waves of social media reaction from both in and outside India.\n\n(The Ambani-Piramal wedding) has put India on the global map as a place of luxury, opulence and grandeur, Bhandari said of the widespread interest in the December event. It seemed to recapture long-forgotten trends of royal wedding feasts, and in doing so could be seen as a bit misplaced and even 'over the top.'\n\nA Hindu Jain groom assists his bride as the 'Mangal Sutra' -- 'Holy Auspicious Thread.' Credit: SAM PANTHAKY/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAmid public fascination, the ceremonies have also attracted criticism for being overly ostentatious. Such shows of excess stand in stark contrast to the poverty and poor living conditions found in places across India.\n\nA representative for the Ambanis told CNN that the family set up a bazaar to showcase the work of local artisans. They claim to have donated enough food to feed over 5,000 local people three meals a day for four days.\n\nLamentably, today's elites seem more keen to display their power through an unabashed embrace of their privilege and status, said Bhandari.\n\nThis, in turn sparks emulation, she said: Some segments of society view trends set by elites as the 'authentic' and 'real' ways of being Indian, or believe that by engaging in these extravagant celebrations they too can claim elite status.

Every step of their escape from Saudi Arabia carried the threat of severe punishment or death.\n\nWe knew the first time, if it's not perfect, it will be the last time, Reem says.\n\nCNN has changed the sisters' names and is not showing their faces, at their request for their safety.\n\nThe sisters say years of strict Islamic teaching and physical abuse at home had convinced them that they had no future in a society that places women under the enforced guardianship of men, and limits their aspirations.\n\nIt's slavery, because whatever the woman will do it's the business of the male, Rawan says.\n\nThat's why they say they renounced Islam.\n\nAnd that's why aged 18 and 20, they stole back their own passports, hid their abayas under the bedcovers, snuck out of their holiday home and boarded a flight from Colombo to Melbourne, via Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong stopover was supposed to take less than two hours.\n\nTwo hours has turned into five months.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN This photo was taken in a restroom in an airport during a trip to Turkey. The sisters wore this type of niqab when they were traveling outside Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhy they fled\n\nGood girls do what they're told, are quiet, don't argue or risk embarrassing their families. Reem and Rawan say they had turned being good girls into a fine art.\n\nIn our house, we (were) always the good girls they wanted us to be. So, if they want us to clean, we will clean. If they want us to cook, then we will cook, 18-year-old Rawan says.\n\nThe last two years it was really bad, because I just forget who I am, I am just pretending (to be) like an Islamic girl, says her 20-year-old sister, Reem.\n\nThey went to school, studied hard and avoided confrontation. Of course, the same rules didn't apply to their brothers. Beat your sisters, the siblings say their brothers were told, it'll make you better men.\n\nReem and Rawan are reluctant to talk about the abuse at the hands of their family. They say it didn't happen all the time, just enough to remind them of the rules. And enough to fill them with terror about what might happen if anyone found out about their plan or, worse still, caught them carrying it out.\n\nThe escape\n\nLeaving Saudi Arabia is not a simple undertaking for women who rebel against the system. Permission is needed from a male guardian for many basic activities, including international travel.\n\nReem and Rawan say they had been planning their escape in secret for two years. They didn't dare discuss it in case they were overheard, so, instead, they swapped WhatsApp messages, even while alone at night in their shared room.\n\nBefore they fled, the Sri Lanka vacation was just like any other. They wore their niqabs to the beach and sat away from the surf while their brothers swam and joked. They cooked the meals and spent most of their days inside. It was humid. Their niqabs stuck to their skin and made it hard to see.\n\nWe travel to move from a box to another box. From home to hotel, nothing will change, Rawan says. They will go out, they will live freely, the men, of course, we will sit away, watching them doing what they want.\n\nTheir five-year-old sister played in the sand, but their 12-year-old sister, like them, didn't. She too was learning that it's OK to be a girl in Saudi Arabia – until you grow up.\n\nDuring the trip, Rawan turned 18. The timing was no accident. The vacation was planned with gentle persuasion to coincide with a birthday that, unbeknown to their mother, allowed Rawan to apply for an Australian tourist visa.\n\nOn the last night of the trip, the sisters launched into action. Reem pre-booked the taxi. It was Rawan's job to retrieve their passports from a bag stored in their parents' bedroom. Around 2 a.m., she tiptoed past them as they slept, took the bag with their passports, then snuck back in again to return the bag so as not to raise suspicion.\n\nIt's a really great memory, exciting, Rawan tells CNN, smiling. Of the two sisters, she's the more talkative, taking the lead and occasionally looking to her sister for advice on the right word in English. Reem is more reserved. She's careful about what she says and who to trust. They both have dark, short, curly hair and being small in stature seem much younger than their years.\n\nWhen the cab driver arrived at 5 a.m., the sisters say they did something they'd never done before. They pulled on jeans they'd bought in secret and walked out of the house without their abayas.\n\nIt was only after they arrived at Colombo Airport that the sisters booked the flight they'd meticulously researched online: SriLankan Airlines flight UL892 departing Colombo at 9 a.m., arriving Hong Kong at 5:10 p.m. local time. From there, they'd take Cathay Pacific flight CX135 departing at 7:10 p.m. for Melbourne, Australia.\n\nThey had no trouble boarding the plane for the roughly six-hour flight to Hong Kong.\n\nIt was after they arrived at Hong Kong International Airport that things started to go wrong.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The younger sister takes a selfie in a hotel room. They say they felt like ghosts under the full-length black robe, as if they were invisible, not there.\n\nArriving in Hong Kong\n\nWhat happened in the transit area was something the sisters might have anticipated had they known their uncle had connections to the Saudi Interior Ministry or had realized the power Saudi officials could have over local airport staff.\n\nAs soon as the women stepped off the plane, they say two men approached them and asked if they were going to Melbourne. The women say the men asked for their passports and boarding passes, first saying they might miss their flight, then suggesting there was something wrong with their Australian visas.\n\nIn a letter to the sisters' lawyer obtained by CNN, SriLankan Airlines has identified the men as Naeem Khan, SriLankan Airlines station manager, and Noman Shah, a staff member for ground handling agent, Jardine Aviation Services.\n\nThe sisters say the men led them to another area of the airport, where their lawyer Michael Vidler says they canceled the women's Cathay Pacific flight to Melbourne and booked them, without their knowledge, on an Emirates flight to Riyadh, via Dubai.\n\nCathay Pacific tells CNN that the sisters' flight was canceled by representatives of SriLankan Airlines.\n\nSriLankan Airlines told CNN its staff members canceled the flight at the explicit request of the Saudi Consulate, which had already booked the sisters on the flight to Riyadh.\n\nThe airline said consular officials told its staff the women's father had phoned and said the sisters needed to go back to Saudi Arabia as soon as possible as their mother was terminally ill.\n\nThe women knew their mother wasn't ill and were quite sure there was nothing wrong with their visas.\n\nWe allege that they were the subject of an attempted kidnapping in an international airport in a restricted area, Vidler tells CNN. The Saudi Consulate was actively trying to deceive them.\n\nCNN has approached the Saudi Consulate in Hong Kong and the Saudi Foreign Ministry for comment on the sisters' claims and has not received a response. Hong Kong Police have confirmed that they're investigating the allegations.\n\nSriLankan Airlines says at no time did the sisters indicate there was a problem. The women disagree.\n\nVidler says that closed-circuit television seen by his team appears to confirm that Saudi Consul General Omar Al Bunayan was at the airport, speaking to the women and airline staff.\n\nThe presence of senior Saudi officials at the airport filled the women with dread. They'd heard about Dina Ali Lasloom, the 24-year-old Saudi woman who was forced onto a plane to Riyadh at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila in April 2017. Her hands, feet and mouth had been bound with duct tape, one witness told Human Rights Watch.\n\nReem and Rawan feared the same could happen to them.\n\nThey excused themselves to go to the bathroom where they made the decision to flee. As they emerged, they said they saw one of their passports on the table. Rawan tried to grab it.\n\nThe teenager says one of the men immediately slapped her hand, prompting the sisters to scream in Arabic, You kidnap us!\n\nThe sisters say they caused such a scene that the Consul General suggested they move to a quieter area where he presented them with their passports and new boarding passes – for Dubai.\n\nThey ran. First to the Cathay desk where counter staff told them their flights had been canceled. Then to the Qantas desk, where they'd hurriedly booked the next flight to Melbourne, QF30, departing at 7:00 p.m.\n\nSoon after they were issued boarding passes, the women say Shah, the ground handling staff member, tried to snatch them.\n\nJardine Aviation Services, whose staff members carry out a number of tasks within the airport, says its employees didn't tell the women their mother was ill or that was there was an issue with their Australia visas. It denies its staff members slapped Hawan's hand or tried to grab the sisters' boarding passes.\n\nHong Kong's Airport Authority has refused to give CNN a closed-circuit recording of the events that unfolded due to privacy concerns.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The women shared selfies they'd taken of their life before they fled. They wore niqabs in public from the age of 11 and at home were told to wear long gowns, so as not to tempt their brothers.\n\nFor the second time in two hours, the sisters say senior Saudi officials stopped them from flying. The sisters say Saudi Vice Consul Al Sharif told staff at the Qantas check-in desk they were running away, had stolen money, and weren't tourists.\n\nAustralian immigration officials were summoned on the phone and after a conversation with the women, Canberra canceled their visas.\n\nThe only issues with the visa occurred when the Vice Consul made what we believe to be false representations to the Australian authorities at the boarding gate of Qantas airlines, Vidler says.\n\nA spokesperson from Australia's Home Affairs department declined to comment on individual cases. Qantas also declined to comment but a spokesman pointed out that the airline does not make visa assessments.\n\nThe sisters say they stayed at the airport for three hours before asking Cathay Pacific counter staff for permission to leave. They wrote their names and a fake Hong Kong contact address then caught a train to the city.\n\nKhashoggi case puts Saudi Arabia under scrutiny\n\nReem and Rawan escaped Saudi Arabia weeks before the world's attention turned to the kingdom and the disappearance of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. They watched from Hong Kong as gruesome details emerged of Khashoggi's murder inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, allegedly by a team of hitmen who cut up his body with a bone saw.\n\nIn November, a source told CNN that the CIA had determined that Khashoggi was killed on the instruction of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, known as MBS, a claim the kingdom denies.\n\nThe Saudi sisters shrug when asked if they are surprised by Khashoggi's murder and the allegation that their country's de facto leader ordered it.\n\nWe know that Saudi Arabia can do stuff like this, Reem says. They are chasing innocent girls, not even important girls, Rawan agrees. We're just normal young women trying to find a life far away from violence.\n\nSoon after the women arrived in Hong Kong, their father and uncle came to the city to find them. Hong Kong police confirmed to CNN that a missing persons report had been filed.\n\nUsing a passport tracking system linked to hotel check-ins, Hong Kong police officers located the sisters on Monday, September 10 and took them into custody for questioning.\n\nThe women say they were held in a room in the imposing Wan Chai police headquarters for six hours, where they repeatedly refused requests from their father and their uncle to see them.\n\nPolice eventually drove them back to their hotel. By that time, it was after midnight and the women hurriedly packed their bags and fled.\n\nIn the five months since, they've moved from shelter to shelter, hotel to hotel, to evade detection and their potential forced return to Riyadh.\n\nThe sisters have not sought asylum in Hong Kong, however. Doing so would have put them at the end of a long queue of claimants caught in Hong Kong's Unified Screening Mechanism (USM), a system used by the government to process asylum claims. The UNHCR doesn't assess claims in Hong Kong.\n\nThrough their lawyer, Reem and Rawan are seeking a visa in a safe country. Vidler says they have few options. Their Saudi passports have been canceled and they don't have formal permission to stay in Hong Kong.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The sisters say being forced to wear the niqab robbed them of their identities. They knew they'd be expected to wear one for the rest of their lives, like their mother.\n\nLife in Saudi Arabia\n\nAt home in Riyadh, the sisters say they were beaten by their father and brothers for a reason and no reason.\n\nOne day when she was 14, Reem says her brother started hitting her for talking and laughing with Rawan. He said that people will hear my voice and it will bring shame, she says.\n\nThe sisters knew it was likely there would be an arranged marriage. There was talk of Rawan marrying her younger cousin, a boy still in high school.\n\nReem was the first to renounce Islam in October 2016, followed by Rawan in May 2017. They didn't dare tell anyone but say they announced it under fake names on Twitter.\n\nI knew If I told my family they will hurt me and I'll be killed. Because that what we studied in schools, that whoever left Islam should be killed. I knew no one will protect me because all my family are so religious and none of them will support me. I was afraid of them finding out, Reem says.\n\nThere are no firm figures on how many Saudi women have escaped the country – or how many have failed in their attempt to leave – but the total number of Saudi asylum seekers is rising.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, 575 Saudi nationals applied for asylum in 2015. Two years later, that figure had more than doubled to over 1,200.\n\nThe period coincides with the rising influence of MBS who in June 2017 was appointed heir to the Saudi throne by his father King Salman.\n\nSince then, MBS has made it clear that dissent won't be tolerated, even as the kingdom has earned international plaudits for new female-focused policies, including lifting the ban on women drivers.\n\nRana Ahmad, a 33-year-old Saudi national who runs the Atheist Refugee Relief agency in Germany, says the jailing and torture of the same women who campaigned for the right to drive had sent a message to some Saudi women that they have no future in the country.\n\nThey look at these women, they're trying to do something and the government puts them in jail. So they see no hope anymore, they want to leave, she said.\n\nAdam Coogle, a Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW), says women whose escape plans are thwarted are at serious risk of abuse.\n\nPunishments range from being locked in their room for months on end or banned from using a mobile phone, to criminal prosecution by the state for disobeying their parents or harming the kingdom's reputation. The women themselves say they fear they'll be killed by their own families.\n\nCoogle says there are few safe corridors for women to leave, because of political pressure the Saudi government applies to some foreign countries to return runaways without giving them the opportunity to claim asylum or put their case forward.\n\nAnywhere you go that doesn't have some sort of respect for refugee law or a strong record of rule of law is a problem because they're the countries where Saudi Arabia can apply its diplomatic pressure to get countries to cooperate, he says.\n\nFew regrets\n\nReem and Rawan say they could see signs of change in Saudi Arabia, but it wasn't moving fast enough for them. They laugh at the suggestion that progress was made by giving Saudi women the right to drive.\n\nDriving cars is not something to celebrate, Reem says. There is a woman abused in the house, and no one hears their voice, and they want us to celebrate a car? Rawan adds.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the sisters watch Netflix to pass the time. Wearing jeans and trainers, they could easily be mistaken for one of the millions of tourists that come through the city each year.\n\nSometimes Reem wears lipstick. She seems relaxed but has a habit of picking at the skin on her fingers when she's nervous. Sometimes, she does it so much that they start to bleed.\n\nThe sisters are anxious about what comes next. But even after five months of uncertainty and fear, they have few regrets.\n\nI regret not waiting, but not leaving, Reem says. From my childhood, I knew this is not my home. I always knew my rights would be taken.\n\nRawan says she too knew there was no life for her in Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhen I was growing up I saw my brothers do whatever they want, have whatever they want. But for me, I should be a good girl, a good woman, to marry someone, my cousin, because I should not even dream to choose my husband, to choose my partner.\n\nI want to study what I want, I want to work what I want, I want to choose the day I marry. To choose the man I marry. Even if I don't want to marry, I want the right to choose.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated with new information from human rights lawyer Michael Vidler who said he originally misspoke about which Saudi consulate official was at the Hong Kong airport speaking to the Saudi sisters and airline staff. Only the Consul General was seen by Vidler's team on closed circuit television.

(CNN) —\n\nAnyone who's spent a night in a dingy motel knows that not all shower heads are created equal. And these days, when self-care is a priority and we're spending more time at home than ever, upgrading your shower head is a no-brainer. First up: deciding the flow that's right for you. Are you a rain shower devotee or someone who prefers intense water pressure pointed directly at your back's aching muscles? Next up: finding a quality head that is easy to install, doesn't leak, looks great and, of course, delivers one heck of a shower.\n\nTo help you narrow down the selection — trust us, there are thousands out there — we spent hours researching the top options on the market and decided on 11 shower heads to test, retest and triple-test over the past several months. The good news (beyond the fact that we're very, very clean) is that all those IRL showers resulted in four winners:\n\nHands down, the Kohler Forte Shower Head provides the best overall shower experience, offering three distinct settings. Backstory: Lots of shower heads out there feature myriad settings that, when tested, are pretty much indecipherable. The Forte's three sprays, however, are each incredibly different and equally successful. There's the drenching, full-coverage rain shower, the pulsating massage and the silk spray setting that is basically a super-dense mist. The Forte manages to achieve all of this while using only 1.75 gallons per minute (GPM), making it a great option for those looking to conserve water.\n\nIf water conservation is a top priority for you, look no further than the High Sierra Classic Plus Shower Head. Limiting water flow to just 1.5 GPM — that's a full gallon below federal regulations (read more about that below) — this compact head is serious about sustainability. Switching to the High Sierra will save you 600 gallons of water per month and you'll use way less energy, because natural gas isn't needed to heat all that unused water. Given its small size and relatively few parts, the product's carbon footprint is also smaller than most. And even with all that environmental friendliness, it still manages to deliver a deluge of water and a very satisfying shower.\n\nWe all love to treat ourselves every now and again, and that's why the Moen Attract Dual Shower Head and Handheld Shower Head also made our list. The chrome version will set you back $79, and the brushed nickel and bronze options will cost you $89 and $99 respectively. The Attract will have you feeling like you're showering at a 5-star hotel. With an ultra-broad face and handheld shower head (with six settings, no less!), this gets you three shower heads in one: Use the main rain shower head, the hand shower or both simultaneously for a head-to-toe water immersion experience.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, there's no shame in the budget shower head game either. The Wassa High-Pressure Shower Head, coming in at just under $20, is ultra compact (it's only 3 inches wide) but delivers an intense, high-pressure stream of water out of 45 silicone jets, providing the perfect marriage of a rain shower and massage setting.\n\nBest overall shower head: Kohler Forte Shower Head (starting at $80.96; lowes.com or $99.25; kohler.com)\n\nKohler K-22169-G-CP Forte Shower Head\n\nThe primary reason the Kohler Forte topped our list is because of the immersive shower experience it provides. Delivering a powerful rainfall spray, comprised of big, full droplets of water, the shower head's main full coverage setting is all-encompassing and perfect for daily use. The intense pressure makes washing shampoo and conditioner out of your hair a quick process, and it's super helpful when rinsing off soaped-up little ones who are much shorter and farther away from the head.\n\nThe water also manages to be gentle due to those full droplets that are created, thanks to the brand's Katalyst air-induction technology, which forces 2 liters of air per minute into the shower head. Whereas competitors' streams seem to blend together, we could literally feel each droplet being issued out by this Kohler standout.\n\nFear not — Forte's other settings are equally great. The pulsating massage can target specific areas, making it perfect for a post-workout shower, delivering a pummeling force of water to sore muscles and other aches. And then there's the silk spray setting. Typically, this type of setting is ineffective at best, creating a steamy mist that isn't able to rinse off anything. The Forte's mist setting, however, produces a dense spray that is ultra light but also still full enough to get all your washing needs done.\n\nThe Forte manages to achieve all of this while also being low flow. At only 1.75 GPM (2.5 is the federally mandated ceiling for GPM; more info on GPM below), the shower head is not only WaterSense-certified but also California Energy Commission-approved — disproving the notion that low-flow shower heads are synonymous with low pressure.\n\nElegant in design, Forte comes in six finishes — the French gold hue is hot in the bathroom design world right now, but it will cost you an extra $37. The 5.5-inch-wide shower head isn't the biggest on our list, but it's also not the smallest. While it won't be the focal point of your bathroom (turn to Glacier Bay's giant square shower head if you're looking for wow factor), Forte's graceful sloped shape and broad head will blend in beautifully with glamorous and no-frills bathrooms alike.\n\nThis shower head was also incredibly easy to install; it took less than two minutes from opening the box until it was attached and running. It came preinstalled with a washer (many of the others required us to manually install those), so all we had to do was screw the head onto the shower arm, though the instructions suggested using a wrench to tighten.\n\nAnd it's easy to clean too: Just rub the head's silicone jets and any mineral buildup will come right off. Truly, the only thing we could find wrong with this product was its limited warranty, which covers it for just one year — this was the lowest warranty of all our tested shower heads, which typically offered five- to 10-year (or, in some cases, lifetime) warranties.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a shower head that checks all the boxes and delivers a consistently powerful water stream, the Forte is a sure bet and worth its relatively high price.\n\nBest low-flow shower head: High Sierra Classic Plus Shower Head (starting at $39.95, originally starting at $49.94; amazon.com)\n\nHigh Sierra Classic Plus Shower Head\n\nThe importance of water conservation in the United States and world beyond is clear, and if it's a top-of-mind concern for you, then let us introduce you to the High Sierra Classic Plus. The lowest of the low-flow heads on our list, the Classic Plus boasts a 1.5 GPM, making it both WaterSense-certified and California Energy Commission-approved. As mentioned above, there is certainly a high-efficiency shower head stigma, with some believing these heads would deliver nothing but an ineffectual trickle of water. The Classic Plus dispels the notion, however, by producing a bursting stream of high-pressure water, easily rinsing off soap and dirt.\n\nPerhaps what we loved most about this head during multiple tests was just how purist the product is. Single-function and made solely of metal — trust us, this is not the shower head industry norm! — the Classic Plus is small but mighty. Measuring 1 inch by 1 inch by 3 inches, the fixed shower head weighs just about half a pound, and yet it's able to produce a wide, forceful stream that easily rinsed products out of even the longest hair. More eco-friendly details to know: Made in the USA, the Classic Plus' compact size correlates to a smaller carbon footprint, as the company uses less material and energy during the manufacturing process.\n\nThe nozzle's patented design is worth mentioning too, as it's unlike any other shower heads we tested. Shooting water out of one single orifice — rather than, say, via a pressure regulator and through dozens of tiny silicone jets — the Classic Plus is virtually clogproof. This design also makes installation a breeze; just screw it onto the shower arm, and voila, it's attached. Same goes for cleaning, as you just run your finger through the hollow cavity to do so.\n\nWe also liked the product's customizability. Available in four finishes (chrome, nickel, oil-rubbed bronze and polished brass), the Classic Plus comes in three flow rates as well (1.5, 1.8 and 2 GPM). If the shower arm height is over 6.5 feet high, the brand recommends opting for a 1.8 or 2 GPM, which dispel larger water droplets, to ensure that optimal rinsing can be achieved. And if you want to save even more water, opt for the trickle-head version, which comes with a turn-off valve that reduces water to a trickle while you're lathering or shaving (or chasing a toddler to get back into the shower).\n\nPerfect for smaller and outdoor showers, the High Sierra Classic Plus emits a surprisingly strong, consistent spray for its miniature size. If you're looking for something with more bells and whistles, this isn't the shower head for you. But if you're A-OK with a simple product that delivers a nonstop drenching stream, all while conserving water, the Classic Plus is your best bet.\n\nBest dual shower head: Moen Attract Dual Shower Head and Handheld Shower Head ($79, originally $89.98; homedepot.com)\n\nMoen Attract Dual Shower Head and Handheld Shower Head\n\nOne look at the Moen Attract and it's easy to see that the shower head would be right at home in a fancy hotel. Simultaneously tasteful and luxurious-looking, the Attract's oversize rain shower head (measuring 6.75 by 3.75 inches) topped our list not only because of its lustrous aesthetics but also because it delivers a doozy of a shower. It's no wonder the head has raked in nearly 1,900 likes on Home Depot.\n\nFor one, there's the fact that it's a dual shower head, offering up a powerful stream via the rain shower head, in addition to six effective sprays via the handheld. When testing it out, we felt pampered by the three-in-one optionality, whether succumbing to rainfall deluge from the main head alone, opting for one of the intense handheld sprays or combining both for all-encompassing water coverage. The shower heads continually deliver a blissed-out experience akin to something you'd expect from a spa.\n\nIn addition to the superb water pressure coverage and consistency, we were also smitten with the Attract's highly intuitive design. Specifically, we're talking about the Magnetix technology, wherein the handheld lives in a magnetic dock, easily releasing and snapping back into place. Unlike other dual shower heads on the market, where you have to maneuver the handheld back into a slippery, narrow dock adjacent to the main head, the Attract seamlessly lands on the magnetic dock, conveniently located directly under the main head. This positioning is genius, because when combining the two heads, they're able to work in unison, delivering one giant stream of immersive water. More to know: We appreciated the water-conservation-friendly pause/trickle button on the handheld — which allows users to stop water flow midshower while they, say, shave their legs or lather up — and the fact that the water temperature stayed consistent once the pause button was released.\n\nSpeaking of water conservation, a chief selling point of the Attract is that while being totally luxurious, it's also a high-efficiency shower head, emitting 1.75 GPM (which is toward the lower end of the heads we tested). WaterSense-certified and California Energy Commission-approved, the Attract proves that low flow doesn't have to mean low quality.\n\nLike most dual shower heads, the Attract comes with more parts and pieces, which added to our installation time. All in all, from box opening to shower running, the installation took about 10 minutes. In terms of cleaning, the silicone nozzles are easy to wipe off, and the chrome version we tested out was indeed spot-resistant.\n\nThe Moen Attract checks all the luxe boxes — it's beautiful to look at, it's smartly designed, it delivers an incredible shower experience and it's eco-friendly to boot. The only reason it didn't make it as our top overall shower head is because, well, not everyone has the room or need for a dual shower head.\n\nBest budget shower head: Wassa High-Pressure Shower Head (starting at $19.97; amazon.com)\n\nWassa High Pressure Shower Head\n\nHere's the thing about the Wassa High-Pressure Shower Head: When we heard that it was $19 and had more than 11,000 positive reviews and a 4.8-star rating on Amazon, we were pretty much sold. Testing the head in-person proved what the many reviews touted, which is that this shower head delivers an incredibly powerful rain spray given its compact, 3-inch-wide head size and budget price. Reminder, folks: It costs less than 20 bucks.\n\nIf water pressure is your top priority, then you should seriously consider this shower head. Described as both heavenly and magical by myriad Amazon reviewers — one even called it a power wash for your shower — we were eager to discover for ourselves what exactly all the excitement was about. And, no surprise here, Wassa lived up to the hype. Shooting water out of 45 silicone jets, we found the stream to be intense and direct, and we could literally feel every single one of those 45 jets bearing down on us. While some Amazon reviewers complained that the pressure was too extreme to, say, wash your face, we'd have to disagree; the pressure is strong, for sure, but not to a level of discomfort. And if you're worried about stream coverage, fear not, as a swivel ball joint makes it easy to maneuver the head, directing the stream to your desired angle.\n\nThere are some downsides, however, such as the head's 2.5 GPM flow. Yes, this makes it WaterSense-certified, but it's at the higher end of GPM levels in heads that we tested and it's a no-go for Californians (more on that below). There's also the fact that this shower head is single-function, with zero fancy settings to choose from. The product's simple design, however, works to its advantage when it comes to installation and cleaning — both were easy and fast.\n\nWhile the Wassa is missing some of the luxe features you'll experience with pricier competitors — namely, a multitude of spray settings — you won't find a better shower head at this price point. It's totally sufficient for any bathroom out there.\n\nHow we tested\n\nAfter scouring the shower head market for bestselling, top-rated, trending and critically hailed options, we corralled a test group of 11 shower heads that (on paper) met the standards buyers are most interested in, including design, build, function, aesthetics and price.\n\nWe then tested each unit by taking a minimum of three showers — including a quick rinse, a long luxurious soak and the ultimate test: washing down four kids after a long summer day. Our testing process was intensive, lasting several months. In addition to those overall shower experiences, we also evaluated:\n\nFunctionality\n\nWater pressure and coverage: This category was clearly a biggie. Here, we were looking for an intense, consistent stream that was maintained throughout different settings and when switching from main shower head to handheld.\n\nStream coverage: We noted the width of each head's stream and whether or not they could deliver a full-body drench.\n\nSpray settings: While some of the heads we reviewed were single-function, others had as many as nine spray settings. We analyzed whether the settings were decipherable and effective, and noted the user-friendliness of switching back and forth between settings.\n\nDurability\n\nLeakage: We assessed whether the shower head leaked from its connection to the wall, from the head itself when turned off and from the head when switching between settings.\n\nBuild quality: We ranked the shower heads on signs of damage over time, build quality, quality of materials and the tangible feel of the products in hand. Specifically, we also noted what each shower head was made of (e.g., metal, chrome finish, plastic, etc.).\n\nEase of clean: After each shower, we took note of how easy it was to clean the shower head's spray jets (and handheld, if applicable) and the surrounding hardware.\n\nSetup\n\nEase of assembly: We noted how long it took to unbox each shower head, how many parts were in each box and whether the parts were clearly labeled.\n\nEase of installation: We assessed if the directions were clear and accurate, whether any special tools were required and how long it took to install the shower head and its additional parts (if applicable) from start to finish.\n\nAesthetics\n\nFirst impression: We observed our first impression of each shower head, homing in on the design, the size, the shape and whether it looked attractive on a standard subway-tiled shower wall. We also noted what type of bathrooms the heads would be best suited for, from commercial use to a luxe master suite.\n\nMarket comparison: We compared and contrasted the shower head to the vast options on the market, noting the design merits and flaws of each.\n\nColor options: We researched if the head came in any colors besides the standard chrome.\n\nWarranty\n\nWe checked the number of years of warranty of each product.\n\nWater flow guidelines\n\nSince 1992, all shower heads have been federally mandated to have a lower flow rate — specifically 2.5 GPM — in order to conserve water nationwide. The bonus for consumers is that it's also going to save you on your utility bill (yay!). Some regions have gone even further in their regulations. California, for example, has instituted a mandatory 1.8 GPM standard. As a result, brands are responding, creating high-efficiency shower heads that meet or surpass the federal standards. Any product with a 2.5 or lower GPM receives a WaterSense certification label from the EPA.\n\nHow we rated\n\nBased upon the categories and testing procedures listed above, we gave all 11 shower heads a score in each subcategory, then combined those numbers for a maximum score in each category, then totaled those numbers for a final overall score. We broke down the scores as follows:\n\nFunction had a maximum of 50 points: water pressure consistency (10 points), water pressure intensity (10 points), stream coverage and width (10 points), leakage (10 points), number of settings (5 points), ease to switch settings (5 points).\n\nBuild had a maximum of 45 points: ease of installation (15 points), quality (10 points), ease of cleaning (10 points), aesthetics (5 points), does it meet current water flow guidelines (5 points).\n\nWarranty had a maximum of 5 points: five+ years (5 points), two to three years (2 points), fewer than two years (0 points)\n\nIn addition to the overall score, we also factored in the price of each shower head.\n\nOther shower heads we tested\n\nGlacier Bay Modern 1-Spray 8-Inch Single Wall-Mount Fixed Rain Shower Head (starting at $29.98; homedepot.com)\n\nPHOTO: The Home Depot Glacier Bay Modern 1-Spray 8-Inch Single Wall-Mount Fixed Rain Shower Head\n\nFor the aesthetically driven, this sleek, ultra-modern rain shower head from Glacier Bay takes the design cake. The extra-wide — it's 9 inches wide, people! — square-shaped head offers up a whopping 81 rub-clean jets that work to deliver a wide rain shower. Available in five finishes, including trendy hues matte black and gold, the shower head can be installed in under two minutes and features a 1.8 GPM, making it WaterSense-certified. Ultimately, the head didn't make our best list because its water pressure didn't overwhelm. While rain shower heads overall tend to be delicate, this one felt extremely soft to us after multiple test drives. Bottom line: This shower head looks and feels much fancier than its price tag suggests.\n\nRainSpa 3-in-1 Rainfall Combination Shower Head ($24.99, originally $29.99; bedbathandbeyond.com)\n\nPHOTO: Bed Bath and Beyond RainSpa 3-in-1 Rainfall Combination Shower Head\n\nSimilar to the Moen Attract, this dual shower head features a fixed rainfall head, clocking in at 6 inches wide, in addition to a high-power handheld. How it differs, though, is in price. With the RainSpa head, you get a huge shoulder-to-shoulder stream, six spray settings (including a pause option) and easy-to-clean jets for under $25. If you're a Bed Bath & Beyond Beyond+ member, you can snag it for $19.99. Though it's a great choice for those looking for a dual shower head at a bargain, the product did have some weaknesses. Its myriad components, coupled with the chrome-finished material that has a cheaper feel, led to a less satisfying overall experience than the higher-end Moen. So, although they perform similarly, we think you're better off spending more on the Moen for a better build quality that's likely to hold up longer.\n\nDelta In2ition 2-in-1 5-Spray 6-Inch Dual Wall-Mount Fixed and Handheld Shower Head (starting at $79.98; homedepot.com)\n\nPHOTO: The Home Depot Delta In2ition 2-in-1 5-Spray 6-Inch Dual Wall-Mount Fixed and Handheld Shower Head\n\nBoasting one of the more clever design schemes of all the heads we tested, the Delta In2ition features a built-in handheld that magnetically attaches by sliding into the main shower head. The two units can be used in unison or separately, together delivering a wide stream of extra-large droplets. We found the handheld's water pressure to be rather low, or gentle, making it a good option for kids. We also experienced some leakage when switching the water from the shower head to the handheld. It did earn points for its innovative design and compact footprint, however, not to mention its 1.75 GPM and WaterSense certification.\n\nAmerican Standard Spectra+ Touch 4-Function Shower Head (starting at $24.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon American Standard Spectra+ Touch 4-Function Shower Head\n\nIf you're looking for a big ol' fixed shower head, this is a decent option. At more than 7 inches wide, the Spectra+ offers up a full-body drenching stream. What's different from most heads is that you can switch between settings by simply touching anywhere on the outer ring of the circular head — no levers or pulleys required. We love the four pretty finishes too. Ultimately, the downside for us was the Spectra+'s less-than-intense water pressure and its plastic composition, which lent a slightly cheaper look and feel than some of the others in our testing pool.\n\nAquaStar Elite High-Pressure 6-Setting Luxury Spa Hand Shower ($34.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon AquaStar Elite High-Pressure 6-Setting Luxury Spa Hand Shower\n\nAquaStar Elite works as both an overhead shower and a handheld, but its big selling point is the antimicrobial jets that repel bacteria, thanks to built-in Microban, which never washes away. We found the head's settings to be strong and effective, with the pulsating massage to be the most powerful of any we tested. The narrow stream coverage is what kept it from earning a top spot on our list, but all in all, we'd say this is great for a guest or kids bathroom.\n\nHydroluxe 1433 Handheld Shower Head & Rain Shower Combo ($25.99, originally $54.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Hydroluxe 1433 Handheld Shower Head & Rain Shower Combo\n\nBeloved by more than 10,000 Amazon reviewers and rocking a 4.4-star rating, this dual shower combo is a solid purchase for anyone on a budget. Boasting all the bells and whistles of a fancier brand — five highly effective spray settings (everyone, truly, should experience power rain), an oversize 4-inch-wide face, rub-clean jets and a sleek chrome finish — this shower head is a steal at this price. That said, if powerhouse water pressure is a must, you'll want to look elsewhere.\n\nWaterpik PowerPulse Massage Shower Head ($39.98; homedepot.com)\n\nPHOTO: The Home Depot Waterpik PowerPulse Massage Shower Head\n\nFor those who simply can't get enough spray settings, let us introduce you to Waterpik's PowerPulse, which has a whopping nine on offer. And having tested them all out multiple times, we can attest that the water pressure intensity and consistency remain forceful throughout. Designed specifically to deliver a therapeutic, massagelike shower, the head's targeted stream does just that. The downside: Its simple, utilitarian look might be a bit out of place in a glam bathroom. It was a hair off from being chosen a winner for its performance (it scored just as well as our top pick) but came up significantly short in terms of build quality. Still, this is a great choice for those who don't care about appearance and want a cheaper option than the Kohler Forte.\n\nRead more from CNN Underscored's hands-on testing:
(CNN) Congressional Democrats have introduced legislation to create a monument on Capitol Hill in honor of the late Supreme Court Justice and liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nGinsburg, who The House bill , introduced on Monday by the Democratic Women's Caucus -- including Reps. Lois Frankel of Florida, Jackie Speier of California, Veronica Escobar of Texas and Brenda Lawrence of Michigan -- and Rep.

CNN has reached out to multiple lawmakers' offices for comment.\n\nThe Notorious RBG was tiny in stature, but a giant in the fight for women's equality, Speier told CNN in a statement. Had it not been for her tireless and fearless dedication, we women in Congress would have had a much different experience in pursuing our dreams to serve our country and shape and inform policy impacting women everywhere.

(Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nRihanna claims her father and his business partner fraudulently used her name to make money and she's suing them over it.\n\nThe singer alleges that her father, Ronald Fenty, and his partner, Moses Perkins, falsely represented their company's affiliation with her.\n\nAlthough Mr. Fenty is Rihanna's father, he does not have, and never has had, authority to act on Rihanna's behalf, nor has he ever been authorized to use her name, intellectual property or publicity rights, the suit obtained by CNN reads. Similarly, neither Mr. Perkins nor the Company has any affiliation whatsoever with Rihanna.\n\nThe pair launched Fenty Entertainment, a production and talent company, in 2017.\n\nRihanna's popular Fenty Beauty line of cosmetics also launched in 2017. She has a lingerie product line as well.\n\nThe suit states that Fenty and Perkins have repeatedly been asked to stop misrepresenting themselves and to cease and desist all activity and efforts to exploit Rihanna's name and the goodwill associated with the Fenty brand.\n\nThe pair unsuccessfully attempted to register the Fenty name for a line of resort hotels, according to the suit.\n\nRihanna also alleges that Fenty and Perkins negotiated an unauthorized deal for her to perform 15 shows in Latin America for $15 million, and two 15-minute sets at Calibash at Staples Center and T-Mobile Arena for $400,000.\n\nThe singer is seeking to stop the pair from using her name or the Fenty brand, as well as damages and attorney's fees.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Rihanna talked about her complicated relationship with her father, who, she said, had a tumultuous marriage with her mother.\n\nHe taught me everything, Rihanna told Winfrey. As awful as he was to my mom at times, it didn't compare to how great he was as a father.\n\nCNN has reached out to Rihanna, Fenty and Perkins for comment.
(CNN) The first half-hour of Pieces of a Woman is a brutal viewing experience, portraying a home birth gone wrong in grueling detail. How the audience processes that will likely determine how they feel about the rest of the film, which is otherwise most notable for its powerful central performance by The Crown's Vanessa Kirby.\n\nThe premise is loosely inspired by a personal tragedy that befell Hungarian director Kornel Mundruczo and writer Kata Weber, a real-life couple that lost a baby. But their first English-language film takes off in dramatic directions thereafter, including the toll the situation exacts on Kirby's Martha and her husband Sean (Shia LaBeouf), as well as others within their extended orbit.\n\nLaBeouf, notably, is currently the subject of off-screen controversy , and Netflix has largely excised him from its promotion for the movie.\n\nThe film's emotional thrust stems from Martha's haunted, numbed response, which has implications for her marriage; her relationship with her imperious mother (Ellen Burstyn), who is determined to intervene, but in ways she sees fit that don't necessarily help; and the midwife (Molly Parker) who participated in the delivery, leading to a trial that feels like a tired device in order to heighten the drama.\n\nThe deeply personal nature of the material shows, and Kirby captures that with the kind of understated performance that conveys the turmoil and pain within her character. In this peculiar awards season, she's garnered a degree of buzz that frankly outshines the film.\n\nRead More

You've probably heard of Mahatma Gandhi, the loincloth-clad man who fronted India's fight for independence from the British. But right beside him and other male leaders, was an army of women whose trials and tribulations were every bit as compelling.\n\nWhen the history of India's independence comes to be known, the sacrifices made by the women of India will occupy the foremost place.\n\nTheir fight began as early as the late 19th century, when some took to the battlefields and one queen even led an armed rebellion against the British. They also fought a domestic battle against oppressive traditions, such as sati (the burning of a wife on her husband's funeral pyre) and child marriage. Sadly, the latter still exists today.\n\nThese women did not have it easy -- they were some of the worst victims of the traumatic events that took place in south Asia in the mid-20th century. It's reported that 75,000 women were abducted and raped during partition, the division that separated Pakistan from India, which took place at the same time as independence in August 1947.\n\nFrom setting up a secret radio station to running for president when it was perceived to be a man's role, these are some of the empowering stories that are often left untold.\n\nKasturba Gandhi (1869 - 1944)\n\nMahatma Gandhi (right) with his wife, Kasturba, at Sevagram Ashram, Maharashtra, India, in January 1942.\n\nI learned the lesson of non-violence from my wife, Mohandas Gandhi, better known as Mahatma Gandhi, once said. Kasturba Gandhi's passive disobedience of her husband is said to have influenced the father of the nation's renowned peaceful movement.\n\nMarried when they were both just 13 years old and schooled by her husband, she became a social activist in her thirties in South Africa, and was imprisoned there for three months for protesting against the treatment of Indian immigrants in the country.\n\nAlthough she was plagued with health problems, she continued her activism work when she returned to India, where she was also arrested and jailed a few more times. In 1942, she was imprisoned along with her freedom-fighting husband and other pro-independence leaders for taking part in Gandhi's Quit India movement -- an effort to encourage the British to allow India to rule itself. Her health deteriorated and she died in prison in 1944.\n\nIt is the women whose task it becomes to encourage the men, in our fight for freedom. Women have better understood the spirit of the fight than men. Kasturba Gandhi, activist and wife of Mahatma Gandhi\n\nFatima Jinnah (1893 - 1967)\n\nCelebrating his 72nd birthday, Muhammed Ali Jinnah, Governor-General of Pakistan, strolls on the lawn of the Government House in Karachi with his sister, Fatima.\n\nStanding firmly alongside Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, was his sister. Fatima Jinnah is fondly remembered as Madar-i Millat, the mother of the nation.\n\nTaking an early interest in politics and playing an active part in women's rights, she represented an advance in the status of women even before Pakistan was born, wrote author M. Reza Pirbhai. She was English educated, a professional dentist and an unveiled social worker even before the word Pakistan was coined in the 1930s.\n\nNo nation can rise to the height of glory unless your women are side by side with you. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, leader of the Muslim League\n\nIn 1964-5, when she was in her seventies, she even ran for president -- a role widely viewed as unacceptable for women. Although she lost, her bold move was praised by Pakistanis, wrote Pirbhai.\n\nAfter India and Pakistan's independence, Jinnah also took part in refugee relief work and formed the Women's Relief Committee during the transfer of power, which evolved into the All Pakistan Women's Association.\n\nRemember it is women who can mould the character of the youth of the nation. Fatima Jinnah, politician, activist and sister to Muhammad Jinnah\n\nKamala Nehru (1899 - 1936)\n\nKamala Nehru, wife of India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, in an undated photo.\n\nSpeaking to a gathering of women in Allahabad, a city in the north of India, the wife of the country's first prime minister said: Ours is a peaceful fight.

She supported him in his fight for independence and played a prominent part in political processions, setting up a dispensary in her house for wounded freedom fighters and advocating women's education.\n\nNehru was mother to Indira Gandhi, who became the country's first female prime minister in 1966. She passed away from tuberculosis in Lausanne, Switzerland in 1936.\n\nWhen my father (Jawaharlal Nehru) came into the political field, there was a certain amount of opposition from the family...

They convinced him to return to India and resume leadership of the movement and banded together in their fight to liberate India and form Pakistan.\n\nKhan helped the refugees who fled India during partition and also organized the All Pakistan Women's Association in 1949, two years after the creation of her country.\n\nNoticing that there were not many nurses in Karachi, a coastal city in the south, Khan requested the army to train women to give injections and first aid.

She is vice president of communications and strategy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Follow her at @jrpsaki. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThere is nothing like a political upset to energize the party out of power.\n\nAnd Tuesday night's election was a whopper of an upset – a huge energizer for not just the Democratic Party, but also for women who have been victims of sexual assault.\n\nPHOTO: Jeff Mauritzen Jen Psaki\n\nYes, Roy Moore was a deeply flawed candidate long before he was accused of sexual abuse, allegations he denies. But Alabama is a deep red state that has not elected a Democrat since 1992, and that Democrat, Richard Shelby, became a Republican just two years later.\n\nDoug Jones ran a smart, Alabama-focused campaign, and stayed out of the national spotlight. He smartly focused on African-American turnout in the closing weeks and it worked.\n\nAs special elections go, this is an earthquake that will have repercussions far into 2018.\n\nWhat will they be?\n\nFirst, Democrats are going to feel emboldened to run in states and districts next year where traditionally they would have no business running. This carries some danger because Democrats are still behind Republicans in fundraising on the national level. Democrats' time, energy and money should be focused on an expanded list of races where they have the best chance of winning.\n\nThere is no doubt now that both the Senate and the House are in play for 2018. The Jones win will help Democrats with fundraising and candidate recruitment. And even in states, like Alabama, where the turnout wheels have been rusty, it is clear that the energy and the enthusiasm is there to be tapped into.\n\nSecond, this is a win for the establishment Republicans. And a loss for Steve Bannon – and more importantly Donald Trump. Trump put himself out there for Roy Moore – not just with presidential tweets, but with a trip to an adjoining media market. This loss is far worse for Trump's political power and for Steve Bannon's political wisdom than was the Republicans' loss in the Virginia governor's race last month.\n\nBut it is still a mixed bag for Mitch McConnell and Republican leaders. Yes, it weakens the insurgency they faced in the Republican Party, but leaves them down a Senate seat at a time when they can't afford it. It also weakens the wing of the party that was actually energizing Republicans, the Trump-Bannon wing.\n\nThird, this is a win for the victims of sexual assault who bravely spoke out in Alabama. It will no doubt embolden other women to speak out against men in power who they say assaulted them. And on the political front, Democratic Senators like Kirsten Gillibrand, who have in the last week raised the stakes on Donald Trump and made clear that Democrats are going to have a zero tolerance policy for sexual harassment and sexual assault, now have the wind at their backs.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nFinally, it is a win for morality and human decency. The candidate accused of sexual abuse, who opposed gay marriage and consensual homosexual relationships, who questioned whether Muslims could serve in the United State Congress, lost.\n\nAnd the candidate who talked not about Donald Trump, but about the importance of the CHIP program, a program that helps provide health insurance to tens of thousands of children every year that Congress has failed to fund, was the winner.\n\nIn a tough political year for morality, let's hope this is a sign of things to come next year.

President Trump has rightly been a staunch critic of Iran for its support of radical terrorism throughout the Middle East (including its anti-Semitic animus), and this new effort spearheaded by Grenell will additionally help hold accountable more than 70 countries, mostly concentrated in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean, that continue to criminalize homosexuality.\n\nThe president has come under fire for his relationship with our allies. But this breakthrough gathering shows that the Trump administration is, in fact, channeling Abraham Lincoln's advice to Stand with anyone that is right; stand with him while he is right and part with him when he goes wrong.\n\nWhen our NATO allies believe they can continue to freeload off the American taxpayer, President Trump rightly calls them out for failing to meet their financial commitments in defense spending for joint security. When they wish to preserve basic human dignity for LGBTI people, we proudly link arms and stand in solidarity.\n\nThis additional push with our allies to call for human rights through an LGBTI lens confirms what Trump supporters already know: That our leaders under President Trump are bold, unabashed supporters of the individual rights, freedom and personal autonomy that undergird America's founding principles.\n\nWhile Grenell's gathering is making news headlines, it's important to note that the Trump administration, along with other past presidents and many Democrats as well, has previously expressed support for decriminalizing homosexuality around the globe.\n\nAround the world, far too many governments continue to arrest and abuse their citizens simply for being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex (LGBTI), Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last year on the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia. The United States firmly opposes criminalization, violence and serious acts of discrimination such as in housing, employment and government services, directed against LGBTI persons. We use public and private diplomacy to raise human rights concerns, provide emergency assistance to people at risk, and impose visa restrictions and economic sanctions against those who persecute them.\n\nIn 2016, President Trump was the first Republican nominee in American history to discuss LGBT rights in an acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. That gathering also provided a platform for tech billionaire Peter Thiel to acknowledge his sexuality in a speech to the GOP convention, where he said he was proud to be gay. Thiel was the first GOP convention speaker to cite his or her sexual orientation – and Thiel was cheered for doing so.\n\nThe Trump administration came under fire last year for revoking same-sex domestic partner visas for foreign diplomats and employees of international organizations, yet the State Department has not issued the same family visas to heterosexual domestic partners since 2009. And the New York Times reported that If necessary, the State Department officials said, legal workarounds could be discussed on a case-by-case basis for couples who are barred from marrying in their home countries.\n\nCritics of a decision by the Trump administration to allow some faith-based organizations to deny gay adoptions on religious grounds should note that the decision does not blanketly ban gay adoption. Observers have pointed out that the circumstances of this situation are similar to the 7-2 Supreme Court ruling in favor of a Colorado baker who, because of his faith, declined to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding. The high court warned against hostility toward people practicing their faith.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nI personally believe bakers serving the general public should serve gay weddings and disagree with the Trump administration on this adoption policy. Yet I also see that debating these issues in light of our Constitution's guarantee of religious liberty is the mark of a pluralistic society – the type not seen in nations that criminalize homosexuality.\n\nEven though some conservatives oppose legalized gay marriage ( President Trump has said he is fine with same-sex marriage and considers the issue settled law) and LGBTI activists oppose the administration's position against trans members serving the military, the issue of global decriminalization should be an area where debates over those issues should be set aside and all sides can work together.\n\nHeartbreaking stories of LGBTI persecution around the world pour in far too often, and we must be vigilant about ending the anger and hate fueling these attacks. This week's European gathering is a positive step in stemming that tide.

This is a special edition of Royal News, a new weekly newsletter from CNN bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what's happening behind palace walls. Sign up here .\n\nLondon (CNN) -- I just didn't want to be alive anymore.\n\nMeghan's powerfully honest admission in her conversation with Oprah is likely to be as explosive as Princess Diana's sit-down with the BBC's Martin Bashir back in 1995 -- which helped spark a crisis that took the monarchy years to recover from.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex's words could potentially be even more seismic than the late Princess of Wales's because the questions she raises are harder for the palace to answer.\n\nHarry told Oprah: What I was seeing was history repeating itself, but more, perhaps -- or definitely far more dangerous, because then you add race in.\n\nFor Meghan, the feelings of loneliness and isolation that drove her to suicidal thoughts were only compounded when, in her last months of pregnancy, she was told their newborn would not be given a title. Being a prince or princess was of little consequence to couple -- except that that withholding a title meant their child wouldn't have the security that comes with it.\n\nIt's like, okay, well, he needs to be safe, Meghan explained. But if you're saying the title is what's going to affect their protection, we haven't created this monster machine around us in terms of clickbait and tabloid fodder. You've allowed that to happen, which means our son needs to be safe.\n\nHow to get help: In the US, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world.\n\nMeghan then disclosed that there had been concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he's born. Visibly shocked, Oprah pressed the Duchess, who explained Harry had several conversations with unnamed royals.\n\nIt was really hard to be able to see those as compartmentalized conversations, Meghan continued. When asked by Oprah if the concern was that if he were too brown that would be a problem, Meghan said she wasn't able to follow up with why.\n\nBut that -- if that's the assumption you're making, I think that feels like a pretty safe one, which was really hard to understand, she added.\n\nHarry refused to elaborate on the specifics of the conversation later during the interview and only added that at the time, it was awkward. I was a bit shocked. The Duke did offer that it wasn't the first time the subject had been raised; in fact, it had been broached right at the beginning.\n\nThere were some real obvious signs before we even got married that this was going to be really hard, Harry added.\n\nCNN has reached out for comment from the palace but had not heard back by the time of publishing. However, any statement will be viewed by many as a response to the charge of institutional racism.\n\nMeghan remarks to Oprah have sent shockwaves after she said the impact of life as a working royal drove her to suicidal thoughts.\n\nThen there's the claim the monarchy failed in its duty of care for Meghan when she had very clear and very scary thoughts of suicide. Meghan says she tried and failed to appeal to a senior staff member and the palace's human resources department, but wasn't offered any support.\n\nI went to the institution, and I said that I needed to go somewhere to get help. I said that 'I've never felt this way before, and I need to go somewhere.' And I was told that I couldn't -- that it wouldn't be good for the institution, the Duchess revealed.\n\nIt was only after they were married that Meghan truly appreciated what she had taken on.\n\nNot only was I not being protected but that they were willing to lie to protect other members of the family, but they weren't willing to tell the truth to protect me and my husband, she said.\n\nMeghan used a story that leaked many months after her wedding as an example. The report claimed Meghan had made Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, cry during a dress fitting for the flower girls but the Duchess of Sussex said it was actually the other way around.\n\nThe narrative about, you know, making Kate cry, I think was the beginning of a real character assassination, she said. And they knew it wasn't true. And I thought, well, if they're not going to kill things like that, then what are we going to do?\n\nMeghan said it was a stressful time and opted not to elaborate further as Kate had apologized and all was forgiven between them but what was hard to get over was being blamed for something that not only I didn't do.\n\nThe tete-a-tete with Oprah was billed, in the weeks leading up to it, as a bombshell broadcast and it did not fail to deliver. When compared to Diana's interview, it will easily go down in history as being as (if not more) disruptive, given the shocking revelations around race and the prevalence of social media today.\n\nFor many Black and mixed-race people both in Britain and around the world, Harry's choice in life partner really held meaning. For some, the fact that a biracial woman was marrying into the royal family was something they never imagined, and it made the family more relevant.\n\nTo now discover that the perceived optics surrounding the color of their future children's skin was being considered will horrify people. The question now is: How will the palace respond? And, more importantly, will it take any action on the accusations of racism leveled at it? It's already faced questions about its relevance, it must now rebuild trust and show that it can hold itself to higher standards.\n\nThe royal family was able to survive the Diana scandal because it restored the public's faith in the institution -- aided by the world's interest in her two sons, William and Harry, and the women they married. What The Firm does next, in response to this profound interview, and the revelations in it, will determine if it can long-term overcome the damage sustained from losing Harry and Meghan -- two of its most loved senior royals -- from its ranks.\n\nThe duty of any monarchy is to represent all its subjects but some people will feel today that it no longer applies to them.\n\nNEWS OF THE WEEK\n\nA Commonwealth Day coincidence\n\nIt was business as usual for the Queen on Sunday -- despite the looming Harry-Meghan interview -- as she and other members of the royal family united for Commonwealth Day. Elizabeth paid tribute to communities across 54 countries -- commending them for coming together in response to the pandemic.\n\nWhilst experiences of the last year have been different across the Commonwealth, stirring examples of courage, commitment and selfless dedication to duty have been demonstrated in every Commonwealth nation and territory, notably by those working on the frontline who have been delivering healthcare and other public services in their communities, the Queen said in a pre-recorded address from Windsor Castle.\n\nThe day is usually celebrated with a service at London's Westminster Abbey. This year's event was canceled due to Covid-19 and replaced with special celebratory programming on British TV. While it has struck some as odd that the commemorations and the Sussexes' Oprah interview fell on the same day, the timing is purely a coincidence of TV scheduling, we've been told.\n\nHowever that won't stop people from drawing comparisons. After all, last year's Commonwealth service was the last engagement Harry and Meghan participated in before stepping back as senior royals. Much was made at the time of the apparently frosty reception Harry and Meghan received. And in 2018, the Commonwealth service was also the setting for Meghan's first official engagement where the monarch was in attendance, a couple months before she tied the knot with Harry.\n\nPrince Philip on the mend?\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh was transferred back to King Edward VII's Hospital last Friday following a successful procedure for a pre-existing heart condition at St Bartholomew's Hospital earlier this week. This has been the longest hospital stint for the Queen's 99-year-old husband to date. He was first admitted to King Edward's on February 16 after feeling unwell, where it was later confirmed he was being treated for an infection. He was moved to St Bartholomew's last Monday.\n\nWhile undoubtedly there has been much concern for Philip due to his advanced age, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall said his condition was slightly improving after his transfer, despite his treatment hurting at moments, according to PA Media. And as the Duke recovers from his operation, he was clearly in the thoughts of those in Buckingham Palace, which shared a family photo of the Queen and her husband smiling as they posed together in the library of Balmoral Castle in Scotland in 1976 to mark World Book Day.\n\nFROM THE ROYAL VAULT\n\nThe royals have been the subject of countless movies, TV shows and documentaries but it's their rare one-on-ones that are often the most revelatory.\n\nIn 1995, Diana participated in an explosive interview for the BBC's Panorama program. Prince Charles and Diana had separated three years prior and Charles had sensationally admitted to having an affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles after years of tabloid speculation in a documentary released in 1994. But it was Diana's simple utterance Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded that turned her sit-down interview into of the most-watched moments in UK broadcasting history.\n\nMore recently, the Panorama interview was back in the news after the BBC launched an internal inquiry amid allegations that journalist Martin Bashir had used dishonest practices to acquire the interview with the Princess of Wales. However on Thursday, British police announced they were not going to pursue any further criminal investigation into the claims after obtaining legal advice from their lawyers, independent counsel and from the Crown Prosecution service.\n\nA WORD FROM THE ROYALS\n\nThis pandemic has shown us the true nature of a global emergency. We have learnt that human health, economic health and planetary health are fundamentally interconnected and that pandemics, climate change and biodiversity loss are existential threats, which know no borders. Prince Charles\n\nThe Prince of Wales praised the response of the Commonwealth's people during the pandemic and took the opportunity to highlight the crisis' link to climate change. Standing alone for his pre-recorded message at Westminster Abbey, he was one of several senior royals who paid tribute to the Commonwealth over the weekend.\n\nWhat do you think about Harry and Meghan's decision to speak to Oprah?

Recent polls show Republicans pulling ahead in the battle for power in Washington despite races in Alaska, North Carolina and other states remaining very close, and they expressed confidence in the home stretch of one of the most pivotal midterm elections in years.

Luther Strange conceded the Alabama primary runoff just after 9:30 p.m. ET Roy Moore has been a lightning rod for controversy for more than a decade\n\n(CNN) —\n\nRoy Moore, the bombastic evangelical Christian who was twice ousted as Alabama's chief justice, has beaten Sen. Luther Strange in a Republican primary.\n\nMoore's win is sending shockwaves through the GOP establishment – including at the White House, where President Donald Trump had poured his own political capital into helping Strange survive.\n\nAt his victory party, Moore said he'd spoken Tuesday night with Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas. He also offered a national audience a glimpse of his religious-themed rhetoric.\n\nWe have to return the knowledge of God and the Constitution of the United States to the United States Congress, Moore said.\n\nI believe we can make America great, but we must make America good, he said. And we cannot make America good without acknowledging the sovereign source of that goodness … which is almighty God.\n\nWith 100% of precincts reporting, Moore had 54.6% of the vote to Strange's 45.4%, according to the Alabama Secretary of State's office.\n\nStrange conceded shortly after 8:30 p.m. local time, 9:30 p.m. ET.\n\nI am especially grateful for the support of President Trump and Vice President Pence, as well as the strong example set by my friends Richard Shelby and Jeff Sessions. I congratulate Roy Moore on the result this evening, Strange said in a statement. May God be with him and may God continue to bless Alabama and the United States of America.\n\nTrump, who campaigned for Strange last week and has tweeted in support of his candidacy, congratulated Moore on Twitter.\n\nCongratulations to Roy Moore on his Republican Primary win in Alabama. Luther Strange started way back & ran a good race. Roy, WIN in Dec! he tweeted.\n\nMoore later tweeted that he spoke to Trump, who endorsed his opponent, after his victory.\n\nHe tweeted, Great to talk with President Trump tonight about #ALSen! I very much look forward to working with the President to win in December!\n\nA source familiar with the call confirmed they spoke, saying Trump congratulated Moore on the victory. The President tweeted Wednesday morning that Moore sounds like a really great guy who ran a fantastic race.\n\nMoore's victory sets the stage for a spate of intra-party bouts in 2018's midterm elections. Already, conservative outsiders in Nevada, Arizona and elsewhere say they see in Moore's win a roadmap they can follow. And, like Moore, they have support from Steve Bannon, the former Trump White House chief strategist who has portrayed the contests as rebukes of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and congressional leadership that has failed to enact Trump's agenda.\n\nRELATED: Bannon, Farage say Roy Moore can save Trump from himself\n\nMoore now faces Democratic nominee Doug Jones in a December general election in the race to replace Sessions.\n\nMoore's win Tuesday night will thrust his long history of homophobic and racially tinged remarks into the spotlight.\n\nHe has campaigned on a platform of placing Christianity at the center of public life. In 2003, Moore was removed as state Supreme Court chief justice for refusing to take down a Ten Commandments monument. He was re-elected to the job, and then ousted again in 2016, when he refused to follow the US Supreme Court's ruling legalizing same-sex marriage.\n\nThough Alabama is a solidly red state, Democrats hope Jones, a former federal prosecutor who rose to prominence by leading the government's case against two perpetrators of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, can make the race competitive. Former Vice President Joe Biden plans to visit Alabama to campaign with Jones on October 3.\n\nAfter years of embarrassing headlines about top public officials in this state, this race is about the people of Alabama and about choosing a candidate with character and integrity they can be proud of, Jones said in a statement after Moore's win was announced. I will never embarrass the people of Alabama. I am running so the people of Alabama can be proud of their next senator.\n\nMoore overcame a barrage of negative television advertisements from forces aligned with McConnell.\n\nSteven Law, the president of the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund super PAC that spent $10 million against Moore, said he won this nomination fair and square and he has our support, as it is vital that we keep this seat in Republican hands.\n\nMoore and his allies persistently bashed McConnell, accusing him of attempting to buy a Senate seat.\n\nThey think you're a pack of morons. They think you're nothing but rubes, Bannon told Moore's supporters at an election eve rally in Fairhope.\n\nBut it was Strange's association with another controversial figure, former Gov. Robert Bentley, that left him damaged from the outset of his February appointment.\n\nThe appointment of Strange, then Alabama attorney general, came just before Bentley was ousted amid a sex scandal. That tinge of scandal tainted Strange, and both Moore and Rep. Mo Brooks, who finished third in the August primary and didn't make the cut for Tuesday's runoff, and cast Strange's appointment as corrupt.

(Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nRihanna claims her father and his business partner fraudulently used her name to make money and she's suing them over it.\n\nThe singer alleges that her father, Ronald Fenty, and his partner, Moses Perkins, falsely represented their company's affiliation with her.\n\nAlthough Mr. Fenty is Rihanna's father, he does not have, and never has had, authority to act on Rihanna's behalf, nor has he ever been authorized to use her name, intellectual property or publicity rights, the suit obtained by CNN reads. Similarly, neither Mr. Perkins nor the Company has any affiliation whatsoever with Rihanna.\n\nThe pair launched Fenty Entertainment, a production and talent company, in 2017.\n\nRihanna's popular Fenty Beauty line of cosmetics also launched in 2017. She has a lingerie product line as well.\n\nThe suit states that Fenty and Perkins have repeatedly been asked to stop misrepresenting themselves and to cease and desist all activity and efforts to exploit Rihanna's name and the goodwill associated with the Fenty brand.\n\nThe pair unsuccessfully attempted to register the Fenty name for a line of resort hotels, according to the suit.\n\nRihanna also alleges that Fenty and Perkins negotiated an unauthorized deal for her to perform 15 shows in Latin America for $15 million, and two 15-minute sets at Calibash at Staples Center and T-Mobile Arena for $400,000.\n\nThe singer is seeking to stop the pair from using her name or the Fenty brand, as well as damages and attorney's fees.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Rihanna talked about her complicated relationship with her father, who, she said, had a tumultuous marriage with her mother.\n\nHe taught me everything, Rihanna told Winfrey. As awful as he was to my mom at times, it didn't compare to how great he was as a father.\n\nCNN has reached out to Rihanna, Fenty and Perkins for comment.
Washington (CNN) A federal appeals court on Friday threw out a heavily promoted but long-shot lawsuit by a group of children and teenagers trying to force the federal government to take action to address the climate crisis.\n\nThe 2-1 ruling says the children must look to the political branches -- Congress and the executive branch -- for action, rather than the courts.\n\nAction in Washington, however, has gone the other way, with the Trump administration pulling out of the Paris climate accord and looking to rewrite Obama-era environmental laws limiting greenhouse gas emissions responsible for the increase in global temperatures and associated effects of climate change.\n\nThe plaintiffs have made a compelling case that action is needed; it will be increasingly difficult in light of that record for the political branches to deny that climate change is occurring, that the government has had a role in causing it, and that our elected officials have a moral responsibility to seek solutions, the majority opinion states.\n\nWe reluctantly conclude, however, that the plaintiffs' case must be made to the political branches or to the electorate at large, the latter of which can change the composition of the political branches through the ballot box. That the other branches may have abdicated their responsibility to remediate the problem does not confer on Article III courts, no matter how well-intentioned, the ability to step into their shoes.\n\nRead More
(CNN) There really is no better metaphor for Sunday's best picture race than that scene from The Matrix when Neo is asked by Morpheus to choose the blue pill or the red pill.\n\nOne pill, Neo is told, will allow him to stay in the comfortable delusion that the world is as it always has been. The other will reveal the truth -- that the world has changed -- and challenge his previously held beliefs as he moves to an uncertain but authentic future.\n\nWhich will the Academy voters choose: the blue pill or Parasite?\n\nA historic choice\n\nIn case you haven't been following the narrative, the genre-crossing South Korean film from director Bong Joon Ho -- called a thriller, a drama, horror and a dark comedy about the class divide all in the same breath -- stands to be a historic best picture winner if it comes to fruition.\n\nThe film, which centers on two families on the opposite sides of South Korea's economic gap, would be the first in a language other than English to win best picture, the first film from a South Korean director to do so, the first film with a primarily Asian cast to do so. Take your pick of firsts, but they all add up to this: Parasite is a movie unlike any of the past 91 best picture winners, and its victory would be a win for the film industry and for a community that still struggles to be seen.\n\nNo matter how you feel about award shows or the politics behind them, the platform of the Academy Awards is tremendous and a victory there would create a rainstorm that would cause many seeds to grow, not only for Asian cinema but for underrepresented voices of every nation, actor Lewis Tan, who stars in the upcoming film Mortal Kombat from Simon McQuoid and Warner Bros., told CNN. (The studio, like CNN, is owned by Warner Media.)\n\nOnly 11 films previously considered foreign language films by the Academy have been nominated for best picture, including Roma, Amour, Babel and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. (The category was re-named best international feature film because the Academy wanted to avoid the label foreign when referring to filmmakers. But the new name has come with some confusion of its own.)\n\nYeo-jeong Jo as Park Keon-kyo, the wealthy mother who opens her door to the Kim family in Bong Joon Ho's Parasite.\n\nA win for Parasite would come in a year when Academy voters have faced criticism for a glaring lack of representation among nominees.\n\nOnly one actor of color -- Cynthia Erivo, star of Harriet -- was nominated this year in the major acting categories.\n\nThe exclusion of the actors from Parasite from the list of individual nominees drew backlash, particularly because of the message it sends and problematic ideas it reinforces.\n\nIt just boils down to racism because people still don't see Asians as individuals, Nancy Wang Yuen, a sociologist and author of Reel Inequality: Hollywood Actors and Racism, told CNN. The whole mistaking one Asian for the other or 'Asians all look alike' [misconception] is still very much part and parcel of anti-Asian racism that exists in this country and, perhaps, in other Western countries as well. We're just seen as one big blob of Asians that are interchangeable, rather than as individuals that are worthy of accolades on our own.\n\nThe cast of Parasite did take home a SAG Award for best ensemble -- the first foreign-language film to earn that award. But scanning the list of the film's other awards and nominations, Yuen's point is valid. Actors from Parasite, including Song Kang Ho, Cho Yeo Jeong and Park Myung Hoon, were nominated for individual awards -- like the Asian Film Critics Association, the Austin Film Critics Association, and the Blue Dragon Awards. But nominations alluded the cast at the major award shows.\n\nPark So Dam (left) and Jung Hyeon Jun (second left) receive direction Bong Joon Ho on the set of Parasite.\n\nSome people said, 'Oh, it's because it's an ensemble piece,' but you know, 'Little Women' was ensemble, and a couple of them got nominations for best actress and best supporting, Yuen added.\n\nYou can slice the facts many ways.\n\nFor example, 1917, which was also nominated for best picture this year, also did not receive any individual acting nominations.\n\nAnd last year, Roma, which was primarily in Spanish, earned individual nominations for Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira.\n\nIn 1999, Roberto Benigni, who starred in the foreign language film Life is Beautiful, which was in Italian, won best actor.\n\nYuen, in her research, sees a trend.\n\nPeople are just seeing as far as race rather than who we are as individuals, she said. This is a reality for Asian Americans in this country. It's no surprise that they wouldn't be able to differentiate between actor, despite the fact that they are so talented. I think it's ridiculous that you would have a film receive six nominations, but none of the actors are nominated. Like, 'Oh, this film is so good, but the actors didn't do anything,'\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which earned 10 nominations and featured a cast of Chinese actors, received no individual nominations back in 2000.\n\nWhat could change\n\nRemember when  Moonlight  won best picture gave everyone so much hope?\n\nIt was the first film starring a black cast that explored a more nuanced depiction of the black experience -- not just racism and mistreatment -- to win best picture.\n\nThe year also saw the most individual black winners ever , with Mahershala Ali, Viola Davis, and Barry Jenkins among the winners.\n\nThis year, as noted previously, wasn't so great.\n\nSo what power does any underrepresented group really stand to gain from an Oscar?\n\nTan sees any victory for Parasite as a massive progression for Asian cinema but for cinema as a whole global dynamic.\n\nYuen agrees, saying it could open up opportunities for Asian-American actors, whose work has been unable to break through the awards circuit quite like Parasite. (See: Crazy Rich Asians, which was a success at the box office and a milestone moment for Asian representation, but unsuccessful in its bid for Oscars recognition.)\n\nI think the fact that Asian Americans are rooting for 'Parasite' is because we still aren't even seeing ourselves in main dramatic roles, she said. The more Asians succeed on the international stage, I think Asian Americans do feel like that will then open up more opportunities for Asian-American actors in Hollywood.\n\nShe notes that while no minority group is a monolith, in Hollywood, they tend to band together because we are racialized together.\n\nThere is power in numbers. But also in the art of film itself, said Tan.\n\nThe reason why cinema is such a powerful medium is its ability to share stories from all cultures and walks of life, Tan said. It shows the unity we share as humans, it enlivens us, inspires us, holds a mirror up and breaks down walls of ignorance which is where most fear comes from -- the unknown\n\nSo-dam Park, Sun-kyun Lee, Woo-sik Choi, Jeong-eun Lee, and Kang-ho Song accept Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture for 'Parasite' onstage during the 26th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards at The Shrine Auditorium on January 19, 2020 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nParasite is in contention for best picture with Little Women, 1917, Ford v Ferrari, Joker, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, The Irishman, Jojo Rabbit, and Marriage Story.\n\nThe war epic 1917, which won the BAFTA and Golden Globe for best picture, and Tarantino's star-packed ode to the Golden Age of Hollywood are considered to be Parasite's main competition.\n\nIf it does not win then we move forward with no loss of enthusiasm, Tan said. We use it as fuel for a burning fire.
Robbie Vargas-Cortes, 31, a paramedic and EMS supervisor, was scheduled to get his vaccination on December 23rd, and knew his boyfriend of five years was one of the vaccine administrators at Sanford Canton-Inwood Medical Center.\n\nI wanted for it to be a surprise, Vargas-Cortes told CNN.\n\nEric Vanderlee, a registered nurse, told CNN he had no idea the proposal was coming. When Vargas-Cortes rolled up his sleeve and there was already tape on his arm, he thought his boyfriend was jokingly indicating where the vaccine should go, like a bulls eye or something.\n\nBut Vargas-Cortes had taped a ring to his arm.\n\nIt just kind of dawned on me and I was like, 'absolutely, of course, yes.' It was just an amazing moment after I figured it out, Vanderlee said.\n\nVanderlee then had to administer the vaccine to his new fiancé.\n\nAnd within 10 minutes, Vargas-Cortes, vaccinated and engaged, was out the door responding to an ambulance call.\n\nCongratulations, Eric and Robby! Sanford Health said in a Facebook post along with video of the proposal.\n\nIf you like it you should put a ring and vaccine on it! Congrats!! one user commented on the post.\n\nVargas-Cortes said he had the ring for three years, and was waiting for the right moment to pop the question. We're nearing the end of the pandemic. The vaccine is kind of like a new chapter, he said.\n\nVanderlee volunteered last month to start administering the vaccine at Sanford Health.\n\nHe lost his previously healthy 86-year old grandfather, Norman Vanderlee, to Covid-19 in November.\n\nHe was a wonderful man, Vanderlee said. Even though we had seen Covid as employees, to finally have a family member die was shocking.\n\nFor Vanderlee, vaccination became a personal as well as a professional objective. I want to be a part of this end. I feel like I can't pass this up. It's like a once in a lifetime opportunity to be the one giving the vaccine if I have the chance, he said.\n\nThe couple says they will not be planning their wedding until after the pandemic. But they feel lucky to have the right to take the big step when they are ready.\n\nSouth Dakota is a very conservative state. We wouldn't have had the right to marry without the Supreme Court in 2015 . So to see such an outpouring of support, especially from our fellow South Dakotans, has been uplifting, Vargas-Cortes said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIt gives me a new confidence to be okay with who we are.

Given that Amazon launched after the pair were married, this rule would likely apply to virtually all of Jeff Bezos' current $137 billion net worth, experts say.\n\nIt is not known whether the couple has a pre- or post-nuptial agreement. It's also unclear whether they might file for divorce in a different state. They own properties in California, Texas and Washington D.C., among other locations.\n\nAssuming there is no prior agreement in place, the Amazon CEO may need to either sell off or transfer half of his more than 16% stake in the company to fulfill an equal split for the divorce, lawyers say.\n\nMacKenzie Bezos could then try to use her large stake in Amazon to push for changes at the company, potentially in opposition to her ex-husband. But it's unlikely this would lead to actual corporate change.\n\nIt's only 8% of the stock, said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush, …not enough to actually exert any control.\n\nJeff remains focused on and engaged in all aspects of Amazon, Drew Herdener, vice president of corporate communications, said in a statement provided to CNN.\n\nUnlike other tech CEOs, including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Snap's Evan Spiegel, Jeff Bezos' control over Amazon doesn't come from having a majority of voting power at the company, but rather from a strong leadership track record over two decades. That probably wouldn't change with a reduced stake. Indeed, his Amazon stake has been declining for years as he sells stock to fund his rocket company, Blue Origin.\n\nInstead, it's more likely that any tension between what would be Amazon's two largest individual shareholders would simply add potential drama to a situation where you may not want drama, said Charles Elson, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware.\n\nBut that assumes MacKenzie Bezos is looking for a fight. Hirsch told CNN that MacKenzie Bezos' legal counsel will almost certainly advise her that attempting to exercise control at Amazon not only risks creating a public spectacle, but also could undermine the value of her own holdings by interfering with business operations.\n\nMy guess is there are going to be opportunities during negotiations that may allow MacKenzie to receive even more than the public is anticipating in terms of assets in return for her complete cooperation, Hirsch says.\n\nAfter Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos released their statement, The New York Post and The National Enquirer reported that Jeff Bezos had begun seeing another woman. The tabloid stories, which CNN has not independently confirmed, do raise the prospect of a messier divorce than initially expected.\n\nIf they can somehow resolve this amicably after yesterday, they'll both walk away some of the wealthiest people in the world and it'll be fine, said Peter Walzer, founding partner at Walzer Melcher in California and president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers.\n\nBut, he added, in our business, when there's some kind of emotional issues involved and other people, it fuels a lot of fighting, attorney's fees and a waste of a lot of money. 
(CNN) On Monday morning, Illinois State House Speaker Mike Madigan made a stunning announcement: He would no longer try to get the 60 votes he needs to be elected to the post he has held almost continually since he first won it in 1983. Madigan represents one of the last vestiges of the old party boss system -- a man not terribly well-known outside of the city of Chicago but someone who, arguably, wields more influence than any other single figure in this massive Midwestern state.\n\nIn search of answers about how Madigan got here, I talked to Chicago Tribune political reporter Rick Pearson in December about Madigan -- and his future fate.\n\nCillizza: Explain, briefly the space Mike Madigan has occupied in Chicago Democratic politics for the last several decades.\n\nPearson: Madigan, 78, has been part of the fabric of city and state politics for more than a half century. He was born into the world of ward politics on the Southwest Side in the bungalow belt near Midway Airport where his father was a Democratic precinct captain. He also grew into the political patronage system, holding city jobs while becoming a trusted part of Mayor Richard J. Daley's machine.\n\nIn 1969, he was elected the youngest ward boss in the city at the age of 27. That year, Daley also tapped him to become a delegate to the convention that wrote the state's 1970 Constitution — its current governing document — as well as to keep an eye on another delegate, Daley's son, the future Mayor Richard M. Daley.\n\nIn 1970, Madigan was elected to the Illinois House, where he has served ever since. While city mayors came and went, Madigan continued to accumulate power and jobs through city and county allies, and in 1983 he became House speaker. He has held that post ever since, with the exception of 1995-1997 when Republicans took brief control of the chamber.\n\nThe year Madigan first became speaker also was the first year of the  Cutback Amendmen t , a voter-approved state constitutional amendment which created single-member House districts and reduced the size of the chamber by one-third. The real effect was to concentrate power -- and campaign money -- into the hands of the legislative leaders and Madigan proved to be a master fundraiser.\n\nGovernors both Republican and Democrat have acknowledged Madigan as the real power in Illinois politics -- through his ability to singularly control the fate of legislation and dictate the vote of his members being key to any politician's agenda. He would quash measures sought by Chicago mayors until he was able to extract concessions in return or punish them if they weren't offered. He made the local share of the state income tax temporary so that Mayor Richard M. Daley had to come back to him for help, allowing him to extract more from Daley.\n\nMadigan also is a property tax assessment attorney, which has proved to be a lucrative business. In addition to representing major city businesses in appealing property taxes, getting a cut of any reduction, business leaders also know of Madigan's clout and offer property tax business as recognition.\n\nMadigan also has further concentrated his power by holding the position of chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party, a post he was elected to in 1998. But unlike other states' party organizations which strive to be publicly active and take a role in national affairs, Madigan cared little about national politics -- even before Illinois turned into a reliably Democratic state on the presidential scene. Instead, he used the party as a closed operation to help further his Democratic majorities in areas that had been traditionally Republican -- such as the suburban collar counties which surround Chicago and Cook County.\n\nCillizza: Madigan is the longest-serving state speaker of the House in the country -- in power for all but two years since 1983. How has he managed to last so long amid so many changes within the Democratic Party?\n\nPearson: On the old Star Trek series, there was a On the old Star Trek series, there was a 3-D chessboard . Consider Madigan to be the political grandmaster. For much of his career, Madigan was able to outmaneuver political adversaries on issues to the point of either sensing the tide on an issue and getting in front of it, waiting his opponents out or helping to defeat them.\n\nBut Madigan has also lasted because of his ability to change. At one time, citing his Roman Catholic faith, Madigan was opposed to abortion and his ideology could be viewed almost as a Blue Dog centrist-to-conservative Democrat. But with his ability to adapt, Madigan eventually oversaw progressive legislation making Illinois a leader in abortion rights, one of the first states to enact same-sex marriage before the US Supreme Court ruled and the 11th state to legalize recreational adult use of marijuana.\n\nProgressive is still not a word used to describe Madigan. Madigan's primary goal [is] maintaining power and a Democratic legislative majority.\n\nCillizza: Has Madigan ever faced a real threat to his power? When and why?\n\nPearson: Previously, the only threat Madigan faced to his power, aside from the two years when Republicans held the Illinois House, came under Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich and recently defeated one-term Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner.\n\nBlagojevich sought to build alliances with then-Democratic Illinois Senate President Emil Jones to try to advance his agenda, though it was widely viewed as damaging to the state's economy and unaffordable. Blagojevich would tell Jones that no one viewed him as a power or respected him as Senate president because Madigan was widely regarded as the power in Illinois. This created tensions between Madigan and Jones, and Madigan ultimately used the House to kill off most of Blagojevich's ill-conceived initiatives. Those feelings were beneath the obvious issues that included trying to shake down a children's hospital and sell a US Senate seat that led to Blagojevich's eventual impeachment, removal from office and federal conviction.\n\nUnder Rauner, a wealthy equity investor, Madigan faced his toughest battles. Rauner used his cash to bankroll Republican legislative candidates, using ads calling Madigan corrupt and blaming Madigan for all of the perceived ills that had befallen Illinois. Rauner also backed a pro-business, anti-union agenda that sought to weaken one of Madigan's greatest sources of financial support — organized labor.\n\nThe ideological clash between the two led to Illinois going two years without a state budget with government funded through court orders that far outstripped available cash. Ultimately, Madigan won support from some Republicans for a budget and income tax increase in an attempt to repair the wreckage caused to social service agencies and places like Illinois colleges and universities.\n\nRauner lasted one term and lost to Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker in 2018.\n\nThough Rauner has departed the political scene, his heavy spending and daily criticisms of Madigan inflicted serious damage. Once a figure that everyday Illinoisans never knew, Madigan has become viewed as extremely unpopular -- even before the federal investigation in which he has been implicated.\n\nCillizza: Why is this the moment that Madigan appears to be in real trouble in his effort to remain as speaker? Is all his history finally catching up with him?\n\nPearson: Reflecting his ability to adapt, Madigan now finds a caucus with a large contingent of women members. But in 2018, cracks developed in support for : Reflecting his ability to adapt, Madigan now finds a caucus with a large contingent of women members. But in 2018, cracks developed in support for Madigan amid the #MeToo movement when he faced issues regarding sexual harassment in both his political and governmental operation. He discarded veteran political operatives including his longtime chief of staff, appointed more women to senior posts and promised to do more to prevent any recurrences.\n\nBut frustration with Madigan has been building with a younger, more progressive caucus straining under an autocratic style which lets members advance only a few of their bills per session.\n\nThen in July, Commonwealth Edison, the state's largest electrical utility, agreed to pay a $200 million fine and cooperate with federal prosecutors in acknowledging its part of a near decade-long bribery and influence scheme, seeking to win Madigan's favor on legislation by giving jobs and contracts to Madigan's top allies.\n\nOn Wednesday, the former CEO of ComEd and once one of the city's most powerful businesswomen, Anne Pramaggiore, two other utility players and Madigan's top private sector confidant, lobbyist and former lawmaker Michael McClain, pleaded not guilty to charges associated with the scheme\n\nRank-and-file Democratic lawmakers and candidates in the November 3 election said that as they tried to explain their positions on issues, voters repeatedly said their chief interest was what were they going to do about Madigan.\n\nDistrust of Madigan was also cited as a factor in the defeat of the governor's signature agenda item, a proposed state constitutional amendment to change Illinois from a flat-rate income tax to a graduated-rate tax that rises with income, a system similar to the federal government and used by more than 30 states. Opponents, largely funded by business interests, continually raised the question of do you trust politicians with more tax money? The amendment was rejected overwhelmingly by voters in a hugely expensive campaign.\n\nPritzker contends the amendment's loss is in part due to Madigan and has said he should consider stepping down . US Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber's leadership, also said the party paid a heavy price for Madigan's leadership after his favored local congressional candidate, Betsy Dirksen Londrigan of Springfield, was defeated by four-term US Rep. Rodney Davis of Taylorville. Davis tarred Londrigan with ads associating her with Madigan.\n\nMadigan had always been viewed on the outside as smart enough to avoid being caught in the city and state's history of corruption. He has not been charged with any wrongdoing. He doesn't have a cell phone or use email. He said he retains sizable support in his caucus and will seek reelection as speaker and doesn't intend to step down.\n\nBut in politics, perception caries a great deal of weight and the public perception of Madigan is now being joined by at least 19 members of his expected 73-member majority in the new General Assembly that convenes in January. Rather than a leader, the dissidents consider him a hindrance and a distraction.\n\nCillizza: Finish this sentence: In January the next Speaker of the Illinois state House will be ________. Now, explain.\n\nPearson: I don't mean to weasel out here but this is very much an open question. In the past, there were heirs apparent to Madigan should he have stepped down. But Madigan has outlasted them. The women's caucus is sizable and has now become a political force. The Black caucus in the House has always been influential. Progressives have become a larger factor in the chamber and they will want to be represented. Members of Madigan's current leadership team want consideration.

Seoul, South Korea (CNN) The South Korean military said it will make an unprecedented decision about the future of transgender soldiers who serve in the armed forces following a noncommissioned officer's decision to undergo sex reassignment surgery.\n\nThe case has sparked a wider discussion in the socially conservative country about the rights of gay and transgender South Koreans.\n\nDuring a briefing Thursday, a South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman said there are no regulations on the books that outline what to do when a transgender soldier undergoes transition surgery. A committee will decide in the coming days whether to discharge the soldier or allow her to keep serving in the military, the spokesman said.\n\nUnder current regulations, transgender Koreans are prohibited from entering the military, but there are no regulations regarding soldiers in active service, the spokesman clarified.\n\nThe soldier, who has not been named, underwent sex reassignment surgery in Thailand late last year while she was on personal leave. She is a professional officer who was not drafted, but rather signed up for the military.\n\nRead More
(CNN) —\n\nNot all yoga mats are created equally. Key things to keep in mind when mat shopping are grip, thickness, material and size — not to mention your preferred workout. If you're an advanced yogi who prefers feeling rooted to the floor, for example, you're going to want a thinner mat. Recovering from an old knee injury? Opt for a mat with extra cushion to protect your pressure points; we'd recommend a thickness of at least 5 millimeters.\n\nYou'll also want to consider where you'll be downward dogging for the foreseeable future. If your workout space is a carpeted room, for instance, you want a heavier mat with textured grooves so it doesn't slide. If you're sneaking in your sessions on hardwood, a cushiony mat that grips the floor is going to be your jam.\n\nAfter researching top-rated and editor-favorite mats, we settled on a pool of nine that we rigorously tested with multiple at-home yoga workouts. The good news, other than the fact that we've never been so limber in our lives, is that we found a few clear standouts across key categories that we feel will cover most people's needs:\n\nPretty much everything Lululemon makes is steeped in good design and quality materials, and that includes our overall winner, the Reversible Mat 5MM (starting at $68; lululemon.com). Hands down our favorite feature of the mat is the fact that it's dual-sided, allowing the user to decide if they want to Ashtanga on the smooth and sticky polyurethane-coated top side or the textured natural rubber bottom side that provides loads of traction. Beyond that, though, we also loved that the mat is slightly oversized and provides ample cushion given its 5-millimeter thickness.\n\nWhile the ultra-slim, extremely foldable nature of the Manduka Eko Superlite Travel Yoga Mat ($44; amazon.com) is appealing in and of itself (especially for frequent travelers), it's also our favorite zero-slip option, with supreme grip and complete floor stability. And as if that news weren't good enough, the mat is also totally eco-friendly, made from biodegradable natural tree rubber.\n\nBecause we're always, always looking for an extra-supportive mat, we're thrilled to include Gaiam's Premium Yoga Mat (starting at $24; amazon.com) on our list, earning it the best thick yoga mat title that also wins bonus points for its under-$30 price tag. Available in more than two dozen fun patterns and designs, the PVC (aka a synthetic rubber called polyvinyl chloride) mat boasts 6 millimeters of cushion and features a deep texture that ensures little to no slipping. While it doesn't have the extreme grip we found in the Lululemon Reversible Mat, the Gaiam is a perfect entry mat for beginner yogis and anyone on the hunt for a quality thick mat.\n\nThink all yoga is alike? Think again! Hot yoga is an entirely different (and hotter) animal, and regular practitioners can definitely rely on the Manduka Pro Yoga Mat 6MM ($120; amazon.com and manduka.com) to withstand the sheer amount of sweat produced in one sweltering class. Ultra dense, the PVC mat's weight works to cement it into your flooring, while it's ultra-tacky top side features a state-of-the-art texture that results in a no-slip grip — yes, even when you're dripping in sweat.\n\nWhile beginners could certainly fare well with any of the mats on our list, they're sure to set themselves up for success with the Liforme Original Yoga Mat ($149.95; amazon.com). The Rolls-Royce of yoga mats, the Liforme is much sleeker and bigger than standard options — it clocks in at 72 inches long by 27 inches wide — and it comes with more than a dozen alignment markers that show users exactly where they should be placing their hands and feet, whether they're standing, lunging, downward dogging or even just lying on their back. Working as a navigational tool of sorts, the markers are especially helpful for beginners practicing at home without a live instructor present to correct their form.\n\nBest yoga mat overall: Lululemon Reversible Mat 5MM (starting at $68; lululemon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Courtney Thompson/CNN Lululemon Reversible Mat 5MM\n\nLululemon's Reversible Mat topped our list for a lot of reasons, chief among them that the mat has two sides, making it the most versatile option we tested. After all, who doesn't love a twofer? Users can choose between a smooth or textured mat (for one price!), and we found that regardless of which side you use, the mat provides superior stability — its hand and feet gripping is unmatched, and it never slipped when placed on hardwood or carpeted flooring.\n\nThe mat's top layer is coated with polyurethane, which we found to be excellent at absorbing moisture, and it feels silky smooth under your hands and feet, with a sticky effect that's great for sweatier workouts. The textured natural rubber base layer is definitely geared more toward low-sweat workouts but provides equally superior traction when in use.\n\nWe found the Reversible Mat's 5 millimeters of cushioning ample enough to provide support to sensitive areas (i.e., weak wrists, hips, etc.), masking the hard floor underneath. It's also slightly larger than the standard yoga mat (which typically measures 68 inches by 24 inches), coming in 3 inches longer and 2 inches wider than most — enough to provide you a bit more coverage without being too huge. That said, if you do want huge (84 inches by 28 inches), this exact mat comes in a much bigger format.\n\nWhile the brand warns of an out-of-box odor, we detected a faint scent that had completely dissipated after just a few minutes. In terms of cleaning, the smooth side wipes down in one quick pass of a soapy cloth, while the textured side unsurprisingly took a bit longer, given its matte nature. One downside is that the mat doesn't come with a bag or strap, and given its size and 5.24-pound weight, it's a bit clunky to carry around solo. Lululemon sells a variety of carrying accessories, starting at $16.\n\nEpitomizing the marriage of form and function, the dreamy design has the mesmerizing effect of a lava lamp with its tie dye-esque pattern that's currently available in red/pink and black/white colorways. Point being: You're going to look like a total pro with this mat, whether you're rolling into a (socially distanced) class or practicing from home. Last, but definitely not least, Lululemon's got your back with this Quality Promise policy that ensures if the mat doesn't perform to your expectations, the brand will take it back for the lifetime of the product.\n\nBest nonslip yoga mat: Manduka eKO Superlite Yoga and Pilates Travel Mat ($44; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Courtney Thompson/CNN Manduka eKO Superlite Travel Yoga Mat\n\nWhat we love most about the Manduka eKO Superlite Yoga and Pilates Travel Mat is that if you took away its portability selling points (more on those below!), it's a superior nonslip mat. Here's why: While it's light enough to travel with, the mat still maintains enough weight to stick to the floor and stay put, whether it's on hard surfaces or carpet — which is rare for a thinner, lightweight mat. But the mat's chief asset is the excellent grip provided by its tightly woven surface. With a slightly dimpled appearance and a tacky texture, the mat provided tons of traction and stability during even our sweatiest workouts.\n\nWhile traveling might not be part of our current agendas, it's certainly something we're all hoping for in the near future, and if you're someone who loves to do yoga on the road — or someone who lives in a small space and simply wants a yoga mat that can be easily tucked away — look no further than this mat. Weighing only 2.2 pounds (most standard mats clock in around 5-plus pounds), the 1.5-millimeter-thick mat can be folded into a 10-inch-by-12-inch rectangle that can be neatly tucked into your tote, backpack or suitcase.\n\nIn terms of cushioning, there isn't much here, which is to be expected from a super-portable mat (and why it didn't snag our overall winning spot). If you're someone who loves a spongy mat with extra padding, this is not the option for you. But lots of advanced yogis prefer a thinner mat, as they provide greater stability, especially when practicing more active or focused poses.\n\nEco-friendly shoppers are sure to delight in just how sustainable this mat choice is. Completely free of toxic chemicals, dyes and latex, it's made from sustainably harvested, non-Amazon tree rubber in a zero-waste manufacturing facility. Did we mention that it's completely biodegradable too? Yes, really.\n\nMoral of the story here is that if you're looking for a zero-slip yoga mat option with incredible portability and a slew of feel-good, eco-friendly selling points, this is it. More great news: It's under $50, and Manduka offers a lifetime guarantee.\n\nBest thick yoga mat: Gaiam Premium Yoga Mat 6MM (starting at $24; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Courtney Thompson/CNN Gaiam Premium Yoga Mat\n\nChock-full of springy, PVC cushion, the rubber-free Gaiam Premium Yoga Mat is perfect for anyone looking for a little extra support for their elbows and knees during their weekly Cat Cow poses. Clocking in at 6 millimeters thick, the mat is twice as thick as most on the market, providing loads of joint protection. More about that thickness: Though it's a whopping 6 millimeters, the mat feels more dense than spongelike, meaning we had zero problems finding stability, even with the extra cushion underfoot.\n\nWhile the grip isn't quite as firm as the Lululemon Reversible Mat, it is still among the strongest we tested, and definitely the best of the cheapish options. Featuring a surface full of tiny textured grooves, the mat has a tacky feel, offering up lots of springy traction, even during sweatier sessions. That said, if you're someone who wants to feel completely cemented into your mat, the Lululemon Reversible is going to be a better choice.\n\nAnother major selling point? That price. Not everyone wants to spend a small fortune on a yoga mat…us included! If you want to get the most bang for your buck, this is the absolute best choice at this price point.\n\nOne of our favorite details about the Gaiam mat, however, is that it weighs only 3.4 pounds, making it ultra lightweight for a mat that is also ultra thick. While it doesn't come with a strap or bag, it is a bit easier to transport because it's lighter than most. Given its diminutive mass, however, we did find the mat took a few days to uncurl completely at the ends upon initial use.\n\nBoasting a lifetime guarantee from Gaiam, the mat, which is free of latex and phthalates, is available in 30 colorways (the most of any mat on this list!), ranging from jewel-toned tribal patterns to sedate darker designs, and each comes with one free yoga class that can be downloaded from the Gaiam app.\n\nWith more than 12,000 positive Amazon reviews and a 4.7-star rating, this Gaiam mat is a customer favorite too, and it's easy to see why.\n\nBest hot yoga mat: Manduka Pro Yoga Mat 6MM ($120; amazon.com and manduka.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Manduka Pro Yoga Mat 6MM\n\nOne of the best overall mats we tested, the Manduka Pro Yoga Mat is just that — made for pros! Specifically, pros who love nothing more than a sweatier-than-thou workout. Even if you're not a typically sweaty person, hot-yoga classes are held at temperatures ranging from 90 degrees Fahrenheit up to 108, with loads of humidity in there to boot. Point being: You're going to be dripping, and you definitely want a no-slip mat that can withstand all that wetness. Enter: Manduka Pro Yoga Mat.\n\nA beast in its own right, the 6-millimeter-thick mat is beloved by advanced yogis and instructors alike for its density and top and underside gripping, all of which were the reasons we felt it performed better than any other mat we tested during hot yoga. Clocking in at a whopping 7.5 pounds, the PVC mat's sheer weight anchors it to the floor and ensures a stable workout. The Pro's top-side texture comprises vertical and horizontal grooves that produced some of the best grip we experienced during testing, even when we had sweat dripping all over the place. The underside also has tons of grip, in the form of a rugged dot pattern that we found stayed put on both carpeted and hardwood floors.\n\nThe brand recommends breaking in the mat prior to your first use, which we did, by sprinkling the surface with salt and letting it sit in the sun for 24 hours, then wiping it down with a damp cloth — a process that is a little tedious when really you just want to get going with your workout. Another negative: Given it's heavier-than-most weight, the mat's portability can be a bear, and it doesn't come with a strap or bag.\n\nAll in all, however, we found the Manduka Pro to be an excellent mat for both hot-yoga and regular yoga devotees and thus worthy of its steep price point. Not only is it backed by a lifetime warranty from Manduka, the mat is also Oeko-Tex certified and latex-free.\n\nBest yoga mat for beginners: Liforme Original Yoga Mat ($149.95; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Liforme Original Yoga Mat\n\nThe Liforme Original Yoga Mat is a great mat on its own, not to mention fancy — we love the smooth, almost silky top side and dense, 4.2-millimeter-thick natural rubber cushion. An investment, sure, but its alignment markers are a true highlight not found on most other mats. Giving cues to newbie and pro yogis alike, the subtle design of the mat works as a cheat sheet for beginners, making hand and foot placement much steadier (and easier!) during your yoga practices, especially for those of us who are getting our namaste on from home, without the positioning help from a live instructor.\n\nAvailable in five happy colors (from a pretty pink to Kelly green), the mat features more than a dozen indicators (etched in a slightly darker shade of the mat's color) from top to bottom, including end-to-end lines that keep hands and feet parallel lengthways, reverse points that keep your hands and feet even when on your back, central lines that keep you centered widthways and 45-degree lines that align your back heels when in standing postures. Having used these markers in our own workouts, we felt more confident as we glided through the motions, knowing that each of our poses was not only accurate but also safe, preventing any unwanted injuries that could occur when left to our own (somewhat uneducated) devices. Those lines also helped us to achieve optimal results and learn exactly where we should be on the mat and thus how our bodies should feel in those positions.\n\nBeyond the mat's built-in tutorial, we also totally appreciated its grip. Covered in an eco-polyurethane layer on the top side, the Liforme mat delivers a no-slip grip that lends itself to a very stable, secure flow. And then there's the mat's eco-friendly nature. Calling itself the most planet-friendly yoga mat, Liforme is composed of naturally sourced sustainable rubber, is PVC-free, has no toxic ingredients and is biodegradable in one to five years in the rare chance it ends up in a landfill.\n\nSadly, sustainability isn't cheap, especially when it comes in the form of a professional-grade yoga mat. The good news is that this is the only mat we tested that came with a sleek carry case, which in our minds helps to further justify that $140 price tag.\n\nHow we tested\n\nWe said it before and we'll say it again: There are a lot of yoga mats out there! To determine our test pool, we scoured the market for bestsellers, top-rated mats, editor favorites and critically hailed options. From there, we tested nine yoga mats with a minimum of three yoga sessions each, ranging from Vinyasa Flow and Hatha-style classes to sweat-inducing Power Yoga, and we did so atop both carpet and hardwood flooring to assess each mat's stability level on different surfaces. Our testing process lasted for more than a month, and during those many, many yoga practices, we also evaluated the following criteria.\n\nFunction\n\nThickness/support: This category was majorly important, and where we looked at not only the exact thickness of each mat but also how supportive and stable each one was. A quick backstory: Thinner mats tend to be preferred by longtime yogis who desire the utmost stability while feeling rooted to the floor; thicker mats are much gentler on the joints (especially the knees and wrists), are beneficial to anyone recovering from an injury and and can range from dense and stable to spongy and unpredictable depending on their constitution.\n\nGrip : Here we noted how well the hands and feet could grip the mat's material, both when dry and when exposed to, say, sweat dripping from your forehead.\n\nAbility to lie flat : Can the mat roll flat right out of the box? If not, how many hours or days did it lie completely flat?\n\nPortability : Does the mat come with a strap or bag? How heavy and bulky is the mat? Is it easy enough to carry to and from a class?\n\nSize: The standard yoga mat size is 68 inches by 24 inches, and we assessed if each mat in our pool is on par or larger than that standard.\n\nMaterial\n\nFeel under skin : For this category we assessed the textures and top coats of our test pool and how they felt under our hands and feet as we glided through our yoga practices.\n\nEco-friendly/sustainable attributes : Here we took a look at how eco-friendly both mat itself and its maker are. Is the mat made from natural rubber? If it's a PVC mat, is it free of phthalates and other toxic ingredients? Is it produced in a zero-waste facility? Is the mat biodegradable? Does it have an Oeko-Tex certification (which declares it free of harmful substances)? As for the brand, how invested in eco practices are they?\n\nOdor : Some mats are known to give on an initial, unappealing smell, so we gave each mat a thorough sniff test.\n\nEase of cleaning: Most manufacturers recommend wiping down your mat with a warm, soapy cloth after each use — but cleaning each mat is not always simple given their texture and composition. We noted how easy (or not!) the cleaning process was.\n\nOptions\n\nSize availability : We noted if the mat is available in multiple lengths or widths.\n\nColor/pattern choices: We noted how many colorways and/or patterns the mat is available in.\n\nWarranty: We looked into each product's warranty, if it had one, and how many years it covers.\n\nHow we rated\n\nBased upon the categories and criteria listed above, we gave the mats a score in each subcategory, then combined those numbers for a maximum score in each category, then totaled those numbers for a final overall score. We broke down the scores as follows:\n\nFunction had a maximum of 50 points: Thickness/support (15 points), grip (15 points), ability to lie flat (10 points), portability (5 points) and size (5 points).\n\nMaterials had a maximum of 30 points: Feel under skin (10 points), eco-friendly/sustainable materials (10 points), odor (5 points), ease of cleaning (5 points).\n\nOptions had a maximum of 15 points: Sizing options (10) and color/pattern choices (5).\n\nWarranty had a maximum of 5 points: No warranty (0 points), up to five years (2 points), lfive to 10 years (3 points) or lifetime (5 points).\n\n\n\nIn addition to the overall score, we also factored in the price of each yoga mat.\n\nOther yoga mats we tested\n\nJade Yoga Harmony Mat (starting at $79.95; amazon.com or jadeyoga.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Jade Yoga Harmony Mat\n\nIf you're looking for a greener yoga practice, the Jade Yoga Harmony Mat is a solid choice. PVC-free and made in the USA, the 4.5-millimeter thick natural rubber mat's textured surface offers up a sticky resilience perfect for low-impact and high-octane workouts alike, while the underside stays put on hard floors and carpeting. Available in two lengths (68 and 74 inches), the mat comes in a slew of cute colors, from fire engine red to a pretty slate blue. One downside was that the flat texture of the mat tended to pick up lots of dust and debris off our floors, which made wiping it clean a bit tougher. Bonus: Jade Yoga plants a tree for every mat sold, and even the mat's label is printed on recycled paper with soy ink. Unfortunately, the brand offers only a one-year warranty.\n\nGaiam Performance Dry Grip Yoga Mat 5MM (starting at $50; amazon.com; $69.98; gaiam.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Gaiam Performance Dry Grip Yoga Mat 5MM\n\nHot yoga devotees, listen up: The Gaiam Performance Dry Grip Yoga Mat 5MM was created specifically to wick away moisture (and maintain grip) even as practice temperatures increase, and we can attest it holds up to its promise. During one particularly sweaty yoga session, the mat stayed dried the entire time (even when we didn't!). We liked the PVC mat's smooth surface, and the soft support of its 5-millimeter density. Free of latex and phthalates, this a good option for those looking for a thick, rubber-free mat that is relatively lightweight (it's 4.25 pounds).\n\nYoga Accessories 1/4 Thick High Density Yoga Mat ($25.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Yoga Accessories 1/4 Thick High Density Yoga Mat\n\nRed alert for tall yogis everywhere: This is the budget-friendly mat for you! Running a full 6 inches longer than standard mats, the Yoga Accessories 1/4 Thick High Density Yoga Mat is 74-inches long, making it ideal for our tallest friends out there. Rhis latex- and phthalates-free PVC mat is also the thickest we tested, coming in at 6.25 millimeters, which makes it a solid choice for anyone in need of extra joint support. The mat has a spongier feel that some might find lacking in stability, but it provides a decent grip and weighs only 3.6 pounds, which makes it easy to lug to and from classes. Available in 17 pretty hues, from sunburst yellow to bubblegum pink, the mat is another Amazon fave with more than 3,000 positive reviews and a 4.5-star rating.\n\nJade Yoga Voyager Mat ($39.95; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Jade Yoga Voyager Mat\n\nThe most portable of Jade Yoga's earth-friendly yoga mats, the Voyager Mat measures just 1.5 millimeters in thickness and is made of natural rubber (read: it's PVC-free!). At 1.5 pounds, the lightweight mat is great for travel and portability — it folds into a 9-by-9-by-2-inch rectangle and can easily be tucked out of sight in your home when not in use. But its thin nature can also be a detriment. We struggled with it sliding on the flooring (when tested both atop carpet and hardwood), which affected our workout stability and tried our patience more than a little. We do, however, appreciate that Jade Yoga is an ultra-sustainable brand that plants a tree for every mat sold.\n\nMore from CNN Underscored's hands-on testing:

The village chief of Embiti adopted Roger while a family in a nearby village took Laurie under their wing.\n\nAfter decking out Laurie in traditional garb, her face painted by warriors and grass put in her shoe (to symbolize food for their cattle), the bride was ready to be presented to her groom, who was equally made up.\n\nParticipants do a celebratory walk from the bride's village to the groom's. Dancing and singing Maasai await them and gifts are exchanged and a dowry negotiated.\n\nTurns out Laurie was a bargain: I was worth one cow and one goat, a very affordable bride! A Maasai wedding complete with food, a week-long safari, accommodation and transport costs about $20,000.\n\n5. Go on a cheese tour\n\nAward-winning African cheese. Courtesy of Brown's Cheese\n\nKenya and cheese -- not two things that automatically come to mind. However, 30 minutes out of Nairobi is the award winning Brown's Cheese factory. Its product has won many accolades, including the South African Dairy Championship and awards from the East Africa Cheese Festival.\n\nBrown's philosophy is to run the farm on purely biodynamic and organic principles.\n\nThe factory tour shows how the cheese is made, after which guests can settle down to a cheese platter, followed by a three-course lunch complete with homemade chutneys, bread and homegrown salad. Brown's also offers cheese-making classes and, for kids, milking sessions with the factory's Friesian cows.\n\nAn afternoon at the farm costs about KES 3,600 ($36) per person and includes up to three glasses of wine or beer. Kids under five are free, 5-11 years rate is KES 500 and 12-plus years rate is KES 1,500. Tours by appointment only.\n\n6. Go on the Rhino Charge\n\nWhere's highway maintenance when you need it? Courtesy of Eric Kihiu\n\nOne hundred square kilometers of rough terrain, 10 hours, 13 check points, one map, one 4x4 and no set route. Reach the most checkpoints in the shortest distance for victory. Just watch for the lions.\n\nThis is Kenya's annual off-road motor sport competition -- the Rhino Charge. The precise location is kept secret until a few days before so competitors don't go on sneaky reconnaissance missions.\n\nThe event is held every May or June, organized by The Rhino Ark Charitable Trust. The rally raises money for the conservation of Kenya's Aberdare Ecosystem. Only 60 vehicles can participate in order to minimize environmental damage. The more cash you can put up, the more likely you are to get a place. Crews must be between two and six people.\n\nRhino Charge , Nairobi; +254 (0) 20 213 6010 or 213 6011\n\n7.

Courtesy of Bio-Ken Snake Farm\n\nThere are more than 100 snake species in Kenya, and snake safari outfit Bio-ken arranges tours to spot them in forests, riverbeds, rocky cliffs and mangroves.\n\nThe most popular package is a three-night snake safari along the banks of the Galana River. An alternative is the Big Five safari -- a search for pythons, boomslangs, puff adders, cobras and mambas.\n\nSome of Kenya's top reptile experts lead the trip, the aim of which is to improve awareness and education about snakes and their role in the eco-system. Check out a video here\n\nThe three-night snake safari costs $1,200 per person, per night. Prices of the longer Big Five safaris are tailored according to customer preference.

Valletta, Malta (CNN) The European Union has set out its draft negotiating position on Brexit -- and declared that it does not want to punish Britain for leaving.\n\nBrexit is punitive enough, said Donald Tusk, President of the European Council.\n\nThe EU nevertheless set out a tough set of principles for Brexit negotiations. They offer the possibility that trade talks could begin before the UK leaves -- but only after sufficient progress is made on the complex task of untangling Britain from the EU.\n\nIn her letter triggering the UK's formal exit from the EU , British Prime Minister Theresa May had asked for a parallel approach from the start.\n\nTusk ruled that out, saying that the talks on trade could only begin once there had been enough progress on the withdrawal agreement. A final trade deal would not be concluded until after Brexit.\n\nAccording to the negotiating guidelines, progress on a number of key areas must be made before preliminary discussions on trade can start. They include:\n\nprotecting the rights of EU citizens in Britain and UK citizens in other EU nations;\n\nworking out the bill for Britain's exit, based on its financial commitments and liabilities;\n\nestablishing a clear legal framework to avoid uncertainty for businesses and institutions;\n\nhow to maintain a soft border between the Republican of Ireland, which will remain in the EU, and Northern Ireland, part of the UK.\n\nThese four issues are all part of the first phase of our negotiations, Tusk said in Valletta, Malta, where center-right EU leaders are meeting.\n\nOnce, and only once we have achieved sufficient progress on the withdrawal, can we discuss the framework for our future relationship. Starting parallel talks on all issues at the same time, as suggested by some in the UK, will not happen.\n\n'Damage control'\n\nTusk said the EU would firmly stand by the proposals in the document and characterized the thorny process ahead as, in essence, damage control.\n\nThe talks which are about to start will be difficult, complex and sometimes even confrontational. There is no way around it. The EU27 does not and will not pursue a punitive approach. Brexit in itself is already punitive enough, he said.\n\nDonald Tusk, President of the European Council, speaks in Valletta, Malta.\n\nBut after more than 40 years of marriage, he said, we owe it to each other to do everything we can to make this divorce as smooth as possible.\n\nThe British government said it looked forward to beginning negotiations once the draft guidelines have been formally agreed by the other 27 EU states. Leaders of the 27 states will discuss their negotiating position at a summit at the end of April before formal talks with Britain begin.\n\nJUST WATCHED Brexit: What happens after Article 50? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Brexit: What happens after Article 50? 01:29\n\nIt is clear both sides wish to approach these talks constructively, and as the Prime Minister said this week, wish to ensure a deep and special partnership between the UK and the European Union, a UK government spokesman said.\n\nEven as the process gets under way, it's clear that many obstacles and potential pitfalls lie ahead.\n\nPossibility of failure\n\nThe draft EU document, which runs to nine pages, lays out EU leaders' plans for a phased approach to negotiations, with trade talks to begin only when the EU is ready.\n\nThe British government has indicated that it ... would like to pursue an ambitious free trade agreement with the European Union. Based on the Union's interests, the European Council stands ready to initiate work towards such an agreement, to be finalised and concluded once the United Kingdom is no longer a Member State, the document says.\n\nThe draft guidelines also recognize the possibility that talks between Britain and the EU members might fail.\n\nIn these negotiations the Union will act as one. It will be constructive throughout and will strive to find an agreement. This is in the best interest of both sides. The Union will work hard to achieve that outcome, but it will prepare itself to be able to handle the situation also if the negotiations were to fail, the document says.\n\nNegotiations under Article 50 will be conducted as a single package, the document adds. In accordance with the principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, individual items cannot be settled separately.\n\nMay formally triggered the Brexit process on Wednesday, firing the starting gun on a two-year effort to disentangle Britain from the European Union.

Editor's Note: Lorenza Brascia Ingram is an editorial producer for CNN based in New York. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. For more on Sex and Love Around the World, tune in to Christiane Amanpour's new series on Saturdays at 10 p.m. ET/PT beginning March 17.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nSitting on the couch in my New York apartment, I sipped some wine and hesitantly typed the last few digits of my debit card into a subscription box on a paid dating site. At the time, I was a 24-year-old producer traveling the country, covering breaking news and the 2016 election. I had built a network of great colleagues and friends.\n\nAnd yet, despite my career and friendships, I knew something was missing: love.\n\nSince graduating college, dating had felt like a second job, and not a particularly enjoyable one at that. A lot of guys I encountered on Hinge, Bumble and other dating apps seemed to just want to date casually.\n\nLorenza Ingram\n\nI suppose I shouldn't have been surprised. Studies show that marriage isn't the same priority for millennials as it was for our parents and grandparents. We are focused on our careers, and we are comfortable being single.\n\nExcept, while I loved my career and respected those who wanted to be single, I also wanted a long-term relationship – a soulmate, just like my parents had found in each other 30 years ago.\n\nIf I wanted a relationship with long-term potential, though, I had to take a different route – and possibly one that carried a fee. A co-worker urged me to try a paid dating site. See what happens, she said.\n\nThe idea of paying $102.32 – the cost of a subscription for two months at the time – felt strange to me. My older sister fell in love with her husband in college. My parents met in high school. Going on a paid dating site felt foreign in comparison to the more organic examples of love around me.\n\nBut eventually I got past my inhibitions, and in the summer of 2016, my sister helped pick profile photos to showcase on my new dating profile. I drafted a short bio that described my love for work, travel, family and friends. And as messages started coming in, I carefully weeded through potential bachelors in my area.\n\nIt was a little overwhelming, but a considerable upgrade from the men I had encountered on the free dating apps. These guys appeared to want something different – something serious. The paid dating site encourages members to complete in-depth surveys about themselves and what they want in significant others. Seeing men who had taken the time to fill out the detailed questionnaires made me realize how many men out there – millennials included – might also be looking for companionship.\n\nOne week after setting up my profile, it was time for my first subscription-based date. I'd connected with a guy named Pete from Hoboken, New Jersey. My sister wasn't sure he was my type, but we shared a lot of the same interests, including our jobs and love of travel.\n\nPHOTO: David Scott Holloway\n\nOn the big day, I did not feel up to the date. I still wanted to meet the one the old-fashioned way, at a college football game or through friends of friends. That night I tried to cancel, texting Pete that I'd just gotten home from a work trip and that I was too tired. He offered to meet me closer to my apartment so that I didn't have to travel far, and something inside me said, just go.\n\nOur first date was refreshing. He was on time, opened doors and seemed genuinely curious about my life. We talked for hours about the places we wanted to travel – Italy being at the top of our lists.\n\nWe also talked about his profile picture, which featured two women – one on each of his arms. I assumed they were his mom and sister. I was correct – and his sister, in fact, was his twin. The picture and his response to it was a sign of how much he cared about the women in his life.\n\nPHOTO: Stephanie Massaro/The Hons Studio\n\nAnd while it took a while for us to let our guards down, this time I felt like I'd met someone who wanted to find a long-term relationship.\n\nOver the next year, Pete and I grew to know and love each other even more. And on June 13, 2017, he proposed to me on a beautiful property outside Rome. We married six months later in New York.\n\nPeople are often surprised to hear that I met Pete on a paid dating site – and at such a young age. For whatever reason, paying to meet someone as a millennial often comes with a certain stigma. But I can tell you now that it was the best $102.32 I've ever spent.\n\nSeeking love and lifelong companionship is not always a personal necessity. I know many people – young, middle-aged and old – who are happily single. But if you want to find love and the right person isn't knocking on your door, there's no shame in paying to find it, even at 24.
Milton H. Greene photographed some of the biggest movie stars in the world during the Golden Age of Hollywood: Cary Grant, Sophia Loren, Audrey Hepburn, Frank Sinatra, Ava Gardner, Marlene Dietrich.\n\nBut to this day, nothing sells like his iconic work with Marilyn Monroe.\n\nShe's lived on from generation to generation to generation, said Milton's son, Joshua, who has restored many of his late father's photos for a new book, The Essential Marilyn Monroe.\n\nThe book is made up of 284 images, of which 176 have never seen the light of day, Joshua Greene said. Many of these photos were long thought to be lost for good.\n\nThe film had deteriorated over the years, Joshua Greene said, and his father died believing all his work was ruined. But with new technology, the photos were able to be salvaged — albeit with hours and hours of restoration work.\n\nThis photo of Marilyn Monroe, never published before, is the limited-edition cover of the new book The Essential Marilyn Monroe. It was taken in October 1953 during a shoot for Look magazine, but it was never used. That was like a found diamond, Joshua Greene said. You've got to realize that all these pictures were in such bad condition. And It's not until you really get down and work on them do they start coming back to life. It's like restoring an old car.\n\nMilton Greene first met Monroe on an assignment for Look magazine in the fall of 1953. They struck an immediate friendship and later formed a business partnership when Greene helped Monroe get out of her studio contract with 20th Century Fox.\n\nThe two created Marilyn Monroe Productions, giving Monroe more say over what films she would do and what roles she would play. They produced two films — Bus Stop and The Prince and the Showgirl — and took thousands of photos together.\n\nThe images in the new book come from 50 different photo shoots — some of which are familiar to Monroe fans, and some that have never been seen before.\n\nThis photo, taken in September 1953, is the main cover of the book. Monroe is wearing a negligee adorned with fur and a diamond bracelet.\n\nMilton would do a lot of these sittings not particularly while under assignment, but more to explore her range and to give her a sense of confidence and also show how good she was as a chameleon, if you will, how good she was in creating characters, Joshua Greene said. So a lot of his focus was to make her look like a character.\n\nSome of the photos were taken on the set of Monroe's films. Others were taken in a private studio session or on the back lots of a movie studio. Some were serious, maybe sensual — others were fun and playful.\n\nShe had a great sense of humor. My father had a great sense of humor, Greene said. They enjoyed each other's company and were able to really relax and explore and play and create these images that were all fantasy, you know?\n\nMonroe is dressed as a palm reader after she and photographer Milton H. Greene ransacked the 20th Century Fox costume department in April 1956.\n\nYou put on an outfit that looks like a ballerina dress. You put on an outfit that you look like a peasant and you go shoot on the back lots of 20th Century Fox in an environment that looks like a town in the countryside in France, in Europe at the time of the war. So there's these environments that they would use to play off of.\n\nJoshua Greene was just a few years old when he met Monroe, but he remembers her being like part of the family when she stayed at their Connecticut home after moving from Los Angeles.\n\nShe would take care of me when my parents would go to the movies or give me bubble baths, he said. He recalled jumping on her bed often, right into her arms. She would tickle me and I'd get up and do it again over and over like a dog, he laughed. There are some fond memories. It wasn't until he got older when he became aware of just how famous she was.\n\nMonroe wears her favorite outfit, a white terrycloth robe, just after finishing her makeup in March 1955.\n\nMonroe's business partnership with Milton Greene ended shortly after her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller, but Greene kept the film and the rights to all the photos they took together. And now, thanks to his son's painstaking work, we are able to get a different look at one of the biggest icons in entertainment history.\n\nHer natural ability shows in the pictures, Joshua Greene said. And it's not just with my dad. I mean, she's a wonderful muse. …\n\nHe loved photographing her. She was gifted, truly gifted in that way, and it shows.\n\nThis photo of Monroe wearing a sweater coat was taken by Greene during their first sitting for Look magazine in September 1953. Many of the photos from the shoot were considered too risqué and weren't published.\n\nMonroe wears a jacket and matching trousers for a studio shoot in March 1955.

Greene had selected two outfits from a fashion shoot and used Monroe as a model while setting up lights for two shooting environments to be used the following day. She was a young woman that was a sponge who wanted life to come in and show her what she had to do, Amy Greene, Milton's wife, said in the book. She was ready for anything. That's why she had such a great sense of humor. And she lived every day in the present.
Canada, Taiwan, India, Editor's Note — This story is part of a series highlighting superlatives of countries and cities around the world. Click here for pieces on Italy France , the United States Hong Kong and Mexico , and watch for upcoming installments featuring other countries.\n\n(CNN) — For such a small country -- it ranks 109th in the world for total area , right behind Iceland -- South Korea sure is in the news a lot.\n\nOccasionally that news is grim -- something to do with a troublesome cousin across the border.\n\nSometimes it's pure mainstream pop -- a bunch of cute singers taking down Lady Gaga on the world stage.\n\nSometimes it's just plain astonishing -- no one throws out the first pitch at a baseball game with as much panache as South Koreans.\n\nFrom the weird to the wonderful to sci-fi stuff from a Samsung galaxy far, far away, here are things South Korea pulls off more spectacularly than anywhere else.\n\n1. Wired culture\n\nWant to see what the future looks like?\n\nBook a ticket to the country with a worldwide high 82.7% Internet penetration and where 78.5% of the entire population is on smartphones (as of 2013).\n\nWhile they're chatting away on emoticon-ridden messenger apps such as Naver Line or Kakao Talk, South Koreans also use their smartphones to pay at shops, watch TV (not Youtube but real-time channels) on the subway and scan QR codes at the world's first virtual supermarket\n\nHyundai plans on rolling out a car that starts with your smartphone in 2015.\n\nSamsung in the meantime has been designing a curved phone.\n\nCrazy displays of technology already in place but not yet distributed can be seen (by appointment) at T.um, Korea's largest telecom company SK Telecom's future technology museum\n\nT.um , Jung-gu, Euljiro 2-ga 11, Seoul; +82 2 6100 0601\n\n2. Whipping out the plastic\n\nSouth Koreans became the world's top users of credit cards two years ago, according to data from the Bank of Korea\n\nWhile Americans made 77.9 credit card transactions per person in 2011 and Canadians made 89.6, South Koreans made 129.7.\n\nIt's technically illegal for any merchant in the country to refuse credit cards, no matter how low the price, and all cabs have credit card machines.\n\nAll that flying plastic makes Seoul one of our top shopping cities in the world.\n\n3. Workaholics\n\nSouth Koreans are so used to studying -- the country has the highest education level in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, with 98% of the population completing secondary education and 63% with a college education -- they can't get out of the habit once they reach the work force.\n\nAccording to this quirky map from thedoghousediaries , Brazil sets the standard for FIFA World Cup titles and North Korea leads in censorship, but South Korea takes the crown for workaholics.\n\nYou can see it in any Korean city, where lights in buildings blaze into the late hours as workers slave away.\n\nAccording to 2012 data from South Korea's Ministry of Strategy and Finance, South Koreans work 44.6 hours per week, compared with the OECD average of 32.8.\n\nAnd according to a study released in August 2014, along with Tokyo residents, Seoulites get the least amount of sleep of any residents of major cities in the world, just less than six hours a night.\n\n4. Business boozing\n\nWhen they're not working, Koreans are celebrating their latest deals or drowning their sorrows in soju.\n\nWhile many leading companies are trying to curb the working/drinking culture, there are still plenty of bosses who drag their teams out for way too many rounds of soju/beer/whiskey bombs.\n\nThose who opt out are considered rude or hopelessly boring.\n\nYes, Japan and a few other countries can stake reasonable claims to this title, but South Korea has stats to back up the barroom brag.\n\nJinro soju was the world's best-selling liquor last year , for the eleventh year in a row, with its home country accounting for most of the sales.\n\nThe South Korean distilled rice liquor manufacturer outsold Smirnoff vodka, which came in second by 37.48 million cases.\n\n5. Innovative cosmetics\n\nWhen it comes to makeup and cosmetics, South Koreans can't stop experimenting with ingredients or methods of application.\n\nSnail creams (moisturizers made from snail guts) are so 2011.\n\nNow it's all about Korean ingredients such as Innisfree 's Jeju Island volcanic clay mask and fermented soybean moisturizer.\n\nAt VDL , Korea's latest trendy cosmetics line, products change monthly.\n\nRight now, they're pushing hair shockers -- neon tints for hair -- and nail polish with real flowers in it.\n\nJust as Korean men are less wary of going under the plastic surgery knife (see point 10) than their foreign counterparts, they also snap up skincare products and, yes, even makeup, namely foundation in the form of BB cream.\n\nSouth Korea is by far the largest market for men's cosmetics, with Korean men buying a quarter of the world's men's cosmetics -- around $900 million a year , according to Euromonitor.\n\n6. Female golfers\n\nThe Economist posed a million-dollar question in 2013.\n\nWhy are Korean women so good at golf?\n\nThe rankings were staggering.\n\nOf the top 100 female golfers in the world, 38 were Korean.\n\nOf the current top 25 , 9 are Korean (10 if you count Seoul-born Lydia Ko, who calls New Zealand home).\n\nInbee Park, 25, is the second-ranked player in women's golf and was the youngest player to win the U.S. Women's Open.\n\nIn January, Ko, 14, set the record for the youngest woman to ever win a professional golf tournament.\n\nChalk it up to crazy Korean competitiveness or to the Tiger Mom/Dad theory (golfer Se-Ri Pak's father is infamous for making her sleep alone in a cemetery every night to steel her nerves), but the phenomenon certainly begs study.\n\nWidely thought to be a response to Korean domination of the sport, the U.S.-based LPGA passed a requirement in 2008 mandating that its members must learn to speak English , or face suspension.\n\n7. Starcraft\n\nOne country's hopeless nerds are among another's highest earning celebrities\n\nStarcraft is actually a legitimate career in South Korea, with pro gamers raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars in earnings in addition to endorsements.\n\nSince the game launched in 1998, nearly half of all games have been sold in South Korea, where boys, girls, men and women drop by for a night of gaming in giant video game parlors.\n\nThere are cable channels devoted solely to the games, and the culture has led to approximately 14% of Koreans between ages 9 and 12 suffering from Internet addiction, according to the National Information Agency.\n\nTo try to crack down, the government passed a ban dubbed the shutdown law or Cinderella law two years ago, prohibiting anyone 16 and younger from game websites. The ban has been widely ignored.\n\n8. Flight attendants\n\nFlight attendants from airlines around the world come to Korean airlines' training centers to learn proper airborne charm.\n\nAsk anyone who's ever flown a Korean airline and dare them to say the service isn't the best they've ever had.\n\nIt's not just the sweet smiles that greet every little request, but the almost comical looks of suicidal despair when they somehow run out of bibimbap in the row before yours.\n\n9. Blind dates\n\nWhen's your next sogeting (blind date)?\n\nThat's one of the most frequently asked questions of any Korean single.\n\nThe standard answer is the epic horror story that was the last blind date, often involving a crippling Oedipus complex or intolerable physical flaw.\n\nFollowed immediately by a chirpy, Why, do you know someone you can set me up with?\n\nDue to the high volume of blind dates, when Korean make up their minds, they move quickly.\n\nAccording to data compiled by South Korea's largest matchmaking company, Duo , the average length of time of a relationship from the (blind) first date to marriage is approximately 10.2 months for working people, with an average of 62 dates per couple.\n\nIn a survey conducted by Duo, working singles interested in marriage say they typically go on two blind dates a week.\n\nThey should know. Of the top four matchmaking companies in Korea (there are 2,500 companies in the country), Duo has a 63.2% marketshare.\n\n10. Plastic surgery\n\nWhether it's a lantern jaw, wide forehead or long teeth, there's no feature doctors can't beautify in the Asian capital for cosmetic surgery.\n\nRussians, Chinese, Mongolians and Japanese flock to South Korea on plastic surgery medical tours, not only for the skill of the surgeons, but for the good deals.
Story Highlights • NEW: Republican Jim Talent concedes tight Missouri Senate race\n\n• Democrats must win both undecided races to control Senate, CNN projects\n\n• Democrats will win control of House of Representatives, CNN projects\n\n• Rep. Nancy Pelosi, set to be House speaker, challenges President Bush over Iraq\n\nAdjust font size:\n\n(CNN) -- Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives for the first time since the 1994 Republican revolution, while control of the Senate hangs in the balance, CNN projects.\n\nDemocratic challengers have picked up four seats in the Senate, CNN projects. Republicans would need to take just one of the two remaining competitive races to keep control of the chamber. Results are still too close to call in Montana and Virginia.\n\nRepublican Sen. Jim Talent of Missouri conceded defeat to Democrat Claire McCaskill early Wednesday after a hard-fought race, telling supporters that the headwind was just very, very strong this year.\n\nWith all polls now closed after Tuesday's midterm elections, CNN projects that Democrats will pick up 22 seats, more than the 15 they needed to capture a majority in the House. (Latest House news)\n\nTonight is a great victory for the American people, said House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who is poised to become the first female speaker of the House. The American people voted for a new direction.\n\nShe vowed civility and bipartisanship but confronted the president over his Iraq policy: Mr. President, we need a new direction in Iraq. (Watch Pelosi challenge the president -- 4:43 )\n\nThe projected result means that President Bush for the first time faces the prospect of working with a Democratic-controlled House.\n\nBush, whose anemic approval ratings proved a drag on Republican prospects, was described as disappointed with the House results. However, spokesman Tony Fratto said the president was still optimistic about the Senate.\n\nWhite House spokesman Tony Snow said the president would telephone Pelosi on Wednesday to offer congratulations.\n\nWe're going to get a lot done, Snow said. On energy, education, those are clearly things we can work on.\n\nThe Democratic pickups in the House included three seats vacated by Republicans amid controversy: Mark Foley's in Florida, Bob Ney's in Ohio and Tom DeLay's in Texas.\n\nWith more voters than ever using electronic voting machines, scattered glitches reported across the country prompted officials to extend voting hours in some areas. (Full story)\n\n'Biting our nails'\n\nThirty-three Senate seats were at stake, but only nine races were considered competitive.\n\nIn Virginia, embattled Republican Sen. George Allen and his Democratic challenger, Jim Webb, were locked in a virtual tie, separated by fewer than 3,000 votes with 99 percent of precincts reporting.\n\nWe are right now biting our nails about Virginia, which is neck and neck, Sen. Chuck Schumer, the chairman of the Democrats' Senate campaign effort, told supporters.\n\nWebb declared victory early Wednesday, saying, The votes are in, and we won.\n\nBut a recount appeared likely.\n\nThe election continues, Allen vowed. I know the counting will continue through the night.\n\nRepublican candidate Bob Corker will win the Tennessee Senate race, defeating Democratic Rep. Harold Ford Jr., CNN projects. He'll fill the open seat now held by retiring Republican Bill Frist, the Senate majority leader.\n\nIf the parties split the Virginia and Montana races, that would create a 50-50 breakdown in the Senate. In that event, Vice President Dick Cheney would break tie votes.\n\nDemocratic senator-turned-independent candidate Joe Lieberman will win the Connecticut Senate race, CNN projects. Both he and newly elected independent Bernie Sanders in Vermont have said they will caucus with the Democrats. (Watch Joe Lieberman become a comeback kid -- 1:58 )\n\nDemocratic challenger Sheldon Whitehouse will win the Rhode Island Senate race, defeating Republican incumbent Lincoln Chafee, CNN projects. (Full Senate news)\n\nTwo-term Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, the chamber's third-ranking Republican, has conceded to Bob Casey Jr. And Democrat Sherrod Brown will defeat GOP Sen. Mike DeWine in Ohio, CNN projects.\n\nThis just was a little too steep of a mountain to climb, said Santorum, an outspoken opponent of abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\nAnd DeWine, also a two-term senator, told supporters: It just was not to be. This was not the year.\n\nDemocrats have retained two of their Senate seats that were considered competitive, with incumbent Bob Menendez winning in New Jersey and Ben Cardin taking Maryland, CNN projects.\n\nDefying the traditional political maxim that all politics is local, 62 percent of voters said in exit polls that national issues mattered more than local issues.\n\nThe exit polls showed that 42 percent of voters called corruption an extremely important issue in their choices at the polls, followed by terrorism at 40 percent, the economy at 39 percent and the war in Iraq at 37 percent.\n\nOther developments:\n\nSix governorships changed from Republican to Democratic hands in Tuesday's election, giving Democrats control of a majority of the top state posts for the first time in 12 years. Among those lost by Republicans were New York, Ohio and Massachusetts, all of which they had held for more than a decade. Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger won re-election in California. (Governors races)\n\nAlso appearing on state ballots are a string of referendums, some controversial. In two of them, CNN projects that state constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage will pass in Virginia and Tennessee. CNN also projects that Arizona voters will approve a measure making English the official language of the state, and that South Dakota voters will reject a proposed law that would ban nearly all abortions.

It seems like people really want toymakers Mattel and Hasbro to get together.\n\nShares of Mattel (MAT) soared 10% Tuesday on no news. The stock only gave up a little bit of those gains Wednesday, falling about 2%. Hasbro (HAS) rose 4% Tuesday and another 2% Wednesday.\n\nInvestors have dreamed about a possible merger between the two companies since November, following a story in the Wall Street Journal that said Hasbro was going to make a bid. Reuters later reported that Mattel turned Hasbro's offer down.\n\nA spokesperson for Mattel told CNNMoney Tuesday that the company had no comment on the new speculation. Hasbro did not get back to CNNMoney.\n\nA marriage of the two companies could make sense. It would unite Hasbro, the owner of Mr. Potato Head, Monopoly, Tonka, My Little Pony and most Disney (DIS) toy licenses, with Mattel, the parent of Fisher-Price, Thomas and Friends, Barbie and Hot Wheels.\n\nThe companies may be running out of time to prove to Wall Street that they are better off on their own.\n\nEven though Hasbro has done better than Mattel lately, Wall Street is concerned that plans by bankrupt Toys R Us to close more than 180 U.S. stores will hurt both toymakers. Each warned late last year that holiday sales would miss analysts' expectations.\n\nRelated: These are the 182 stores Toys R Us is closing\n\nHasbro's earnings and sales growth are likely to slow this year too, while Wall Street is forecasting a drop in revenue for Mattel in 2018.\n\nInvestors are also nervous about possible price cuts for toys due to growing dominance of Walmart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN) in the retail world.\n\nAnd many kids are now playing more video games on consoles, smartphones and tablets instead of playing with toys.\n\nMattel will report its fourth-quarter results on February 1. Investors will be looking for any signs that new CEO Margo Georgiadis, formerly an executive at Google (GOOGL), will be able to turn around the company with a greater focus on high-tech toys.\n\nHasbro is expected to report its holiday sales and profits sometime during the first week of February as well. And both companies will be showcasing new toys that they hope will be big hits this Christmas at the big Toy Fair in New York later in February.\n\nTo go it alone, both companies will need to wow investors with their latest results, not to mention children of all ages (and their parents) with their new toys.
(CNN) The sports world is rightly raving about Tom Brady securing a seventh Super Bowl title on Sunday, as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers breezed past defending champions the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nBut when Brady trotted off the field at halftime, he ceded center stage to a man calling the shots for a 12th Super Bowl in a row, and whose decisions will be discussed, debated, and were perhaps even danced along to.\n\nNever mind the action on the field at the NFL's showcase game, for many, this weekend was all about The Weeknd. And the man who helped bring the pop megastar's Super Bowl LV halftime show to life is a British TV director named Hamish Hamilton.\n\nSince 2010's The Who-headlined spectacle, the now 54-year-old, award-winning Hamilton has been involved in showcasing musicians so famous we know them by a single name -- Madonna! Beyoncé! Gaga! -- or bands that have soundtracked a generation, such as Coldplay, Maroon 5 and the Black Eyes Peas.\n\nPop -- ahem -- starboy The Weeknd headlined the Super Bowl LV halftime show.\n\nGlobal interest in the halftime show is nothing new, though 2021 does mark the 30-year anniversary of the NFL changing course from traditional marching bands to contemporary music acts -- and what a change it was.\n\nSuper Bowl XXV -- also held in Tampa -- kicked off with a sublime rendition of the Star Spangled Banner from none other than Whitney Houston.\n\nHalftime was billed as A Small World Salute to 25 Years of the Special Bowl featuring New Kids on the Block, though events of the day would intervene.\n\nOperation Desert Storm resulted in the show being tape-delayed until after the game with a Gulf War news report shown instead.\n\nIt was a watershed moment and the league never looked back, booking household names such as Michael Jackson, Diana Ross and Boyz II Men in the 1990's.\n\nThe Aughties witnessed U2's cathartic post-9/11 performance, the infamous Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake Nipplegate incident from 2004, and Prince in 2007 -- often cited as the greatest halftime in history.\n\nAll these performances were seminal moments before Hamilton took the reins in 2010.\n\nThe audience has even eclipsed the viewership for the game itself at times: in 2015, Katy Perry and her colorful companions attracted 118.5 million viewers , compared with the average game audience of 114.4 million.\n\nFrom Blackpool to the Super Bowl\n\nFor Hamilton, raised in the north of England in the 1970s, the very notion of the Super Bowl, let alone the halftime show, was literally as foreign a concept as he could contemplate, with his paying more attention to English, rather than American, football.\n\nI grew up in Blackpool, Hamilton tells CNN Sport in a rare interview. These are the days before the internet and mobile phones and global sharing of media. My only knowledge of sport really was my local football team Blackpool, and many miles away in the big city, Liverpool, who at the time were dominating European football.\n\nHamilton attracted attention from America after directing numerous BRIT Awards -- the UK equivalent of the Grammys -- and while he has the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics and the Oscars on his resume, helming the Super Bowl halftime show is, well, the Super Bowl of his career when it comes to the cultural zeitgeist.\n\nWe always looked across the Atlantic to this undiscovered land of opportunity and excellence, he says. Now, for me to be creating these enormous shows at the very epicenter of American culture fills me with enormous pride.\n\nThe logistics involved in mounting the halftime show are arguably as tricky as trying to win the Super Bowl itself.\n\nMany months, involving many people -- halftime was also co-executive produced by Shawn Jay-Z Carter's Roc Nation -- go into the planning, and the song, if you will, remains the same: turn a football field into a concert venue and back in under 30 minutes.\n\nHamilton acknowledges that each headliner is different when it comes to the time they spend collaborating, but they have a vision, and our role is to bring that vision to life. At the end of the day, the mission is to create 12 minutes of entertainment halfway through this football game in February.\n\nShakira and Jennifer Lopez perform onstage during last year's Super Bowl LIV Halftime Show at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami.\n\nHamilton is acutely aware how much this gig means to the musicians -- a career-defining moment and a huge part of their artistic legacy -- against the backdrop of multiple challenges.\n\nYou've got to push a stage out in seven, eight minutes, put it all up, build it, and take it down, Hamilton says. In a world that's fracturing, it's a great lesson in what people can build under tremendous stress when they work together and place trust in each other ... It's extraordinary.\n\nIt's an adrenaline rush roller coaster and honestly, you spend 12 minutes focusing, just trying to keep the train on the track, and deliver what everybody wants you to deliver.\n\nCovid-19 concerns\n\nDelivering this year's show was a monumental task, with the coronavirus pandemic looming large over proceedings, despite the vaccine rollout across the nation.\n\nThe 25,000 fans in attendance were required to wear face coverings at all times and received PPE kits, a Super Bowl branded face mask, hand sanitizer, and wipes from the NFL on arrival.\n\nThe impact on the halftime show was considerable. This is, after all, an event which involves a multitude of performers on stage and where social distancing is the very antithesis of what tends to be a highly coordinated and packed affair.\n\nHamilton refused to give anything away, though did admit that it has put a very different set of parameters around the production. [But] we have risen to the challenge in the same way we rise to the challenge every year, so I guess all I would say to everybody is, 'Tune in and make your own judgment.'\n\nBut The Weeknd (real name Abel Tesfaye) did confirm beforehand that we built the stage in the stadium, while executive producer Jesse Collins told Entertainment Tonight, We're going to use the stadium to present the show in a way that it's never been presented before.\n\nThe acts are savvy enough to reportedly perform without a fee from the league -- because the intense interest generated through appearing pays for itself -- though the NFL does supposedly supply a budget.\n\nAnd while Hamilton wasn't willing to divulge details, The Weeknd's manager, Wassim Sal Slaiby, told Billboard magazine that his star client put up $7 million of his own money to make this halftime show be what he envisioned.\n\nFor his part, when speaking to CNN Sport and the rest of the assembled virtual media on February 4, The Weeknd did refer to putting his hand in his pocket.\n\nI don't think I have enough money  he joked when it was put to him that wasn't too late to incorporate the usage of a helicopter, which is what his favorite halftime performer ever -- Diana Ross -- did to conclude her show in 1996.\n\nWhen Hamilton speaks about his halftime show memories, the sporting parallels with the sides contesting the Super Bowl emerge. Reflecting on the many major acts he has worked with, his observations about Coldplay's frontman evoke a team player, rather than individual talent who doesn't want to share the ball, or rather stage.\n\nChris Martin is the most generous of artists, Hamilton says about his fellow Brits Coldplay headlining Super Bowl 50 in 2016. So he rings up his mate Beyonce, he rings up his mate Bruno Mars, and he literally persuades them.\n\nThey were both a bit reticent at the beginning and he's like, 'Come on guys!' And so Beyonce turns up with a hundred dancers, and Bruno turns up with his entourage. And what a great show it was ... That came together pretty last minute, in a dance studio behind a laundromat. If people knew what was happening in this tiny little dance studio, they would be shocked.\n\nBeyonce, Chris Martin and Bruno Mars perform in the Super Bowl 50 Halftime Show, which Hamish Hamilton recalls as one of the greatest halftimes he's produced.\n\nBut if you can take the boy out of Blackpool, you can't quite take Blackpool out of the boy. Hamilton casts his eye back toward his native Britain and poses the question about whether English football would ever take a leaf out of the NFL's book and add an extra layer of entertainment to proceedings.\n\nI was a football fan as a kid, I used to watch the FA Cup, and that was the big thing in the calendar, he says about the closest comparison to the Super Bowl in England.\n\nIt would be great if the FA decided to do a halftime show and a pregame in the same way as the NFL. The NFL have been brilliant, they're very supportive of halftime, and they really invest financially, creatively and logistically in creating this centerpiece at halftime.\n\nIt's the marriage of sport and music and entertainment and it really, really works. I don't think there's a better example of it in the world.
(CNN) -- A federal judge in California on Wednesday struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriage, ruling that voter-approved Proposition 8 violates the U.S. Constitution -- handing supporters of gay rights a major victory in a case that both sides say is sure to wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe 136-page opinion, issued by Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker in San Francisco, is an initial step in what will likely be a lengthy fight over California's Proposition 8, which defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman.\n\nAt stake in the trial was whether California's ban on same-sex marriage violates gay couples' rights to equal protection and due process, as protected by the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe high-profile case is being watched closely by both supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage, as many say it is destined to make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. If it does, the case could result in a landmark decision on whether people in the United States are allowed to marry people of the same sex.\n\nSame-sex marriage is currently legal in five U.S. states and in the District of Columbia, while civil unions are permitted in New Jersey. The five states are Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nProposition 8 fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license. Indeed, the evidence shows Proposition 8 does nothing more than enshrine in the California Constitution the notion that opposite-sex couples are superior to same-sex couples, Walker, who was appointed to the federal bench by former President Ronald Reagan, wrote in his opinion.\n\nRace restrictions on marital partners were once common in most states but are now seen as archaic, shameful or even bizarre, he added. Gender no longer forms an essential part of marriage; marriage under law is a union of equals.\n\nIn a separate order, Walker also granted supporters of Proposition 8 a temporary stay, which stops his decision from taking immediate effect. They had argued, prior to his ruling, that same-sex marriages would be performed soon after his decision and could be complicated by rulings and appeals farther down the legal road.\n\nWalker gave both sides in the case until Friday to submit their responses to the order.\n\nElated supporters of same-sex marriage gathered to celebrate the judge's opinion in the Castro district of San Francisco. After speeches and songs, they began a march to city hall. People waved rainbow flags and U.S. flags, and carried signs that read, We all deserve the freedom to marry, and Separate is Unequal. Similar rallies unfolded in cities across California -- including Los Angeles and San Diego.\n\nFor our entire lives, our government and the law have treated us as unequal. This decision to ensure that our constitutional rights are as protected as everyone else's makes us incredibly proud of our country, said Kristin Perry, a plaintiff.\n\nPerry and Sandy Stier, along with Jeffrey Zarrillo and Paul Katami, are the two couples at the heart of the case, which if appealed would go next to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals before possibly heading to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOpponents of same-sex marriage have said their best bet lies with higher courts and vowed to appeal the federal judge's ruling.\n\nIn a national survey, conducted by Gallup in May, 53 percent of respondents said same-sex marriages should not be recognized by law, while 44 percent said they should.\n\nProposition 8 is part of a long line of seesaw rulings, court cases, debates and protests over the controversial issue of same-sex marriage. It passed in California with some 52 percent of the vote in November 2008.\n\nBig surprise! We expected nothing different from Judge Vaughn Walker, after the biased way he conducted this trial, said Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage. With a stroke of his pen, Judge Walker has overruled the votes and values of 7 million Californians who voted for marriage as one man and one woman.

This includes the hundreds of women from around the world who flocked to the Islamic caliphate – drawn by the promise of a new life and marriage to strong, devout men.\n\nSeveral women who surrendered to Iraqi forces alongside defeated ISIS fighters have already been sentenced to death or life in prison, according to Human Rights Watch. The humanitarian organization warns that these women are receiving unfair trials due to their perceived collusion with ISIS.\n\nIn these cases, the women are getting the harshest possible sentences for what appears to be marriage to an ISIS member or a coerced border crossing. The Iraqi courts need to redirect their priorities, Belkis Wille, a senior Iraq researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement released last week.\n\nThe Iraqi court said the death sentence of the 16 Turkish women can be appealed.
(CNN) Congratulations to this year's crop of Oscar nominees.\n\nUnfortunately, that means not you, Jennifer Lopez, Beyoncé, Awkwafina and others.\n\nHarsh? Maybe. But since this year's Oscar nominations left so many talented artists in the proverbial corner, a harsh mood is justified. Especially when some of the omitted talents would have put much-needed Ooh-factor into the largely by-the-books nominees.\n\nLopez had been in the running for best supporting actress for her role as a dancer turned business mogul in  Hustlers . While the movie itself lacked best picture buzz, Lopez's performance was hailed for being empowered and without reservations.\n\nKathy Bates (Richard Jewell), Laura Dern (Marriage Story), Scarlett Johansson (Jojo Rabbit), Florence Pugh (Little Women) and Margot Robbie (Bombshell) ended up earning nominations.\n\nRead More

Click HERE: http://bit.ly/12rLx\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe following contains spoilers about The Big Bang Theory Season 11 finale.\n\nThe Big Bang Theory eschewed the usual sitcom gimmicks — cliffhangers, last-minute objections, crazy impediments — and married off two of its characters in the 11th-season finale. The result was a terrific half-hour, managing to be funny, sweet and touching all at once.\n\nMuch of that has to do with the unlikely, protracted and unorthodox courtship of Sheldon (Jim Parsons) – a man child always more preoccupied with science and his pop-culture pastimes than coitus, as he insists on calling it – and Amy (Mayim Bialik), his equally awkward and brilliant companion. The idea of the two finding each other seemed improbable at first, along with Sheldon's ability to consider someone else's needs along with his own.\n\nThe relationship, however, built over time, and actually resonates more deeply thanks to the spinoff CBS introduced this season, Young Sheldon, depicting its protagonist as a child genius, surrounded by a family that doesn't know what to make of him.\n\nSeeing the Young Sheldon characters grown up and older – not only Laurie Metcalf as Sheldon's mom, but Jerry O'Connell as his brother – added a splendid wrinkle to the finale, as did Kathy Bates and the magician Teller as Amy's parents, the latter appropriately unable (mostly) to get a word in edgewise.\n\nThe highlights didn't end there, with Mark Hamill gamely making a cameo as himself, drafted into officiating the ceremony; and Wil Wheaton back, lending dual Star Wars and Star Trek sizzle to this much-ballyhooed event.\n\nTo their credit, producer Chuck Lorre and his creative brain trust weren't coy about the wedding. Rather, Sheldon and Amy got so caught up in a theoretical breakthrough that they had to be coaxed to the altar, before realizing there would be plenty of time for such pursuits later.\n\nThe term very special episode is a cliche, a throwback to TV's old days. But Thursday's Big Bang Theory did indeed feel like an occasion, showcasing the cast's enviable chemistry – a group capable of eliciting laughs throughout the ensemble – and then augmenting that with all the high-profile guests.\n\nWhile there have been creative hiccups along the way, that dynamic underscores how the show has actually improved thanks to the ascendance of its female characters, compared to the early days, when it was the four guys and Penny (Kaley Cuoco). In that respect, the show has matured along with its characters as they enter new phases in their lives (marriage, parenthood), if, thankfully, not too much.\n\nYoung Sheldon has mirrored that template, closing the season with episodes that showcase Annie Potts, a fabulous addition as Sheldon's cranky but caring grandma.\n\nBig Bang is heading into what most assume will be its final year, having reached the Friends-like stage where the decision resides with a cast that – having reaped millions from the program's success – is probably ready to move on.\n\nIn TV terms, nobody could call such an ending premature. Yet the strength of the finale demonstrated that the show's continuing quality has perhaps been underappreciated in its later seasons, making the formula look deceptively simple. That's why whenever the finish comes, this multi-camera sitcom – likely one of the last true big-tent hits of that magnitude – will be rightly missed.
Kelly Ripa showed up for work on Tuesday morning, which normally wouldn't warrant headlines. After all, a woman doing a job she's held since 2001, co-hosting Live! With Kelly and Michael, is sort of the direct opposite of news.\n\nStill, this wasn't an ordinary Tuesday. ABC and its parent Disney had botched plans to move Ripa's co-host, Michael Strahan, to the more-important-to-the-company franchise Good Morning America. Ripa was reportedly blindsided (albeit not in the way Strahan treated quarterbacks during his football career), triggering the TV-talent version of a tantrum, a public-relations headache and the need to smooth over feelings and mend fences.\n\nYet the Ripa situation also underscores a particularly strange aspect of the way the audiences identify with its TV stars, perhaps especially in the cozy environs of talk and morning news.\n\nThere have been no shortage of similarly bobbled and bungled baton passes, from Jane Pauley making way for Deborah Norville on the Today show to Ann Curry's more recent departure.\n\nThis isn't to say that A-level talent can't harbor legitimate grievances. But to call their problems high class is practically a disservice to the term.\n\nRelated: Kelly Ripa on her return to TV: Our long national nightmare is over\n\nHaving it be made so publicly known that GMA is a higher priority for ABC than Live had to be a somewhat bitter pill to swallow. Even so, it's hard to imagine that emphasis on strengthening GMA could have come as complete news to Ripa or anyone in her camp, given the frenzied nature of the morning competition with Today and their status as huge profit centers for their respective news divisions.\n\nIn that regard, Jay Leno -- a guy NBC elbowed toward the door not once, but twice, despite years of yeoman service hosting The Tonight Show -- accurately summed up the lot of late-night hosts with a beef in the various succession battles that have played out, suggesting they could all go cry into large sacks filled with cash.\n\nRelated: What Kelly Ripa said: Full transcript\n\nNevertheless, fans often rally around stars in these situations, or at least express solidarity in a manner that suggests a certain level of projection is involved. Because while everyone can relate to having had a boss at one time or another who doesn't value one's contribution, what the average person experiences in such a scenario bears at best a glancing resemblance to these high-profile players, where those disrespected or even jettisoned weather the experience cushioned by golden parachutes and soft landings.\n\nNotably, viewers' ability to generate sympathy for stars isn't confined to the conspicuously slighted. Take Charlie Sheen, whose employers on the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men appeared to tolerate several incidents of bad or boorish behavior before cutting him loose. For some, though, the actor still came across as a convincing victim, even amid public rants regarding his Tiger's blood and Winning ways.\n\nRelated: Kelly Ripa gets a personal apology from ABC execs\n\nAfter an extended ovation, Ripa got right to the point. Our long national nightmare is over, she quipped, thanking her fans for their support through this bizarre time. The host acknowledged reports that she had received apologies from her bosses, saying the issue boiled down to respect in the workplace, and that the show's parent company has assured me that 'Live' is a priority.\n\nFrom there, it was business as usual. Host chat about Prince's untimely death and Tom Brady's suspension over deflated footballs, interviews with Scandal's Bellamy Young and Blindspot's Jaimie Alexander. While there might be moments of awkwardness down the road (look out for Ricky Gervais' appearance on Wednesday), for now, order has been restored.\n\nMy dad, who was a bus driver for 30 years, thinks we're all crazy, Ripa said in her opening monologue, injecting a note of perspective that's a frequent casualty when such backstage skirmishes erupt into the open.\n\nBoth Ripa and ABC would no doubt like the drama surrounding the show to subside (although a little extra attention in the short term is likely welcome, what with the May rating sweeps about to begin), while the company and host seek to engineer Live's latest transition and chart a course for its next act.\n\nIf history's any guide, that usually means reaching an accommodation that works out reasonably well for all concerned. And honestly, when it doesn't and the marriage can't be saved, hosts of Ripa's privileged status -- even when they aren't winning -- are generally a whole lot better off than your average bus driver.

(CNN) -- Argentina became the first Latin American country on Thursday to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nLawmakers in the Senate passed the bill after 14 hours of debate that began Wednesday and carried well into early Thursday morning, the state-run Telam news agency reported.\n\nThe bill had already passed the lower chamber of Congress.\n\nIt gives same-sex couples equal marriage rights, including the ability to adopt children.\n\nThe law was backed by the center-left government of President Cristina Kirchner, who has said she will sign it.\n\nThe majority Roman Catholic country follows a few others around the world where same-sex marriage is legal. Among them are the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain.\n\nLast month's congressional vote and Wednesday's Senate vote are the latest moves in a pro-gay marriage trend in Argentine politics.\n\nLast year, a judge in Buenos Aires ruled that a ban on same-sex marriage was illegal, paving the way for such marriages in the capital of Argentina.\n\nAn injunction by another judge stopped what would have been the first same-sex marriage there.\n\nUltimately, Latin America's first same-sex marriage happened in Argentina in a southern state with a pro-gay marriage governor.
(CNN) —\n\nSen. Kamala Harris' unique biography and unlikely political ascent might have been summed up best by a political strategist who incorrectly predicted her defeat in the 2010 California attorney general's race.\n\nThere was no way I could win, Harris writes in her new memoir, recalling the strategist's stinging words, because I was 'a woman running for attorney general, a woman who is a minority, a woman who is a minority who is anti-death penalty who is DA of wacky San Francisco.' Old stereotypes die hard.\n\nHarris did win that race (barely) and is now poised for another steep and daunting climb – this time a potential quest for the Democratic presidential nomination in what might become the most diverse and seasoned field of presidential candidates in the party's history.\n\nIn a twist of fate, what one strategist viewed as her vulnerabilities – her gender, her race and the interrogation skills she developed as a prosecutor – may now be what sets her apart in the 2020 crowd.\n\nThe California senator's memoir publishing Tuesday, The Truths We Hold, lays the groundwork by chronicling Harris' journey as the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica who grew up with a stroller-eye view of the civil rights movement and was educated in the black intellectual circles of Oakland and Berkeley in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nThe book is a rallying cry against what Harris views as the un-American policies of the Trump administration, alongside her set of policy alternatives. She casts herself as a champion for everyday Americans against the powerful, and she is unsparing in her disdain for the policies of President Donald Trump. She notes that after her own victory speech in 2016, she watched the returns with her husband in a state of shock, eating an entire family-size bag of classic Doritos. Didn't share a single chip.\n\nI did know this: one campaign was over but another was about to begin, Harris writes. This time, a battle for the soul of our nation.\n\nIn the years since, she continues, we've seen an administration align itself with white supremacists at home and cozy up to dictators abroad; rip babies from their mothers' arms in grotesque violation of their human rights; give corporations and the wealthy huge tax cuts while ignoring the middle class; derail our fight against climate change; sabotage health care and imperil a woman's right to control her own body; all while lashing out at seemingly everything and everyone, including the very idea of a free and independent press. We're better than this.\n\nThe memoir is also her most personal account to date of her exploration of her own heritage, her path to becoming a progressive prosecutor and her brushes with sexism as a woman in the male-dominated spheres of law and politics.\n\nShe will launch a media blitz Tuesday with appearances on ABC's Good Morning America and The View, followed by a late night interview later this week with CBS' Stephen Colbert and a series of talks about her book in Washington D.C., New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Her announcement about a presidential run is expected toward the end of this month.\n\nFor many years in California, Harris recoiled from questions about her personal life, which helped establish her image as a disciplined and cautious politician. Her first book, Smart on Crime, reflected that private veneer with its narrow focus on policy, drawing from her experience prosecuting crimes that ranged from child sexual assault to homicide in Alameda County and San Francisco.\n\nIn the new book, Harris delves far more deeply into her upbringing by a single mother who was determined to see that she and her sister Maya would grow into confident, proud black women. A mother, Harris writes, who taught them to be tough and rarely offered praise for behavior or achievements that were expected.\n\nHarris stitches together touchstones from her childhood – like her mother's pride in finally saving enough money to buy a home when Harris was in high school – with stories about her work as California's attorney general pursuing predatory lenders and holding out for a larger settlement from the big banks after the foreclosure crisis.\n\nNoting her self-doubt during that period as California held out for what ultimately became a $20 billion settlement, Harris recalled a tart message from then-Gov. Jerry Brown – I hope you know what you're doing – as well as a tense meeting with top officials at the big banks who seemed to be under the misimpression that I could be bullied into submission, she writes.\n\nIn one dramatic moment, she describes how she engaged in a shouting match with Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase.\n\nI was tired of feeling caged, of talking through lawyers and other intermediaries in endless obfuscation, Harris writes of her decision to call Dimon directly. I took off my earrings (the Oakland in me) and picked up the receiver.\n\n 'You're trying to steal from my shareholders!' he yelled, almost as soon as he heard my voice. I gave it right back, Harris writes.\n\n 'Your shareholders? Your shareholders? My shareholders are the homeowners of California! You come and see them. Talk to them about who got robbed.' It stayed at that level for a while. We were like dogs in a fight. A member of my senior team later recalled thinking, 'This was either a really good or a colossally bad idea.'  (The settlement was reached two weeks later).\n\nIn a series of stories, Harris explains how the people she met as a prosecutor, and later as attorney general, steered her agenda in the Senate toward criminal justice revisions, legal protections for immigrants, boosting wages for the middle class and advocating for universal health care and for lowering the cost of prescription drugs.\n\nShe notes a career high point in performing gay weddings in California after the Supreme Court struck down Proposition 8, the 2008 California ballot measure that prohibited marriages for same-sex couples. (Like Brown, who served as attorney general before her, Harris refused to defend Proposition 8 in the courts).\n\nWalking out of the Supreme Court after watching oral arguments in the case, Harris notes that day underscored her rationale for becoming a lawyer: It was in the courtroom, I believed, that you could translate that passion into action and precedent and law.\n\nThe most interesting passages of the book often tie back to Harris' family heritage and the values instilled in her by her mother, who separated from Harris' father when she was young.\n\nHarris describes her focus on immigration as a senator – including her efforts to drill Trump officials like former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly on protections for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and children crossing the border – as being shaped by watching her mother's experience of being a target as an immigrant in America.\n\nI saw it, and it made me mad, Harris writes. I have too many memories of my brilliant mother, a breast cancer researcher who migrated from India to go to graduate school, being treated as though she were dumb because of her accent. Memories of her being followed around a department store with suspicion, because surely a brown-skinned woman like her couldn't afford the dress or the blouse she had chosen.\n\nAt times, Harris reveals a more vulnerable side that she rarely shows in public. She notes, for example, her shock and horror when she failed the California Bar on her first try, and how she almost didn't notice that her now-husband was proposing marriage because she was so caught up in what she calls the balancing act of the working woman.\n\nShe describes her nervousness changing into jeans and Chuck Taylors before she was introduced to her stepson and stepdaughter. She explains the Momala descriptor on her Twitter handle as the name she and the kids settled on because of their dislike of the word stepmom.\n\nThere are also relatable moments when she describes her anguish at missing sports matches and family milestones as she tried to balance her home life with her job in Washington.\n\nFor now, she writes that her centering ritual is the tradition of a Sunday gathering of friends and family.\n\nAs long as I'm making Sunday family dinner, she writes, I know I'm in control of my life.
A photograph released by the South Korean Defense Ministry appears to show a Japanese plane as seen on board one of its destroyers, the Dae Joyeong, on Wednesday.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nJapan and South Korea are engaged in a heated military dispute that analysts say could damage the already tenuous geopolitical situation in northeast Asia if the two sides do not reach a resolution.\n\nThe spat began December 20 after an encounter between a Japanese plane, which Tokyo said was collecting intelligence, and a South Korean destroyer, which Seoul said was on a humanitarian mission.\n\nBoth sides disagree on what happened next – the Japanese said the South Koreans targeted their aircraft with missile-targeting radar, while the South Koreans said the Japanese plane was flying dangerously low and that the radar was not intended to trace any Japanese-controlled aircraft.\n\nThe disagreement has quickly escalated, bringing to the fore historical disputes previously on the back-burner and – in turn – threatening the region's stability.\n\nEast Asian geopolitics has been shaken loose and is now unsettled, said Van Jackson, a former US Department of Defense official specializing in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nChina is seeking to push out the US, North Korea has pulled a jiujitsu move by using summit diplomacy to solidify its status as a nuclear state even as the ostensible purpose is to denuclearize Pyongyang, and the future of the US in the region is less certain now than any time since the 1970s.\n\nAmid all this tumult, suppressed animosities are started to crack through the veneer of regional stability.\n\nA marriage of convenience\n\nSouth Korea and Japan are historical adversaries locked in a marriage of convenience, which makes for a complex partnership. Their relationship is still very much colored by the legacy of imperial Japan's occupation and colonization of the Korean Peninsula in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nThis revived tension comes at a terrible time for the United States – the Trump administration is currently preparing for its second summit with North Korea, while also inching towards a key deadline in trade talks with China.\n\nShortly after the initial incident, Japan and South Korea held working-level meetings to try to resolve the issue behind closed doors.\n\nIt appears to not have worked – and neither side is buying the other's explanation.\n\nJapan released video of the incident from its perspective on December 28. South Korea released its own video on January 4. Each accused the other of misleading the public and distorting the facts.\n\nJapan has conducted three other flybys over South Korean ships this month – one last week, one on Tuesday and another Wednesday. Seoul publicly condemned the latest as a clearly provocative act against a partner country.\n\nPHOTO: South Korea Defense Ministry South Korea's Defense Ministry released this radar photo, which it says shows a Japanese patrol aircraft 7.5 kilometers (4.6 miles) away from the South Korean naval destroyer Dae Joyeong.\n\nLawmaker Song Young-gil, from South Korea's ruling Democratic Party, has even gone so far as to suggest Seoul pull out of its General Security of Military Information Agreement, a pact allowing the two countries to share sensitive intelligence.\n\nJonathan Berkshire Miller, an analyst at the Tokyo-based Japan Institute for International Affairs, believes historical enmity contributed to the sudden deterioration of relations.\n\nThe context is key, he said.\n\nHistorical adversaries\n\nDespite their historical differences, South Korea and Japan share plenty of surface similarities. They're both vibrant democracies with developed economies. Geopolitically, they are both US allies; they both want a denuclearized North Korea; they both support free trade; and they both view China's rise with trepidation.\n\nBut history looms large, and the Japanese occupation and colonization of Korea – when many Koreans were brutalized, murdered and enslaved – is still a highly emotional issue that defines their relationship.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan signed a treaty in 1965 that normalized relations between the two countries and was supposed to settle most of the wartime issues.\n\nBut South Korea was a military dictatorship at the time, and many Koreans felt the deal was unfair – and today are still fighting against it.\n\nThe two countries are still locked in heated debate over statues depicting comfort women – Korean women forced into providing sexual services for Japanese soldiers – and recent decisions by South Korea's Supreme Court allowing citizens to sue Japanese corporations for reparations for forced labor.\n\nJapan contends both issues were settled by the treaty.\n\nEven further, they have been in a heated dispute for more than 50 years over ownership of a group of islands called Dokdo in Korean and Takeshima in Japanese.\n\nDespite all this, military-to-military relations between Japan and South Korea often appeared largely unaffected by the ebbs and flows of political disagreements, said Miller, the analyst at the Japan Institute for International Affairs.\n\nThat was the one area that was kind of quarantined or immunized before, he said. It wasn't always perfect … but it was one that they both agreed was for the better good for the both of them.\n\nAlliance maintenance\n\nJapan and South Korea's foreign ministers met on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Wednesday to discuss the issue, but their meeting ended with statements that did not appear to resolve anything.\n\nNot with them at Davos was their shared treaty ally, the Untied States, which typically would help mediate the dispute. President Donald Trump canceled his trip to Davos to deal with the US government shutdown.\n\nSome have accused the White House of not placing enough importance on alliance coordination and management. Former Defense Secretary James Mattis pointed to that as a key disagreement between himself and the President in his resignation letter.\n\nOur strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships, Mattis wrote.\n\nWhile the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies.\n\nAnalysts like Jackson, the former Defense Department official, worry that the current spat is a manifestation of declining US leadership, and will play into the hands of North Korea and China – two countries that have historically sought to diminish US influence in the region by causing rifts between Washington and its allies.\n\nWhat we're seeing lately is a return to history in some sense – the two countries never fully reconciled when they normalized relations in 1965, and put a lot of conflicts of interest on the back burner in the name of cooperation with the US, Jackson said.\n\nIf something doesn't change, I expect some kind of serious crisis to break out at some point, unfortunately.\n\nCNN's Jake Kwon in Seoul and Yoko Wakatsuki in Tokyo contributed to this report
Hong Kong (CNN Business) A new commercial for one of China's largest online marketplaces never utters the words gay rights. But it's making waves online for what appears to be a subtle challenge to one of the country's major taboos.\n\nAlibaba BABA The 23-second ad released by Tmall , an e-commerce platform owned by, begins when a young man brings another man home for the holidays and introduces him as Kelvin. Two girls in the home respond by giggling and gossiping. At dinner, the father hands Kelvin a bowl of soup, and he responds by saying, Thanks, Dad, creating an awkward moment of surprise.\n\nThe video caught fire this week when it was posted on the Chinese social media website Weibo by LoveMatters, an organization that provides education and advice about sex and relationships.\n\nLoveMatters praised Tmall as a prominent company that supports the LGBTQ movement — something it said was important for the community to be visible, to be seen by the public, and to be recognized.\n\nThe video has millions of views and has been liked on Weibo tens of thousands of times. It has also garnered more than 4,500 comments, many of which are positive.\n\nRead More

Story highlights More senators and members of parliament resigning over dual citizenship New polling shows support for Turnbull as Australian leader is slipping further\n\nEditor's Note: Peter van Onselen is a professor of politics at the University of Western Australia. He is a contributing Editor at The Australian newspaper and on Sky News Australia. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has had better months.\n\nThe latest Newspoll (Australia's most reputable polling agency) has seen him fall further behind the Labor Party opposition, right at a time when a gaggle of by-elections are in the offing.\n\nIt also comes at a time when internally conservatives within the government are openly questioning the PMs judgment more generally.\n\nAs Turnbull flew from Vietnam to the Manila for Monday's ASEAN meeting, the citizenship crisis that's prompted a string of sackings and resignations claimed another scalp.\n\nOn the weekend, Liberal MP, John Alexander, quit parliament forcing a by-election in his seat, on concerns that he might be a dual British citizen. The former tennis champion's Sydney metropolitan electorate is tough to hold, on a margin just under 8%. The by-election, which Alexander will recontest, will be held next month.\n\nPHOTO: MANAN VATSYAYANA/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Australia Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull (L) waves as his wife Lucy looks on upon arriving in the Philippines on November 12, 2017, for the ASEAN meeting.\n\nThis follows another by-election, also set down for December, for the Nationals leader and former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce's seat of New England in regional New South Wales. Joyce was disqualified from holding office due to his New Zealand heritage, though he's expected to win it back.\n\nA host of senators from various parties have already fallen foul of Australia's constitutional rules, preventing members of parliament (MPs) and senators holding dual citizenship. Section 44 of the Constitution is quite clear that members of the federal parliament cannot have an allegiance to a foreign power. MPs have been struck out on this provision before, but not on the scale we've seen during the life of this parliament.\n\nThe government tried to petition the High Court to take an activist interpretation of the law and allow dual citizenship when MPs didn't know they held, or didn't apply to hold, such status. But the court ruled against the government unanimously.\n\nThe assumption now is that there may be a number of other MPs and senators who are serving in violation of the Constitution. Two weeks ago, the President of the Senate Stephen Parry sensationally resigned, having hidden his suspicion that he held UK citizenship.\n\nOn Monday, after a week of negotiation, the opposition and the government agreed to a process for evaluating who might still be under a citizenship cloud within the parliament. Both parties have given members of the country's parliament until December 1 to disclose any dual nationalities and steps to renounce them.\n\nIt's a voluntary system which has the appearance of a detente between the parties as its goal, rather than getting to the bottom of who may or may not really be ineligible.\n\nThe problem for Turnbull is that his majority is wafer thin. At the 2016 election his government was returned with just 76 of the 150 seats in the lower house. It represents a one-seat majority, which means if his government loses any seats at by-elections forced by the citizenship chaos, the Coalition might be forced to a general election.\n\nReturning to the latest polling, with the Coalition trailing 45-55% on the two-party vote, that's the last thing Turnbull wants. Hopes of a positive lift in the polls leading into the summer recess, off the back of the expected passage of same-sex marriage laws after years of toxic debate, have been dashed by events out of the PM's control.\n\nAdding to Turnbull's woes are the latest personal numbers in the poll. They revealed that Australian Foreign Minister and long term Liberal Party deputy leader Julie Bishop is now more popular than Turnbull, and by a significant margin. Previously, despite poor party polling, Turnbull's personal favorability numbers protected him somewhat from his critics who would like to see a challenge to his leadership.\n\nForty percent of voters favor Bishop as leader compared to just 27% for Turnbull. This is fueling speculation that Turnbull won't survive the year or, if he does, a leadership showdown early next year might be in the offing. Bishop tried to shut down speculation of a leadership challenge by saying Monday that Turnbull would lead the party at the next election (or something along those lines).\n\nPHOTO: MADE NAGI/AFP/Getty Images Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (front C) poses with other ministers ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit leaders meetings in Vietnamon November 8.\n\nLabor doesn't appear to be immune from the citizenship chaos either. A number of its MPs have questionable credentials when it comes to having renounced their dual citizenship before the last election. But even if Labor also loses MPs to by-elections, the odds are that, with the polls where they currently are, Labor seats would be retained with swings to the opposition, cementing the view that Turnbull is in trouble.\n\nThe senate is sitting this week, but when the House of Representatives returns for sitting in two weeks' time the opposition will test Turnbull on the floor of the chamber. His government is already two MPs down, meaning that there is a risk that the opposition, in conjunction with the crossbenchers, could succeed in forcing through legislation the government doesn't want, or even a no confidence motion sparking an early election.\n\nAustralia has become the Italy of the south in recent years – six prime ministerships since 2007. Turnbull risks falling victim to this phenomenon, courtesy of the citizenship saga and enduring poor polls.
Don't even ask why someone would want an $86,000 Jeep Grand Cherokee with a 707-horsepower supercharged V8 engine. There is no rational reason for such a machine to exist. It answers no pressing need. It does not leave the Earth a better place for having driven over it.\n\nLand Rover, Porsche and Mercedes, among others, all make performance SUVs. They are, legitimately, a thing. Maybe a dumb thing, but a thing. That's because everybody loves SUVs and some people still love performance. Or at least bragging about performance. And some of these SUVs, the Porsche Macan for instance, are marvelous.\n\nRelated: Fiat Chrysler recalls 4.8 million vehicles\n\nWhen it comes to the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk, I was skeptical, but it largely won me over. I loved how easy it was to live with 707 horsepower. Normally, this sort of outrageous power comes in a package, like an exotic European sports car, that requires great care in handling. The Trackhawk isn't up for real Jeep-type off-roading. But potholes or bumping over the occasional curb ... no worries there. It is, still basically a Jeep Grand Cherokee with a huge engine upgrade.\n\nThere is one thing we need to get to: Gasoline. Lots of it. There was a time when the Trackhawk's EPA estimated fuel economy of 11 miles a gallon in the city and 17 on the highway would have seemed OK. Around that time, cigarettes on elevators and hard liquor at lunch were also considered acceptable. One could make the argument that, considering its horsepower, the Trackhawk's V8 is actually extremely efficient. Absolutely. And TGI Friday's Toasted S'mores Extreme Shake is a diet drink considering that... Oh, come on.\n\nRelated: Tesla's Model 3 isn't really for the mass market\n\nBut here's what Trackhawk is. It's fast. With the help of Launch Mode, it can go from zero-to-60 miles an hour in 3.5 seconds, according to Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FIADF). I do not disbelieve them. Even with just a simple push on the gas pedal it accelerates as if the car up ahead were its next meal.\n\nThe engine makes a vicious snarl overlaid by the climbing whirr of the supercharger pulling in roomfuls of air. It's a terrific experience and it's hard to resist the temptation to use every opportunity for a howling entrance onto the interstate.\n\nDespite not having been completely re-engineered in nearly forever in auto industry terms -- this Jeep still carries Daimler (DDAIF) DNA from Chrysler's last failed marriage -- the basic Grand Cherokee is still a fundamentally good product. It takes a beating better than most crossovers and still drives nicely on the road.\n\nThe Trackhawk, with performance suspension, performance brakes and all, is no punishing brute in daily asphalt-coated traffic. Drive it fast into a curve and, well, it's a Jeep. It's tall. It's heavy. But it does surprisingly well. The tires extend farther out to the sides for greater stability. In Sport and Track modes, the suspension stiffens for better handling but it still remains fairly comfortable.\n\nYou might object to the Grand Cherokee Trackhawk's very existence. You might decry the sort of person who would consider, even for a moment, buying such a wasteful thing. And you might be right. But, for a moment, let us take it as it is compared to similar, but costlier, baubles one could buy from any of the European luxury carmakers. Seen that way, the Trackhawk looks pretty good.
(CNN) If the snubs and oversights feel a little more acute and arbitrary with the latest round of Oscar nominations, blame that in part on a year that produced an abundance of good movies, and few genuinely great ones.\n\nThere were, in fact, a number of mixed signals to be found in the nominations unveiled on Monday morning, which, taken together, paint a portrait of a movie industry in transition. The Oscars have met the streaming age -- and the flood of options coming from it -- but still appear to be figuring out how to absorb all that content, and where it fits.\n\nAdding to the logjam, a number of performers delivered standout performances in movies that, overall, weren't equal to them. While Renee Zellweger and Cynthia Erivo overcame that in Judy and Harriet, respectively, Jennifer Lopez (Hustlers), Taron Egerton (Rocketman) and Adam Sandler (Uncut Gems) didn't.\n\nEven among the nine movies nominated for best picture -- equaling the most titles since the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences expanded from five to as many as 10 -- there is a certain been-there quality to go along with a few breakthroughs.\n\nJoe Pesci and Robert De Niro in 'The Irisman'\n\nBoth The Irishman and Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood are fine movies.

Yet the series quickly takes on a life of its own, with an assortment of eccentric, almost uniformly unlikable characters, recalling that on TV, anyway, great wealth tends to breed a lot of high-class, outlandish problems.\n\nThe description of Logan Roy, the architect behind the fifth-largest media company in the world and a pal to prime ministers, certainly possesses a Murdoch-ian vibe, although the producers say they drew inspiration from a number of different dynastic enterprises. Moreover, his company has a strong family-run tilt to it, with son Kendall (Jeremy Strong, upgraded from Masters of Sex to master of the universe) sitting as the ostensible heir apparent to dear old dad, who is played, sensationally, by Brian Cox.\n\nLike Murdoch, the thrice-wed Roy has several children, including an older son (Alan Ruck) from his first marriage, younger party boy (Kieran Culkin) and a daughter, Shiv (Sarah Snook), who has stepped out of the business orbit to working in political consulting but isn't far removed from familial politics. In an introductory scene, Kendall is dismissed as a daddy's boy when a big deal he's trying to engineer blows up in his face, serving notice both of the weight that comes from nepotism, as well as the assumption that the apple might have fallen uncomfortably far from the tree.\n\nEvery intern on the street knows that you're stepping up, Kendall is told, making his promotion appear inevitable. But his father has other ideas, at least, until the company is thrown into chaos when he experiences a health scare.\n\nCreated by Jesse Armstrong, directed by Adam McKay (who tackled high finance in The Big Short) and counting Frank Rich (Veep) among its producers, Succession has put together first-rate teams both in front of and behind the camera. The former includes Matthew Macfadyen, playing against type as Shiv's incredibly needy boyfriend, who works for Roy's company and is painfully desperate to earn his approval.\n\nNot all the wrinkles work, including a subplot involving a young nephew (Nicholas Braun) who is essentially cast in the role of minnow among the sharks, trying to claim a piece of his birthright. As noted, some might also be put off by the general unpleasantness of the characters, who seem to care little for the collateral damage that their high-stakes machinations inflict – a scenario that hasn't made Showtime's Billions, it should be noted, any less entertaining.\n\nWhile Succession shares certain attributes with that show, its closest cousin might actually be Weapons of Mass Distraction, a brilliant and prescient 1997 HBO movie – written by Larry Gelbart – about a feud between two media moguls, who wielded their far-flung assets like pawns on a chessboard.\n\nThe new series doesn't quite rise to that level, but it does become more engrossing over the episodes previewed – reveling in the darkly comic discomfort, in one noteworthy example, of the most awkward Thanksgiving dinner imaginable.\n\nWe need a more dynamic strategy, Kendall – who Strong invests with a mix of insecurity, frustration and thinly veiled anger – tells the company's board at one point. Because steady as she goes, it's the iceberg.\n\nThere could always be still be icebergs ahead in keeping the storyline going, and the premise doesn't feel especially compatible with Westworld, which the series will initially follow. But given the complicated nature of the subject matter, Succession has navigated its launch in impressive fashion.\n\nSuccession premieres June 3 at 10 p.m. on HBO.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) When the words great and actor are linked together, we think of grandeur and power -- or, to get colloquial about it, oomph and wow. We associate greatness in an actor, man or woman, with the oversized roles they take on: Marlon Brando as Don Corleone, Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf, Denzel Washington as Malcolm X, Meryl Streep as ... anybody!\n\nSo when I tell you that Cloris Leachman, who died Wednesday at age 94, was a great American actor -- one of the greatest, actually -- I expect many or most of you to arch a skeptical eyebrow in my direction.\n\nCloris Leachman? you ask. Really? The alarmingly austere housekeeper Frau Blücher (insert horse whinnying) in Mel Brooks's Young Frankenstein? The barely functional granny doddering around in bathrobe and slippers in 2003's Bad Santa? The woman who spent the entire 1970s playing the self-aggrandizing, self-deluding and cheerfully acid Phyllis Lindstrom on The Mary Tyler Moore Show and a spinoff sitcom?\n\nThat Cloris Leachman?\n\nYes. Absolutely. One of the all-time greats.\n\nThose aforementioned characters -- her best-known handful of roles -- only hint at the unfettered range and sustained quality of Leachman's body of work in over a half-century of more than 200 credits on big and small screens. The size of the role didn't seem to matter, nor did the age or deportment of the character involved. She seemed, literally, up for anything and everything.\n\nHer credits throughout the early TV of the 1950s and 1960s are like a mini history of the medium, with shows like Bob and Ray, Gunsmoke, Rawhide, Route 66, Perry Mason, The Donna Reed Show, Dr. Kildare and The Twilight Zone, where she's best remembered from the 1961 episode It's a Good Life, where she's the tightly wound mother of Billy Mumy's apocalyptically moody little boy, roles both of them would repeat in a 2003 Twilight Zone sequel.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Mary Tyler Moore' show cast reunion (2002) Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'Mary Tyler Moore' show cast reunion (2002) 30:32\n\nSpeaking of moms, here's a fun fact: for one season (1957-8), she was Lassie's TV mom until she was replaced by June Lockhart.\n\nI digress. By now you're probably saying: Big deal. It just proves she was busy. Lots of character actors make themselves familiar to the public just because they're always around. Where's the greatness in that?\n\nLet's go back to Phyllis Lindstrom. If you were a regular viewer of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, you remember her, along with anchorman Ted Baxter and Sue Ann Nivens (played by Betty White), the Happy Homemaker, as one of the three most overbearing and clueless people in Mary Richards's orbit.\n\nYet, one of the abiding graces of that groundbreaking, much-honored sitcom was its insistence that even obnoxious jerks are human beings, too. And when the show gave Leachman room to pull back the curtain on her character's deep wounds and insecurities, she let us see Phyllis's scars -- without pathos and with all the uproarious, shrewdly observed wit still humming along. Such delicate, impeccably wrought craftsmanship won her two best-supporting comedy actress Emmys.\n\nAnd even as she was curating Phyllis every week and simultaneously collecting paychecks, credits and still more awards, she managed to bring forth her most indelible big-screen triumph: an Oscar-winning performance as Ruth Popper in 1971's The Last Picture Show.\n\nRuth was the sad, neglected wife of the high school football coach in a smaller Texas town that's withering away as precipitously as she is. Her affair with Sonny, a high school senior played by Timothy Bottoms, restores hope and even vivacity to her features. But Sonny abandons her for the school's prettiest girl, Jacy (Cybill Shepherd), with whom he elopes in a brief, doomed marriage.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIn the movie's final scene, Sonny returns to Ruth's house and finds her even more haggard and despondent than before. Leachman creates a zone of wild-eyed tension as her character can barely contain her rage, resentment and deep hurt. Her anger subsides when she sees her chastened lover's desolation as being in sync with her own and, ever so gradually and persuasively, forgives him.\n\nActing like this can make an abandoned forest cry, while making the bluntest, most forsaken object seem human. That's what makes it great.

As a teenager, I got my ears pierced at Claire's. And the ultimate treat every year around the holidays was a trip to the toy store FAO Schwartz on Fifth Avenue in New York City.\n\nPHOTO: c/o Kara Alaimo Kara Alaimo\n\nNow, Toys R Us may shutter its stores this week. Claire's is reportedly about to file for bankruptcy. In 2015, Toys R Us closed the flagship FAO Schwartz store on Fifth Avenue where Tom Hanks famously danced on a huge piano in the 1988 movie Big.\n\nIt's easy to get nostalgic about these stores and to feel their closings as a loss. It's also worrisome to think that, instead of taking their kids to a store to play together, parents may order their toys online – or, even worse, hand over electronic devices so kids can do so on their own. But there's a silver lining here: parents can use the time they would have spent shopping to do healthier activities with their families.\n\nTeaching children that happiness comes from shopping was never the best lesson anyway. In fact, researchers have found that the commercialization of childhood causes problems including obesity, violence, family stress, sexualization, and early use of drugs and alcohol.\n\nAnd, while toys can certainly help children learn, having too many of them can actually be detrimental to a kid's development. A study published recently in the journal Infant Behavior and Development found that toddlers were more creative and played for longer amounts of time when they were given fewer toys.\n\nSo, here's an idea, parents: Use the time you could have spent at Toys R Us to do quality non-commercial activities together, like reading books, volunteering or going to the park. These are activities that are actually proven to be good for children. In fact, a 2015 study in the Journal of Marriage and the Family found that the quantity of time that parents spent with kids ages 3-11 didn't have a huge impact on their children's behavior, achievements or well-being over time. Studies show that what is good for kids is having quality time with their parents, doing things like talking or eating dinner. Activities other than shopping can also help kids learn that objects don't buy happiness – but spending time with family and friends or giving back to their communities certainly can.\n\nYes, going to places like Toys R Us was a fun experience for a lot of kids (myself included) – and one that ensured they spent at least a little time with their parents. But it doesn't take a room full of thousands of toys to teach or have fun with a kid. In fact, all that stimulation risks leaving them distracted that they don't get the benefit of learning as much from the experience as they otherwise could.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nSo, instead of feeling nostalgic about the shuttering of these stores, let's all get nostalgic about a time further back – before they existed at all. Thankfully, activities like reading, going to parks and volunteering can't be put out of business.
Oprah Winfrey will contribute several stories to the coming season of 60 Minutes, CBS announced Tuesday.\n\nThe deal joins one of the most famous women in the world with the most prestigious newsmagazine on television.\n\nWinfrey will be a special contributor, CBS said. This means she'll have several stories on the upcoming season of the newsmagazine. The first story will air sometime in the fall.\n\nCBS declined to comment on the length of Winfrey's contributor deal.\n\nJeff Fager, the executive producer of the program, said it was invigorating discussing the partnership.\n\nShe's a wonderful person full of energy and ideas, he told CNN.\n\nWinfrey's main outlet remains OWN, the cable channel she co-owns with Discovery Communications. But 60 Minutes will allow her to reach many more people with a single segment. The program regularly draws 10 to 20 million viewers a week.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, she said, I've been a big admirer of 60 MINUTES since my days as a young reporter. I'm so excited and proud to join forces with this historic news program, which for me represents the bastion of journalistic storytelling.\n\nShe added: At a time when people are so divided, my intention is to bring relevant insight and perspective, to look at what separates us, and help facilitate real conversations between people from different backgrounds.\n\nWinfrey's longtime friend Gayle King already works for CBS as the co-host of CBS This Morning. That's where the contributor news was announced on Tuesday.\n\nI am so psyched about it, King said on the show. I know she's equally excited. She has said all the time she doesn't miss the day-to-day of the show, but what she does miss is storytelling and connecting with people, women in particular, and being able to meet and talk to them and interact with them. That's what she really misses. So to me, this is a perfect marriage.

Birmingham's fight over the minimum wage, advocates say, echoes the city's epic civil rights campaign, memorialized in statues like this one.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe schoolchildren who faced water hoses and police dogs in Birmingham gave the civil rights movement one of its most iconic victories. But a new generation of activists has arisen in the city with another message:\n\nThe for colored only signs may be gone, but the Jim Crow economy remains.\n\nThat is the thrust of a lawsuit linking a three-year battle to raise the city's minimum wage with Alabama's ugly racist heritage. Oral arguments were heard in federal court on Friday after a coalition of civil rights groups sued to preserve an attempt by Birmingham's majority black government to raise the city's minimum wage.\n\nThe suit is the latest skirmish in a national battle over the minimum wage. At least 21 states and DC have raised their minimum wages above the federal level of $7.25 an hour in the last four years, and at least 41 localities have adopted wages above their state minimums. Many have done so because of protests by Fight for $15, a workers' movement that seeks to raise the minimum to $15 an hour.\n\nThey treated Birmingham like it had whistled at a white woman. It was like an insult: How dare you raise your own minimum wage without our say-so. Scott Douglas, executive director of Greater Birmingham Ministries\n\nLegislatures in at least 24 states, including Alabama, have responded by passing pre-emption bills that either abolish or roll back those increases. What's different in Birmingham is the racial dimension of its minimum wage battle – and the massive implications of a workers' movement gaining a victory in a Southern city.\n\nBirmingham became the first city in the South to try to raise the minimum wage for anyone employed within its city limits. The primary beneficiaries of the raise would have been fast-food and retail workers.\n\nAlabama lawmakers responded by passing a law that abolished the wage increase. Every Alabama lawmaker who voted against the raise was white, according to the lawsuit.\n\nA coalition of groups that included Fight for $15 activists sued the state in 2016, saying passage of the law was tainted by racial animus and relied on a state constitution that still has explicit language geared toward putting blacks in their place.\n\nThey treated Birmingham like it had whistled at a white woman, says Scott Douglas, executive director of Greater Birmingham Ministries, one of the plaintiffs in the suit. It was like an insult: 'How dare you raise your own minimum wage without our say-so.\n\nPHOTO: Mike Brown/The Commercial Appeal/AP Dunetra Merritt protests for higher wages in Memphis, Tennessee. Some Fight for $15 activists say their struggle is linked to the civil rights movement.\n\nCNN tried to reach at least four Alabama lawmakers who voted to overturn Birmingham's wage increase, including some of the most outspoken opponents. None responded. Alabama's attorney general's office, though, made the state's position clear in a brief filed with the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals. The court is hearing an appeal by the plaintiffs after a federal judge dismissed their lawsuit. A decision is not expected for months.\n\nThe brief said Alabama lawmakers were motivated in part by studies that suggest minimum wage increases cause more unemployment and don't reduce poverty. It said the state was well within its rights to oversee the economic regulations of its cities, and pointed out that numerous states had already passed similar laws preventing localities from enacting their own minimum wage laws.\n\nTo get around this, the appellants asserted a dizzying array of legal theories casting Alabama's minimum-wage law as state-sponsored racial discrimination, the brief said.\n\nLiving on two ham sandwiches a day\n\nLinking a minimum wage battle in Birmingham to water hoses and attack dogs may seem far-fetched, almost obscene. But the famed 1963 civil rights campaign was spawned by economic concerns in the city's black community as well. The initial goal of the campaign was to desegregate downtown stores for black shoppers and persuade merchants to hire black sales clerks.\n\nThe Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. often noted that racism and economic exploitation are intertwined.\n\nWhat does it profit a man to be able to eat at an integrated lunch counter if he doesn't have money to buy a hamburger? King said.\n\nBlacks in Birmingham still have trouble buying a hamburger, the plaintiffs argue. According to their suit, the city is about 74% black; 32% of its black residents earn below the federal poverty line; and the average black resident earns about $16,000 a year.\n\nPHOTO: Hal Yeager/AP A statue honoring the four girls killed in the 1963 bombing of Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church graces the corner of Kelly Ingram Park.\n\nPoverty in the city's black community has spilled into the closest thing to sacred ground in Birmingham – a park dedicated to the 1963 campaign.\n\nKelly Ingram Park was the four-acre epicenter of the 1963 protests. It's where black school children were lashed with water hoses. It's now a civil rights monument, ringed with sculptures of King, statues of demonstrators facing off against lunging attack dogs, and benches adorned with photos of civil rights martyrs.\n\nHomeless black men also populate the park. They shuffle through the manicured grounds with soiled clothing and matted hair like zombies. Some mutter to themselves, heads cast down. Others sleep on park benches. One panhandler with a ZZ Top silver beard and a toothless smile approached strangers on a recent day asking, Gotta dollar?\n\nAcross the street, Antoin Adams, a young man with gold teeth, leaned his lanky frame against a civil rights museum facing the park. He's not there to reflect on the past; he's trying to make some new history.\n\nAdams, 24, is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. At the time he joined the suit, he was making $7.25 an hour at Hardee's and lived in Section 8 housing. His job came without health benefits, but he was making too much for Medicaid. Alabama refused to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, leaving him to call 911 for free breathing treatments for his chronic asthma.\n\nAdams said he couldn't afford the cost of an inhaler.\n\nI know I need it for my asthma, but the bills need to be paid. It makes you kind of think of giving up, but you can't. Life goes on.\n\nAdams is joined by Michelle Jones, a Fight for $15 activist. Bubbly with a big smile, the 28-year-old said she could barely afford to eat after paying her bills and bus fare on her $7.25 an hour wage at McDonald's.\n\nTwo ham sandwiches a day – one in the morning and one at night, she said when asked to describe her diet. Sometimes it's just crackers and noodles.\n\nJones and Adams swapped stories about the grim choices needed to make a living on minimum wage: Do you pay the water bill or gas bill? When you're in pain, how long do you wait before paying for a doctor's visit? How do you get to work on time when the buses you rely on often break down?\n\nBefore their conversation ended, they mentioned a startling detail. They said they'd sought out black veterans of the 1963 campaign to get advice and inspiration. Instead they got shrugs.\n\nThey'll be like, 'It ain't going to happen. You're fighting for nothing,' Adams said. I thought older people would motivate us. I never thought it would be like that.\n\nWhy some say Alabama is 'the baddest of the bad'\n\nTheir pessimism may be understandable because of a geographic reality: It's difficult to organize any workers' movement in the South.\n\nThe region is the most hostile in the nation to workers' rights. Every Southern state has right-to-work laws that make it easy for companies to fire employees – and difficult for unions to organize. Only five states have no state minimum wage. All five are in the South – including Alabama.\n\nPHOTO: Gary Tramontina/Bloomberg/Getty Images Birmingham's black residents won a stirring victory in 1963, but many still struggle to make ends meet.\n\nThis Southern hostility to workers isn't a coincidence. It's tradition. Since the late 19th century, many Southern states have embraced a similar economic approach, some historians say: slash taxes to attract corporations, pass laws that weaken unions and pull back on investing in public services like infrastructure and public schools.\n\nSome groups are starting to rebel against this economic approach. Public school teachers in red states like West Virginia and Oklahoma have staged walkouts and protests over low pay and funding cuts, placing many state lawmakers on the defensive.\n\nSouthern political leaders, though, traditionally have been hostile to any measures – guaranteed health care, unemployment benefits, minimum wage laws – that would make workers less dependent on employers, these historians say.\n\nSome call this economic approach Southernomics. After the Birmingham lawsuit was filed, one woman described it as a fight against the Jim Crow economy.\n\nThe days of a Jim Crow economy should be long gone, said Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit group that promotes policies to protect low-wage workers and the unemployed.\n\nBut sadly, the refusal of Alabama's legislature to allow Birmingham to meet local needs through appropriate local measures signals the past persists.\n\nPHOTO: Jim Weber/The Commercial Appeal/AP Antonio Cathey leads a crowd of fast food workers in a Fight for $15 protest in Memphis. The campaign has raised wages for low income workers but inspired a fierce counterattack by some lawmakers.\n\nAdams, one of the lawsuit's plaintiffs, eventually moved to Atlanta for better job prospects because the economic climate in Alabama was so difficult. He is still a plaintiff in the lawsuit.\n\nJim Crow remains in other ways, too, the plaintiffs say in their suit.\n\nThey pointed to Alabama's Constitution, which they say state lawmakers relied on to abolish Birmingham's wage increase. The Constitution is explicitly racist. It calls for separate schools for white and colored children, and it still has references to poll taxes, which were used to prevent blacks from voting in the Jim Crow era. A referendum was held in 2012 to remove the language, but voters rejected it.\n\nThe suit also says the Constitution was designed to concentrate power at the state level and prevent black people in cities from exercising control over their communities.\n\nThe notion of ordinary workers of color organizing for better pay is offensive to some white leaders in Alabama, says Douglas of Greater Birmingham Ministries.\n\nThere's a culture of deifying corporate leaders, making them almost like gods, Douglas says. It's a kind of deference where the model is the plantation owner.\n\nThere are still many people in Alabama who reflect the sentiments of the state lawmakers who once wrote about educating white and colored children in separate schools. Alabama was the last US state to overturn a ban on interracial marriage. Voters did it in 2000 – but at least 40% of the state's residents voted to keep it.\n\nNo place in the US has had white supremacy embedded so deeply in its everyday social culture as Alabama, says James Blaksher, a native of the state and one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs.\n\nEven among the Southern states, when it comes to race, Alabama is the baddest of the bad.\n\nA Fight for $15 victory in Birmingham could show that workers can win a victory anywhere, even in Alabama, says Richard Rouco, another of the plaintiffs' attorneys.\n\nIf this case succeeds, it will put limits on the power of the state to enact legislation that would deprive people of the ability to address what they think are racial inequalities in their community, he says. The deepest racial inequalities that exist in this country are economic.\n\nAntoin Adams may have already won a personal victory – to preserve some of his own self-worth.\n\nHe talks with pride about the time he was asked to deliver a speech before a huge Fight for $15 rally in Richmond, Virginia. He quoted King and broke into rap, an homage to Fight for $15 he composed.\n\nPHOTO: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images Black protesters came under attack by dogs and water cannons in 1963. Activists say there's a link between those protests and Birmingham's efforts to raise the minimum wage.\n\nAs he sings his anthem for me, his gold teeth flash and he dips his shoulder to do a little dance. And once again, a young black activist is singing freedom songs in Kelly Ingram Park:\n\nWell, first of all to tell the truth,\n\n7.25 is not going to do\n\nThat ain't right so let's stand up for what's right\n\nWe've been in the dark so long, it's time we've seen some light.\n\nBut this isn't 1963. Adams isn't flanked by a group of fellow civil rights demonstrators. There is no King writing a letter from a Birmingham jail. And there are no racist Southern sheriffs for him to confront as the cameras roll. His main audience, at least for today, is a group of indifferent homeless men.\n\nAnd yet he continues to sing.\n\nThey say it can't happen, he says of his battle for a higher wage. But it can happen. The only way it won't happen if we don't try.

Credit: James Vaughan\n\nRussian scientist Dr Igor Ashurbeyli founded the world's first independent nation to operate in outer space in October 2016.\n\nNamed after a Norse mythological city of the skies, Asgardia is free to join and so far, about 114,000 people have signed up.\n\nAshurbeyli says the project's mission is to provide a peaceful society, offer easier access to space technologies, and protect Earth from space threats, such as asteroids and man-made debris in space.\n\nWhile Asgardia's citizens will -- for the time being -- remain based on earth, the satellite launch brings the nation one step closer to space.\n\nThe satellite's mission\n\nAsgardia-1 made its journey to the ISS aboard the OA-8 Antares-Cygnus, a NASA commercial cargo vehicle.\n\nNow it must wait for about three weeks as vital supplies and scientific equipment are transferred from the NASA ship to the six people currently living at the ISS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 6 – Zipping to the moon with SpaceX Spaceship company SpaceX, headed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, is taking two thrill seekers on a trip around the moon in 2018. It's not the first exciting feat for the pioneering firm: in 2017, it successfully launched a used rocket, the Dragon (pictured), into space.

Citizens' data will remain in orbit for between five and 18 months, the typical lifespan of this type of satellite. It will then burn out and disappear.\n\nFor Ashurbeyli, the launch fulfills a pledge he made when establishing the space nation to take its citizens to space via their data.\n\nI promised there would be a launch, he says. We selected NASA as a reliable partner ... because we have to meet the commitments that I made 13 months ago.\n\nGetting it off the ground\n\nWithin 40 hours of the project being announced in 2016, over 100,000 people had applied for citizenship on Asgardia's website. After three weeks, Asgardia had 500,000 applicants.\n\nAnyone over 18 years old, with an email address, regardless of gender, nationality, race, religion, and financial standing can apply for citizenship -- including ex-convicts, provided they are clear of charges at the time of application.\n\nA rendering of a habitable platform, which Asgardia envisions sending its citizens to in future. Credit: James Vaughan\n\nToday, there are 114,000 Asgardians from 204 countries -- a population drop from 211,000 in June, when voting to determine the details of Asgardia's constitution began.\n\nOnly those who agreed to adopt the finalized constitution are counted as Asgardians.\n\nTurkey currently has the largest number of Asgardians, with over 16,500 residents.\n\nRayven Sin, an artist based in Hong Kong, told CNN that she signed up to become an Asgardian in November 2016 after hearing about it on a Chinese radio show while she was in Toronto.\n\nI really want to be able to see if human beings are able to have more opportunity to express their opinions, she told CNN. The society we live in now -- everything seems to be either capitalism or communism -- there's a lot of conflict.\n\nAs a human being, I would hope (to see) if we could have other ways (of living). For a better life, and for more options.\n\nJohn Spiro, a digital marketing specialist who organizes a monthly meet-up for Hong Kong-based Asgardians, told CNN it was the possibility of sending personal data into space that excited him.\n\nI help translate and preserve Buddhist sutras as a hobby and the symbolism of sending one of those religious texts in electronic form 'up to the heavens' seemed very nice.\n\nOut of this world idea\n\nAfter the launch of its first satellite, Asgardia plans to send a series of them into space. Credit: James Vaughan\n\nGoing forward, the Asgardia team hopes to create habitable platforms in low-earth orbits -- the first one located 100 to 200 miles (161 to 321 kilometers) from space, which is also where the ISS is located.\n\nThe first human flight to this location is projected to take place in eight years' time.\n\nWe want to give equal opportunities to everyone who has a mind, who can do something, for their protection, Ashurbeyli said.\n\nOur real home is not the house or the city where we were born. (Our) home is planet Earth, (and) we want to protect it.\n\n(It's) not a fantasy. Going to Mars, the galactics, so on -- that's just fake. I intend something more real.\n\nFurther satellite launches are in the works but no dates have yet been confirmed.\n\nRocket scientist\n\nA 53-year-old rocket scientist, Ashurbeyli says he is single-handedly bankrolling the project -- for a sum that's undisclosed.\n\nRegularly reported to be a billionaire -- although he has never appeared on the Forbes rich lists -- the Azerbaijan-born Russian graduated from the Azerbaijan State Oil Academy in 1985, and three years later founded Socium, a software and consulting firm turned holding company with over 10,000 employees, according to his website\n\nDr Igor Ashurbeyli Credit: From ashurbeyli.eu.com\n\nAfter moving to Moscow in the 1990s, he became a heavyweight in the science industry and, in 2010, was awarded the Russian State Science and Technology Prize. Three years later, he founded the Aerospace International Research Center (AIRC) in Vienna, and today he is chairman of UNESCO's Science of Space committee.\n\nIn short, Ashurbeyli is no beginner when it comes to space.\n\nHe did, however, resign from all governmental organizations in 2011 , according to his website, and now claims to be politically neutral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 13 In 1975 a research group led by Princeton professor Gerard O'Neill conducted a 10 week study of future space colonies. The NASA-sponsored research and the paper born of it was given to artists Rick Guidice and Don Davis, commissioned to illustrate the fantastical and as yet unrealized concepts. Credit: NASA Ames Research Center\n\nAt a press conference in Hong Kong in June 2017, Ashurbeyli explained that Asgardia is a project he has been dreaming of since childhood.\n\nI was interested in doing something unusual that nobody else was doing, Ashurbeyli told CNN. It was my dream to create an independent country.\n\nThat ambition became more concrete after Ashurbeyli gave a speech at a conference on space law at McGill University in Montreal in 2016, where he was inspired by a discussion about the laws governing murder, marriage and divorce in space.\n\nI thought: 'Why not organize a country?' Not only for lawyers. But for technicians, for engineers, for every human ... because he's currently restricted by the laws of the country he was born in.\n\nCurrently space law is adhered to in the form of the Outer Space Treaty , signed by 103 countries including the US and Russia.\n\nAsgardia advocates for the creation of a new legal platform in space.\n\nBecoming a legitimate country\n\nOne of Asgardia's most ambitious plans is to gain UN membership.\n\nTo achieve this, the UN's Security Council must firstly approve Asgardia's application to be considered a nation, then two-thirds of members of the General Assembly must vote for its admission.\n\nA state has to have these characteristics: a permanent population; a defined territory, a government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states. And it must be recognized as a state by other states, Joanne Gabrynowicz, a space law expert and professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology's School of Law, tells CNN.\n\nA rendering shows a spacecraft with Saturn in view. Credit: James Vaughan\n\nAshurbeyli plans for Asgardia to form a democratic government, as well as a Prosecutors Office, National Audit Office and the other governmental bodies.\n\nGovernmental departments will be run by Asgardians in the locations they represent, while the administrative center will be in Vienna.\n\nThese have not yet been formed. A parliamentary election will come first: Asgardians have until March 29 to submit their applications to become parliamentarians. After the election, governmental bodies will then be formed.\n\nWhen asked by CNN how Asgardia intends to provide peace to its citizens without a physical settlement, Ashurbeyli says the nation's citizens can take advantage of their dual citizenship.\n\nIf I have problems on Earth, I'll have my embassy from Asgardia. (It's as if) you are a tourist, you can go to your embassy and they'll try to help you.\n\nAshurbeyli does, however, recognize the multitude of issues that come with forming his own nation -- let alone one based in space.\n\nWe have to be like a normal country. All countries have problems, and soon we will have the same problems, he says.\n\nBut we will have more than normal countries because we are not on earth.
Written by Allyssia Alleyne, CNN\n\nOver the last 300 years, it's passed through the hands of royals from four European dynasties. But in May, the 6.16-carat Farnese Blue diamond will go on sale for the first time in its history at a Sotheby's auction.\n\nThe pear-shaped fancy dark grey-blue diamond was unearthed from the Golconda mine in India, where the Hope Diamond discovered. It was originally gifted to the Italian-born Elisabeth Farnese, queen of Spain, in 1715, following her marriage to King Philip V of Spain.\n\nIt would be passed down through more than seven generations and, as Elisabeth's descendants married into other European families, journey across the continent, traveling from Spain to France, Italy and Austria.\n\nThe Farnese Diamond is being sold with a detachable fitting, a case and a plaque explaining its provenance. Credit: Courtesy Sotheby's\n\nAt key points it adorned a tie pin belonging to Charles II, Duke of Lucca, and a tiara dressed with diamonds thought to have belonged to Marie Antoinette. And yet, for much of history, the diamond was known only to family members and the jewelers who tended to it.\n\n'Fragments of history'\n\nNext month, a family descended from Queen Elisabeth will be selling the stone at Sotheby's Magnificent Jewels and Noble Jewels auction in Geneva, with the upper estimate set at 5 million Swiss francs ($5.27 million).\n\nHowever, David Bennett, chairman of Sotheby's international jewelry division, suggests that the diamond could sell for more: 75% of the jewels sold at 2017's Magnificent Jewels and Noble Jewels sales exceeded their top estimate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 17 The Aurora Green is the largest Fancy Vivid green diamond ever sold at auction. The stone went under the hammer on May 31, 2016 at Christie's auction house in Hong Kong, selling for $16,818,983. Credit: courtesy christies\n\nRoyal and noble collectors have traditionally had access to the finest gemstones available, and so the gems which adorn these pieces often display the very highest quality, size and rarity, Bennett said in an email. They are fragments of history and there is currently great enthusiasm for jewels of this type.\n\nThe Farnese Blue will go on public display at the Sotheby's Hong Kong showroom on on March 29, and will be exhibited in London, New York, Singapore, Taipei and Geneva before the auction.
It was November 2000, and she was a freshman at the University of Arizona. The essay was for class, but she was writing for herself.\n\nThompson wrote about an encounter she says she had with Hollywood writer and director James Toback two years earlier, when she was 17 years old. She didn't care about the grade she would get; she needed to get it all out of her head.\n\nShe remembered the stench of marijuana in the New York loft, the director's hot breath that smelled like onions and kielbasa. He straddled her leg and rubbed his groin against her, she wrote. She didn't name Toback in the essay, though the reader could easily identify which director she was talking about from the names of the movies he was working on.\n\nShe turned in the paper. It came back with an A, and a note from her instructor, Heather Nagami. I'm so sorry you had to go through this experience, it read. I'm glad you were able to get something positive out of it though, with your own self-reflection.\n\nAn excerpt of the essay Erin Thompson wrote for her freshman composition class at the University of Arizona.\n\nThompson, now 36 and an actress in Tucson, Arizona, shared her essay with CNN in October and reflected on the mindset of herself at 17. Her thoughts both as a teen and an adult woman provide rare insight into the impact from the alleged encounter with the director, who has been accused of sexually harassing and assaulting young women over several decades\n\nErin Thompson is now an actress in Tucson, Arizona.\n\nCNN has not been able to independently verify Thompson's account. Like many of Toback's accusers, Thompson said she did not file a police report at the time. Toback has not responded to CNN calls for comment for this story, but has denied the allegations made against him by more than 300 women\n\nNagami, who now teaches English to middle and high school students in Oro Valley, Arizona, never forgot what Thompson wrote.\n\nI just remember that essay, and with the recent stories that have been out in the news, I found myself thinking about it again, thinking of Erin, Nagami said last month.\n\nThe note Heather Nagami wrote to Thompson after grading her essay.\n\n'I was going to read for a big director'\n\nExtroverted and confident, Thompson always wanted to be an actress. She decided to leave Tucson after she graduated high school in May 1998.\n\nHer farewell cake read: Good Luck in New York.\n\nShe enrolled in the American Musical and Dramatic Academy, a two-year program in Manhattan. I had no fear, she said.\n\nErin Thompson at a farewell party in 1998 before she embarked on an acting career in New York.\n\nShe met Toback in the fall of 1998 while riding the subway. He reminded her of the panhandlers she saw who often begged her for money, she wrote. But he surprised her.\n\nI was a bit tired and not in the mood for a bum at this point, she wrote. But when he spoke to me, he did not ask for money, rather he painted a beautiful picture of what I could be. He introduced himself as a director and told me I was a fascinating beauty.\n\nToback, whose best-known films are The Gambler, The Pick-up Artist and Bugsy, invited her to read for a part in his next movie, she wrote, so she agreed to meet him the next day at a Manhattan loft.\n\nI was going to read for a big director tomorrow, but little did I know this 'reading' would change my life so drastically.\n\nWhen she arrived at the apartment, other people were there with Toback, who invited her to join him on a leather couch in the corner.\n\nTwo men sat at giant computer screens editing the movie Black and White, the 1999 film that Toback directed, Thompson wrote.\n\nRead Erin's current reflection He has such a deep, gruff voice and it seemed so close to my neck that I immediately got goose bumps. Something inside of me is telling me that this doesn't feel so right anymore. But, again, I ignore it. 'You really ought to get an agent, you're quite striking. You look very athletic as well, may I look at your ankle?' What was he asking me? To look at my ankle. What a whack job this one is. Of course, he did say I was striking. I love how I justify everything here. I offer up my ankle as he takes hold of my leg with one hand his other hand is slowing winding its way up my leg. I think I remember thinking 'just grow up, you're adult. You're in New York by yourself, you're going to school. If he wants to touch your ankle, show him your ankle. I remember feeling, like 'don't show him your ankle, this is not how a normal interview goes. As a 36-year-old, I wish I could go back and say, 'you were right in that one moment there. You should've absolutely gotten up and left.' There's a part of me that wishes instead of showing him my ankle, I should have kicked him in the nose and walked out.\n\nToback asked her how old she was.\n\nYour eyes show so much more history than you're telling me. I want to know how you feel what you feel. I need you to get deeper with me, so I can compare you with the main character, she recalled him saying.\n\nHe told her to come to get another reel of film in the video room, so she followed him into a storage room with halogen lights.\n\nThen, she heard the door click.\n\nHe told her to have a seat on a swivel chair. She faced a television that Toback switched on. His movie Two Girls and a Guy played.\n\nRead Erin's current reflection He placed one of his huge, fat hands on my shoulder and says, 'I want to show you something that you'll remember for the rest of your life. Just watch my eyes and do what I say.' Why the f--- can't I move? Why is no sound coming out of my mouth? It's amazing what fright does to a person. I'm sure I knew something incredibly bad was about to happen. Everyone said you'll do what you have to do to survive. But I would have to say that's kind of false. I was incredibly strong, even at 17, as far as what I knew to do in a bad situation. And I could not possibly have moved. I didn't know what was going to happen. I didn't know if my clothes were going to get taken off. I didn't know if his clothes were going to come off. It literally feels like you're frozen in time, and this horrible slow motion is happening. It's like when you dream and in your dream, you have to be somewhere really quickly or you trying to do something quickly and you just can't move.\n\nWhat follows in Thompson's essay echoes the accounts of other women who've accused Toback of sexual harassment.\n\nRead Erin's current reflection He has perched himself on my right leg and begins rubbing himself up and down on my leg. He grabs my hands and tells me to rub his nipples and keep looking in his eyes. He was moaning ... yet I could still hear the movie, it was a funny part. I couldn't believe this was happening to me. I had trusted him and he was doing this this to me. Everything felt very slow, almost as if I was watching this happen to myself. I'm very aware of what was happening on my leg. I'm very aware of what my hands were doing. I cannot forget the dark eyes, the gross facial hair. As a 36-year-old, I'm still very familiar with that moment. And as a 17-year-old, I remember exactly what I felt like, and yet I'm still able to have this outside commentary with myself still saying, 'hey, you should get up.'\n\nReading it again for the first time in 17 years, Thompson grew angry.\n\nI was more pissed that at some point I didn't say anything to anyone that could have done something, she said. I still have that guilt -- especially seeing how many more women have come out with the same story.\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair , actress Selma Blair alleged that Toback asked her to audition for him naked, then asked her to let him rub himself against her.\n\nI felt disgust and shame, and like nobody would ever think of me as being clean again after being this close to the devil, Blair told the magazine. His energy was so sinister.\n\nJUST WATCHED Toback accused of sexual harassment Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Toback accused of sexual harassment 01:06\n\nIn her essay, Thompson wrote that she ran for the door after Toback climbed off her. The people in the room stared at her, she said.\n\nI had always had a positive outlook on people, but the faces I had just run away from in the editing studio forced me to rethink that outlook, Thompson wrote.\n\nFaith in humanity 'crushed'\n\nBack in her dormitory, she told her friends the audition went well. When they left, she fell to her knees and cried.\n\nShe told her roommate, Julie Messer, who Thompson said encouraged her to tell her parents.\n\nMesser, now 46, recalled Thompson was just all to pieces.\n\nShe was scared to death. She was still shaking. She didn't sleep that night. I sat up with her, Messer said from her home in Waynesville, North Carolina.\n\nMesser said Thompson took a long time to get a few words out. Messer said she doesn't remember the name of the person Thompson said took advantage of her but it wasn't a name she recognized.\n\nI knew he pushed himself on her. I can't be specific of exactly of what happened, she said. I do remember (him) taking advantage of her.\n\nShe added: It wasn't just feel you up. It was more than that.\n\nShortly after the alleged incident, Thompson said she called her mother crying. Adrianne Craig confirmed that her daughter told her about the encounter 17 years ago but didn't go into detail.\n\nRead Erin's current reflection I never said anything to anyone who could've done anything about it. I figured it was his word against mine and I didn't want to drag it out ... My personal experience did change my life, but not entirely for the worse. I do not hate men or fear them, I am just cautious now. With everyone. I no longer look at someone and assume he or she is a good person, no one gets the benefit of the doubt from me anymore. I cannot allow myself to ever feel as helpless and small as I did that night. I am stronger from the incident and for that I am grateful. Maybe that's why it happened. To show me my self-worth, and to make me believe in the strength I possess. I had a good thesis for the rest of my life when I wrote this essay. I was feeling strong. I was feeling empowered, probably because I had finally written it out and I knew that my professor was going to read it. Yes, the incident did make a stronger person. But I think had I been able to say something to someone -- an authority and made something happen -- I might have felt like an even stronger person. So, as a 36-year-old, I would have told the 17-year-old, 'you think you're making the right choice right now by not saying anything because you're scared, and you think someone's not going to believe or you're embarrassed. I wish I could tell her all that strength that got you out of there, that strength would've just gotten bigger than just trying suppress it.\n\nThompson says the encounter crushed her faith in humanity and haunted her for years.\n\nShe became disheartened about a career in movies after that. She trusted few people. She didn't get into a relationship that I wasn't 100% in control of, she said. I just wasn't vulnerable.\n\nShe buried the memory of that night, drank to self-medicate and threw herself into school and work.\n\nErin Thompson graduated from the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in 1999 and returned to Arizona.\n\nThompson had carried the essay in a binder of keepsakes for 17 years, moving it from house to house and state to state. She worked as a waitress, a sommelier and a massage therapist.\n\nI must have kept it because I must have not wanted to forget that I got through it, she said.\n\n'I felt like I was going to throw up'\n\nShe came back to acting in 2012, joining the Gaslight Theater in Tucson, and met her husband there. They married two years later.\n\nStill, the memories of the alleged assault haunted her. About a year into her marriage, Thompson caught a glimpse of Toback's cameo in the movie Black and White as her husband was flipping channels.\n\nI felt like I was going to throw up, she said.\n\n'I am done with you'\n\nLast fall, she told her therapist about Toback. The therapist urged her to confront the feelings she had repressed. She thought for the next week about what the therapist had said -- could she find the strength do that?\n\nOne night after dinner, she made up her mind. After her husband went to bed, she sat on the couch with a glass of wine, muted the television and went to Toback's page on the Internet Movie Database website.\n\nButterflies formed in her stomach. She didn't like seeing his name.\n\nAnger welled up inside her. She clenched her fist. She stared at his face -- those dark eyes, mustache and beard. For nearly two decades, she said, the sight of men with facial hair like Toback's had made her uneasy.\n\nI can't believe you did this to me. I can't believe I allowed it.\n\nOvercome with emotion, she leaped up and rushed out to the porch.\n\nShe fastened her eyes on a large tree in the yard and imagined it was Toback standing in front of her.\n\nThey were going to have it out in the dark. She cursed him. Then tears came.\n\nI can't believe you did this to me. I can't believe I allowed it, she said.\n\nShe stopped crying.\n\nI am done with you, she said, and went inside.\n\nShe would wait almost another year before she would tell her husband.\n\nFinally, some relief\n\nOn October 22, when the Los Angeles Times published the first story about multiple allegations of sexual harassment and assault against Toback, Thompson finally told her husband, Todd.\n\nHe was surprised when she told him, he said, and pledged to support her.\n\nI've seen these movies and I've enjoyed a couple of them, Todd told CNN. Now you have this total disdain for another human being based off their history.\n\nSince the allegations against the director went public, Thompson has reached out to Sari Kamin, one of Toback's accusers who had spoken to the LA Times, and joined a Twitter group of women that included some who had similar allegations against Toback.\n\nShe also has spoken to a prosecutor from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office and a New York police detective.\n\nThompson said the prosecutor thanked her for sharing her story but said the statute of limitations had passed. The prosecutor promised to keep her posted.\n\nIn an email, the NYPD said it has spoken to multiple women who claim that they were sexually assaulted by James Toback. The investigation is ongoing.\n\nThompson said she wants Toback to have to pay for something. There has to be some retribution.\n\nAfter years of holding her story in, she said, she's finally found some relief. I feel like it's off my chest, she said. From here on, it's up to whoever can make something happen, happen.

This discontent has grown more and more in recent years, the palace's communications chief, Lene Balleby, told Danish tabloid BT in August last year.\n\nFor the prince, the decision not to be buried beside the queen is the natural consequence of not having been treated equally to his spouse – by not having the title and role he has desired.\n\nPHOTO: Luca V.

It was during this time, in 1965, that he first met then-Princess Margrethe at a dinner party of mutual friends.\n\nThey were engaged in 1966 and married the following year.\n\nIn a period of mourning, the Royal Family will not participate in social or entertaining events until March 14, the family said in a statement.\n\nA previous version of this article misspelled Lene Balleby's family name and left out a word in her second quote.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nPeople are looking in shocked disgust at the defenders of Roy Moore. How can so many Alabamans throw their support behind Moore, the Republican nominee for a United States Senate seat there, who is accused of pursuing or sexually abusing teens – including a 14 year-old – back when he was in his 30s? Moore denies the allegations, and is threatening to sue the Washington Post, where the report appeared last week.\n\nPHOTO: Tom Spader/Asbury Park Press Fraidy Reiss\n\nAmericans are appalled, unable to account for the bizarre responses of, for example, the state auditor, who likened Moore's situation to the biblical story of Joseph and Mary, or the parade of citizen supporters defending Moore and doubting his accusers, or even an elementary school principal, who seemed to dismiss the allegations: This all happened many years ago, correct? I honestly think we're paying too much attention to it. (She later said she didn't mean for her comment to come out that way.)\n\nHow can such thinking persist anywhere in America in 2017? How can anyone not be horrified that a grown man could allegedly attempt sexual relations with a minor?\n\nI must point out an awkward truth.\n\nChild marriage – which often is legalized child rape – is happening at an alarming rate across the United States today. Clerks and judges openly give marriage licenses to adult men who are marrying young girls, granting the men a get out of jail free card that in many cases allows what would otherwise be against the law.\n\nMoore's alleged sexual encounters more than 30 years ago, as described by his accusers, were surreptitious, the actions of a man who knew he might get punished if he were caught. These adult husbands' sexual encounters with child wives, on the other hand, are brazen, the actions of men who know they will not get punished because the government has sanctioned their misconduct and is complicit in it.\n\nWhile most states set 18 as the marriage age, legal loopholes – such as judicial approval – in all 50 states allow marriage before 18. Laws in 25 states do not specify any minimum age for marriage.\n\nIronically, though Alabama's child marriage laws are on their face abysmal, as they permit marriage before 18, they are relatively strong compared with other states across the nation: At least Alabama specifies that no child under 16 may marry.\n\nIn 2015, Unchained At Last – a nonprofit I founded in 2011 to fight forced marriage – collected marriage license data in the United States from 2000 to 2010, the time period for which the highest number of states had marriage age data available.\n\nIn just the 38 US states that track marriage ages, according to the available data, more than 167,000 children, some as young as 10, were married between 2000 and 2010. In all 50 states, Unchained At Last estimated that 248,000 children – or those under age 18 – were married in America in that decade. (Twelve states and Washington, DC, could not provide sufficient data on child marriage. For them, Unchained used a statistical model to estimate the number of children wed, based on the strong correlation Unchained identified between population and child marriage.)\n\nAlmost all the children married were girls wed to adult men, according to the data. In many cases, because of the age of the child or the spousal age difference, sex between the two would constitute statutory rape under that state's laws.\n\nThis is happening in state after state, not only in Alabama. Since 1995, judges in my home state of New Jersey, for example, have handed marriage licenses to more than 105 men who instead should have been investigated for statutory rape under state law: The men were four or more years older than their child bride, who was between the ages of 13 and 15.\n\nHorrifyingly, statutory rape within marriage is not considered a crime in many states. New Jersey is not one of those states. Thus, while those 105+ marriages are legal, every time those couples have sex, the husband could theoretically be charged with sexual assault.\n\nChild marriage is an outrage not only when it legalizes or ignores statutory rape. Child marriage also is often forced marriage – imposed on minors who have little recourse. Before children become adults, which typically happens at age 18, they cannot easily leave home, enter a domestic violence shelter, retain an attorney or bring a legal action. They are nearly powerless to protect themselves if their parents or others try to force them into marriage.\n\nI see the horrors of forced child marriage regularly through Unchained At Last. It means rape for the child on the wedding night and thereafter. It usually means the child is pulled out of middle school or high school, with all her or his hopes for the future destroyed. It means lifelong trauma.\n\nFurther, whether it is forced or not, child marriage devastates girls' health, education and economic opportunities and significantly increases their risk of being beaten by their spouse. The US State Department considers marriage before 18 a human rights abuse.\n\nSolving America's child marriage problem should be simple. Every state can start by passing commonsense legislation I have helped to write to eliminate the archaic loopholes that permit marriage before 18, or before the age of adulthood, whichever is higher. Strong legislation to this effect is pending in Florida, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.\n\nBut the same legislation has failed recently in other states. Gov. Chris Christie conditionally vetoed the bill that passed with overwhelming, bipartisan support in New Jersey. New Hampshire legislators voted no, and Maryland legislators let the bill die, twice. Legislators in New York, Virginia, Texas and Connecticut passed weaker bills that still allow marriage before 18.\n\nSure, let's be outraged about Moore's alleged actions to prey on five teenage girls.\n\nBut let's not forget the ongoing outrage of child marriage, happening legally right now in courthouses and clerks' offices across America.

(Photo by Jim WATSON / AFP) (Photo credit should read JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN Business) —\n\nIn an explosive tell-all blog post published Thursday, Jeff Bezos accused the publisher of the National Enquirer of trying to extort him.\n\nThe post by Bezos on the blogging platform Medium revealed what he said were the full text of emails his representatives got from executives at AMI, the publisher of the National Enquirer.\n\nBezos, the billionaire founder and CEO of Amazon (AMZN), alleged that AMI threatened to release compromising photos of him. His post included what he said were emails from AMI detailing what he described as extortion and blackmail. Bezos, the world's richest person, is the single largest shareholder in Amazon (AMZN), with 16% of the company's stock.\n\nSomething unusual happened to me yesterday. Actually, for me it wasn't just unusual — it was a first. I was made an offer I couldn't refuse. Or at least that's what the top people at the National Enquirer thought. I'm glad they thought that, because it emboldened them to put it all in writing, Bezos wrote. Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I've decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten.\n\nBezos titled his post No thank you, Mr. Pecker, referring to AMI's chairman and CEO, David Pecker. In the text, he shared what he said was an email from AMI's chief content officer, Dylan Howard, in which Howard threatened to release intimate and personal photos and text messages of Bezos and a woman the National Enquirer said he was having an affair with.\n\nIn the AMI letters I'm making public, you will see the precise details of their extortionate proposal: They will publish the personal photos unless Gavin de Becker and I make the specific false public statement to the press that we 'have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AMI's coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.'\n\nPHOTO: From Jeff Bezos/Medium.com In an explosive tell-all blog post published Thursday afternoon, Jeff Bezos accused the publisher of the National Enquirer of trying to extort him.\n\nSome of Bezos' text messages were made public last month. Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie Bezos, are getting divorced after 25 years of marriage.\n\nHoward and AMI deputy general counsel Jon Fine did not immediately respond to CNN Business' requests for comment. Neither did a spokesperson for the Washington Post. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment other than to confirm that Bezos wrote the post.\n\nRival investigations\n\nAfter Bezos made his divorce plans public, the National Enquirer said it had been investigating Bezos for four months, claiming it had evidence that Bezos has been whisking his mistress off to exotic destinations on his $65 million private jet. The Enquirer and other outlets identified the woman as Lauren Sanchez, a former anchor for Fox's local station in Los Angeles.\n\nGavin de Becker, whom the Washington Post described as Bezos' longtime private security consultant, has been conducting an investigation to determine the source of the leaks to the Enquirer.\n\nEarlier this week, de Becker told the Post that he believed the Enquirer's reporting about Bezos was sparked by a politically motivated leak, and told the Post and the Daily Beast that his investigation had looked at Michael Sanchez, Lauren Sanchez's brother, who is connected to a number of associates of President Donald Trump. Sanchez, the Post reported, firmly denies playing any role in the revelation of his sister's affair. Michael Sanchez did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN Business.\n\nIn his blog post, Bezos said that an AMI leader advised us that Pecker was apoplectic about de Becker's investigation.\n\nAMI threatens Bezos\n\nBezos included an email from Howard to de Becker's lawyer. In the email, Howard wrote that he had evidence of 10 photographs of Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, including nude selfies. In his introduction to his descriptions of the photos, Howard appeared to make reference to an upcoming Post article that quoted de Becker.\n\n(W)ith The Washington Post poised to publish unsubstantiated rumors of The National Enquirer's initial report, I wanted to describe to you the photos obtained during our newsgathering.\n\nThen, in an email to de Becker's attorney, AMI Deputy General Counsel Jon Fine referenced Bezos' investigation and the Post's reporting.\n\nIt is our understanding that your client's representatives, including the Washington Post, continue to pursue and to disseminate these false and spurious allegations in a manner that is injurious to American Media and its executives, Fine said in the email. Accordingly, we hereby demand that you cease and desist such defamatory conduct immediately. Any further dissemination of these false, vicious, speculative and unsubstantiated statements is done at your client's peril.\n\nBezos called the exchanges an extortionate proposal.\n\nPecker has become a public name because of his association with President Donald Trump. Pecker was granted immunity in a federal investigation into former Trump attorney Michael Cohen. In exchange, Pecker agreed to provide federal prosecutors information on hush money deals.\n\nCohen admitted that he made payments to AMI, which in turn paid women who claim they had affairs with Trump. AMI purchased the rights to the women's stories but never published them — a technique known as catch and kill.\n\n– CNN Business' Heather Kelly and Oliver Darcy contributed to this report.

As awful as he was to my mom at times, it didn't compare to how great he was as a father.\n\nCNN has reached out to Rihanna, Fenty and Perkins for comment.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion at CNN .\n\n(CNN) Maybe it's just how the general state of things is affecting me lately, but the 2020 Academy Awards nominations honor the gloomiest, most despair-ridden slate of films I've seen since the 1970s, when movies in general were better than they are now.\n\nDon't believe me? Watch 1976's Taxi Driver and last year's Joker in tandem.\n\nAnd if you still don't believe me, I'll gladly take my  OK, Boomer  snaps under a separate cover. (Just don't be too repetitive.)\n\nThe thing is: It wouldn't have taken much to lighten this slate up a little. Nominating Dolemite is My Name for Best Picture, for instance, would have been a nice grace note. So would nominating Eddie Murphy for Best Actor for Dolemite Akwafina for Best Actress for The Farewell or Jennifer Lopez for Best Supporting Actress for Hustlers.\n\nLots of bounciness and light in those choices. But they're nowhere to be found\n\nJust about every Academy Awards season somehow ends up being a contest between our hopes and fears, with hope usually walking off with all the party favors.\n\nThe examples go as far back as 1977, when the uplifting Rocky won Best Picture over Taxi Driver and other less sanguine competitors such as Network. Another example came last year when the racial-brotherhood bromides of Green Book likewise triumphed over the beautiful-but-distressing childhood elegy, Roma, and a far more acerbic race-based melodrama, BlackKkKlansman.\n\nThis year's Best Picture nominees? Not a whole lot of hope here, folks. We have the slow, painful death of romance (Marriage Story); a dour, near-funereal shaggy-dog story about a phlegmatic hit man (The Irishman); a blackly funny but agonizing depiction of contemporary social polarities culminating in gore and gristle (Parasite); a wish-fulfillment fantasy of an alternate-universe 1969 whose climax is no less bloody (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood); a harrowing odyssey through the muddy, corpse-ridden battlefields of World War I Europe (1917); and an origin story of a comic-book sociopath (Joker) that seems almost nostalgic for a dingy, crime-ridden urban landscape straight out of the Bronx-is-Burning era of 1970s New York.\n\nEven less drastically dark Best Picture fare such as Little Women and Ford vs. Ferrari are haunted by the prospects of death to varying degrees, while Jojo Rabbit may be the only movie on this ballot with some rays of hope poking through its ominous Second World War milieu. Still, there may be something a little too idiosyncratic to some voters about a youthful protagonist whose imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler.\n\nSeriously, were those voting on nominees that hard up for uplift? What happened to Dolemite is My Name, the raucous, ribald and charmingly humane account of African American lounge comic Rudy Ray Moore's reinvention as a cult movie icon? The movie, in this writer's opinion a better-made one than Green Book, was noticeably absent from all major categories, including Best Actor, where Murphy's performance as Moore was once considered a no-brainer nominee.\n\nWhile we're here, let's make a checklist of other omissions. The most egregious, perhaps, is Greta Gerwig for directing Little Women, though it's always possible she could receive the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar she's nominated for. As with Spike Lee's Oscar for co-writing BlacKkKlansman last year, it's often an Academy consolation prize.\n\nLupita Nyong'o's fiercely committed performance was the best reason to see the horror comedy Us. But she was likewise ignored by the Academy for a Best Actress slot, as was Akwafina's affecting Golden Globe-winning turn in The Farewell. And don't get partisans of Jennifer Lopez's performance in Hustlers started on their girl's omission as a Best Supporting Actress nominee. No doubt you've heard them shouting from the Bronx to Beverly Hills.\n\nExcepting Nyong'o, any of these films or nominees could have lightened the load of gloom shrouding this year's awards, though one should set off fireworks for Parasite's six nominations, including Best Picture, the latter an unprecedented coup for a South Korean feature.\n\nSomehow, despite Joker's cache of 11 nominations -- the most of any movie, with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and The Irishman close behind with 10 -- I'm wondering whether Batman's mortal enemy will actually end up with the big prize at the end.\n\nAs I keep telling people year after year, the industry -- not the critics or the audience -- votes on these things. And people in the industry don't just vote for what's great or even good: They vote for what they want the rest of the world to know about their trade, their product and their shared values -- and not necessarily in that order.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.

(GREG BAKER/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe night they fled, Reem and Rawan didn't dare sleep.\n\nIt was September 6, 2018. The two Saudi sisters were on a family vacation in Colombo, Sri Lanka. For weeks, they had helped their mother organize the trip, feigning excitement at the possibility of two weeks away from Riyadh, but knowing that if all went to plan, they'd never go back.\n\nFailure was not an option. Every step of their escape from Saudi Arabia carried the threat of severe punishment or death.\n\nWe knew the first time, if it's not perfect, it will be the last time, Reem says.\n\nCNN has changed the sisters' names and is not showing their faces, at their request for their safety.\n\nThe sisters say years of strict Islamic teaching and physical abuse at home had convinced them that they had no future in a society that places women under the enforced guardianship of men, and limits their aspirations.\n\nIt's slavery, because whatever the woman will do it's the business of the male, Rawan says.\n\nThat's why they say they renounced Islam.\n\nAnd that's why aged 18 and 20, they stole back their own passports, hid their abayas under the bedcovers, snuck out of their holiday home and boarded a flight from Colombo to Melbourne, via Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong stopover was supposed to take less than two hours.\n\nTwo hours has turned into five months.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN This photo was taken in a restroom in an airport during a trip to Turkey. The sisters wore this type of niqab when they were traveling outside Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhy they fled\n\nGood girls do what they're told, are quiet, don't argue or risk embarrassing their families. Reem and Rawan say they had turned being good girls into a fine art.\n\nIn our house, we (were) always the good girls they wanted us to be. So, if they want us to clean, we will clean. If they want us to cook, then we will cook, 18-year-old Rawan says.\n\nThe last two years it was really bad, because I just forget who I am, I am just pretending (to be) like an Islamic girl, says her 20-year-old sister, Reem.\n\nThey went to school, studied hard and avoided confrontation. Of course, the same rules didn't apply to their brothers. Beat your sisters, the siblings say their brothers were told, it'll make you better men.\n\nReem and Rawan are reluctant to talk about the abuse at the hands of their family. They say it didn't happen all the time, just enough to remind them of the rules. And enough to fill them with terror about what might happen if anyone found out about their plan or, worse still, caught them carrying it out.\n\nThe escape\n\nLeaving Saudi Arabia is not a simple undertaking for women who rebel against the system. Permission is needed from a male guardian for many basic activities, including international travel.\n\nReem and Rawan say they had been planning their escape in secret for two years. They didn't dare discuss it in case they were overheard, so, instead, they swapped WhatsApp messages, even while alone at night in their shared room.\n\nBefore they fled, the Sri Lanka vacation was just like any other. They wore their niqabs to the beach and sat away from the surf while their brothers swam and joked. They cooked the meals and spent most of their days inside. It was humid. Their niqabs stuck to their skin and made it hard to see.\n\nWe travel to move from a box to another box. From home to hotel, nothing will change, Rawan says. They will go out, they will live freely, the men, of course, we will sit away, watching them doing what they want.\n\nTheir five-year-old sister played in the sand, but their 12-year-old sister, like them, didn't. She too was learning that it's OK to be a girl in Saudi Arabia – until you grow up.\n\nDuring the trip, Rawan turned 18. The timing was no accident. The vacation was planned with gentle persuasion to coincide with a birthday that, unbeknown to their mother, allowed Rawan to apply for an Australian tourist visa.\n\nOn the last night of the trip, the sisters launched into action. Reem pre-booked the taxi. It was Rawan's job to retrieve their passports from a bag stored in their parents' bedroom. Around 2 a.m., she tiptoed past them as they slept, took the bag with their passports, then snuck back in again to return the bag so as not to raise suspicion.\n\nIt's a really great memory, exciting, Rawan tells CNN, smiling. Of the two sisters, she's the more talkative, taking the lead and occasionally looking to her sister for advice on the right word in English. Reem is more reserved. She's careful about what she says and who to trust. They both have dark, short, curly hair and being small in stature seem much younger than their years.\n\nWhen the cab driver arrived at 5 a.m., the sisters say they did something they'd never done before. They pulled on jeans they'd bought in secret and walked out of the house without their abayas.\n\nIt was only after they arrived at Colombo Airport that the sisters booked the flight they'd meticulously researched online: SriLankan Airlines flight UL892 departing Colombo at 9 a.m., arriving Hong Kong at 5:10 p.m. local time. From there, they'd take Cathay Pacific flight CX135 departing at 7:10 p.m. for Melbourne, Australia.\n\nThey had no trouble boarding the plane for the roughly six-hour flight to Hong Kong.\n\nIt was after they arrived at Hong Kong International Airport that things started to go wrong.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The younger sister takes a selfie in a hotel room. They say they felt like ghosts under the full-length black robe, as if they were invisible, not there.\n\nArriving in Hong Kong\n\nWhat happened in the transit area was something the sisters might have anticipated had they known their uncle had connections to the Saudi Interior Ministry or had realized the power Saudi officials could have over local airport staff.\n\nAs soon as the women stepped off the plane, they say two men approached them and asked if they were going to Melbourne. The women say the men asked for their passports and boarding passes, first saying they might miss their flight, then suggesting there was something wrong with their Australian visas.\n\nIn a letter to the sisters' lawyer obtained by CNN, SriLankan Airlines has identified the men as Naeem Khan, SriLankan Airlines station manager, and Noman Shah, a staff member for ground handling agent, Jardine Aviation Services.\n\nThe sisters say the men led them to another area of the airport, where their lawyer Michael Vidler says they canceled the women's Cathay Pacific flight to Melbourne and booked them, without their knowledge, on an Emirates flight to Riyadh, via Dubai.\n\nCathay Pacific tells CNN that the sisters' flight was canceled by representatives of SriLankan Airlines.\n\nSriLankan Airlines told CNN its staff members canceled the flight at the explicit request of the Saudi Consulate, which had already booked the sisters on the flight to Riyadh.\n\nThe airline said consular officials told its staff the women's father had phoned and said the sisters needed to go back to Saudi Arabia as soon as possible as their mother was terminally ill.\n\nThe women knew their mother wasn't ill and were quite sure there was nothing wrong with their visas.\n\nWe allege that they were the subject of an attempted kidnapping in an international airport in a restricted area, Vidler tells CNN. The Saudi Consulate was actively trying to deceive them.\n\nCNN has approached the Saudi Consulate in Hong Kong and the Saudi Foreign Ministry for comment on the sisters' claims and has not received a response. Hong Kong Police have confirmed that they're investigating the allegations.\n\nSriLankan Airlines says at no time did the sisters indicate there was a problem. The women disagree.\n\nVidler says that closed-circuit television seen by his team appears to confirm that Saudi Consul General Omar Al Bunayan was at the airport, speaking to the women and airline staff.\n\nThe presence of senior Saudi officials at the airport filled the women with dread. They'd heard about Dina Ali Lasloom, the 24-year-old Saudi woman who was forced onto a plane to Riyadh at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila in April 2017. Her hands, feet and mouth had been bound with duct tape, one witness told Human Rights Watch.\n\nReem and Rawan feared the same could happen to them.\n\nThey excused themselves to go to the bathroom where they made the decision to flee. As they emerged, they said they saw one of their passports on the table. Rawan tried to grab it.\n\nThe teenager says one of the men immediately slapped her hand, prompting the sisters to scream in Arabic, You kidnap us!\n\nThe sisters say they caused such a scene that the Consul General suggested they move to a quieter area where he presented them with their passports and new boarding passes – for Dubai.\n\nThey ran. First to the Cathay desk where counter staff told them their flights had been canceled. Then to the Qantas desk, where they'd hurriedly booked the next flight to Melbourne, QF30, departing at 7:00 p.m.\n\nSoon after they were issued boarding passes, the women say Shah, the ground handling staff member, tried to snatch them.\n\nJardine Aviation Services, whose staff members carry out a number of tasks within the airport, says its employees didn't tell the women their mother was ill or that was there was an issue with their Australia visas. It denies its staff members slapped Hawan's hand or tried to grab the sisters' boarding passes.\n\nHong Kong's Airport Authority has refused to give CNN a closed-circuit recording of the events that unfolded due to privacy concerns.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The women shared selfies they'd taken of their life before they fled. They wore niqabs in public from the age of 11 and at home were told to wear long gowns, so as not to tempt their brothers.\n\nFor the second time in two hours, the sisters say senior Saudi officials stopped them from flying. The sisters say Saudi Vice Consul Al Sharif told staff at the Qantas check-in desk they were running away, had stolen money, and weren't tourists.\n\nAustralian immigration officials were summoned on the phone and after a conversation with the women, Canberra canceled their visas.\n\nThe only issues with the visa occurred when the Vice Consul made what we believe to be false representations to the Australian authorities at the boarding gate of Qantas airlines, Vidler says.\n\nA spokesperson from Australia's Home Affairs department declined to comment on individual cases. Qantas also declined to comment but a spokesman pointed out that the airline does not make visa assessments.\n\nThe sisters say they stayed at the airport for three hours before asking Cathay Pacific counter staff for permission to leave. They wrote their names and a fake Hong Kong contact address then caught a train to the city.\n\nKhashoggi case puts Saudi Arabia under scrutiny\n\nReem and Rawan escaped Saudi Arabia weeks before the world's attention turned to the kingdom and the disappearance of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. They watched from Hong Kong as gruesome details emerged of Khashoggi's murder inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, allegedly by a team of hitmen who cut up his body with a bone saw.\n\nIn November, a source told CNN that the CIA had determined that Khashoggi was killed on the instruction of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, known as MBS, a claim the kingdom denies.\n\nThe Saudi sisters shrug when asked if they are surprised by Khashoggi's murder and the allegation that their country's de facto leader ordered it.\n\nWe know that Saudi Arabia can do stuff like this, Reem says. They are chasing innocent girls, not even important girls, Rawan agrees. We're just normal young women trying to find a life far away from violence.\n\nSoon after the women arrived in Hong Kong, their father and uncle came to the city to find them. Hong Kong police confirmed to CNN that a missing persons report had been filed.\n\nUsing a passport tracking system linked to hotel check-ins, Hong Kong police officers located the sisters on Monday, September 10 and took them into custody for questioning.\n\nThe women say they were held in a room in the imposing Wan Chai police headquarters for six hours, where they repeatedly refused requests from their father and their uncle to see them.\n\nPolice eventually drove them back to their hotel. By that time, it was after midnight and the women hurriedly packed their bags and fled.\n\nIn the five months since, they've moved from shelter to shelter, hotel to hotel, to evade detection and their potential forced return to Riyadh.\n\nThe sisters have not sought asylum in Hong Kong, however. Doing so would have put them at the end of a long queue of claimants caught in Hong Kong's Unified Screening Mechanism (USM), a system used by the government to process asylum claims. The UNHCR doesn't assess claims in Hong Kong.\n\nThrough their lawyer, Reem and Rawan are seeking a visa in a safe country. Vidler says they have few options. Their Saudi passports have been canceled and they don't have formal permission to stay in Hong Kong.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The sisters say being forced to wear the niqab robbed them of their identities. They knew they'd be expected to wear one for the rest of their lives, like their mother.\n\nLife in Saudi Arabia\n\nAt home in Riyadh, the sisters say they were beaten by their father and brothers for a reason and no reason.\n\nOne day when she was 14, Reem says her brother started hitting her for talking and laughing with Rawan. He said that people will hear my voice and it will bring shame, she says.\n\nThe sisters knew it was likely there would be an arranged marriage. There was talk of Rawan marrying her younger cousin, a boy still in high school.\n\nReem was the first to renounce Islam in October 2016, followed by Rawan in May 2017. They didn't dare tell anyone but say they announced it under fake names on Twitter.\n\nI knew If I told my family they will hurt me and I'll be killed. Because that what we studied in schools, that whoever left Islam should be killed. I knew no one will protect me because all my family are so religious and none of them will support me. I was afraid of them finding out, Reem says.\n\nThere are no firm figures on how many Saudi women have escaped the country – or how many have failed in their attempt to leave – but the total number of Saudi asylum seekers is rising.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, 575 Saudi nationals applied for asylum in 2015. Two years later, that figure had more than doubled to over 1,200.\n\nThe period coincides with the rising influence of MBS who in June 2017 was appointed heir to the Saudi throne by his father King Salman.\n\nSince then, MBS has made it clear that dissent won't be tolerated, even as the kingdom has earned international plaudits for new female-focused policies, including lifting the ban on women drivers.\n\nRana Ahmad, a 33-year-old Saudi national who runs the Atheist Refugee Relief agency in Germany, says the jailing and torture of the same women who campaigned for the right to drive had sent a message to some Saudi women that they have no future in the country.\n\nThey look at these women, they're trying to do something and the government puts them in jail. So they see no hope anymore, they want to leave, she said.\n\nAdam Coogle, a Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW), says women whose escape plans are thwarted are at serious risk of abuse.\n\nPunishments range from being locked in their room for months on end or banned from using a mobile phone, to criminal prosecution by the state for disobeying their parents or harming the kingdom's reputation. The women themselves say they fear they'll be killed by their own families.\n\nCoogle says there are few safe corridors for women to leave, because of political pressure the Saudi government applies to some foreign countries to return runaways without giving them the opportunity to claim asylum or put their case forward.\n\nAnywhere you go that doesn't have some sort of respect for refugee law or a strong record of rule of law is a problem because they're the countries where Saudi Arabia can apply its diplomatic pressure to get countries to cooperate, he says.\n\nFew regrets\n\nReem and Rawan say they could see signs of change in Saudi Arabia, but it wasn't moving fast enough for them. They laugh at the suggestion that progress was made by giving Saudi women the right to drive.\n\nDriving cars is not something to celebrate, Reem says. There is a woman abused in the house, and no one hears their voice, and they want us to celebrate a car? Rawan adds.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the sisters watch Netflix to pass the time. Wearing jeans and trainers, they could easily be mistaken for one of the millions of tourists that come through the city each year.\n\nSometimes Reem wears lipstick. She seems relaxed but has a habit of picking at the skin on her fingers when she's nervous. Sometimes, she does it so much that they start to bleed.\n\nThe sisters are anxious about what comes next. But even after five months of uncertainty and fear, they have few regrets.\n\nI regret not waiting, but not leaving, Reem says. From my childhood, I knew this is not my home. I always knew my rights would be taken.\n\nRawan says she too knew there was no life for her in Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhen I was growing up I saw my brothers do whatever they want, have whatever they want. But for me, I should be a good girl, a good woman, to marry someone, my cousin, because I should not even dream to choose my husband, to choose my partner.\n\nI want to study what I want, I want to work what I want, I want to choose the day I marry. To choose the man I marry. Even if I don't want to marry, I want the right to choose.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated with new information from human rights lawyer Michael Vidler who said he originally misspoke about which Saudi consulate official was at the Hong Kong airport speaking to the Saudi sisters and airline staff. Only the Consul General was seen by Vidler's team on closed circuit television.
(CNN) — If everything had gone according to plan, they would probably never have met. But Mafalda Feliciano's original British Airways flight from Brazil was overbooked, so she was bumped on to another -- and then fate played its hand.\n\nTraveling with her sister and brother in law for a vacation in Egypt in September 2004, the group was re-routed via London.\n\nAfter they lost their original seats, Feliciano ended up on her own, in the middle of a row, between two strangers.\n\nBy her own accounts, Feliciano, a then-37-year-old medical physicist from Brazil, is naturally shy and introverted. She had no intention of making conversation with the passengers on either side of her. Instead, she settled in for a quiet flight across Europe.\n\nAbout two hours into the journey, bored of napping, Feliciano went to turn on the inflight entertainment. She reached for what she thought was her remote, built into the armrest, and hit the on-button.\n\nIt was the wrong remote. She'd accidentally turned off the screen belonging to the guy in the window seat next to her.\n\nHe was like, 'Excuse me, but I was watching a movie and you just stopped my movie, she recalls. Embarrassed, Feliciano apologized. Oh, I'm sorry, sir, she said.\n\nLaughing at the formality of her apology, he replied: I haven't been knighted by the Queen.\n\nThey started talking.\n\nThe window seat passenger was Sameer Sah, a 38-year-old, Indian-born Londoner who worked for an international charity. He was a frequent BA flier and -- as he jokingly puts it -- basically threw a tantrum at the airport and said, 'No, I want a window seat.'\n\nIt was kind of his fault that Feliciano and her family had ended up sat in different rows.\n\nHe was traveling to Cairo for work, she was traveling for vacation. They spent the rest of the journey in deep discussion.\n\nSah was taken with Feliciano right away: She was pretty, he says. He thought she looked much younger than her 37 years.\n\nAs for Feliciano, she wasn't fluent in English at the time, so not all his jokes landed, but she knew she enjoyed his company.\n\nWhen the flight started to descend over Cairo, Sah hedged his bets. He asked Feliciano if she'd like to get dinner together during her week in Egypt.\n\nFeliciano hesitated, she was keen, but this wasn't how she'd envisaged this vacation going.\n\nShe was recently divorced, and, in a strange coincidence, she'd actually met her first husband on an airplane, on an internal flight in Brazil.\n\nWhat were the chances of another romance beginning in the air, and would this one work out?\n\nSerendipitous meeting\n\nMafalda Feliciano and Sameer Sah in Cairo, Egypt, right after they met in 2004. Courtesy Mafalda Feliciano and Sameer Sah\n\nRight before Feliciano set out for her Egypt vacation, a friend had offered to do a tarot card reading.\n\nFeliciano didn't believe in fate, or divination, but she indulged her friend anyway.\n\nShe recalls her friend shuffling the cards and then looking at her, knowingly.\n\nShe said, 'The cards are telling me you're going to meet someone on this trip.'\n\nFeliciano just laughed in response. I'm not going to meet anyone, she insisted.\n\nNow here she was, making an unexpected connection on a flight before she'd even touched down in Cairo.\n\nFeliciano agreed to dinner with Sah, but requested that her sister and brother-in-law accompany them.\n\nShe hastily explained the situation to her family when they were reunited at Cairo Airport.\n\nThey were like, 'You just met him on the flight, but he's coming for dinner?' They were a bit shocked.\n\nBut the evening was a success. We had a very good time, all of us together, says Feliciano.\n\nThe couple, pictured right, with Feliciano's sister and brother-in-law in Cairo, Egypt in 2004. Courtesy Mafalda Feliciano and Sameer Sah\n\nThe group ended up spending most evenings together. Sah would work during the day and Feliciano spent her time touring the city's sites with her family.\n\nThen, in the evening, the couple met for dinner -- at first with Feliciano's sister and brother-in-law in tow, then later, on their own. They also did some sightseeing altogether, including to the pyramids of Giza.\n\nThe connection didn't fizzle out when the week ended. Feliciano and her family moved on to the next leg of their vacation in Istanbul, but she continued to chat to Sah on the phone most nights.\n\nBefore long, he visited her in Brazil and they decided to begin a long-distance relationship.\n\nRelated content They met on an airplane and fell in love across continents\n\nGlobe-trotting romance\n\nThe couple embarked on a long-distance romance, meeting across the world. Here they are in Marrakesh, Morocco. Courtesy Mafalda Feliciano and Sameer Sah\n\nFeliciano says her friends were astonished -- a few joked they should start flying more.\n\nBut her friend who'd read the tarot cards just said she'd told her so.\n\nOver the next couple of years, Feliciano and Sah met every three months or so for two-week vacations. They reunited in London, Brazil, Brussels, the Netherlands, New York, and the Dominican Republic. Both love to travel and say exploring the world with one another was an unforgettable experience.\n\nMafalda Feliciano I think it was meant to be. Me, a person from South America, meets a person from India, flying over Europe, going to Africa.\n\nBut as the two-year-anniversary of their fateful airplane meeting rolled round, the couple had reached a deadlock.\n\nEither we split up or we get married.\n\nAs fun and as glamorous as it was to travel together, it was hard being apart from one another in-between.\n\nPlus, it was expensive, Sah says he was racking up credit card debt.\n\nThe couple decided to go all in -- they'd get married, and Feliciano would move to London.\n\nTheir wedding celebrations took place in Brazil. A night to remember, lasting until the early hours of the morning.\n\nA big party, a lot of drinking, laughs Sah.\n\nMaking it work\n\nFeliciano and Sah settled in London after two years of meeting on vacation, including on a train to Casablanca, Morocco, pictured here. Courtesy Mafalda Feliciano and Sameer Sah\n\nAfter the exhilaration of the wedding and the whirlwind romance of the last few years, the reality of their decision sunk in.\n\nSome of Feliciano's friends had told her relocating for love was a mistake -- she was leaving an established job in Brazil.\n\nMy boss said, 'I'm sure you're going to be back after a month, your job is here,' says Feliciano.\n\nSah's friends were excited for him, but the situation with his family was difficult. He was also divorced, with two children, and his parents and siblings refused to recognize Feliciano as his wife.\n\nWithin two months of arriving London, Feliciano got a job at a hospital, but it was a lower rung on the ladder than she was used to.\n\nShe's since risen the ranks and is now Head of Brachytherapy Physics at Colchester General Hospital, southeast of London, where she treats cancer patients.\n\nThe couple also had to adapt to living together full time.\n\nThere were a lot of problems in the beginning, says Feliciano.\n\nIt took us, I think, a year, to calm down. It was two different people, two different cultures -- completely different as well -- living under the same roof.\n\nSah was frustrated that he had to do all the cooking, and Feliciano wasn't a fan of Sah's dishes.\n\nPlus, Feliciano was dealing with the stresses of living in a new country and attending language classes.\n\nA recent photo of Feliciano and Sah with their dog, Ziggy. Courtesy Mafalda Feliciano and Sameer Sah\n\nRelated content He flew to Paris to surprise his girlfriend. She flew to Edinburgh to surprise him\n\nBut after a year of being at odds, the couple sat down and talked candidly about their relationship and its future.\n\nWe reached a point when we thought it wouldn't work out at all, says Sah. But then we sat down, spoke, then made an effort -- both of us -- and turned our lives around. And here we are after 16 years.\n\nNow the two live happily in the historic town of Colchester, in the southeast of England with their dog, a cocker spaniel called Ziggy who Feliciano calls their beautiful boy.\n\nFeliciano, who used to be suspicious of serendipity, now thinks their meeting was fate.\n\nI think it was meant to be, she says. Me, a person from South America, meets a person from India, flying over Europe, going to Africa.\n\n2018 study from British bank HSBC suggested that 1 in 50 airplane passengers meet the love of their life on board an aircraft.\n\nBut right now, with flying curtailed and social distancing and mask-wearing the norm, it seems very unlikely two strangers on a plane would strike up a conversation and make a connection.\n\nIt's been a surreal year for Sah and Feliciano. She's continued to work in the hospital during the Covid-19 pandemic, treating cancer patients with radiotherapy and trying to stay safe.\n\nMeanwhile, the tuberculosis charity Sah had been working with for the last few years folded last year, and he's now working as a freelance consultant.\n\nSah says 2020 was also the year he hoped to make it to 100 countries, he's currently stuck on 95.\n\nBut they've been there for each other throughout the stresses of the pandemic, just as they have throughout their marriage.
Trump administration regulatory czar Neomi Rao (C) reacts after US President Donald Trump announced his intent to nominate her to fill Brett Kavanaugh's former seat on the D.C. Circuit Federal Court of Appeals during the Diwali ceremonial lighting of the Diya at the White House in Washington, DC, on November 13, 2018.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nNeomi Rao, President Donald Trump's choice to take the DC Circuit seat vacated by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, has a history of controversial writings, including authoring articles attributing some blame to women for being raped under the influence of alcohol.\n\nThe findings from the progressive advocacy group Alliance for Justice came as Rao's nomination continues to await further consideration in the Senate, several months removed from Kavanaugh's successful but fraught confirmation to the Supreme Court, a controversy largely defined by allegations of sexual misconduct against women. Kavanaugh denied the claims.\n\nThe group's findings came from articles she wrote in the 1990s at a handful of outlets at Yale University and the Washington Times just before and after her college graduation. The topics include writings raising questions about alcohol and sexual consent along with other comments on gender and race.\n\nUnless someone made her drinks undetectably strong or forced them down her throat, a woman, like a man, decides when and how much to drink. And if she drinks to the point where she can no longer choose, well, getting to that point was part of her choice, read a 1994 article titled Shades of Gray.\n\nThe same article said, A man who rapes a drunk girl should be prosecuted. At the same time, a good way to avoid a potential date rape is to stay reasonably sober.\n\nA 1993 article titled The Feminist Dilemma said, Women believe falsely that they should be able to go anywhere with anyone.\n\nAlthough I am certainly not arguing that date rape victims ask for it, when playing the modern dating game women have to understand and accept the consequences of their sexuality, the article read. Some feminists chant that women should be free to wear short skirts or bright lipstick, but true sexual signals lie beyond these blatant signs.\n\nIn another article titled How the diversity game is played, Rao lambasted multiculturalists.\n\nUnderneath their touchy-feely talk of tolerance, they seek to undermine American culture, the article read. They argue that culture, society and politics have been defined – and presumably defiled – by white, male heterosexuals hostile to their way of life. For example, homosexuals want to redefine marriage and parenthood; feminists in women's studies programs want to replace so-called male rationality with more sensitive responses common to womyn. It may be kinder and gentler, but can you build a bridge with it?\n\nThe White House and Justice Department did not return requests for comment from CNN.\n\nBuzzFeed News was first to report on the Alliance for Justice's findings, and noted that similar language on race within the article review was part of Trump's unsuccessful nomination of Ryan Bounds to the 9th Circuit. BuzzFeed also noted that in a 1994 article, Rao referred to gay rights as a trendy political movement. In its report on Rao's writings, Mother Jones noted that in 1992, she dismissed the greenhouse effect, depletion of the ozone layer and acid rain as the three major environmental boogeymen.\n\nIn a statement to BuzzFeed, Kurri Kupec, a spokeswoman for the Department of Justice, defended Rao.\n\nNeomi Rao is a renowned constitutional and administrative law expert. That is why the President nominated her to the D.C. Circuit. The views she expressed a quarter century ago as a college student writing for her student newspaper were intentionally provocative, designed to raise questions and push back against liberal elitism that dominated her campus at the time, Kupec said to BuzzFeed. More than two decades later, her views can be found in her numerous academic articles and speeches. We are confident Ms. Rao will make an exemplary judge on the D.C Circuit.\n\nNan Aron, president of the Alliance for Justice, told CNN that she thought Rao's views were completely disqualifying for a lifetime appointment to such a key judicial post and that the views expressed in their review demonstrate a real hostility to the very individuals and groups that would appear before her on the court.\n\nRao joined the Trump administration as administrator of the Office of Information of Regulatory Affairs within the White House Office of Management and Budget, and with the change in Congress at the start of the new year, it is up to Trump whether to send her nomination back to the Senate.

(Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nRihanna claims her father and his business partner fraudulently used her name to make money and she's suing them over it.\n\nThe singer alleges that her father, Ronald Fenty, and his partner, Moses Perkins, falsely represented their company's affiliation with her.\n\nAlthough Mr. Fenty is Rihanna's father, he does not have, and never has had, authority to act on Rihanna's behalf, nor has he ever been authorized to use her name, intellectual property or publicity rights, the suit obtained by CNN reads. Similarly, neither Mr. Perkins nor the Company has any affiliation whatsoever with Rihanna.\n\nThe pair launched Fenty Entertainment, a production and talent company, in 2017.\n\nRihanna's popular Fenty Beauty line of cosmetics also launched in 2017. She has a lingerie product line as well.\n\nThe suit states that Fenty and Perkins have repeatedly been asked to stop misrepresenting themselves and to cease and desist all activity and efforts to exploit Rihanna's name and the goodwill associated with the Fenty brand.\n\nThe pair unsuccessfully attempted to register the Fenty name for a line of resort hotels, according to the suit.\n\nRihanna also alleges that Fenty and Perkins negotiated an unauthorized deal for her to perform 15 shows in Latin America for $15 million, and two 15-minute sets at Calibash at Staples Center and T-Mobile Arena for $400,000.\n\nThe singer is seeking to stop the pair from using her name or the Fenty brand, as well as damages and attorney's fees.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Rihanna talked about her complicated relationship with her father, who, she said, had a tumultuous marriage with her mother.\n\nHe taught me everything, Rihanna told Winfrey. As awful as he was to my mom at times, it didn't compare to how great he was as a father.\n\nCNN has reached out to Rihanna, Fenty and Perkins for comment.
(CNN) —\n\nA woman found guilty of taking her 17-year-old daughter to Pakistan for a forced marriage was sentenced Wednesday to four-and-a-half years in prison by a British court following a landmark conviction.\n\nThe teenage girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was taken to Pakistan by her mother under the guise of a holiday, but later found herself being forced to marry a relative almost twice her age.\n\nThe mother, who has three other children, was convicted on Tuesday at Birmingham Crown Court on charges of deceiving the victim into traveling to Pakistan in order to enter into a false marriage, forced marriage and perjury.\n\nIt was the first time a conviction has been secured after a victim testified against her own family. Legislation against forced marriage was introduced in the UK in 2014, but has led to only one previous successful prosecution.\n\nNearly 1,200 possible forced marriages were flagged up to British authorities last year. According to a UK government report, the statistics do not reflect the full scale of the abuse.\n\nPregnant at 13\n\nThe court heard that the girl had been entered into a marriage contract with the man years before in Pakistan and became pregnant to him at age 13. The victim had an abortion on returning to the UK, with her doctor reporting his concerns to social services.\n\nThe girl's 45-year-old mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons to protect the identity of the victim, tricked her daughter into returning to Pakistan shortly before her 18th birthday.\n\nFigures published last year by the United Nations' International Labour Organization (ILO) showed 15.4 million people across the world were trapped in a forced marriage in 2016.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, the UN Human Rights Council adopted resolutions calling for an end to child, early and forced marriage, and recognizing child marriage as a violation of human rights.\n\n'Culturally embedded'\n\nProminent Pakistani activist and writer Bina Shah said the problem of forced marriage was culturally embedded in Pakistan, with marriage seen as transactional and girls often considered as commodities.\n\nIt is a major problem in Pakistan. We have the problem of child marriage but also coerced marriages, which, given that most marriages in Pakistan are arranged, is widespread, she said.\n\nThe marriages are often made between relations, particularly in rural areas, to keep property in the family, she added.\n\nPeople are looking for other advantages, for example, to marry someone with a foreign passport, she told CNN.\n\nShah pointed to a case of an Italian girl of Pakistani origin who was rescued from the prospect of a forced marriage last week after she had been lured to the country by her family on false pretenses.\n\nViolence against women and girls – including rape, murder through so-called honor killings, acid attacks, domestic violence, and forced marriage – remained routine, said a Human Rights Watch report on Pakistan published last year.\n\nRepatriation\n\nThe Birmingham court heard that the victim had been returned from Pakistan to the UK with the assistance of the Home Office.\n\nThe Forced Marriage Unit, a joint team from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home Office, was set up in the UK in 2005. It provided support to about 1,200 potential cases in 2017, a government spokesman said.\n\nSince being introduced in 2008, more than 1,500 forced-marriage protection orders have also been issued, preventing people from being forced to wed and assisting in repatriating victims.\n\nIn the past decade, British diplomats, working in tandem with the unit, have rescued scores of women from forced marriages in Pakistan.\n\nWe dealt with 59 cases in Pakistan last year, 10 male victims and 49 female, a spokesman for the British High Commission in Pakistan told CNN.\n\nLast year, British diplomats assisted with 16 repatriations, through rescues or protection orders, he added.\n\nThe rescues are sometimes sensitive snatch operations, with diplomats secretly making contact with women living in forced marriages and then swooping on their houses to make rapid getaways with the victims in armored cars.\n\nCNN's Nada Bashir contributed to this report.

(CNN) —\n\nThe appointment of a polarizing Hindu religious leader as the next chief minister of an Indian state with almost 40 million Muslims has raised concerns about the country's direction under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\nAfter BJP swept Uttar Pradesh elections in a landslide last week, taking 75% of available seats, Yogi Adityanath became head of the state's government.\n\nAdityanath is known for his provocative rhetoric against Muslims, including once vowing in a speech about inter-faith marriage that If the Muslims take away a Hindu girl, we will take away 100 Muslim girls.\n\nUttar Pradesh is India's most populous state with 204 million people – nearly a fifth of which are Muslim.\n\nAdityanath, 44, is head priest of a Hindu temple in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh's northeast, and five-time member of parliament for the district.\n\nWhile he is popular with many Hindus, his appointment caught many by surprise, said Shekhar Gupta, a veteran political journalist and former editor of the Indian Express newspaper who currently hosts Walk the Talk, a political interview talk show on NDTV24x7.\n\nThere was a great degree of polarization in this election, Gupta said. The Hindu vote is divided on the basis of caste, and the challenge (for BJP) was to try and use faith to reunite what caste has divided.\n\nBJP has defended Adityanath's appointment, with BJP minister and spokesman Venkaiah Naidu saying in a statement that the new chief minister is a strong politician and committed to (helping) the downtrodden.\n\nUnity and development\n\nSince coming to power in 2014, Modi and the BJP have focused on fiscal growth and development.\n\nIn the run-up to its record-breaking win in Uttar Pradesh this month, the BJP campaigned on a promise of sabka saath, sabka vikas, which loosely translates to unity together, development together.\n\nBut for some, Modi's backing of Adityanath raises the specter of Hindutva, an ideology which considers India a Hindu nation. The Indian constitution established the country as a secular republic.\n\nThe BJP campaigned on several issues and 'development' was only one of them, said Firat Unlu, lead India analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).\n\nThe choice of Adityanath makes sense as it will help solidify the BJP's gains among the Hindu population and the Hindutva plank was arguably more important than the 'development' agenda in UP.\n\nMultiple BJP figures have said Muslim support for the party was key to their victory in the state. However, concerns have been raised over how willing Adityanath's government will be to reach out to Muslim residents. In recent years, there have been numerous religious and communal clashes in the state. According to an investigation by the Hindustan Times, of the 11,000 incidents of communal violence in Uttar Pradesh since 2012, around 23% were sparked by religious intolerance.\n\nPhotos: Uttar Pradesh: 100 million Indians to cast vote in pivotal elections PHOTO: MONEY SHARMA/AFP/AFP/Getty Images A supporter of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) attends an election rally for leader Mayawati in February, 2017.

Prev Next\n\nVeerappa Moily, a senior figure in the opposition Congress party, called Adityanath's appointment a big assault against secularism.\n\nIndia is not Hinduism. Hinduism is not India, he told the Press Trust of India news agency.\n\nIn a statement, Congress said it accepted it was the right of the ruling part to appoint the chief minister but vowed to act as (a) watchdog of people's interests.\n\nGupta, the political commentator, said if I was a Muslim in UP today, I'd be feeling very unwanted. He accused the BJP of discounting non-Hindu supporters and choosing a divisive candidate.\n\nWe thought that (Modi), who had insisted that this was a vote for development and for equality, would have come up with a more modern leader than Yogi Adityanath, Gupta said.\n\nRepresentatives for the BJP and Adityanath did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOutspoken\n\nAdityanath has staunch views on the slaughter of cows, an animal considered sacred by Hindus. He also has a history of controversial statements having reportedly told those who oppose yoga to leave the country or drown themselves, and, according to media reports, claiming at a religious rally in 2016 that Mother Teresa was part of a conspiracy to Christianize India.\n\nHe also once compared Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan to Hafiz Saeed, the alleged planner of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, according to the Press Trust of India.\n\nIn January, he praised US President Donald Trump's travel ban barring citizens of several Muslim-majority countries and called for India to take similar measures, according to NDTV.\n\nOn Monday, Amnesty International India called on Adityanath to retract his previous statements.\n\nAdityanath has been one of Uttar Pradesh's most polarizing politicians, given to hateful rhetoric that incites discrimination and hostility against minority groups, particularly Muslims, said executive director Aakar Patel.\n\nHe (Adityanath) and his party have an obligation to ensure that his positions do not become government policy. It is therefore imperative that he retracts any statements which may provide a license for others to abuse human rights.\n\nA calculated risk\n\nModi congratulated Adityanath on Twitter, writing that he had immense confidence the new team will leave no stone unturned in developing Uttar Pradesh (UP).\n\nOur sole mission and motive is development, Modi said on Twitter. When UP develops, India develops. We want to serve UP's youth and create opportunities for them.\n\nI have immense confidence that this new team will leave no stone unturned in making UP Uttam Pradesh. There will be record development. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) March 19, 2017\n\nFollowing his swearing-in on Sunday, Adityanath said his government will work for all sections of society without any discrimination.\n\nHis appointment was a calculated risk that will polarize voters but could pay off electorally, said EIU's Unlu.\n\nHaving raised expectations for economic development so high the BJP needs to advance on its 'development' platform, he said.\n\nA stronger coordination between the central and UP governments could drive economic growth while Adityanath ensures that the base remains happy.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated for clarity.
Return to Transcripts main page\n\nCNN LIVE EVENT/SPECIAL\n\nLifting the Veil\n\nAired April 23, 2009 - 23:00 ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\nANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: Good evening again and welcome to a 360 Special Presentation.\n\n\n\nRight now America's vital ally in the war against al Qaeda is on the brink, nuclear-armed Pakistan, where tonight Taliban fighters have pushed within striking distance of the capital, Islamabad.\n\n\n\nThey're bringing their harsh brand of Islamic justice, beheadings, beatings, brutality against anyone who dares defy them especially against women, some who simply want to show their faces in public.\n\n\n\nWe know what's in store for Pakistan because that is precisely what happened and continues to happen in parts of Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nSo here now is Afghanistan in 2007, LIFTING THE VEIL, Afghan women speaking out. First though a warning: Some of what you're about to see is very rough stuff.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nSHARMEEN OBAID-CHINOY, JOURNALIST, DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER (voice- over): Afghanistan, 2001, the true horror of Taliban rule revealed in the shocking CNN documentary BENEATH THE VEIL. Massacres in the countryside, streets filled with beggars, starving children, women forced to wear burqas, denied work or education, even paraded in front of a jeering crowd and executed in public.\n\n\n\nThen 9/11, U.S. and coalition forces invaded, pulling the Taliban from power for harboring al Qaeda. The country and its women were liberated, or so we thought. Now we've come back six years later to ask, if life for women in Afghanistan is really any better.\n\n\n\nGEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The American flag flies again over our Embassy in Kabul. The mothers and daughters of Afghanistan were captives in their own homes. Today women are free.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: After the U.S. invasion, President Bush sounded so confident. But as a Muslim journalist, I want to find out if life has changed for women in this newly Democratic state. Are girls back in school? Are women working? Do they have freedom to live and to dress as they please?\n\n\n\nI'm Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, and I'm traveling right across the country to find out. In early 2001, we found a country under Taliban rule decimated by war, poverty and violence. The streets were full of women like this one, unable to work, forced to beg for change with only animal feed to serve her children.\n\n\n\nToday despite the invasion and promises of aid, things don't look much better. Most of the beggars I see in Kabul are women. There are more than one million widows in Afghanistan, the legacy of 20 years of conflict and poverty.\n\n\n\nYears of isolation by the Taliban have left many women unskilled and unable to work. Widows without male relatives to help them are often forced to beg. I noticed one particular woman by the side of the road. She's clearly in distress and crying into her blue burqa.\n\n\n\n(on camera): What is your name?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Bebe Kul\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: How many hours a day do you sit outside begging?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I sit here every day, from morning until evening.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: It turns out that Bebe Kul is also a war widow.\n\n\n\nIt must be extremely difficult for her to be sitting out here. She's surrounded by men all the time. And she says men hurl abuses at her when they walk past her, and this is extremely degrading for her to do.\n\n\n\nAlready I can see what she means because the men around her are laughing at her.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: These men are bastards. You bastards, may your fathers be cursed.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY (voice-over): Because Bebe Kul feels uneasy talking here, she invites us back to her home; a slum dwelling on the very edge of Kabul.\n\n\n\n(on camera): I'm immediately struck by how poor this place is. There are children running around barefoot, piles of garbage, and the building seems to have been hit heavy by years of shelling.\n\n\n\nHow long have you been living here?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Three years.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: Can I see your face? What you look like? She is Bebe Kul is 40. She tells us she was widowed by an American bomb in 2001 and now lives in a single room with her two daughters, 14-year- old Beba and 16-year-old Sima.\n\n\n\nBEBE KUL (translated): I was at home, by my husband wasn't there. It was at 3 o'clock in the afternoon when the American bomb was dropped.\n\n\n\nMy son and husband died. The both died on the same day. After my husband and son died, life became worse for me. I was young before my husband died.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: I ask if her girls are getting an education.\n\n\n\nBEBA (translated): We would like to study, but we don't have the money to buy notebooks, pens or pencils.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: These girls have had a very difficult upbringing. They have hopes and dreams. They want to go to school. They want to be able to work when they grow up. But they don't have any money and barely enough to make ends meet and have no money to buy notebooks. And it's very difficult for them to see their mother go out and beg.\n\n\n\nThey say that nothing has changed for them. They hoped that the government would help them, but their life seems to have been exactly the way it was before.\n\n\n\nTo understand how harsh the streets of Kabul are for women, my translator and I follow Bebe Kul as she goes begging that afternoon. I keep my microphone turned on.\n\n\n\nOh, it feels really strange to be under this. Actually, I'm tripping all over myself because it's very difficult to walk in this.\n\n\n\n(voice-over): In today's Afghanistan wearing the burqa is no longer required by law. Most are forced beneath the veil by men and their families or communities.\n\n\n\nFor the Afghan woman, there is little difference.\n\n\n\nI can't imagine having to do this every day in and day out for years and years and years. And to have no hope for what the future would hold.\n\n\n\nThis group of young boys were just sitting in front of us, making fun of us that we are begging. They asked if we really needed the money and then very deliberately gave it to us.\n\n\n\nThe men here look at us with disdain. I feel angry and invisible under the burqa.\n\n\n\nFor the West, this veil has been a symbol of women's oppression here.\n\n\n\n(on camera): But, you know, let's face it. The issue of the burqa is just the tip of the iceberg. Afghan women face far graver issues than whether to wear the burqa or not.\n\n\n\nI leave Bebe Kul where I found her, a lone blue figure crouching in the mud; her future and the future of thousands like her uncertain.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: When we return, desperation leads to the unimaginable. (END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY (on camera): I'm going to catch a bus from Kabul right across the country to the western end of Afghanistan. I'm trying to see if life here has gotten any better since the invasion. There are some signs of progress; new roads and power, six times the number of students in schools, even a feeling of peace in some places, like Iraq.\n\n\n\nHere, there's a sense of normalcy. You know, people are walking around, going about their daily business. Women are out in the markets. It is very easy, I think, to forget that this country is still at war.\n\n\n\n(voice-over): But under the surface, some shocking stories start to emerge. In 2001, women's behavior was strictly controlled in public by the Taliban; within the family, by men. Today we find there are still problems.\n\n\n\nMore and more women are burning themselves to death to escape the horrors of Afghan family life.\n\n\n\nThe doctor Mormadi says there have been double the number of cases in the last two years. I ask him how the women burn themselves.\n\n\n\nDR. MORMADI (translated): Afghanistan is a poor country, so kerosene is widely available. The women take it and burn themselves. Most of the women who burn themselves intend to die.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: He tells me that few seek or find the help they need.\n\n\n\nMORMADI: Some women do tell the police and the criminal investigators what happened. But then, there are women who are afraid to say anything. I had two women who were near death and just before they died, they told me what happened and why they did it.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY (on camera): Even when women do report their problems, there is little evidence that the police follow up. I'm going to sit down so I can have a conversation with her.\n\n\n\nWhat kind of a married life did you have?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My husband is a good man. He was not the problem, I was happy with him.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY (voice-over): This woman tells me about her life at home. She finds it painful to talk and can only say a few words at a time. But I slowly piece her story together. She says her brother- in-law beat her after a series of family quarrels.\n\n\n\nAs a protest, she poured kerosene over herself and set it alight. Much of her body has third-degree burns. She is six months pregnant. This woman is just 20 years old. She has burned herself so badly out of despair the doctors do not expect her to live. I asked what happened.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My mother-in-law would hit me because she didn't like me. She would curse at me, hit me and verbally abuse me when my husband wasn't home. For several nights she kicked me out of the house.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY (on camera): Why did you decide to burn yourself?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I had no other choice. No matter how much I would protest I couldn't stop the beating. Why are you beating me? I didn't do anything. She was a bad woman. NO one would help me, no one could say anything.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY (voice-over): What strikes me is the sense of powerlessness in Afghan women's lives. They live hidden away, often under unbearable conditions.\n\n\n\nI think these women wanted to make a point. They didn't want to die quietly but in a way that let others know they suffered in life; a reflection of deep-seated issues in Afghan society that need to be addressed.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY (on camera): Next\n\n\n\nHow old were you when your father sold you?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was 7.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: Young girls sold into marriage.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nERICA HILL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Erica Hill. INSIDE THE VEIL continues in a moment.\n\n\n\nBut first, this 360 Bulletin.\n\n\n\nAt least 80 people killed in two suicide bombings in Iraq making this the deadliest day of the year. One attack targeting people who were getting food in central Baghdad, the other happened at a restaurant northeast of the capital.\n\n\n\nA newly released Central Intelligence report shows in 2002 then National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice endorsed water-boarding as an interrogation technique. The Secretary of State, Colin Powell, wasn't told it was being used on terror suspects until a year later.\n\n\n\nGM workers are getting extended summer vacations they don't want. The automaker will temporarily close 13 of its 20 North American plants over the next few months to cut inventory due to sagging sales. And Michelle Obama, celebrating Take Your Child to Work Day at the White House today with more than 100 children. During a Q&A session, she was asked about the first dog.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, the dog. Oh, he is a crazy dog. You know, he loves to chew on people's feet. I'll tell you a story about Bo last night.\n\n\n\nIt was, like, 10:00 at night. Everybody was asleep. And we hear all this barking and jumping around. And the president and I came out. We thought somebody was out there. And it was just Bo. He was playing with his ball. And it was like there was another person in the house. He's kind of crazy. But he's still a puppy, so he likes to play a lot.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nHILL: Those are your headlines. I'm Erica Hill.\n\n\n\nINSIDE THE VEIL continues after this.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY (voice-over): Six years after the Taliban were removed from power; I'm in Afghanistan investigating whether the lives of women have improved.\n\n\n\nWhen we came here in 2001, we found a society oppressive to women, where they lacked freedom, opportunity or education. Today, Afghanistan is freed from the control of the Taliban and trying to move towards a brighter future.\n\n\n\nBut still, very young girls are being sold into marriage. I'm on my way to meet a child bride who lives with her family at the edge of Herat where the desert begins.\n\n\n\n(on camera): What is your name?\n\n\n\nSHAHNAZ, CHILD BRIDE (translated): Shahnaz.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: Shahnaz, how old are you?\n\n\n\nSHAHNAZ: 14.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: Shahnaz, tell me about your father.\n\n\n\nSHAHNAZ: (translated) My father? My father was a drug addict. He had many gambling debts. And so he sold me.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: How old were you when your father sold you?\n\n\n\nSHAHNAZ (translated): I was seven. OBAID-CHINOY: How did you feel when your father told you that you had been sold?\n\n\n\nSHAHNAZ (translated): I felt depressed when I found out.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: It's difficult for us to speak to Shahnaz because her mother-in-law and her husband keep coming into the room. And although I have permission to speak to Shahnaz, her husband seems nervous because as it turns out, she had burned herself to protest their marriage.\n\n\n\nTell me why you decided to burn yourself.\n\n\n\nSHAHNAZ (translated): Because of the people saying, Look at all her father did, look at how her mother married, look at how they married you off. Because of this kind of talk, I thought I should just burn myself so I could just die and not hear this anymore.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: How old were you when you decided to burn yourself?\n\n\n\nSHAHNAZ (translated): When I was 11 years old.\n\n\n\nI still have fresh scars and I have had two operations.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: Would you like to go to school?\n\n\n\nSHAHNAZ (translated): Yes, yes.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: What would you have liked to have done had you not been sold into marriage?\n\n\n\nSHAHNAZ (translated): I was too young to wonder about what I would do with my future.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY (voice-over): Shahnaz's story is a familiar one across Afghanistan. Though the legal age of marriage is now 16, it is still common and customary to sell girls into marriage as their families struggle with the devastation caused by two decades of conflict.\n\n\n\nOften these child brides are little more than servants at home and virtual prisoners in marriage. Divorce is nearly impossible for a woman here and would make her a total outcast.\n\n\n\nAnd it's not just poor women who are struggling in Afghanistan. Women who are educated and outspoken run the risk of great harm as well.\n\n\n\n(on camera): A young poet from this city recently published her first book in spite of the fact that her family thought it brought shame upon them. She wrote, I am caged in this corner, full of melancholy and sorrow. My wings are closed, and I cannot fly. I must wail because I'm an Afghan woman.\n\n\n\n(voice-over): Her name was Nadia Anjuman. Nadia was a local heroine. She defied the ban placed on women's education by the Taliban and secretly studied literature with a group of friends.\n\n\n\nNadia's poetry had brought her celebrity, and her death shocked the liberal city of Herat. Thousands of people attended her funeral. She left behind a 6-month-old son.\n\n\n\n(on camera): I have managed to locate Nadia Anjuman, the poet's family, and I'm going to try and see if I can sit down and speak to her mother about what really happened to her.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (translated): My innocent daughter.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: How old was she in this photograph?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She was 25.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: Nadia's mother is still very upset and would not talk long. But she did tell me something quite shocking. Nadia was murdered.\n\n\n\nNadia's brother Shappy tells us more. Who do you blame for Nadia's death?\n\n\n\nSHAPPY ANJUMAN, NADIA ANJUMAN'S BROTHER: Of course her husband. The husband.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: He wanted to control her?\n\n\n\nANJUMAN: Yes, of course. Nadia was a successful woman, a popular woman, a good poet, and he was feeling jealous.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: You think her husband couldn't handle her success as a poet, and he was jealous?\n\n\n\nANJUMAN: Yes, of course. He talked to Nadia several times, Why you are popular and I am not? Why people know you and they don't know me? I am the husband. I am a man.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: Although Nadia's husband was arrested and charged for the murder of his wife, the case did not go to trial. Under local law, the victim's family can pardon the accused.\n\n\n\nANJUMAN: Because of our culture, and our religion, we forgave. But we did not want him to be released two months after being forgiveness. It was clear. We consulted with the lawyers, with the prosecutors. We asked them, if we forgive him, what will be happen? They said, at least he will be in prison for five years. And we thought, five years is enough. That's good.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: I've managed to locate Nadia, the poet's, husband. His name is Fareed. He works at the Central Herat University Library. I believe he's never given an interview.\n\n\n\nI'm going in to try and convince him to speak to us to tell us his side of the story.\n\n\n\nFAREED (translated): I'm happy to do the interview, but I'm also not happy because it is not a good subject.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: Initially, Fareed doesn't seem keen to talk to us. My translator also seems nervous. A U.S. State Department report says that he admitted beating Nadia but claims to have stopped before she died.\n\n\n\nWhat was the fight about? Did you not beat her that night?\n\n\n\nFAREED: No, no, not at all.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: Fareed claims that Nadia died after taking poison.\n\n\n\nSo she did have a bruise on her face which you cannot explain how it got there. Why would a successful young poet commit suicide? You claim she was happily married. Why would she commit suicide?\n\n\n\nFAREED: Look, I told you Nadia did not want to kill herself. My dear, how can I make you understand? She was trying to put pressure on people to love her more. It's just something women here do.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: Fareed denied everything to us. He spent less than five months in prison.\n\n\n\nComing up -- this seems like the new Afghanistan. Young girls are laughing and joking and playing without their burqas on. At least within the four walls of this school, there seems to be a new hope.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY (voice-over): In 2001, a secret women's political group Kalrava (ph) captured the shocking video of a woman executed in front of a jeering crowd. Later that year, coalition forces ousted the Taliban, and shattered al Qaeda. They promised Afghan women a better life.\n\n\n\nMore than six years later, I am meeting with a member of Rava (ph) in secret to find out if those promises have been fulfilled.\n\n\n\nWhy does the current administration oppose Rava and the fact that women should be allowed to voice their opinions, that women should be active on the political front?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (translated): Well, because the current government is full of the fundamentalists who cannot tolerate women as even part of the society.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: But Afghanistan's constitution says now that men and women are equal.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, the constitution is nothing to these fundamentalists. The chief justice of this country who was just three months ago was a tolerant (ph) kind of man -- clearly said that this constitution, it has no value for us.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: So what you're saying is that Afghanistan may have a constitution but no one is following it? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Exactly.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY (voice-over): Most Afghans live outside of the city. I wonder how life is now in the villages and if the aid and relief promised by the international community is reaching them.\n\n\n\n(on camera): I've left Herat and I'm traveling towards the northeast of Afghanistan to the small town of Talakan (ph).\n\n\n\n(voice-over): Talakan is a small quiet town now, a far cry from 2001 when it was at the center of some of the fiercest fighting between the allies and the Taliban. It's a place that's desperately trying to rebuild itself.\n\n\n\nOne of the first things I hear when I arrive is the sound that was silenced under the Taliban; the playful noise of girls running around, having fun in a school playground.\n\n\n\n(on camera): There's a real sense of freedom within the four walls of this school.\n\n\n\nYou know, young girls are laughing and joking, gossiping, running around and playing without their burqas on. This seems like the new Afghanistan, you know, the kind of -- at least within the four walls of this school, there seems to be a new hope.\n\n\n\n(voice-over): I talked to the headmistress who held secret classes for girls at great risk when the Taliban were in power.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (translated): I wanted to look after the girl's future. I knew the Taliban were not going to stay in power forever. Death would have been preferable to not studying at all. And many of the students that I taught are not in grades 10, 11 and 12.\n\n\n\nSecond floor. My problem, you can see.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: No money?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No money.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY (voice-over): This school is a perfect example of Afghanistan's progress and pain over the last six years. There are 4,000 girls now able to study here, but there isn't enough space to teach them. And I'm told that getting aid money to build more classrooms has proven nearly impossible. And the girls are still battling resistance at home.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE STUDENT (translated): My father does not encourage me to study. In fact, I have a book in my hand, my father says, What is this that you are studying? Then he does not let us study. I never study at home. I go to my grandmother's house or somewhere else. I never study around my father.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: Only two of five Afghan girls attend school and seeking an education remains dangerous. The humanitarian organization Human Rights Watch reports a sharp increase in attacks against students, teachers and schools across Afghanistan in the last two years, particularly if they teach girls.\n\n\n\nThe tyranny of extremists has oppressed women here, but I learned it's not just religious fanatics who think this way. Even the most educated Afghan males are deeply conservative, like this group of young teachers I meet in the park.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because they are my friend I never accept that they all should see my wife.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY (on camera): Oh. They're your friends but you would never allow them to see your wife?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: One hundred percent.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: One hundred percent.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Even a picture.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: Even a picture you won't want them to see?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Even her own picture.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: So you want to keep her locked away.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: Under lock and key?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lock and key, password.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: Password. Lock, key and password?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: There must be something in the water here because the testosterone levels here are very high. They think that if they saw a woman walking down the street wearing what I'm wearing which by no means is tight would be tempting for them. They'd follow the woman, they'd say something to her. So to avoid that, women should just wear burqas.\n\n\n\n(voice-over): As a Muslim woman I know attitudes like these are not inherent in our culture; that there are places around the world where we can walk around freely. I find it oppressive here.\n\n\n\nSix years ago, we met these four little girls in CNN's BENEATH THE VEIL.

Now, I'm off to see if the health care has gotten any better.\n\n\n\nEarly in 2001 we used a hidden camera to film this footage of a maternity hospital. Dark, filthy, few doctors, little medicine. Today, some of the hospitals look better. But I'm shocked to learn that the health of mothers and the newborn children remains dismal.\n\n\n\nThese doctors are in charge of the maternity ward.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (translated): It's mostly mother-in-laws and husbands involved in making family decisions. And if they do not permit the mother to come to hospital, then she cannot come. OBAID-CHINOY (on camera): Doctor Nila (ph), what kind of condition are the women in when they arrive for their delivery in the hospital?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (translated): Normally they arrive with major complications. Sometimes they have a ruptured uterus. If they are lucky they have a car. If not, they are tied to a ladder and carried here.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY (voice-over): I asked the doctors if the men realize that their wives are in grave danger.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (translated): Some know, but most don't have a clue.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (translated): When the men bring the women in, the doctor tells them that if they had brought them in earlier, there would not have been a problem.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: It amazes me that a woman doesn't even have control over her own body. Since the invasion six years ago, there's been little improvement. UNICEF reports that 50 pregnant women die each day. And that one in four children will die before their fifth birthday.\n\n\n\nI am traveling to the village of Mumayi (ph) in the far north of the country. The journey is extremely perilous. Others have been murdered on this road. Afghanistan today is more dangerous than it's been since the invasion.\n\n\n\nIn 2001, the Taliban were fighting in the area. We came here then to see what life was like on the front lines. And what we found was shocking.\n\n\n\nStories of kidnapping, execution, and in Mumayi, the haunting sorrow of these four little girls.\n\n\n\nThe Taliban had taken their father prisoner, shot their mother, and stayed with them in the house, alone, for two days.\n\n\n\nNow, six years later, I want to find out what happened to them.\n\n\n\nWe find their village is still very poor. This is the same house where the four little girls watched the Taliban murder their mother. I find their father, Mohammed Amin (ph), nearby. He's a land owner and a village elder.\n\n\n\nTwo of his daughters still live with him. Ruksana (ph) was just a toddler when the Taliban came, she's eight now, and goes to school. An opportunity her sisters did not have.\n\n\n\nMumayi's brand new secondary school was built with Western aid. Mohammed says Ruksana is doing very well.\n\n\n\nMOHAMMED AMIN, VILLAGE ELDER (translated): She's a very good student. She's not top of the class, but I'd say she was second. I always encourage her and try to help her. She likes going to school.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: I ask about her future.\n\n\n\nAMIN (translated): I am hoping she will finish her education. There is no rush to get her married. If she can study to be a doctor or engineer, I will let her carry on.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: And he tells me about life in the village.\n\n\n\nAMIN (translated): They are trying to build a clinic now but there is no proper doctor. Also we have no piped water. All of our water comes from the river. We lack all kinds of basic things.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: Mohammed's older daughters have married and moved away from Mumayi. I wonder if they're happy. Then, something Mohammed says makes me think the next generation may have a better chance than they did.\n\n\n\nAMIN (translated): I really want my granddaughters to go to school.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: Mohammed's daughters grew up in a bleak, violent time. Now there's at least a chance that their little sister and their own children will have a peaceful life and a brighter future.\n\n\n\nNext, hope for Afghanistan's next generation.\n\n\n\n(on camera): Nusotiya (ph) wants to get an education, she wants to go to school and college before she says she can even think of getting married.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY (voice-over): I'm heading way up into Afghanistan's northern mountains, into one of the most remote parts of the country. This was territory held by the Taliban. Small villages ruled by repressive clerics.\n\n\n\n(on camera): I'm going to the village of Takitanuz (ph). This area was heavily mined by the Mujahideen in the 1990s. When the Taliban came to power they had a base right above this village. It is a very remote area and outsiders hardly ever venture here.\n\n\n\n(voice-over): First, some good news. There's a school here for the children.\n\n\n\n(on camera): It's heartening to see that in this tiny village young boys and girls are studying together. Their lesson today is about Afghanistan, how wonderful their country is, how plentiful the fruits and vegetables are and how they should respect their country.\n\n\n\nA few of the students in this class are deaf so the teacher is using sign language to teach them.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think about marriage?\n\n\n\nNusotiya (ph) wants to get an education, she wants to go to school and college before she says she can even think of getting married.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you married?\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: Am I married? Yes. I'm married.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (translated)\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: No, my husband didn't come with me.\n\n\n\n(voice-over): Nostrat (ph) wants to show me her home. As the little girls pull me along, I'm expecting their parents to come out and stop us filming. But then a surprise; there are no parents.\n\n\n\n(on camera): These young girls were left orphaned, both their parents died because they didn't have access to good health care and they had life-threatening diseases. And after speaking to them, it's heartening to know that, despite them not having parents, they are very eager to study, to be educated, and they all have hopes and dreams of becoming teachers and of working in the village when they grow up.\n\n\n\n(voice-over): The head of the village is also the local cleric.\n\n\n\n(on camera): Kari Sab (ph), can you tell me what the poverty is like in your village?\n\n\n\nKARI SAB, VILLAGE HEAD (translated): It's like this, 40 percent of the people in the village have just enough to eat. But the other 60 percent are even poorer and do not have enough.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY: What hopes do you have for your village in the future?\n\n\n\nSAB (translated): You can see with your own eyes that the situation in this village is worse than ever. The villagers hope that reconstruction will come and that it will bring economic benefits. At the moment there is no health center here. But we have a lot of hope.\n\n\n\nOBAID-CHINOY (voice-over): People here are resilient. They have been through a lot, but they want to move forward if they're given the chance.\n\n\n\nI've traveled across this vast country and I have found joy and hope in places I least expected it. But I've also learned that progress is slow, Afghanistan's problems were not fixed by the invasion.\n\n\n\nThe country still struggles, after decades of war and loss. The culture remains oppressive to many and billions of dollars of promised aid have failed to arrive or to reach those most in need.\n\n\n\nHanging in the balance -- the future of Afghanistan and the lives of its people; people desperate for peace and for hope.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)
Txotx, bellows the cider master. His notice-slash-command is acknowledged by the cider house guests, who begin to fall in line behind him. They follow the cider master—txotxero—to one of the dozens of massive chestnut barrels holding thousands of liters of sidra (cider).\n\nThe txotxero uses a hybrid tool, a snub-nosed pair of pliers with a mini-hammer head, to remove the golf-tee-like stopper of the barril. The cider shoots out of a hole no bigger than a few millimeters into a guest's glass, which is held almost perpendicular to the stream of cider in order to break and oxygenate the liquid. More than a dozen people wait in line. Each person takes only what they are going to drink at one time—about as much as a sizeable gulp. You can go back and txotx as many times as you like, but filling your glass is seen as disrespectful. The custom is to take a small amount so the cider stays fresh.\n\nBasque sidra has little in common with English or American cider apart from being made from apples. The Basque cider crush takes place in October, when truckloads of apples are moved by water canal from the truck to the crusher. Their mosto, or juice, is extracted and piped into vats to ferment with proprietary yeast strains. The cider is ready within two months.\n\nGood sidra will have a hazy, bright, yellowish-green color with the body of a light Hefeweizen beer. Aromas can range from fresh apples to funky ferment, or bright and citric to barnyard haze. Every cider house's brew tastes different, and even each barrel has its own character. Sidra is fresh and ever-evolving; its low alcohol—around 5 percent ABV—and crisp juice quality means that it doesn't age well, and should be consumed when it is fresh. Cider reaches its optimal age in the waning weeks of April when it has had time to rest in the barrel but hasn't been bottled.\n\nThe most authentic Basque sidrerias are open from mid-January through the end of April—only during the cold months. Most have no seating and the guests join in an ebb and flow of the txotx, eating family-style at large tables. The menu is the same at every cider house, and typically each is known for at least one of its dishes. The ubiquitous menu includes: pintxo of chorizo cooked in cider, tortilla de bacalao (cod omelet), bacalao alla sidreria (fried cod with caramelized peppers and onions), txuleta (dry-aged rib steak), followed by cheese, quince paste, and crack-your-own walnuts for dessert.\n\nGuests sharing food at Zapiain.\n\nNo guest receives their own plate; each chooses food off the platter it is served on. It's communal, fun, familial, and unique to the Basque region. During sidreria season, cider houses are often dominated by locals, evidenced by the majority of guests speaking Basque, not Spanish. A tourist may fear they won't be welcomed, but this couldn't be further from the truth. The willingness to share and teach the tradition of the cider house to foreigners is ever apparent. Basques take pride in knowing that guests from afar have come to their slice of the world for this experience.\n\nHere is a list of three great sidrerias renowned for both cider and food.\n\nZapiain\n\nOne of the best is Zapiain, located on the edge of Astigarraga, a tiny town located less than 10 minutes south of San Sebastián and the capital of Basque sidra country. The sidra is made by a passionate young man named Egoitz Zapiain who labors extensively to create a consistent, interesting flavor. While it's a large operation relative to other cider houses, it is still family-owned and operated. The guys who deliver cider during the day man the grill at night. The patriarch of the cider house runs a cider empire but oversees service every night. The sons who handle the commercial side of the business run food and bus tables.\n\nAll of the food at Zapiain is excellent, but the most special dish is the tortilla de bacalao. Theirs is loosely scrambled with gobs of caramelized onions, extra virgin olive oil, parsley, and cayenne pepper. This is the tortilla that all other tortillas wish they could be. It's a simple and perfect marriage of flavor, from the sweet sinewy onions to the mild heat of cayenne. It is quite possibly the best tortilla in Spain.\n\nRufino Going to Rufino feels like being let in on a secret. Their production of cider is extremely low compared with other cider houses, so their bottled goods are a rare find. This scarcity makes going to Rufino that much more rewarding. And not only is their cider some of the best in the region, but their food delivers on every level. Some sidrerias excel in one or two dishes of the traditional menu, every one of Rufino's dishes is flavorful at the highest level, from their tortilla to the bacalao a la sidreria and txuleta. Rufino\n\nLocation: Akarregi Ind., 7, 20120 Hernani, Gipuzkoa\n\nContact: (+34) 943 55 27 39\n\nZelaia\n\nDown the road in Hernani is Zelaia, another family-owned sidreria. As soon as you enter the restaurant, run by three sisters, you will understand what their house specialty is. Through a window, you can watch the grill man (asador) making steaks for more than a hundred people. There are shelves full of beef waiting to be seared on the glowing coals. Just like a steak shouldn't be over-wrought or over-thought, nor should an explanation of it. It's just a dry-aged, perfectly seared steak, served rare with a judicious amount of flaked sea salt.
(CNN) As the clocks struck midnight on Tuesday, dozens of same-sex couples tied the knot in Australia, marking the first legal ceremonies of their kind in the country.\n\nAlthough Australia passed a law l egalizing same-sex marriage last month, Tuesday was the first day such couples could legally marry without applying for a special exception.\n\nThe law was passed in Australia's Parliament after a national postal survey found that a majority of people supported marriage equality in December.\n\nAustralia is the 26th country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage, according to Pew Research . The measure was widely lauded as a victory for worldwide LGBTI+ groups -- a term that refers collectively to people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or intersex or other sexual minorities.\n\nHere's how some of the country's newest newlyweds celebrated on Tuesday.\n\nAmong the first to wed were athletes Craig Burns (R) and Luke Sullivan, whose ceremony took place just after midnight at an estate in New South Wales on Tuesday.\n\nThe two runners quickly organized the wedding in the month since the law was passed, CNN affiliate Seven Network reported. All Australian couples must provide a full month's notice of their intention to get married.\n\nIn the port city of Perth in Western Australia, Gillian Brady (L) and Lisa Goldsmith signed their marriage certificate at a ceremony at the Court Hotel.\n\nIn Sydney, local bakeries prepared commemorative cakes for the Sydney Festival's event in Hyde Park. In celebration of the historic event, festival organizers threw a public rainbow wedding reception in the park's Meriton Festival Village complete with music, cake, champagne and pink swimming pools.\n\nWives Rebecca Hickson (L) and Sarah Turnbull exchanged in a ceremony in Newcastle, New South Wales.\n\nIn Melbourne, activists Antony McManus (R) and Ron Van Houwelingen were married at the David Williamson Theater, where they met 30 years earlier as students.\n\nTheir wedding cake was topped with a symbol of their love.\n\nI suppose it's been a wedding planned for 30 years but we've had really a month to get things together, Ron Van Houwelingen, 50, told CNN's Australian affiliate Seven Network.\n\nIt's been quite hectic trying to organise that in such a short amount of time, he said.\n\nMost countries that have opted for marriage equality are in Europe and the Americas. In 2001, the Netherlands was the first nation to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nIreland was the first country to legalize the measure through popular vote in 2013, and in 2015 the United States Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples could marry nationwide.
Story highlights Jenipher Mukite's mother revealed on her deathbed that she had HIV The whole family tested positive and Jenipher felt pressure to marry early\n\n(CNN) —\n\nIn 2013, Jenipher Mukite's whole life changed in an instant.\n\nIt was her mother's answer to a question both she and her siblings had feared asking that altered her present, past and future in one sweep.\n\nWhile their mother was bedridden, unable to move or eat yet refusing to go to the hospital to seek medical help, they finally mustered the courage to ask.\n\nDo you have HIV?\n\nYes.\n\nWorse still for them, she had been living with the virus since before Jenipher, then 18, and her brother and sister, then 14 and 10, were born – and had not been on treatment.\n\nHer mother confessed that the drugs had been too big and difficult for her to consume.\n\nMy mother had kept it a secret, Mukite said through an interpreter. Soon, their whole village in the Bugiri district of Eastern Uganda gossiped about their mother and the fact that her whole family must also be infected.\n\nShe said it was a challenging time.\n\nPHOTO: Mariam Nassaka/CYSRA Jenipher Mukite, a teenager living with HIV at a community project for adolescents in Uganda.\n\nWhen a pregnant woman is HIV-positive and not taking antiretroviral drugs, she has a 15% to 45% chance of passing the virus on to her baby, according to the World Health Organization. With treatment throughout pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding, this risk falls below 5%.\n\nMost countries, including Uganda, readily offer HIV testing when women come in for pregnancy checkups and offer treatment on-site for those found to be infected. But this was not the case when Mukite was born.\n\nAfter disclosing her HIV status, Mukite's mother was kicked out of their home by their father, but with nowhere to go and no one to care for her, returned home and died a few weeks later.\n\nAll three children and their father soon found out that they too were HIV-positive.\n\nWith the death of her mother, Mukite's main confidante and carer, everything changed.\n\nShe said she wanted to commit suicide. She knew she had no one who would take care of her anymore.\n\nPunishment without a crime\n\nTheir father saw no benefit in caring for girls with HIV, according to Mukite.\n\nMukite was soon shipped off to his mother's home, where she lasted just over a year facing hatred and abuse, largely aimed toward her deceased mother and the fact she had kept the virus a secret. Mukite says she was not given fees to go to school and not provided with the same meals as others.\n\nHer younger sister had stayed home but soon ran away to stay with an aunt, she said.\n\nTheir brother remained home, Mukite saw when she returned there over a year later. She also found that her father had remarried.\n\nShe had a new mom, or at least she had hoped so, but Mukite explained that the change came with no maternal care. Instead, the lack of education and food continued, and she was required to do most of the housework.\n\nIn late 2016, her father began arguing that it was time for Mukite to get married. In fact, it was possibly too late, as in his eyes, the 21-year-old was old, she said.\n\nHe feared that she would never get married and bear children, according to Mukite.\n\nThis is so common, especially with adolescent girls living with HIV, said Allen Kyendikuwa, program lead for the Uganda Youth Coalition on Adolescent Sexual Reproductive Health and HIV. Many girls are told to drop out of school and go get married.\n\nMukite turned to a project within this organization for advice.\n\nPeople say you are old at 20 and need to have a child, Kyendikuwa added, especially when you are HIV-positive.\n\nKyendikuwa further highlighted that grooms' families are often required to give money when their sons get married, but she more strongly believes it's a matter of passing over responsibility.\n\nWhen you get married, you are no longer under (your family's) care, Kyendikuwa said. It happens a lot.\n\nInternational AIDS Society President Linda-Gail Bekker adds that there is much more marriage (in general) in East and Central Africa compared with southern Africa. Being in a relationship could reduce stigma in some way, by being seen to be in a stable relationship.\n\nRather than giving in to this pressure, Mukite sought the help of a local social worker, who put her in touch with a pastor whom she now lives with. She is studying hairdressing at the New Life Skills Center in Bulesa village in her home district of Bugiri and has been on antiretroviral treatment since she learned of her infection.\n\nShe wants a husband and child but first wants to finish her studies.\n\nWe need a generation that is more independent and educated, Kyendikuwa said. In 2015, African youth accounted for 19% of the total global population in that age group. If you want to make a change, this is the generation you should target.\n\nPHOTO: Peter Caton for International HIV/AIDS Alliance Naguru Teenage Information and Health Centre, where outreach programs provide HIV Testing and condom distribution and inform the community on benefits of knowing your status.\n\nDisproportionate rates in young women and girls\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, young women ages 15 to 24 are at more than twice the risk of having HIV than males the same age, according to a recent study.\n\nGlobally, 65% of HIV infections among 10- to 24-year-olds are in females; in sub-Saharan Africa, this number goes up to 75%. Every day, 1,000 adolescent girls and young women are infected in this region, according to the US President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief.\n\nThe epidemic puts young women and girls at a particular disadvantage, Bekker said. Girls are at risk earlier … but you can't ignore men.\n\nThere are many routes of infection, with heterosexual transmission being the primary mode in sub-Saharan Africa, according to Bekker.\n\nThat's true for young women in Uganda for a variety of social reasons, including exposure to sex with older men at a younger age, Bekker said. But Infection from mother to child also remains a risk.\n\nAn estimated 6% of women receiving prenatal care in Uganda are infected with HIV, according to the Strengthening Uganda's Systems for Treating AIDS Nationally project. Through programs to prevent transmission to children, UNAIDS data show that transmission rates to children had fallen to 2.9% in 2015 – down from 29% in 2009.\n\nPHOTO: Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images Lilian, 12, an HIV-positive orphan, at the Aidchild Orphanage in Mpigi, Uganda.\n\nBekker believes the priority to end HIV in young women and girls is to prevent new infections: by targeting both girls and men.\n\nThis continent has a very patriarchal approach, she said. Efforts need to be made to understand men and the gender norms and to impact males in society, she said.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nWhen it comes to young women, they need self-initiated protection through education and awareness but also products, such as contraceptive vaginal rings that also release antiretroviral drugs.\n\nThe International HIV/AIDS Alliance is now tapping into women's willingness to speak out using social media and giving them a platform with a focus on HIV. Its project, #ReadytoDecide, aims to highlight links between gender inequality and HIV.\n\nIt's an opportune time, alliance Executive Director Christine Stegling said. Gender-based violence is a societal norm and needs to be addressed.\n\nStegling also believes that after decades of focusing on finding and treating people with HIV, there needs to be focus on prevention.

(CNN) An increasing number of people around the world are opting to go solo.\n\nThe number of American men and women who have never been married, are divorced or are living alone has been on an upward trend for several years, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\nDespite the fact marriages or relationships are less common these days , being single continues to have stigma and feelings of loneliness attached, no more so than on Valentine's Day. Feelings of loneliness among singles not yet having found the one still abound.\n\nHowever, recent research shows that some people view singlehood as a happy destination rather than a stop on the journey to marriage.\n\nif you're single, you can redefine the concept for yourself, according to Elyakim Kislev, an assistant professor at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem: You don't have to be lonely, and you're not a failure. Being single can be an advantage instead of a source of agony, he believes.\n\nKislev analyzed US and European databases and conducted interviews to examine trends in singlehood and what made some singles happy — finding that for some, happiness was a choice lifestyle or something they came to accept.\n\nThe fact is that many societies see tremendous growth in the single population and we need to change this image we have that being single means you are frustrated, less worthy or abandoned, said Kislev, author of the research presented in his book  Happy Singlehood: The Rising Acceptance and Celebration of Solo Living .\n\nSinglehood and living alone are also on the rise in many countries including Japan Italy and Sweden , various studies have shown. There are ways to turn feelings of loneliness into the ability to feel empowerment and joy at any stage of your life, including during the pandemic.\n\nIdentifying the root of loneliness\n\nIf you're going to try to pull yourself out of feeling lonely, identifying the cause of that loneliness is important, according to Kislev. There are differences between chronic loneliness, social isolation and feelings of loneliness.\n\n(health problems such as insomnia and heart disease), psychological distress and behavioral problems, said Dr. Indra Cidambi, the medical director of the Center for Network Therapy in New Jersey. Chronic loneliness is defined as loneliness or social isolation that occurs over a long period of time and affects your mental and physical health , according to the American Psychological Association . It can increase the risk of developing(health problems such as insomnia and heart disease), psychological distress and behavioral problems, said Dr. Indra Cidambi, the medical director of the Center for Network Therapy in New Jersey.\n\nFeelings of, or temporary, loneliness are based on subjective, self-perceived feelings of neglect or a discrepancy between one's achieved and desired levels of social relations, according to experts.\n\nBeing alone does not make a person lonely, but the perception of being alone is what makes one lonely, Cidambi said.\n\nMarried people can be just as lonely and unhappy as their single counterparts, previous research has found.\n\nIt was proven time and again that married people can be very lonely and emotionally deprived within their wedlock, sometimes exactly because they are committed to this one person and gave up on nurturing other connections, Kislev said. Instead of facing loneliness at its roots, many people chase partnership only to discover that loneliness is a standalone problem, the cure for which mainly lies within oneself, as researchers have repeatedly argued.\n\nWhat makes some singles happy\n\nThe databases Kislev used included the US Census Bureau and the European Social Survey. He examined relationship trends in more than 30 countries and conducted more than 140 interviews with single people in the US and Europe — people between ages 30 and 78 who comprised all genders, sexualities and socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds.\n\nHe found key differences between happy singles and unhappy singles, generally dependent upon whether they internalized stereotypes about being single or shrugged them off.\n\nPeople who were unhappy with being single felt resigned due to reasons including having never found the right person, feeling they might grow old alone or as if they were missing out on life. In contrast, the happy singles enjoyed their solitude, took responsibility for their lives and were satisfied with their social ties as a substitute for marriage, Kislev wrote.\n\nSome happy singles' solitude was also fortified by procuring exciting experiences that can be had outside of a relationship, such as traveling or finding new hobbies. They used their time alone to replenish themselves and be empowered by focusing on themselves in these moments, Kislev said.\n\nOthers Kislev interviewed were happy because they intentionally built robust social circles as alternatives to intimate romantic relationships. They invited their friends to accompany them on outings more and spent more time talking to their neighbors and staying in touch with family.\n\nWidowed, divorced and never-married individuals socialized with their friends up to 45% more frequently than their married counterparts, the research found.\n\nOn average, singles have more friends than married people, Kislev said. We see a phenomenon of 'greedy marriage,' in which couples turn inwards and forget their friends and relatives. Instead, singles cast a wide net of friends that better support them in all walks of life.\n\nSome single people did this because, at one point, they were lonely, while others chose this life because they valued the additional time and freedom that resulted from not being attached to a partner or family.\n\nThe research also found that in the case of never-married individuals, being more social gave them the confidence to feel that they did not 'miss out.' \n\nDeveloping quality relationships with people who share similar interests, staying in touch with family and friends and pursuing enjoyable activities are key to alleviating loneliness, Cidambi said.\n\nBuilding self-esteem\n\nSome studies have shown that people in relationships can have higher levels of self-esteem, but that may only happen if the relationship is well-functioning, stable and at least lasting for a year or longer — otherwise, that self-esteem has been shown to tank, a 2017 study found.\n\nSome may want to be in a relationship, but are unable to find the groove, Cidambi said. This can lead to a loss of self-esteem and feelings of loneliness or even depression.\n\nSome single people in Kislev's study also found satisfaction in working toward their career goals.\n\nFulfilling one's potential and feeling more content with one's alone time, yet also spending time with friends, helped to raise the self-esteem of those who were either once unhappy being single or who had chosen the solo life for themselves. They realized the opportunity for personal growth that was tied to the time they had alone, the study found.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBeing single doesn't have to feel desolate. During and after the pandemic, singlehood can provide many opportunities to find what you love, make new friends and discover new places — although doing so virtually is safest for now.\n\nSingles must invest in their singleness, Kislev said. It might sound funny, but we must invest in any way of living we choose for ourselves. Exactly like couples invest in their marriage — they go to counselors, read books and have quality time with their partners — singles must do the same in order for them to feel good.

During a meeting Francis answered questions from children and one of them, Emanuele, was too shy to speak at the microphone so the pontiff decided to invite him onto stage. The child started crying and hugged Francis and whispered his question into the pope's ears, saying he was afraid that his father, who was an atheist, could not go to heaven. Francis comforted Emanuele and said that it is God who decides who goes to heaven and that, since God has a 'dad's heart', he will not abandon the boy's dad, even if he was not a believer. The leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics visited the parish of St. Paul of the Cross in Rome's Corviale neighbourhood and met with children of the poor district of the Italian capital and celebrated Mass for the parish community.\n\nGay man: Pope told me 'God made you like that'\n\nMALMO, SWEDEN - OCTOBER 31: Pope Francis gives a speech during the 'Together in Hope' event at Malmo Arena on October 31, 2016 in Malmo, Sweden.

(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)\n\nStory highlights He's shining a light in this darkness, and that's a wonderful thing, a divorced Catholic says of Pope Francis Francis urges priests to be more accepting of divorced Catholics Pope is trying to influence pastoral behavior without changing doctrine, he says\n\n(CNN) —\n\nPope Francis' call for mercy toward divorced Catholics arrived as a breath of fresh air, Vince Frese says.\n\nAs a conservative Catholic, he's endured it all: married, divorced, secured an annulment and remarried.\n\nFor so long, the Catholic Church offered nothing to its divorced faithful such as Frese, who became a single parent after winning custody of his three daughters. Divorced parishioners felt excommunicated by the church, which has long disdained divorce. Many just went to another Christian denomination, but not Frese.\n\nThey don't feel welcomed and they don't feel understood and they're hurting and they need help, Frese said.\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy Vince Frese Vince Frese appeared on his Twitter account beside wife Monica on their way to attend a retreat for divorced Catholics for the Diocese of Toledo.\n\nBut the Pope on Friday spotlighted this underserved flock by issuing a sweeping statement instructing priests to be more welcoming to divorced Catholics.\n\nThe declaration promises a new era for Frese, 55, a software firm owner who lives with his family outside Atlanta. He and wife Monica, who also went through a divorce with children and an annulment, now have seven children together.\n\nHe's shining a light in this darkness, and that's a wonderful thing, Frese said. The Pope is saying we need to help these people, and that's why ultimately I think it's going to help.\n\nDon't 'pigeonhole' those who divorce\n\nThe Pope calls on pastors not to pigeonhole divorced Catholics but to use their own judgment about how to integrate them into the church.\n\nDivorced Catholics, which Francis described as living in an irregular situation, must be integrated into the church.\n\nThe divorced who have entered a new union should be made to feel part of the Church, the Pope wrote. Christian communities must not abandon divorced parents who have entered a new union.\n\nFrancis added: It can no longer simply be said that all those living in any 'irregular situation' are living in a state of mortal sin.\n\nThe Pope also urged individual parishes to interpret doctrine in accordance with their community's culture.\n\n'Everybody has a shot here'\n\nUnder church teaching, remarried Catholics without an annulment of the prior marriage are considered adulterers and cannot receive Holy Communion.\n\nThe Rev. Edward Beck, a CNN religion commentator, interpreted Francis's new statement as providing a way to allow divorced and remarried Catholics to receive Holy Communion. Francis has already moved to make it easier to get an annulment.\n\nWhat he's saying is if you are divorced and you have remarried and haven't been able to get an annulment for some reason, that maybe for you, you can enter into this process, and communion can be possible, Beck said.\n\nBut the parishioners must speak with their pastor about the matter, Beck said.\n\nIt is saying everybody has a shot here, but not everybody reaches it perfectly all at once, Beck said of the Pope's pronouncement.\n\nThe Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and writer, called the Pope's paper a groundbreaking new document.\n\nBut Candida Moss, a theology professor at the University of Notre Dame, said there were no bombshells in the Pope's statement, which she described as toothless, even if it is pastorally sensitive, she wrote for CNN Opinion.\n\nSome Catholics took exception with the Pope.\n\nWe can't make changes. It's not like it's a democratic thing, where Jesus gives us a vote, Phil Adargo, a Denver Catholic attending Mass on Friday evening, told CNN affiliate KMGH. It's been the same for 2,000 years.\n\nFrancis's statement is called an apostolic exhortation, in which a pope urges Catholics to behave in a particular way. Friday's statement is called On Love in the Family in English and Amoris Laetitia in Latin.\n\nAccording to Georgetown University's Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, of 30 million married Catholics in the United States, 4.5 million are divorced and remarried without an annulment.\n\n'Let God work out the details'\n\nFor his part, Frese took the initiative to help divorced Catholics.\n\nHe developed a program to help them heal, now writes a blog at VinceFrese.com, founded a divorced Catholic ministry at his parish, and co-wrote the book Divorced. Catholic. Now What?\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy Vince Frese Vince Frese speaks to divorced Catholics at a retreat held by the Diocese of Toledo.\n\nRight now, on average, less than 15% of parishes have any support for divorced Catholics, Frese said.\n\nThe Pope is seeking to influence pastoral behavior without changing doctrine that he cannot change, Frese said.\n\nWhat he is trying to say is, 'Don't get all focused on the rules, let's be merciful to them and let God work out the details,'  he said.\n\nAbout a quarter of American Catholics have experienced divorce, according to the Pew Research Center, a think tank in Washington. That's slightly lower than the national average of 30% as of last year.\n\nSitting in the back row\n\nOther Catholics also found hope in the Pope's declaration.\n\nAnnette was 31, living more than 6,000 miles from home with three young children, when she decided she had to leave her husband.\n\nI experienced great violence and the doctors asked me how many times they were going to have to patch me up, she recalled Friday, nearly 50 years later.\n\nBack home in Glasgow, Scotland, as a single mother in the late 1960s, she had difficulty supporting herself, getting a mortgage – and going to church. (CNN chose not to use Annette's last name because she says she was a victim of domestic violence.)\n\nAll I did really was confuse the community, she said. It would have been easier for them to accept me as the mother of three illegitimate children than as the divorced mother of three children.\n\nShe doubts the bishops in her day had true understanding of what human relationships were, accusing them of draconian decisions, she said.\n\nToday, she hopes that era is relegated to bygones under Francis's new announcement, she said.\n\nAnnette, now 80, never had her marriage annulled, but she attends church and participates in confession and Holy Communion.\n\nShe doesn't know whether her priest is aware that she's divorced.\n\nI don't care anymore, she said with a laugh.\n\nBut she said she hopes the Pope's statement will help others.\n\nI have been in touch with over 400 divorced Catholics. Many have accepted that the church has nothing more to say to them. Many sit in the back rows of their churches, contritely, for some reason, she said.\n\nNeither option is good enough, she said.\n\nIf someone is looking for … a community of welcome and comfort and understanding, it shouldn't be an exclusive community, she said. None of us are perfect. Even bishops.
(CNN) — There's no arguing: Hanoi is a street food mecca.\n\nBut humble bowls of pho and turmeric-tossed cha ca fish aren't the only culinary draws in the capital of Vietnam\n\nAn influx of international restaurants, combined with a young population hungry for a cosmopolitan lifestyle , has opened the door for a new generation of Vietnamese cuisine.\n\nRestaurants and bars are catapulting traditional recipes into the 21st century -- and at least one famous dish has been reimagined in cocktail form.\n\nAs traditional Vietnamese food goes head-to-head with fashionable foreign fare, it's never been a more exciting time to travel to this culinary wonderland.\n\nFrom pho cocktails to xoi ga (sticky rice with chicken), CNN Travel trawls the capital to find the best of Hanoi's contemporary Vietnamese fare.\n\nMAD Society\n\nNot your average rice crackers. From MAD Society\n\nLocated inside a new mixed-use complex in the ever-expanding Tay Ho (West Lake) District, MAD Society has no qualms about playing with tradition.\n\nVietnamese food is amazing, but wherever you go, it's very similar, founder So Yeon Kim tells CNN Travel.\n\nI thought, let's try to have some fun and combine it with other Asian flavors. It works so well!\n\nTaking its cues from tapas-style dining, there are more than a dozen small dishes which can be mixed and matched to create a meal.\n\nThe tapas idea came from noticing that more young Vietnamese want to pair food with wine or spirits, explains So. Pairing Asian flavors with wine works perfectly, because both wine and many Asian ingredients are fermented.\n\nSo Yeon Kim, Mad Society You can't survive these days unless you adapt.\n\nOne such dish is the edamame dip with shrimp chips -- popular in Vietnam and across Southeast Asia -- with a hummus-like dip made from Japanese edamame beans.\n\nBesides tapas, the menu also includes a few reworked street food classics. For example, pho comes in two styles.\n\nThe first is relatively authentic, served with either beef, chicken or seafood but not without theatrical flair, as the broth is poured from a floral Bat Trang-style ceramic teapot.\n\nEver had a phoritto? From MAD Society\n\nThe second style? Hanoi's first phoritto.\n\nPicture beef, herbs, noodles and, yes, even a splash of broth -- all rolled up in a soft tortilla.\n\nIn a similar vein, MAD Society also serves cha ca-style tacos. The crispy tortilla shells (in lieu of rice noodles) arrive loaded with traditional turmeric-marinated fish and all the tasty herbs and vegetables.\n\nYou can't survive these days unless you adapt, says So. You can keep traditions, they're important -- but you need to have new things.\n\nMAD Society , 4/F, Somerset West Point, 2 Tay Ho, Tay Ho, Hanoi, Vietnam; +84 24 3200 6881\n\nThe T-Art\n\nContemporary digs at The T-Art. From The T-Art\n\nMarred by overpriced tourist traps and kitschy western restaurants, Hanoi's historic Old Quarter doesn't always showcase the best of Vietnamese food.\n\nBut the T-Art -- short for The Taste of Art -- opened in July and has already chiseled out a reputation as the go-to place for modern Vietnamese cuisine.\n\nDeveloped by chef Duong Hai Anh -- who penned a book on modern Vietnamese appetizers while working at the Hanoi Opera House's Nineteen 11 Restaurant & Bar -- the menu focuses on premium ingredients and modern presentations.\n\nI want to bring Vietnamese food more in line with international cuisine, Duong tells CNN Travel.\n\nI love the taste of traditional Vietnamese food, but I want to create and present Vietnamese dishes in a more modern way.\n\nHaving studied under a French chef at cooking school, Hai Anh embraced the art of presentation early in her career -- and it's evident in her dishes.\n\nXoi ga gets a makeover at The T-Art. From The T-Art\n\nTake the xoi ga, for example: Typically eaten out of a polystyrene tray, this local dish is usually a mess of shredded chicken, crispy onions, spices and rice.\n\nBut at The T-Art, the street dish transforms into three tidy balls of rice -- all imbued with a vivid purple color, courtesy of magenta leaves (a native plant used for food dye and medicine).\n\nPresented on an Instagram-friendly slate, each manicured ball is full of marinated chicken, mushrooms and mung beans.\n\nHai Anh has also taken aim at one of the most quintessential Hanoian dishes: cha ca.\n\nIt's usually served in a sizzling pan, where thin slices of turmeric-marinated fish bubble in oil alongside fresh dill and green onions.\n\nIn the traditional style, the fish sits in oil too long, says Duong. I cut the fish thicker, and then marinade it longer. It's then grilled, so it's less oily, and much more tender.\n\nThe T-Art , 46B Bat Dan, Hoan Kiem, Hanoi, Vietnam; +84 24 3875 4646\n\nNê Cocktail Bar\n\nInside Nê Cocktail Bar. From Nê Cocktail Bar\n\nHanoi's restaurants aren't the only ones getting creative.\n\nWhile it might sound like something out of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, you can now enjoy several Vietnamese dishes in the form of artisan cocktails, thanks to master mixologist Pham Tien Tiep.\n\nIn a career which has seen him rise from shining shoes on the street to representing his country at international bartender competitions, Pham is now the proud owner of Nê Cocktail Bar.\n\nNamed after his son -- who is in turn named after Pham's favorite drink (a negroni) -- Nê is a chilled-out space.\n\nPham Tien Tiep, Nê Cocktail Bar I want people to experience my drinks with all their senses.\n\nThere's jazz instead of the usual thumping Vinahouse music, and craft cocktails instead of 50 cent bia hoi (Vietnamese draft beer).\n\nNow emulated in bars across the city, Pham's most famous creation is the pho cocktail.\n\nI worked in a pho restaurant for a year, so I knew how to cook the real dish, Pham tells CNN Travel.\n\nBefore the bartender competition in 2012, I thought: 'Why not try to make a drink with the same flavor as pho?'\n\nTo craft the drink, Pham uses a custom-built apparatus with a three-tiered filter.\n\nHe places star anise, cinnamon and cardamom into the filters, followed by a mix of gin and Cointreau. Then he sets the mixture on fire as it runs through the filters.\n\nThe fire cooks the cocktail, just like cooking the soup, says Pham. Then we add coriander, and serve with chili and lime, so it's like real pho.\n\nI want people to experience my drinks with all their senses.\n\nIntroducing: The pho cocktail. From Nê Cocktail Bar\n\nProving he's more than a one-trick pony, Pham has since created a number of cocktails based on Vietnamese cuisine.\n\nThe Donna Donna cocktail -- inspired by bo luc lac (shaking beef) -- even requires a bit of cooking.\n\nPham first stir-fries beef with capsicum, chili and lemongrass, before de-glazing the pan with rum and sugar. Then the resulting syrup is mixed with lime juice to balance the flavor.\n\nIf you're still standing after a few of those, we'd recommend The Pickles cocktail, which channels traditional Vietnamese sour fish soup.\n\nBefore you know it, you'll have sipped through a three-course Vietnamese dinner.\n\nNê Cocktail Bar , 3B Tong Duy Tan, Hoan Kiem, Hanoi, Vietnam; +84 90 488 6266\n\nDon's Bistro\n\nInside Don's Bistro.

From Don's Bistro\n\nBut at Don's Bistro? The signature Donald Duck Pho a l'Orange comes with two forms of duck: leg and breast.\n\nThe leg is prepared confit-style, while the breast meat comes medium-rare as a nod to the raw beef found in traditional pho.\n\nThick slices of fresh orange add a bittersweet note and double as a colorful centerpiece.\n\nIn another unique twist on Vietnamese classics, Montreal-born Berger has imbued traditional fresh spring rolls with a taste of fresh seafood and trendy avocado from his Canadian homeland.\n\nInstead of the usual herbs, rice noodles, prawns and pork, Berger's spring rolls come packed with crab, avocado and mayonnaise.\n\nPassionfruit crème brûlée. From Don's Bistro\n\nEach roll is topped with colorful Masago, an Icelandic caviar, which not only enhances the fresh, salty flavor but also adds a dash of sophistication.\n\nPresentation is a big part of it, but you can have new flavors too. Berger tells CNN Travel. Sometimes being different is the same as being authentic.\n\nThe creativity trickles down to the dessert menu, where diners will find a passionfruit crème brûlée with tropical Vietnam written all over it.\n\nIt's lighter and more fragrant than a traditional crème brûlée, explains Berger. It's quite similar to che, a local soup-like dessert.\n\nDon's Bistro , 16 Quang An, Tay Ho, Hanoi, Vietnam; +84 24 3719 3719\n\nGreen Tangerine\n\nAl fresco feasts at Green Tangerine. From Green Tangerine\n\nIn the center of Hanoi's crowded Old Quarter, there's a charming little oasis serving up unique Vietnamese fusion dishes: Green Tangerine, set in a spacious French colonial villa that dates back to 1928.\n\nAt this al fresco address, the food is unmistakably French in technique but a strong local influence pervades the flavors and ingredients.\n\nVietnamese flavors and French food are an ideal marriage, operations manager Nguyen Dung tells CNN Travel. I wouldn't call our food traditional -- it's modern fusion, but still retaining an authentic Vietnamese taste.\n\nThe ca qua risotto takes its cues from a Hanoian classic. From Green Tangerine\n\nCa qua, or snakehead fish, is commonly used in Hanoi's cha ca dish (turmeric-marinated fish with dill, scallions and rice noodles).\n\nAt Green Tangerine, the ubiquitous ingredient appears atop a bed of risotto, which has been wrapped in spinach leaves infused with ruou (Vietnamese rice liquor).\n\nThen there's the thit kho to, or Vietnamese caramelized pork -- a nod to the humble dishes you'd find at canteens in schools and workplaces or at com binh dan rice buffets.\n\nThe French mille-feuille pastry gets a new look in Vietnam. From Green Tangerine\n\nBut here, tender pork comes with stewed apples, local herbs, mashed carrot and taro -- layered between crispy lotus seed sheets, inspired by flaky mille-feuille French pastries.\n\nFor chef Stephane Yvin, a former biological engineer, balance is the key.\n\nStephane uses the concept of yin and yang, combining Earth with the sea, explains marketing manager Celia Tran. It's about balancing flavors which work best together.\n\nThe red grouper tartare, in particular, is a colorful demonstration of this philosophy.\n\nYvin pairs raw ocean fish with local tropical fruits and rau tien vua, a leafy vegetable known locally as the king's vegetable.\n\nGreen Tangerine , 48 Hang Be, Hoan Kiem, Hanoi, Vietnam; +84 24 3825 1286\n\nSpices Garden\n\nFancy bun thang at Spices Garden. From Metropole Legend Hanoi Hotel\n\nSet inside the swish Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi hotel, Spices Garden has been serving up upscale street food for more than 20 years.\n\nIn the early days, menus were co-created by French chef and restaurateur Didier Corlou.\n\nToday, the food is overseen by Hanoian chef Nguyen Thanh Van, who was the first Vietnamese woman to become a member of l'Académie Culinaire de France back in 2007.\n\nLike any fine-dining restaurant worth its salt, Spices Garden offers a tasting menu to enable diners to sample the signatures.\n\nOur degustation menu is intended to give guests a taste of all three regions of Vietnam, explains Nguyen.\n\nAbalone soup, from the south; a tasting platter of Hanoian appetizers; and Nha Trang lobster to represent the central region.\n\nA taste of Nha Trang lobster. From Metropole Legend Hanoi Hotel\n\nAs for the a la carte menu, diners can expect gourmet versions of traditional dishes -- that means beautiful plating, high-quality ingredients and excellent service.\n\nBut the most exciting aspect of dining at Spices Garden is the professional sommeliers, who can pair wine with anything from pho to spring rolls.\n\nFor example, the black Angus beef tenderloin on the degustation menu is marinated with lemongrass and local spices -- a combination that calls for a medium- to full-bodied red.\n\nThe dish includes mushroom and chestnuts, which are quite wintery flavors, so I would say a full-bodied red like a Cotes du Rhone, explains restaurant manager Do Hong Long.\n\nChef Nguyen Thanh Van, Spices Garden It can compete with the best French and Japanese food, for sure. Why not?\n\nOther well-known local dishes, such as cha ca, also benefit from a little French wine.\n\nCha ca is the perfect dish to pair with wine -- fish sauce is quite a strong flavor, so a light red, like a pinot noir, would be ideal, says Do.\n\nPairing Vietnamese cuisine with wine is just one of the many ways that Vietnamese food is starting to emerge from its low-budget street-eats niche.\n\nI'm very confident in the reputation and development of our cuisine, says Nguyen. It can compete with the best French and Japanese food, for sure. Why not?
Vendors vanishing to extinction as India hurtles forward\n\nI heard the twangs in November or perhaps early December, after the dampness of the monsoons evaporated and the air carried a hint of winter chill. They were the distinct, almost comical, sounds of the mattress wallahs.\n\nWallah in Hindi means seller or someone in charge of something, and the mattress wallahs were men who roamed the streets strumming a harp-like wooden implement they used for cotton carding.\n\nThe vibration of the bowstring echoed through my neighborhood in Kolkata, and women who ran middle-class households, like my mother, ran out to their balconies to summon the cotton fluffers.\n\nWhen I was growing up, we slept not on plush foam or box springs but on firm mattresses stuffed with cotton that needed renewal every so often. I watched the mattress wallah carry our quilts, pillows and, of course, mattresses, to our rooftop terrace and gut them of their deflated innards. He used his carder to beat and fluff the existing cotton, added more from his personal supply and then hand-stitched everything back together. That first night after a mattress wallah's visit was nothing short of bliss.\n\nBut there are few cotton plumpers left on the streets of my hometown.\n\nGlobalization and growth wrought massive change in a very short time. Old ways are dying fast, especially in India's urban centers.\n\nMillions of Indians now find themselves struggling to make a living in niche occupations they've known all their lives. Among them are the mattress wallahs and people in unusual trades that are unfamiliar in the West. They include street typists, snake charmers, water delivery men, broom makers, sugarcane juicers, ironers, street pastry sellers and knife sharpeners.\n\nThey were once crucial to my family's livelihood but I notice their dwindling numbers every time I visit India.\n\nA few years ago, a man who ironed my aunt's saris told me about the dire situation he faced. He still had his stall on a street corner and heated his heavy iron on hot coals, but he was losing customers by the day. They now had dryers or electric irons at home, bought clothes made from synthetic fabrics that did not need ironing or used automated cleaning services.\n\nThe street ironer worried that soon he would not be able to provide for his family anymore. This was what his grandfather and father had done but his sons would have to enter a different trade. Or they'd be doomed.\n\nI returned to Kolkata last winter thinking about the mattress wallah and the street ironer. Donald Trump promised to bring back jobs to America. But who will advocate on behalf of the men and women in the disappearing trades of India? They are the last of their kind and vanishing fast to extinction.\n\nBasir Baig pedals to turn the stone on his sharpening contraption. These days, his customers are mainly owners of eateries in central Kolkata.\n\nChhuri wallah: The knife sharpener\n\nAt lunchtime in downtown Kolkata, Dacres Lane is better known as tiffin gali or lunch lane. It has been a culinary street since colonial days, when British sailors sought to fill their bellies here.\n\nBasir Baig arrived on this street many years after the Royal Navy left, but he's been sharpening knives for local eateries for the last five decades. He's known as a churi wallah -- churi means knife.\n\nAfter business in private homes declined, restaurant owners became his primary customers. He's 82 now, his scruffy long beard whiter and his skin browner from years under the Indian sun. He remembers a time when Dacres Lane was saner, before restaurants began spilling over onto the asphalt.\n\nAfter finishing eighth grade in 1947, the year of India's independence, Baig called it quits on education and took up his trade. He made less than a dollar a day back then, but that was pretty good money. He sent his four kids to school and even though it took all his savings, he considers their education a measure of his success. These days, eight hours of work yields $5, perhaps $6; given inflation, that's about a fifth of what he made as a young man.\n\nOn this winter day, Baig manages to find a spot across from the Pink Room, whose sign proudly advertises its air-conditioned dining room and attached bar.\n\nA cook from another nearby eatery brings over three dulled knives; one is a menacing meat cleaver. Baig begins pedaling to turn the stone on his sharpening contraption. He bought his first machine for less than 30 cents; now it costs more than $70, he tells me. It takes him three minutes to sharpen a small knife, more for larger blades.\n\nBaig is 82 now and has been sharpening knives since he quit school after the eighth grade.\n\nHis joints hurt from the pedaling, and he's had eye surgery to retain the sharp vision he needs for his profession. But he has no regrets.\n\nMy main priority has been to feed my family, he says. I am poor but I am satisfied with whatever Allah has given me. \n\nIt used to be that the women of the house couldn't chop and dice without the help of their churi wallah.\n\nThey waited for me for days, Baig says. They depended on me.\n\nBut now people buy knives from big stores, and they don't require sharpening, he says. What saddens Baig is that he no longer feels essential to people's lives.\n\nI am afraid I am not needed anymore.\n\nPatties wallah: The patties seller\n\nThe bell at Elite Cinema rings at 4:05 p.m., signaling intermission at the matinee showing of the Bollywood crime thriller Wajah Tum Ho (You are the Reason). Sheikh Saeed wastes no time.\n\nHe rushes with his trunk and stool to the entrance and presses his face against a folding metal gate, like the ones in old elevators. He opens the tired trunk, picks out a vegetable patty, places it in a bag made from newspapers and thrusts his right hand out, eager to lure a hungry moviegoer.\n\nBhaiya! he yells using the Hindi word for brother. They are hot and tasty.\n\nHe has five minutes before people return to the darkness of the theater, one of Kolkata's oldest movie houses.\n\nSheikh Saeed sells vegetable and meat patties from a trunk near Kolkata's New Market. He keeps them warm with hot coals.\n\nBut few are interested in Saeed's treats these days. They bring their own chips or nuts to the theater -- or head to the concession stand. And the crowd at the Elite is smaller. In its heyday the manager posted a sign that read House Full to indicate sold-out shows. Now people flock to shiny new American-style multiplexes. On afternoons like this, the clientele here consists mostly of single men taking a break from the office or the occasional young couple on an illicit afternoon date.\n\nSaeed has little luck today. He and two other vendors sell only five patties. Between them, they earn less than a dollar.\n\nWhen I was young, vendors like Saeed walked the streets selling baked goods.\n\nI was especially fond of a woman who carried a black metal trunk on her head with three trays of pastries inside: The top layer held vanilla, the middle was strawberry and at the bottom was my favorite: chocolate. I watched as she lowered the trunk under a searing Bengal sun and marveled at her strength to carry such a load in the heat. The pastries were pure sugar and fat, and my mother resisted buying too many. But she took a certain amount of pity on the pastry wallah, and my brother and I always each got two -- one for instant gratification and one saved for after dinner.\n\nOn my last visit to Kolkata, I tried in vain to find a pastry wallah. I was told they had faded with the explosion of top-notch bakeries and Starbucks-style coffee houses that sell everything from cookies and cupcakes to vegetable and chicken patties.\n\nNo wonder Saeed is barely in business.\n\nThere was a time when he, too, took his trunk to people's homes and opened it up to the delight of customers. But sales dropped precipitously in the last few years. Saeed guesses he's now competing with 15 to 20 other wallahs of his kind left in Kolkata.\n\nHe sells his patties mostly in central Kolkata -- in front of cinema halls, at the maidan (the city's equivalent of Central Park) and on the congested streets around New Market, a British-era market that was the place to shop when I was growing up.\n\nHe keeps his patties warm with hot coals that line the bottom of the trunk. It's tough to carry the 15-pound trunk on his head, even tougher in Kolkata's endless summers.\n\nHe shows me his tray of neatly lined patties. Veg on one side that sell for 15 rupees (22 cents) and Non-veg on the other for 20 rupees (29 cents). Twenty years ago, he would sell 500 of these on a good day. Now he's lucky to sell 30 in the 10 hours he works everyday.\n\nSaeed and two other patties vendors wait for customers outside the Elite Cinema hall. But few come.\n\nHe has two daughters who completed high school and two younger sons. He tells me he struggles to support them.\n\nI try to make up the deficit by going to festivals and fairs, but I can't rely on that on a daily basis, he says.\n\nSaeed is 45 and has to keep working for the sake of his family.\n\nWhy don't you try to do something else? I ask.\n\nBut this is what I have done since I was a boy, he replies. I don't really know how to do anything else.\n\nBesides, he says, he pays the police 200 rupees every month for his space on the street. Many of Kolkata's vanishing vendors pay small bribes to operate on public sidewalks and streets, Saeed tells me. If he switches turf or begins selling something else, he will probably have to pay more.\n\nSo, he'll stay here, he says. And take his chances.\n\nZari Karigar: The brocade embroiderer\n\nIn the village on the outskirts of Kolkata that Archana Hazra calls home, more than 60% of the people share the same profession. They are zari karigars.\n\nZari is brocaded thread -- usually gold or silver -- used in intricate embroidery to embellish clothing, and karigar means artisan. When I was young, I thought myself special when I received a sari with zari work.\n\nSometimes the zari is married with sequins and beads for more elaborate and delicate designs known as zardosi, which surfaced in popular clothing lines in America after trade with India began to open up in the 1990s. It was the big companies, not the zari workers, who profited from the export boom.\n\nHazra, 28, quit high school for zari work. It was good money then, and she wanted to help her parents out.\n\nArchana Hazra and her mother, Sandhya Sardar, are both brocade embroiderers, but Hazra doubts there will be any work left by the time her infant daughter Papri grows up.\n\nMost people in her village, Panchla, live in modest one-room homes. They have brick walls and tin roofs, if they are lucky. Many make do in mud huts with thatched roofs.\n\nHazra's husband is also an embroiderer -- as are her four sisters and brothers. So was her mother, Sandhya Sardar, until five years ago when her vision diminished. She still had nimble fingers but not the sharp eyes needed for detailed work.\n\nHazra recently developed an eye infection from the kajal, or kohl, she bought for her baby girl. Kajal is believed to have a soothing effect. Superstitious Indians also believe it wards off evil and apply the cosmetic to their baby's forehead and eyes soon after birth.\n\nHazra tested the kajal on herself first to make sure it was not adulterated. Sure enough, her right eye swelled and turned red; the reaction was so severe that she worried she, too, like her mother, would have to abandon embroidery.\n\nIf my eyes go, so does my work, she tells me.\n\nHer eye healed but her profession is ailing.\n\nThe computer, she says, is the end of us.\n\nComputer? I ask.\n\nHazra leads me to a small building five minutes away. It houses an enormous machine, made in China, with giant spools of thread threading needles that work at lightning speed. In contrast, Hazra spends hours hunched over a dhadda, a wooden frame that stretches out the silk, chiffon, georgette or crepe she is adorning.\n\nWhat takes me seven days to do, the computer does in an hour, she says. They do it faster but my work is better.\n\nAutomation has arrived, even in this sphere of traditional work that harkens back centuries to the heavy silk robes and saris of emperors, empresses and courtiers.\n\nZari work will always be there, Hazra says. Just that there is less work for people like me.\n\nShe is one of 600,000 or so other zari workers who live in villages and towns across the river from Kolkata that gained fame for their embroidery.\n\nA lot of zari embroidery has been automated and artisans are being forced to abandon their trade.\n\nBesides automation, the workers themselves have lost clout over the years as middlemen called ostagars stepped into the zari business. They buy the fabric and get the contracts with companies that sell clothing and bags in upscale malls in India and abroad. The wedding trousseau business is particularly big for zardosi work.\n\nBut the middlemen cut out the zari workers from the profits, says Farid Mullah, leader of the local Forward Block political party. The party headquarters proudly flies its red flag emblazoned with a tiger and the communist hammer and sickle.\n\nMullah says zari workers -- many of whom are women or children -- often work 12 to 16 hours hunched over yards of cloth but make shameful wages. Maybe $4 on a good day.\n\nHazra and her husband now struggle to make a decent living. Zari workers like them make less than $2 a day -- hardly enough for the couple and their two young children.\n\nThe middlemen make the money, but the workers are in a dire situation, Mullah says.\n\nSome villagers have tried to find other jobs like operating cycle rickshaws or getting on the assembly line of the factories that have popped up in the area. Hazra landed one such job at a pen factory. She reports to work at 8:30 in the morning and works until 6:30. Her husband set up a small potato stall at the market. They still do zari work -- when they get it -- but their wages have fallen from $85 a month to about $20.\n\nPeople make noise about saving us, Hazra says. But no one ever does. We are a dying breed.\n\nPandit Mahender Pandey Shastri sits on one of Kolkata's main thoroughfares with a pair of parrots that help him tell fortunes.\n\nJyotishee: The fortune-teller\n\nEvery morning at 7, Pandit Mahender Pandey Shastri offers prayers for three hours before making his way to Chowringhee, the Champs-Elysées of Kolkata.\n\nChowringhee was officially renamed after India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, though nobody calls it that. During the day, the wide avenue swells with commuters, shoppers and tourists. Kolkatans know they don't even have to walk; the tide of humanity carries everyone and everything in its path.\n\nAmid the snarl, Shastri, a jyotishee, or fortune-teller, conducts business from a mat on the sidewalk in front of the Indian Museum. Behind him dangle dust-laden branches of a Mahua tree. In front is a small hand-painted sign that announces his presence.\n\nMeet or write for every astrological problem.\n\nOn this day, Shastri, 70, is wearing a saffron dhoti (a garment worn by Hindu men) and a batik scarf hugs his neck. A red mark on his forehead tells the world he has been to the temple to pray. Next to him are his two prized parrots nestled in a small cage painted green to match their feathers. Their names are Radha and Krishna, after Hindu gods, and they are Shastri's assistant fortune-tellers.\n\nFor a mere 30 cents, the birds hop out of their cage on Shashtri's command and pick out one of the 100 cards neatly arranged face down on the mat. Each contains a message not unlike those found in fortune cookies, only longer and far more detailed.\n\nParrot astrology is an ancient tradition in India and people turn to it for help navigating life. Parrot astrologers determine compatibility for prospective brides and grooms. They are consulted when someone in the family falls seriously ill or obtains a good job. And they foretell suitable dates and time of day for big occasions like a marriage ceremony.\n\nShastri's astrological accoutrements include gemstones that represent the planets. Coral, for instance, enhances the positive energy of Mars and should be worn by those in need of confidence. Pearls represent the moon, and if there is a beneficial moon in a customer's horoscope, Shastri recommends wearing one.\n\nShastri also reads palms, When I extend my left hand, he inspects it by looking through a magnifying glass missing its handle. His eyes scan the lines of my hand and he concludes that the last 2½ years have not been easy.\n\nShastri reads the author's palm and says many people just don't believe in astrology anymore.\n\nYou should worship God more to relieve your tensions, he says.\n\nI nod my head and ask Shastri how things are going. He's been an astrologer since 1969 and says people these days have other means of figuring out their lives. They don't need someone like him for advice. Even if they do, they can always go online and look up their horoscopes.\n\nA lot of people don't even believe in all this anymore, he says, giving me the eye.\n\nThey're skeptical of Shastri's unique blend of science, mysticism and skill. They say it's hocus pocus.\n\nThere are too many cynics and too much information around for Shastri to make a profit, he tells me. Good thing one of his sons decided to run a clothing shop; another farms for a living.\n\nHe takes a sip of masala chai from a tiny disposable cup that can barely hold the heat of the tea. Gone are the terra cotta cups that made afternoon tea so much more satisfying.\n\nIt's dark by the time Shastri begins to pack up for the day. The sun sets before 5 in the winter, and the priest makes his way home by 6. It's not worth it for him to sit through the evening rush. Too few customers.\n\nI pay him for reading my palm and extend my good wishes to the priest and his parrot partners.\n\nGood luck, Shastri says. Good luck.\n\nMohammed Golam Rasul uses a harp-like instrument to fluff cotton to restuff mattresses and pillows.\n\nDhunia: The cotton carder\n\nIn a small, dark warehouse near the left bank of the Hooghly River, five men pound piles of cotton with wooden sticks. They heave their arms high in the air and beat the cotton with every ounce of their strength. They can work 5 pounds of cotton within 10 minutes. They are Kolkata's dhunia, or cotton carders.\n\nThe afternoon light catches a flurry of fluffy white particles that swim through the air and land on the heads of the workers, coating their oil-slicked hair. It's an asthma sufferer's hell and within minutes, I begin coughing from the fibers in my throat.\n\nI ask Mohammed Golam Rasul, 60, to step outside. He emerges from the dark looking like he's just been in a pillow fight.\n\nHow can you breathe in there? I ask.\n\nHe tells me many of his colleagues suffer from lung ailments like tuberculosis from breathing the cotton dust.\n\nRasul has been beating cotton like this for the past 36 years. His father, grandfather and great-grandfather did the same. The family has been in the business for 200 years, he says.\n\nBut 20 years from now, they won't be. There's hardly any money to be made these days in this old-fashioned mattress industry. Rasul is lucky to make $3 a day.\n\nRasul once wandered city streets like the mattress wallahs of my youth. Back then, only the wealthy could afford foam and coir mattresses and Rasul kept busy. But at the start of this century, stores filled with soft, cushy bedding, and work slowed for the cotton plumpers.\n\nThe warehouse where Rasul works is in Bandhaghat, a 100-year-old market known for its cotton trade. Its proximity to the river makes it easier to transport bales of cotton.\n\nSubrata Kundu runs a family-owned bedding shop in Bandhaghat and tells me when he started in the business 40 years ago, there were no machines involved in the bedding industry. Not even cotton gins.\n\nThough the market is a sliver of its former self, Kundu says the customers who shop at his store remain faithful to hand-made mattresses. They are cheaper, better for your back and completely sustainable, he says.\n\nInside a dark warehouse on the banks of the Hooghly River, workers use all their strength to plump old cotton.\n\nAs though on cue, a customer arrives with an old quilt to be re-stuffed. Kundu inspects the cotton inside and provides an estimate: 900 rupees ($13) to get the quilt looking new. The customer agrees.\n\nI've been shopping here for 30 years, Tapas Adhikary tells me. All my wedding stuff came from here. There's nothing like these mattresses and quilts.\n\nI leave Kundu's shop with optimism that there are still loyal customers who patronize the mattress wallahs. But, sadly, not enough.\n\nBhisti: The water carrier\n\nRudyard Kipling immortalized the bhisti in his poem Gunga Din, the water carrier who brought nourishment to British officers on the battlefield. But even before that, there were tales of heroic bhistis who carried water in thick leather mashaks, bags made from goat skin, and delivered them to the Mughal emperors of India.\n\nIt was a trade passed down from father to son with an enormous sense of pride. Mohammad Ansur Ali's father was a bhisti. So was his grandfather. Men like him once were a common sight in Kolkata.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nI have to ask around to find Ali and wait for him at a tubewell just off Kolkata's Lindsay Street. He's one of a handful of bhistis left in the city.\n\nAcross the narrow lane, a few men sip tea at a sidewalk stall and watch the 28-year-old as though he were performing street theater. Ali pushes down with the entire weight of his muscular body to fill his 8-gallon mashak and then hoists it over his left shoulder. He doesn't flinch even though it weighs close to 80 pounds.\n\nAli does this 60 to 70 times a day. His first runs are from 5 in the morning to noon. He takes a lunch break and then is back on the job from 3 until 7.\n\nMohammad Ansur Ali carries delivers water to homes and businesses in a mashak, a bag made from goat skin.\n\nSlowly, business is going down, Ali says. It's a lot of hard work for very little money. So men are leaving this job whenever they can. Besides, people have pipes now.\n\nHe means that most people have access to city water now that flows from the Tala Tank in north Kolkata and is pumped up to rooftops before it comes out of gravitational systems connected to bathroom and kitchen faucets.\n\nI try to keep up with Ali as he begins his half-mile sprint down narrow lanes and side streets. He runs barefoot for speed, he says. Gets better traction this way. Sometimes, he climbs eight or nine flights of stairs.\n\nThis is a job for the young and strong, he tells me. You cannot do this after 40.\n\nAli has two daughters and a son. But he took this job because he has five sisters, and his father needed help in getting them married. Two are still at home.\n\nWe arrive at the Modern Book House on Mirza Ghalib Street, and I watch Ali slip into a dark and skinny stairwell to the second floor, where the store owner's family lives. He delivers here once a day and gets paid about $3 a month for his services.\n\nThere's every kind of book in the store: from Anne Frank's diary to daily yoga poses. But no customers. Owner Mohammed Aziz asks what I am looking for.\n\nI'm following the water delivery man for a story, I tell him.\n\nWell, you ought to write about the small new and used bookshops that were once prevalent in this part of town, Aziz says. People read everything online now. Even I will go out of business soon.\n\nFor more than 25 years, D.N. Bhattacharya has been sitting outside Kolkata's high court, typing legal documents on a manual typewriter.\n\nThe street typist\n\nOutside Kolkata's high court, a group of men sit facing Remington typewriters on splintered tables. Plastic tarps give the typists shelter from the sun and the torrential monsoonal rains that flood Kolkata every year.\n\nD.N. Bhattacharya tells me the humidity is so high during the rainy season that the paper he types on curls, and the ink begins running before it can dry. But that's the least of his worries.\n\nHe's been typing legal documents almost half his life. He took a typing class when he was 18 and by the time he turned 26, he was doing this full time. I watch him punch keys on his manual typewriter from another century faster than I can on a brand new MacBook.\n\nTypists like Bhattacharya used to complain their fingers turned blue from the constant tapping. They typed all sorts of papers for my family. Even when I sold my parents' house a few years ago, the deed was typed outside the courthouse.\n\nThey typed official letters for businessmen, resumes for job seekers and even letters for lovebirds. Typing was not an essential skill taught in schools like it was in America -- I never learned Qwerty -- and street typists were very much in demand.\n\nSo many people in Kolkata don't know how to type, Bhattacharya tells me. They don't understand legalese or they don't know how to make corrections.\n\nHe was good, he proudly admits. No one could keep up with my speed.\n\nHe'd knock out 40 to 50 pages a day. Easy.\n\nBut everything changed with the advent of desktops and laptops and now mobile devices.\n\nBhattacharya is 50 and one of the last of Kolkata's street typists. He tells me there were once 212 typists who worked at the high court. Today, there are fewer than 10.\n\nNow that everyone has computers, my work has dropped 70%, he says.\n\nHe tried to make up for lost wages by raising his price -- from 2 rupees per page to 10 (that's about 15 cents). But it doesn't fill the gap. On average, he's only typing 10 pages a day.\n\nAs courts move to digital filing, work is dwindling for Kolkata's street typists.\n\nComputerization has meant many things. Lawyers who flocked to the street typists to get their legal briefs in order now have assistants in their offices who have templates on laptops. And as court records are stored online, judges are demanding uniformity in legal documentation.\n\nA chief justice already tried once to have the typists evicted from the high court's sidewalks. Bhattacharya comes to work every day knowing that a new declaration could come down at any time: No more filings on manual typewriters.\n\nThat will be the end of us, he says.\n\nBhattacharya has no health benefits or retirement account. There is no union that represents street typists. He wonders what he might do if the work stops altogether. Maybe he will try to get on as a clerk; not many people in Kolkata possess his speed and accuracy in typing.\n\nOur conversation is interrupted by R. Islam, a high court lawyer who still utilizes the street typists. He has come with a brief to be typed. He takes off his freshly polished loafers, crosses his legs on a wooden bench next to Bhattacharya.\n\nI have a computer but I don't use it, he tells me. I sit here until all hours of the evening dictating.\n\nBut we are digital India now. This machine is irrelevant, Islam says, placing his left hand on Bhattacharya's Remington.\n\nWe talk about how Indian software engineers have contributed a great deal to the world of computers. The irony does not escape anyone, and an uncomfortable silence ends the discussion.\n\nThen Bhattacharya switches from Bengali to English.\n\nThe future, he says, is completely dark.
Editor's Note: Lillian Faderman is a historian and author of The Gay Revolution: The Story of the Struggle. The views expressed are those of the author.

The victimized fought fiercely and gave a community a desperately needed symbol for pride. But as director Roland Emmerich learned through the firestorm created by his new film, Stonewall, emotions run very high over who can claim the strongest link to what happened back then.\n\nThe Stonewall riots began on June 28, 1969, during a routine 1 a.m. bar raid. This time, though, the harassed gay clientele didn't go quietly. Indeed, they kept fighting for five nights, their number growing to thousands. The Tactical Police Force had to be called out to regain control of the streets. Many rioters were beaten so badly that Seventh Avenue from Christopher to West 10th was said to look like a battlefield in Vietnam. But gays came away feeling victorious, and the riots were a crucial turning point in LGBT history. As one wit of the day prophetically pronounced, they were the hairpin drop heard round the world.\n\nPHOTO: Phyllis Irwin Lillian Faderman\n\nRadical gay groups formed soon after the riots and grabbed media attention as homosexuals never had; they eventually emboldened other gays to start mainstream organizations such as the powerful Human Rights Campaign. Those organizations would wage the winning battles to lift the prohibitions on gays in the military and on same-sex marriage.\n\nClearly, all segments of the LGBT community have some link to Stonewall. So how has Emmerich caused such a stir?\n\nEmmerich's fictional hero, blond and blue-eyed Danny Winters, is kicked out of his home in small-town Indiana by his football coach father when he discovers that Danny is gay. Danny boards a bus to Greenwich Village, where he meets other throwaway and runaway kids. They're exploited even in the grungy, mafia-controlled Stonewall Inn, where they hang out for want of a safer place. On a hot summer night, when the cops raid the Stonewall for the second time in less than a week, Danny and his friends throw bricks, smash windows, scare the hell out of the police who are trapped inside the bar, and start the revolution.\n\nEmmerich has claimed that he wanted to make the film after he discovered that 40% of all homeless teens are LGBT. But Stonewall's focus is unclear: Is it about the hardships of homeless teens or, as the title would suggest, about the historic riots?\n\nThere are other problems with the film, too: The acting is wooden, and the lines the actors have to utter are melodramatic. Still, those aren't reasons the film has been trashed in the LGBT community. Instead, Emmerich has been faulted mostly for getting historical facts of the riot wrong.\n\nBut has he?\n\nIn early August, almost immediately after a two-minute trailer for Stonewall was released, a boycott petition began circulating on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Tumblr. The petition accused Emmerich of whitewashing history. It is time that black and brown transwomyn and drag queens are recognized for their efforts in the riots, the petition said. It got almost 25,000 signers before anyone saw the film.\n\nYet the reality is that there's no paucity of diversity in Emmerich's Stonewall. Most of Danny's companions, including his closest friend, Ray/Ramona, are black and brown transwomyn (though the term hadn't been coined in 1969). They're shown rioting no less ferociously than Danny, though Emmerich has Danny throw the first brick that starts the riots. The film's angry critics say it was an African-American trans-woman, Marsha P. Johnson, who threw that first brick, but Johnson herself never claimed that initiating honor.\n\nThere's no doubt that Johnson, who died in 1992, was a major actor in the riots, as Emmerich shows her to be. But there were other major actors at the Stonewall, too, not all of them black or brown or transgender. For example, the only known photo to capture the first night of the riots was taken by Joseph Ambrosini for the New York Daily News. It appeared the next day, June 29, showing a bunch of kids confronting the police, most of them white and cisgendered. Most prominent in the photo is a boy as blond as the fictional Danny Winters. Another photo of the rioters, taken in front of the Stonewall during the second night, was by Fred McDarrah and was printed in the Village Voice for the week of July 3. It shows about a dozen youngsters, perhaps a third of them black or brown, one of them in drag.\n\nAs Ambrosini's and McDarrah's black and white photos show, the kids who started the gay revolution were black and white and brown, too; some were trans and some weren't. There are enough laurels to go around. And that, at least, Emmerich gets right.\n\nNote: An earlier version gave an incorrect date for the Stonewall uprising.

Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nIt's hardly shocking that Louise Linton, wife of ultrawealthy former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, chose Valentine's Day weekend as the perfect date to release her feature film Me You Madness, a special gift to the person she loves most: Herself.\n\nMe You Madness bills itself as a dark comedy, but Linton seems to be the only one in on the joke -- it's hard to imagine anyone watching this serial murder celebration and laughing, other than its writer/director/producer.\n\nBut that probably won't bother Linton, who has crafted a career as a kind of performance artist of self-indulgence: The daughter of a wealthy Scottish developer, she burst into the public spotlight in 2016 after self-publishing In Congo's Shadow, her memoir of a college gap year in Zambia, which she described in its Amazon synopsis as the compelling coming-of-age story of a 'skinny white muzungu with long angel hair' who travels to darkest Africa and learns that friendship can transcend race, age, and history. The book's handful of readers pointed out its blanket factual inaccuracies and condescending, White-savior tone, and it went viral as a diamond-dusted example of staggering privilege, until Linton finally pulled it from virtual shelves.\n\nStories like this flare up and fade away just as quickly, and Linton's likely would have as well, if it hadn't been for her marriage to Mnuchin, and Mnuchin's subsequent appointment by ex-President Donald Trump as secretary of the Treasury immediately thereafter.\n\nFrom there, Linton stumbled through a series of Let them eat cake controversies , including Instagramming a photo of herself returning from a trip to Fort Knox tagged with an array of luxury items in her wardrobe, and posing gleefully with Mnuchin holding a freshly printed sheet of uncut currency. But now, with the release of Me You Madness -- a product of her personal production company Stormchaser Films -- it has become a lot less clear whether these entitlement eruptions were accidental, or merely early guerrilla marketing for this i ncredibly bizarre vanity project.\n\nJUST WATCHED Mnuchin's wife says she's 'super duper' sorry Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mnuchin's wife says she's 'super duper' sorry 02:09\n\nSince the trailer was released a few weeks ago, Linton has been actively promoting the film as a satirical combination of wry mea culpa and clap back at her critics. Having expended several regretful hours watching it, it's clear that it's both of these, and neither.\n\nSpoiler warning, for anyone who thinks this movie could possibly be spoiled further: The film focuses on Catherine Black, played by Linton as a kind of neon cartoon of herself (or, she might argue, how she's been falsely depicted in the news): Catherine is a narcissistic conspicuous consumer of both material possessions and men, in the latter case, quite literally -- she has a freezer full of severed male body parts, which she and her Chinese BFF/accomplice/female sex toy Yu Yan (Taiwanese American actress Shuya Chang) gleefully dine on in gourmet meals prepared, naturally, by Catherine herself.\n\nThings get complicated when Tyler, a hunky would-be thief played by British actor Ed Westwick, enters the picture -- with a dubious blue-collar American accent.\n\nEd Westwick and Louise Linton in 'Me You Madness'\n\nMuch of the unhinged remainder of the film is alluded to in the trailer: Catherine and Tyler have sex, fight, have more sex, brandish various weapons -- in one already-infamous scene Catherine whirls nunchucks while explaining that they're cool because Bruce Lee used them, and Bruce Lee is cool -- but everything ends happily in the end, as Tyler ends up embracing Catherine's way of life, making the threesome with Yu Yan permanent (they celebrate with a vegan dinner, with the clumsy joke being that the dinner is in fact a vegan) and then turning it into a quartet with the credit-sequence arrival of Tyler and Catherine's cutie-patootie baby.\n\nIt's hardly new stuff, even as a shock-tactic black comedy. Murder and cannibalism as a comic metaphor goes back to Jonathan Swift's modest proposal, and has remained a popular concept ever since, in musicals like Sweeney Todd, movies like Delicatessen, Eating Raoul, The Cook, The Wife, The Thief and His Lover and entire franchises like the vast canon of Hannibal Lecter.\n\nEd Westwick (back to camera) and Louise Linton in 'Me You Madness'\n\nSometimes it's the rich eating the poor. Sometimes it's the poor eating the rich. Sometimes it's the interesting eating the boring, or the sophisticated eating the crude. Me You Madness purports to focus on gender, with a very specific pop culture antecedent -- which is even noted in one of the movie's many fourth-wall breaking moments, as Catherine says that If you're thinking this is a straight rip-off of 'American Psycho,' in some ways you may be right. But this is a woman's tale. (In one early scene, Catherine publicly eviscerates a chubby loser on her hedge-fund team -- figuratively, in this case -- whose name turns out to be Patrick, undoubtedly a reference to American Psycho protagonist Patrick Bateman. The point being perhaps that Catherine, the movie's Batewoman, outmans Bateman.)\n\nSo this is Linton's ultimate girlboss movie, her paean to independent womanhood, or something.\n\nBut if Linton's claims of telling a woman's tale are made questionable by her unique privilege , her assertion that her  inclusive  team seeks to celebrate diversity (as she said in a statement to the Hollywood Reporter) is simply laughable: Linton has apparently learned nothing from the backlash after her 2016 book release.\n\nEvery major speaking role in Me You Madness is White (the only Black thing in the movie is Catherine's last name, though it's an act of mercy to Black actors that they were excused from this fiasco), with two prominent exceptions: Catherine's sister man-eater Yu Yan, and a Vietnamese male manicurist named Tien, played by Jimmy Dinh.\n\nYu Yan is relegated to speaking exclusively in Mandarin and letting her body talk, in scenes as Catherine and Tyler's bedroom third wheel; she's solely there to express her enthusiasm for man-flesh, both living and dead. Tien's dialogue is similarly all in Vietnamese; his only role in the movie is to cringe when Catherine accuses him of doing a bad gel job and to give her the excuse for comic exposition over why working-class himbo Tyler is lying unconscious in her palatial house.\n\nDespite Linton's vast privilege, she's continuously positioned herself as both an excluded outsider and a victim of the woke mob. She told Fox News, When I was in my early 20s, I definitely felt like it was a boys club, and I felt like people didn't take me seriously because I was trying to produce as young as 25; the fact that very few people are able to produce films at twice that age doesn't seem to register for her. In a softball profile for The New York Times , she said that while Mnuchin was in office, she felt censored and didn't know what she was allowed to be due to social media pressures. Perhaps in her mind, angry tweets create a cage as oppressive and confining as the ones the Trump administration used to store the children of migrants.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nPlaying Catherine, by contrast, allowed Linton to finally feel liberated: In writing and playing Catherine I've discovered an extraordinary sense of freedom and fun, she said to the Times. This character can be so uninhibited in her universe.\n\nWhich underscores what Me You Madness ultimately amounts to: Not a scathing parody, an act of subversion, or a humble confession, but a multimillion-dollar spa day, in which a child and wife of privilege gives herself the chance to relax, unwind and be herself, to a soundtrack of her favorite Eighties hits.\n\nThe madness is that, in a time when tens of millions are out of work and hundreds of thousands have died, the Trump administration's aristocracy are not only paying no price for the ruin they've visited on America -- they're giving themselves over-the-top consolation prizes for the trauma they believe they experienced. While Marie Antoinette may never have actually said let them eat cake, Louise Linton's message with this movie is clear: Let the masses eat cadavre humain.

(CNN) —\n\nEach year when Valentine's Day approaches, our thoughts turn to love, relationships and coupling.\n\nAs some anticipate the holiday that others dread, the spotlight is split between two groups: Those in relationships, and those who're not. While there are certainly perks to both lifestyles, when is it better to be coupled up, and when is it better to be living the single life?\n\nTEAM MARRIED: In one corner, we have the wedded. According to the US Census, 128.8 million of Americans 18 and over were married in 2016, which translates to 52.7% of the adult population.\n\nTEAM SINGLE: On the other side, we have the unattached, those 18 and over who have never been married, as well as divorcees, widows, widowers and those who're separated. There were 115.8 million single Americans in 2016, which is about 47.3% of the adult population. Forty-nine percent were women, and 45.5% were men.\n\nNote: Obviously plenty of people in long term relationships and civil unions get a little bit of both the married and single world, legally and personally speaking.\n\nFinances\n\nWhen you have a significant other, you have a significant financial advantage: You can pool your financial resources and share the bills. If you both work, and make about the same amount, it can seem like you're getting a 100% raise. One often-cited 2005 study from Ohio State University found married people experience a per person net worth increase of 77% over singles. Additionally, their combined wealth increases on average by 16% for each year of marriage. Another plus, if one partner loses his or her job, the other's income provides a safety net.\n\nWhat about taxes?\n\nMarried couples don't automatically benefit when it's tax time. Depending on income, some are eligible for bonuses and certain deductions where singles aren't, but in certain situations, they are responsible for paying a tax penalty that could eat up a large portion of their combined salaries. For Social Security, one partner can claim a full spousal benefit, which is equal to one half of your husband or wife's retirement benefit.\n\nWhat about spending?\n\nIn their 2013 article for The Atlantic, The High Price of Being Single in America, Lisa Arnold and Christina Campbell experimented with hypothetical single and married people's finances and discovered the marrieds came out on top over their unmarried counterparts in several key areas.\n\nIf you're single, there may be a bit less spending money, but how to spend it is your choice alone. No one can deny your dream of weekly mani-pedis or slam the door on your meticulously decorated fan cave.\n\nVerdict: TEAM MARRIED\n\nSingletons may enjoy more personal freedom with their finances, but if we're talking hard numbers, being married is usually an advantage.\n\nHealth\n\nMarried people seem to reap more health benefits. Being married may significantly improve the likelihood of surviving cancer, according to a 2013 study from the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Coupled cancer patients were also 17% less likely to see their cancer spread.\n\nThey have a lower risk for heart problems as well, says a 2014 study from the American College of Cardiology. Researchers there screened 3.5 million adults for cardiovascular problems and found that those who were married had less heart disease and healthier blood vessels throughout the body than people who were single, divorced or widowed.\n\nWhat about insurance?\n\nCouples and families sharing a plan are sometimes able to pay toward the same annual deductible, which would make benefits coverage kick in faster, saving money.\n\nWhat about health and happiness?\n\nThe takeaway from these advantages relies on whether the couples had happy marriages. Stress and depression resulting from unhappy partnerships can adversely affect health, an issue singles don't have to face. Researchers from the University of Utah found in 2009 that middle-aged women in unhappy marriages showed risk factors for heart attacks and diabetes.\n\nIf you're single, you may be more motivated to get in shape to look attractive for potential mates.\n\nResearch published in 2013 from Southern Methodist University correlated weight gain and marriage satisfaction in early marriage (newlyweds were more likely to gain weight if they were happy).\n\nVERDICT: A TIE\n\nMarriage is good for your health, but only if it's a healthy marriage! Plus, single people may avoid some of the bad health habits that come from settling down.\n\nSex\n\nNo surprise here that married people have sex more often than singletons. Data compiled by Statista from the Journal of Sexual Medicine in 2009 shows that 71.32% of married people over 18 reported they had had sexual intercourse in the past 90 days.\n\nOnly 11.32% of unattached people said they had done the deed during that time.\n\nOh, and by the way, a 2017 online survey shows 32% – almost a third of American adults – plan on getting some on Valentine's Day.\n\nVERDICT: TEAM MARRIED\n\nMarriage does have its built-in benefits ;)\n\nSleep habits\n\nWhen you're single, you usually don't have to deal with a partner who hogs the bed or steals the covers. The Better Sleep Council found that 26% of the coupled people they surveyed in 2012 got a better night's sleep when they slept alone.\n\nWhat about the quantity of sleep?\n\nIt seems like many people aren't getting enough sleep anyway, no matter what their relationship status is. Data from the CDC shows that almost one-third of American adults aren't getting the recommended seven hours of sleep each night, and single mothers are getting even less. The study found that 43.5% got less than seven hours. Adults either without kids or without kids at home got a few more winks closer to the right amount, where 29.7% had fewer than seven hours.\n\nWhat about snoring?\n\nPerhaps a snoring partner is the culprit for some of this lack of sleep. A 2015 survey from the American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine found 40% of women claim snoring in the opposite sex is a turn-off, and nearly one in 10 Americans went so far as to admit that snoring has hurt at least one of their romantic relationships.\n\nSnoring regularly affects 37 million sleepers. For singletons, snoring probably isn't as much of an issue – and every night doesn't feel like an eternity.\n\nVERDICT: TEAM SINGLE\n\nNo one hogging the bed, no one keeping you up, and no kids to barge in? Single life is sleep life.\n\nExpenses\n\nReady to cross over to the other team? Getting hitched can really add up, for all concerned.\n\nThe national average cost of a wedding in 2016 was at an all-time high of $35,329, according to The Knot.com. Those not saying I do aren't necessarily off the hook either. The average cost of being a guest at a wedding in 2016 was $738 for men and $472 for women. However, out-of-town travel, gifts and suitable attire can certainly drive up the cost. Doesn't hurt to pray for an elopement.\n\nVERDICT: A TIE\n\nNo one's forcing you to spend major cash on a wedding. We hear backyard celebrations are totally in.\n\nPets\n\nEveryone knows the stereotype of the lonely spinster with a gajillion cats, but according to the numbers, families have more critters.\n\nGranted, partnerships between pets and singles are growing. Results from an American Veterinary Medical Association study indicate the percentage of single adults with pets grew from 46.9% to 54.7% from 2006 to 2011. Families with pets grew from 65.5% to just 66.4%. Pets trigger health benefits that help everyone, such as decreasing blood pressure and cholesterol. They help ease loneliness and even provide chances to meet new (human) friends and dates. To the dog park!\n\nVERDICT: A TIE\n\nWhen it comes to pets, everyone wins!\n\nSometimes there's just not a number\n\nUnfortunately, statistics are elusive for some valuable benefits of being single or married; however, they're still worth noting.\n\nOne partner in a couple can be the resident bug swatter. Couples can enjoy the perks of trading off designated driver duties after a night out on the town, as well as nab a spot in HOV multiple-occupancy highway lanes. If you have a partner, you don't have to worry about facing an amusement park ride by yourself, since those tiny little cars usually come in sets of two.\n\nBut, if you're single, you never have to wrestle for control of the remote or run every financial decision past someone else.

(CNN) South Korea recorded more deaths than births in 2020 for the first time ever, prompting calls for action to revive the country's falling fertility rate.\n\nFor years, South Korea has struggled with a growing demographic crisis. The country's fertility rate -- the average number of children a woman will have in her lifetime -- has repeatedly hit record lows, and ranks near the bottom of the lowest fertility rates in the world. Meanwhile, South Korea's population continues to age, sending the country into a demographic decline.\n\nBut last year's census data, released by the Ministry of Interior and Safety on Monday, appears even more alarming.\n\nThere were only 275,815 births, a record low -- compared to 307,764 deaths, a 3.1% increase in fatalities from the previous year. This is the first time South Korea has hit the population death cross, when the number of deaths surpasses births, the ministry said in a news release -- and the first time the total population has shrunk.\n\nThe population continues to age rapidly, the census showed: 32.7% of people are in their 40s and 50s, and nearly a quarter are over the age of 60.\n\nRead More
New York (CNN Business) Corporate America has finally put its money where its mouth is -- just in time for Democrats to take control of Washington.\n\nLast Wednesday's Capitol siege appears to have turned the president from kingmaker to radioactive . The fallout has spread to the 147 GOP lawmakers who lined up against the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nEven more companies are reviewing their political contributions and putting donations to both parties on hold. Many of their press releases frame the move as a defense of democracy and a commitment to their values.\n\nIt's not a hard call for them, says Tony Fratto, who served in the George W. Bush Treasury Department and now advises companies. This is meaningful. These companies are saying we are not going to be there for you because your actions crossed this particular line -- aid and comfort to an effort to overthrow an election.\n\nRead More

New York (CNN Business) Xerox is dropping the niceties. It really, really wants to merge with HP, and it has gone hostile.\n\nThe copier company said Thursday it will nominate 11 new directors to replace HP's entire board at HP's upcoming shareholder meeting.\n\nHP said Thursday Xerox's proposal significantly undervalues HP and creates meaningful risk to the detriment of HP shareholders. It has also raised significant concerns about Xerox's business strategy, noting that its revenue fell nearly 10% in 2019.\n\nBut Xerox says combining the companies, which are in similar businesses, could save tremendously on costs.\n\nWe believe HP shareholders will be better served by a new slate of independent directors who understand the challenges of operating a global enterprise and appreciate the value that can be created by realizing the synergies of a combination with Xerox, Xerox CEO John Visentin said in a statement Thursday.\n\nHP called Xerox's nominations a self-serving tactic by Xerox to advance its proposal.\n\nThe hostile takeover, if successful, would merge two American technology giants that have both seen better days.\n\nA deal would be complicated by the fact that HP is more than three times the size of Xerox: HP has a market value of $32 billion, compared to Xerox's less-than-$8 billion valuation. Xerox's latest offer would value HP at $33.5 billion, or $22 per share. HP's market cap was about $27 billion before Xerox came in with its offer in early November.\n\nBut Xerox announced in November that it is selling various stakes in former parts of its business, and it will generate $2.5 billion in cash from those transactions. And on Thursday the company announced it lined up $24 billion in financing to take over HP.\n\nHP's stock was marginally higher in premarket trading. Xerox was flat.\n\nA marriage between the companies could make sense. Both Xerox and HP spun off their big money-making ventures in recent years, leaving behind aging printing businesses that remain profitable. But those earnings are dwindling every year.\n\nHP Enterprise HPE HP had surprised investors by growing faster than many had believed possible after its 2015 split with, but it has struggled in recent quarters.\n\nAlthough HP still has a sizable PC business, fewer customers are buying ink from HP. Ink sales had long been HP's profit generator: HP would take losses on its printer sales, generating the bulk of its income from ink. But smartphones make printing less crucial, and many customers who do print are able to find cheaper ink suppliers.\n\nThe company announced in October that it would cut between 7,000 and 9,000 jobs by 2022. At the time, Enrique Lores, HP's CEO, called the move bold and decisive action to help the company in its next chapter. HP's former CEO, Dion Weisler, stepped down late last year for a family matter.\n\nXerox, like HP, relies on a dying business for the bulk of its sales and profit. It sells and services copy machines and printers, primarily for corporations. But sales are falling, declining in each of the past seven quarters.\n\nBoth companies have a storied history: Xerox started in 1906 as the Haloid Photographic Co. The photographic supply company in Rochester, New York, paved its way to mega-success in March 1960, when it shipped its first office copier . The Haloid Xerox contraption was the size of two washing machines and weighed 648 pounds. It also occasionally caught on fire. The Xerox copier's core technology -— a process called xerography, invented by Chester Carlson — is still widely used in copy machines five decades later. Xerox is now based in Norwalk, Connecticut.\n\nHP traces its origins to 1938, when Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard rented a garage in Palo Alto, California. That year, they invented their first product: the HP Model 200A, an audio oscillator used to test sound equipment. The company became the pioneer of Silicon Valley, building its first computer in 1966 and the famous HP-35 in 1972 — the world's first handheld scientific calculator.
Adjust font size:\n\nEditor's note: Thomas Roberts has been a Headline News anchor since 2001. In this story, he discusses being sexually abused by a Catholic priest as a teenager.\n\nATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- I became a victim of sexual abuse at the age of 14; the abuse lasted three years. It took me nearly 20 years to gather the strength to help put my abuser behind bars. Now, a year after justice was done, I am ready to tell my story publicly in ways I never have before.\n\nMy abuser was Father Jeff Toohey, a trusted man of God. He was the equivalent of a religious celebrity in my private all-boys Catholic school in Baltimore, Maryland. Father Jeff was every boy's friend and mentor. I considered him my mentor as well.\n\nWhen my parents divorced, I was sent to Father Jeff to help me cope with all the changes. Divorce in the mid-1980s still seemed so foreign. Plus, I was just a kid, and I didn't know much about divorce. I just knew it sucked.\n\nAll I had at that time in my life was my family and school. Those were my constants. But as my family fell apart, so did my life at school. After the abuse began, high school became a prison of shame and lies.\n\nI felt trapped. My parents would be horrified to know their failure at marriage put their son at risk to be sexually abused and that the man abusing me was the high school chaplain and beloved priest. (Watch Roberts' mom say the priest will 'burn in hell' )\n\nThe school would never believe me, I thought, and I feared I would be expelled if I revealed the abuse. I was 14, with no voice, except the one in my head saying, You can never tell the truth about what is happening.\n\nRoughly a month after the abuse started, I attempted to commit suicide. I took a bottle of my mother's pills. I lined them up one-by-one on my maple dresser. I took them all and lay on my bed hoping to just fade away and die.\n\nMy sister, Patsy, came home and found me. It was the day before her 18th birthday. She saved my life that day just by merely coming to my room to say, Hi. She saw the pill bottle and went to get ipecac, which made me throw up.\n\nMy parents were terribly upset by my actions. Father Jeff was told I tried to kill myself. All agreed I just needed more counseling. Father Jeff's exact words were, You have so much to live for. I felt so cornered, and I had nowhere to go and no one to run to. I just became numb to the abuse.\n\nThis too shall pass is one of my favorite religious sayings. The abuse did pass, but it left me so insecure about who I was.\n\nWhen I was in college, another boy, Michael Goles, came forward and reported his abuse at the hands of Father Jeff. I knew I could help Michael if I, too, revealed Father Jeff's abuse, but out of a feeling of self-preservation, I remained quiet. Michael wasn't believed, and his case was thrown out of court.\n\nNearly 20 years after the abuse started, I became strong enough to go back and confront what had happened to me. I was strong enough to tell my family the truth. I was strong enough to report it to the archdiocese. And I was strong enough to call Michael Goles and tell him, I am sorry, and that I believe him because it happened to me, too.\n\nTogether, we were strong enough to see our abuser finally admit his crimes. Father Jeff was charged with 10 criminal counts of child sexual abuse in relation to my case. He asked for a plea and admitted his guilt in court. He was sentenced to five years in jail but only served 10 months. He was released early to serve eight months in home detention.\n\nThis story is so layered. For a long time, I couldn't talk about it without crying. But a year ago, CNN Anchor Anderson Cooper and CNN Senior Producer Charlie Moore approached me about telling and following my story. I was scared. I was scared of being so honest and televising this journey.\n\nWhat would people think? Would I ruin my career? But I came to the conclusion that I will not be scared anymore. I will not be scared of telling the truth because it might be uncomfortable for people to hear.\n\nIf this story compels even one person to seek help for being sexually abused, then it is all worth it. All it takes is telling one person. From there, strength grows and you can tell a second person and so on. Then you can finally have control of your life back.
Story highlights 40% of our daily actions are so rote, they are automatic The most effective way to adopt a habit is to replace a bad one with a better one\n\nEditor's Note: This essay is part of a column called The Wisdom Project by David Allan, editorial director of CNN Health and Wellness. The series is on applying to one's life the wisdom and philosophy found everywhere, from ancient texts to pop culture. You can follow David at @davidgallan.

As a species, we are impressively committed to self-improvement, and most of us believe that habits are an effective means to that end.\n\nHabits – actions performed with little conscious thought and often unwittingly triggered by external cues – are powerful influences on behavior and can be our greatest allies for positive change. But because they are so difficult to break, habits are also frequent saboteurs of personal progress.\n\nHabit is a good servant but a bad master is how author Gretchen Rubin summed it up in her book Better Than Before: Mastering the Habit of Our Everyday Lives. Hers was one of three recent books I read back-to-back on the subject of habit formation; the others were Charles Duhigg's The Power of Habit and Jeremy Dean's Making Habits, Breaking Habits. Together, they helped me understand more deeply the importance of habit control, how to choose a habit to begin or end, and the mechanics of sticking with it.\n\nThe first thing to know, each book explained, is that a lot of our daily actions are so rote, they are automatic. All our life … is but a mass of habits, philosopher and psychologist William James wrote, though a 2006 study put the amount of habitual daily action at 40%. Still, that's a lot of mindless behavior.\n\nIt's helpful that we don't need to think about how or when to drink coffee, brush our teeth or drive to work. If we did, we'd waste so much time rethinking or learning those tasks, we'd get little else done.\n\nThe whole trick is to get habits to work for you, not against you. Self-control is a limited resource, Dean explains, so a good habit means not having to exert effort every time you need to do the right thing.\n\nRoom to grow\n\nThe first thing to identify for yourself is the habit you want to work on, whether it's starting a new (good) one or ending an old (bad) one. That's a minor distinction, by the way. Eating healthier is eating less junk. Exercising more is being less sedentary. One is often the inverse of another.\n\nThis step requires some honest self-evaluation. What is not working in your life? What personality flaws are holding you back? Where is there room to do better?\n\nWe know what many of the most common areas of improvement are, at least when it comes to making resolutions. People want to lose weight, eat better, be more mindful, spend money more wisely, sleep better and improve relationships. By eliminating bad habits and starting new ones, you can succeed in most of these areas.\n\nOne helpful checklist frequently used for goal-setting is the acronym SMART, created by economic theorist Peter Drucker. Effective resolutions, research has shown, are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound.\n\nBefore finishing the first book (Dean's, which is the most prescriptive and research- and science-based), I decided on two habits to work on myself. The first was to be more present and mindful with my kids. The second was to stop seeking out and consuming free, non-nutritious food at work. One was a good habit to start, the other a bad habit to quit.\n\nRubin, who approaches the topic personally and looks for specific techniques that work for her, recommends starting a habit at the same time as a big turning point such as pregnancy, marriage, a medical diagnosis, a family death, an anniversary, a long trip or a new year.\n\nRepeal and replace your behavior\n\nThe consensus among these books is that the most effective way to adopt a habit is to replace a bad one with a better one. Dean's metaphor is to think of habits as well-worn rivers of action that flow out of the predictable path of your routine. Often, the most effective way to stop it flowing in harmful directions is not by damming it but by diverting it. For example, many people stop smoking by chewing gum.\n\nThe point is that bad habits die hard, and as with riding a bike, your brain never stops learning how to do them.\n\nSo it's easier to think about any habit formation, even new good ones, in terms of replacing unwanted behavior. That made sense for my snacking at work. I started buying healthy yet still delicious snacks to keep there: yogurt instead of morning doughnuts, dried papaya instead of chocolate, sweetened rice cakes instead of stale leftover doughnuts. A supply of healthy snack options kept me on a new course of action that largely followed the old eating habit pattern.\n\nTo be more mindful with my kids, I needed to avoid the opposite behaviors, such as checking my work phone or planning activities while with them so I could focus on their needs and thoughts.\n\nDuhigg explains that habit reversal therapy is a legitimate technique used for things like tics and obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as predilections such as gambling, smoking and bed-wetting.\n\nIt's important to make a distinction between a bad habit and addiction, however, even if the behaviors seem to overlap. Addiction requires greater intervention than habit hacking.\n\nDean describes the hallmarks of addiction as not being in control and not being aware of time/energy spent on the behavior. People with addictions are preoccupied with soothing a craving and needing more and more to get the same effect, as well as suffering withdrawal without it. Unlike bad habits, addictions eat away at important activities such as relationships and work. They tend to be an escape from normal life and are often hidden from others.\n\nE-Commerce Guide by CNN Underscored: 5 genius morning routine habits, as told by 5 of the world's most successful people\n\nThe wonderful thing about triggers\n\nWe like to think we have free will in every situation, but many of our actions are predictably triggered by external situations. And if those events are part of your daily or weekly routine, our Pavlovian tendencies become ingrained. Pajamas are on: Time to floss and brush. Cup of coffee in hand: Time to dunk a doughnut. Beer finished: Let's have a cigarette. But triggers can also be feelings, such as stress or boredom.\n\nBeing aware of your triggers is the first step in learning how to keep them from sabotaging you and make them work for you instead. Is there a certain time of day or task when you crave a treat? What do you always do when you feel stress (go for a run or go for a drink)? What is your bedtime ritual to let your brain know it's time to sleep?\n\nYou can help create conditions to avoid triggers, but not fully. If the trigger is deeply ingrained, maybe going back years, it will sabotage you when your guard is down. For these situations, you need contingencies. Dean calls them If … then … plans. When trigger X happens, I won't do bad habit Y, as I usually do, but I will replace it with much healthier Z action.\n\nMy favorite example of effective trigger planning is Starbucks, a company that puts a higher premium on customer service than on the (habit-fueled) products it sells. Duhigg, who prefers Malcom Gladwell-esque case studies for his book, explains that the chain's baristas are well trained on what to do when something goes wrong, such as a messed-up order that angers a customer. Rather than improvise or consider options in those moments, they practice rapid responses – such as apologizing and offering a replacement drink for free – until it's second nature.\n\nYou likewise need to have a plan for when a strong, perhaps rare, trigger threatens your winning habit streak. Ordinarily, I can avoid eating cupcakes at work, but what's my plan when I've skipped lunch, it's late afternoon, I have some onerous task that would be made more enjoyable with a treat, and the cupcake is filled with peanut butter?\n\n66 is the magic number\n\nAccording to one study cited by Dean and Rubin, it takes 66 days of doing something to convert it to a habit. However, that number varies depending on the person and activity. For example, it took those participating in the study less than 20 days to habitualize drinking a glass of water every day, 60 days for eating fruit with lunch and more then 84 days to make 50 sit-ups a daily habit. Some habits could take a year to form. But 66 days is a good target.\n\nI avoided work snacking and improved my capacity for parental mindfulness for 66 days straight. Or rather, I diligently monitored these habits over 66 days, because another pillar of successful habit formation is tracking. Even something as subjective as be more present with my kids can be numerically self-scored every evening.\n\nAnd another pro tip of habit-making (or replacing) is accountability. Tell other people. Share on social media (unless social media is the habit you're changing). Ask your friends and family to support the effort. Getting others involved, or even just aware, makes it harder for you to give it up. And others' support can be inspiring and helpful.\n\nTreat yo'self: rewards\n\nUnlike tracking and accountability, incentives are a debatable strategy. Duhigg believes that they are central to the exercise, because habits are reward-based. Rubin concludes that external rewards take you away from internalizing the right motivation behind your new habit.\n\nFor me, rewards have been pivotal. Five years ago, I took off 25 pounds and have kept it off by establishing an elaborate reward system.\n\nIf you do treat yourself for keeping a habit, make sure it's not self-defeating. You may not want to reward, say, avoiding doughnuts by indulging in a half-gallon of ice cream.\n\nAnd that's one to grow on\n\nAt the end of 66 days, I stopped tracking my new habits and found that they had largely stuck. When I came home from work, seeing the faces of my daughters was the trigger to remind me to give them my undivided focus. I rarely (instead of automatically) checked my phone for work updates, and I put off my personal agenda items until after bedtime. And I replaced workplace snacking with my private stash of more nutritious snacks: same trigger, but alternate behavior at much fewer calories.\n\nThe real test though, is time. More than six months have passed since my 66 days of daily tracking, and I'm still doing a solid job on mindful parenting. I have occasionally slipped on the work snacking, though. I wouldn't say I've failed at it, because I'm building up a new long-term habit muscle for healthy snacking, and I ate a lot less junk food than I would have without trying.\n\nRubin would call it stumbling, and we should accept that it happens in the habit game. Stumbling is not a reason to quit trying.\n\nSubscribe to this column Don't miss another Wisdom Project column by subscribing here.\n\nYou may want to read one of the habit books, too. The three overlap and support each other, but my personal preference was for Rubin's, largely because I feel a kinship with her love of life-hacking, introspection and applied psychology.\n\nShe's the author of the bestselling The Happiness Project and wrote this new book, she explained, after concluding that habits were the best means to actually achieve happiness.\n\nBut I'll give the last word to the wise Ben Franklin, whose advice would make all these books unnecessary.  'Tis easier to prevent bad habits than to break them, he wrote.

(CNN) With the global pandemic, 2020 proved to be a tough year for everyone -- especially girls and women.\n\nBut many leaders stepped up to help. As we mark Women's History Month , here's a look at some women making a difference around the globe -- and the ways you can help, too.\n\nDr. Alaa Murabit -- Equity in health care\n\nDr. Alaa Murabit is a Libyan-Canadian medical doctor, women's rights advocate and United Nations High-Level Commissioner on Health, Employment and Economic Growth.\n\nThe Canadian government named her one of Canada's 100 most influential women in history. Her TED Talk about her Muslim faith, What my religion really says about women, has been viewed more than 5 million times.\n\nAnd while she holds degrees from the London School of Economics and Al Zawiya University, she says her most important education may be the one she received at The Murabit School of International Affairs, otherwise known as her family home in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith 10 sisters and brothers, Murabit says she learned early how important diplomacy and forming alliances can be.\n\nSo, as an adult, Murabit aligned herself with the UN, where she can combine her interests in medicine and helping women around the world.\n\nFrom engaging with countries on Covid vaccine delivery ... to supporting women's rights activists, working through dual challenges of pandemic and conflict, the UN has been at hand throughout.\n\nFor Murabit, equity is a key part of public health. She points to the pandemic's disruptions of the global supply chain, limiting the availability of contraceptives in low-income countries.\n\nTo find out more about Murabit's charity, visit UN Women USA\n\nDr. Valerie Montgomery Rice -- Gender equality\n\nShe entered medicine because she wanted to use her love for math and science to impact people. Becoming a doctor, she says, seemed like an obvious choice.\n\nArmed with a medical degree from Harvard Medical School, Montgomery Rice had a successful career as a fertility specialist and researcher before moving into medical leadership.\n\nWhile Montgomery Rice says more women and women of color are getting into medical school, there's still not enough representation when it comes to the highest levels of medical leadership. When we get to the level of dean, we still see a significant gap, she says.\n\nDiversity matters in medical leadership (and board rooms everywhere) she says, because people with different life experiences help organizations see the big picture and make better decisions. Those life experiences, combined with your formal education and your career, allow you to solve problems.\n\nAs part of her efforts to raise gender equity in public health, Montgomery Rice serves on the board of CARE\n\nCARE thinks about not just that a woman is living in poverty but what put her in poverty? Does she need an education?\n\nThat specificity allows the organization to really help people, Montgomery Rice says.\n\nI would say one of the most important things is to try to direct more intentional resources -- resources based on specifically what the person needs -- so that they can be empowered to create a sustainable change for themselves.\n\nGloria Aguilera Terry -- Ending gender violence\n\nGloria Aguilera Terry calls domestic violence the scourge in our society and the common thread in homelessness, mental health and maternal mortality.\n\nTerry is the CEO of the Texas Council on Family Violence and is the board chair of the National Network to End Domestic Violence.\n\nTerry was the chief financial officer at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce when she took a tour of a homeless shelter, an experience that would change the trajectory of her life. After seeing entire families trying to live out of cardboard boxes, she concluded that she hadn't done anything particularly meaningful with her own life.\n\nI felt I could leverage my expertise in more impactful ways. I also felt compelled to be the voice for women who couldn't use theirs.\n\nIn Terry's home state of Texas, research found an increase in domestic violence after Hurricane Harvey\n\nWe are finding the same is true of Covid. Comparing the six months preceding Covid to the first six months of the pandemic, calls to law enforcement increased by 9 percent, she says.\n\nFurther, the use of firearms at family violence incidents grew by nearly 42 percent.\n\nImagine you, your sister, mother (or) friend making a decision to either stay in an abusive relationship or seek basic human safety within a communal shelter during a global pandemic.\n\nThe National Network to End Domestic Violence operates 56 coalitions across the United States. Terry says that means a survivor can quickly be connected to the closest resources.\n\nMalala Yousafzai -- Education for girls\n\nMalala Yousafzai was a schoolgirl in Pakistan when the Taliban took over her town. Among other things, they banned girls from going to school. Encouraged by her father and the rest of her family, she began speaking out about the need for girls' education.\n\nIn October 2012, a gunman boarded her school bus, asked, Who is Malala? and shot her in the head.\n\nWhen she woke up 10 days later in a hospital room in England, she was famous around the world. She used that notoriety to advocate for girls' education.\n\nIn 2014, she established the Malala Fund , a charity striving to ensure every girl can pursue an education. That same year, she became the youngest-ever Nobel laureate, winning the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nAlthough a global pandemic meant I spent my final months as a university student in my parents' house, I'm grateful that I was able to complete my education, she says on her official website.\n\nAfter taking time to relax, I am more dedicated than ever to my fight for girls.\n\nFaith Mwangi-Powell -- Ending child marriage\n\nis the chief executive officer of Faith Mwangi-Powellis the chief executive officer of Girls Not Brides , an organization that partners with more than 1,500 groups working to keep girls in school and out of early marriages\n\nMwangi-Powell was previously the global director of an initiative working to end female genital mutilation\n\nI grew up in a small rural village in Kenya. I was inspired at an early age by watching my own mother, a leader in our community, making a positive change in my world back then. I always knew I wanted to do work that empowered women and girls, and I was lucky to have had opportunities that set me on a path to do just that, Mwangi-Powell says.\n\nI feel privileged to be CEO of Girls Not Brides, where every day I am working to make sure girls and women everywhere can achieve their dreams -- and be free to make choices about their own lives and futures.\n\nBefore Covid, every year, 12 million girls are married under the age of 18. Yet the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic is projected to result in 13 million additional child marriages in the next 10 years alone because of social distancing and the economic impact on households, she says.\n\nCovid-19 threatens to undo decades of good work to end child marriage and achieve gender equality. Changing practices takes a long time. When something this big and with this scale of impact comes along, it puts that work under threat.\n\nFaith Mwangi-Powell and the other activists profiled here are not working alone.\n\nI would like people to think about celebrating women, particularly those who are everyday, unsung heroes among us, who are within our own communities -- the ones who wake up every day and do something to make a positive change in their own community. We all know them -- the woman who goes the extra mile to help, to heal, to educate, to nurture, Mwangi-Powell points out. Let's not celebrate the women leaders we know. Let's celebrate the ones who are unsung, everyday heroes who carry on regardless during this pandemic.\n\nMaybe you can join them to advance women's equality around the world.
(CNN) Crystal Hefner says she almost didn't make it through a cosmetic procedure and is using the experience to talk about unrealistic beauty standards.\n\nHugh Hefner's widow posted a photo Wednesday on her verified Instagram account showing her bandaged, with a caption that begins, I had a fat transfer surgery October 16 and almost didn't make it through.\n\nI lost half the blood in my body and ended up in the hospital needing a blood transfusion, the caption reads. I've been slowly eating my way back to health since then and I am now finally feeling ok.\n\nHefner writes she has been an advocate for being natural after she became ill and had her implants removed in 2016.\n\nI should have learned my lesson the first time but I guess the universe keeps sending you the same lesson until you learn it, she writes.\n\nRead More
Editor's Note: After we first published this story we received reader feedback about the term's derivation and use in pop culture. We've updated the story to reflect those additional details.\n\n(CNN) Shannon was used to her socially awkward son being bullied by other boys at the private school he attends in Atlanta.\n\nBut when she picked him up from school in mid-January and her eighth grader told her he was being called a simp, Shannon, who's only using her first name to protect her son's identity, didn't know what to think.\n\nHe's telling me this and I'm driving and I'm trying to make sense of it, she said. I'd never heard the word.\n\nHe told me, 'It basically means that I'm just being nice to girls because I like them,' she said. I was like, wait, my kid is being picked on for being nice to girls?\n\nHer son had told her he'd recently been put in the friend zone by one of the girls, who made it clear she wasn't interested in dating him. They had continued to be friendly.\n\nYou do all these things as a parent to raise your kid right, to be nice to everyone, especially kids without many friends, Shannon said. And you never think that by making your kid the nice one you could be making them a target for bullies.\n\nWhat is a simp?\n\nWhile many parents might be unfamiliar with the word simp, chances are your tween or teen has used or at least heard the term.\n\nSimp hashtags are rampant on TikTok. Instagram has over 350,000 posts tagged #simp and there are Facebook groups devoted to simps and simping (it can be a verb, too).\n\nDepending on who you talk to, there is some debate on the word's current usage and how much (if at all) it has evolved over time. While simp's way-back origins are connected to the word simpleton, its current usage is linked to West Coast American rappers like Too Short, who first used it in the mid-1980s in a way that denotes the opposite of pimp in his song Pimpology.\n\nIn 1992, Boyz II Men released a song called Sympin' Ain't Easy, using a different spelling of the word and evoking frustrated yearning.\n\nUrban Dictionary 's top definition of a simp is someone who does way too much for a person they like. Other definitions on the crowdsourced online dictionary include a man who puts the hoes before the bros, and a guy that is overly desperate for women, especially if she is a bad person, or has expressed her disinterest in him whom which he continues to obsess over.\n\n'Simp' is slang for a person (typically a man) who is desperate for the attention and affection of someone else (typically a woman), said Connor Howlett, 23, a digital strategist for Turner PR in New York City, in an email to CNN.\n\nThink the energy of puppy dog eyes but manifested in a romantic, human form, Howlett said. It's used in an insulting manner. Though typically playful, there are definitely undertones of toxic masculinity since it's related to showing too much emotion.\n\nFlorida mother Karen McClung first encountered the word in group chats she closely monitors with her 11-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son.\n\nI saw the word and quickly looked it up, said McClung, who lives in Tampa. I asked my kids what they thought it meant and my son said, 'It's basically if you had $1,000 and you could do anything with it, you'd use it to get the attention of a girl — then everyone would make fun of you.\n\nI blocked the thread, McClung said.\n\nWhile she said her son wasn't being called a simp in the thread, McClung said she's curious to see how it impacts my son because he's very chivalrous by nature.\n\nA definition that's evolving\n\nA word that emerged into Gen Z vernacular from social media usage, as simp is thought to have arrived, is bound to get muddled and continue to evolve.\n\nAnd simp can have different contexts depending on the age group using it, said Laura Capinas , a clinical social worker in Sonoma County, California.\n\nDepending on if it's a middle schooler or a high schooler using it, it could be different, she said, and it's not just boys talking about simps and simping either.\n\nGirls in high school sometimes throw out the term to their high school girlfriends, Capinas said. Some kids I've talked to have said it's not a derogatory term. It's sort of like teasing someone, like 'You've left us to go hang out with your friends, you're simping us.'\n\nIf you have someone saying it who's used to being a bully, it will be received as a bully comment, she said.\n\nWhile she hasn't heard kids or parents in her practice be overly concerned about the word, Capinas often hears kids use it in describing their day or their peer groups.\n\nMyra Fortson said she has discussed the word with her 15-year-old daughter and thinks words like this often spread more quickly than their meaning.\n\nKids will also own their language by refusing to go back to its original meaning, said the Tampa, Florida, mother of three. They will say things like, 'Maybe that's where it comes from, but it doesn't mean that anymore.' And they keep using the term the way they want.\n\nTactics for defusing a tense simp-tuation\n\nOne way to think of a simp, said Sean Davis, a marriage and family therapist in Sacramento, California, is simply someone who is ahead of their time.\n\nThough it hurts in the moment, in the big picture, a boy who is called a 'simp' can wear it as a badge of honor, Davis said.\n\nToday's boys are being raised in the middle of the biggest redefinition of male gender roles in recent history, Davis said. Should I be kind and sensitive or distant and aloof when trying to win a partner over?\n\nAs with all bullying, teens and tweens should first tell their parents or a trusted adult who may be able to intervene on their behalf, he said. Otherwise, simply owning it and refusing to be ashamed can help.\n\nIt's important for parents to remember that there have always been new slang terms to navigate for kids and parents alike, Capinas said, and the goal is to make sure it's being received in a playful manner and used playfully.\n\nI think we are always looking to stop our kids from being hurt, she said. We don't like language that's slang and has potential for negative connotation.\n\nOne tactic she teaches kids in her therapy sessions, she said, is the humor tool.\n\nIt's comic relief. You practice not putting down the other person, you put down the situation, she said.\n\nIf someone is being called out for always simping the girls, Capinas said, he could turn it around and say 'It's tough being the lone soldier simp nice guy, who wants to join me?'\n\nYou can turn it and make it into comedy, she said.\n\nDavis pointed to a similar approach.\n\nTelling the bully, 'That's right,' while holding your head up high and walking away can help, as bullies usually give up if they don't succeed in tearing the other person down, he said. And you can tell yourself that being bullied is simply the price a revolutionary has to pay for standing up for what's right.\n\nShannon said her son's therapist advised similar tactics, but the boy said he only comes up with the perfect retort three hours later.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIt's just been really heartbreaking, especially because I know a lot of these boys bullying him. He's been at the school since second grade, Shannon said. If their moms knew, they'd be horrified. But my son doesn't want me to tell them because it will just get worse.
(CNN) —\n\nNearly a year after a gunman massacred 17 students and staffers at a Parkland, Florida, high school, the political landscape on guns has shifted.\n\nDozens of lawmakers endorsed by the gun-safety group Everytown for Gun Safety now hold seats in the US House – many part of a freshman wave that helped Democrats seize control of the chamber in November's midterm elections. More than 20 states have passed some form of gun regulation in the last year, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. And a growing number of companies are risking customer backlash to link their brands to the gun-safety movement.\n\nGun-control advocates say nationwide student protests after Parkland – and the grim succession of mass shootings that have followed in the year since – all have spurred the further shift in gun politics. And they say a strategy adopted years ago – to follow a trail blazed by same-sex marriage advocates and take their fights to the states and corporate America – is paying off.\n\nIn the coming year, the gun debate could be thrust into the center of the looming 2020 presidential campaign like never before.\n\nFormer New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, one of the largest financial benefactors of the gun-safety movement, is considering entering the Democratic presidential primary. One early 2020 contender – New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who once earned an A-rating from the National Rifle Association as a moderate Democrat representing an upstate House district – already has spent part of her campaign rollout explaining her evolution on the gun issue to an increasingly progressive Democratic electorate.\n\nWe're heading toward a new era on guns, said Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at the centrist think tank Third Way and a former aide to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. I think the tables have turned on the NRA. The gun-safety organizations are just better and smarter than they used to be. They have a lot more resources than they have in the past.\n\nIn House races last year, groups and candidates promoting gun control spent an estimated $23.6 million on television campaign ads – more than three times the amount spent on ads opposing gun control, according to a Kantar-CMAG analysis prepared for CNN. That's a stark reversal from the 2014 midterms when anti-gun control ads outnumbered gun-control spots by nearly 5-to-1.\n\nLast year, the National Rifle Association's spending in federal races dropped sharply, following a record $54 million in 2016 contests, including $30 million to elect pro-gun President Donald Trump, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nGun safety is no longer the third rail of American politics, said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown, a Bloomberg-aligned group that plowed $30 million into the 2018 midterm elections for Congress. We've buried that myth.\n\nIn one of the latest examples of the growing corporate activism on guns, Blake Mycoskie, the founder of the California-based Toms shoe company, heads to Capitol Hill this week to deliver more than 700,000 postcards. They urge lawmakers to pass one of the first bills introduced by the new Democratic majority in the House: a measure that would impose background checks on virtually all gun sales.\n\nState battles\n\nBloomberg, who Forbes estimates is worth nearly $50 billion, launched Everytown partly in response to a 2012 mass shooting at a Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, where 20 young children and six adults died. Despite weeks of intense debate on Capitol Hill, congressional efforts on guns stalled.\n\nFeinblatt said Everytown took a cue from the architects of the marriage-equality movement, which chipped away at state restrictions on same-sex marriage until scoring a historic victory in 2015 when the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationwide.\n\nThe gun-safety movement did the same thing and is racking up win after win across the country in red, blue and purple states, he said.\n\nGun-control activists have helped pass background-check ballot initiatives in Washington and Nevada, along with a slew of new laws to disarm domestic abusers and allow family members and law enforcement officials to petition courts to temporarily remove firearms from people deemed a threat to themselves or others.\n\nIn Florida, then-Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, signed bills last year, in the wake of Parkland, raising the minimum age to purchase a gun to 21 from 18 and imposing a three-day waiting period on buying firearms. In neighboring Georgia, Democrat Lucy McBath, a gun-control activist who lost her son to gun violence in 2012, captured a Republican House seat once held by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich following $4 million in spending on her behalf by Everytown.\n\nThe group also saw 2018 wins in Nevada and Michigan, where Everytown spent $760,000 backing the campaign of Michigan's new Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. It said it spent $2.8 million supporting Steve Sisolak in Nevada, the first Democrat elected governor there since 1994. Sisolak defeated Republican Adam Laxalt, who as Nevada attorney general had opposed a 2016 Bloomberg-backed ballot initiative expanding background checks in the state.\n\nBoth states are crucial to Democrats' presidential ambitions: Michigan narrowly backed Trump in 2016 after going for President Barack Obama four years earlier. And Nevada, a perennial presidential swing state, hosts the West's first Democratic nominating contest in 2020.\n\nEverytown's activism means no candidate for president can go into those states and not talk pretty muscularly about the issue of gun safety, Feinblatt said.\n\nSeveral already have delivered impassioned calls to action against gun-rights forces.\n\nAt a CNN town hall last month, California Sen. Kamala Harris, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, lamented the failure of Congress to act on expanded background checks after Sandy Hook. She said lawmakers should have been forced to examine the autopsy photos of the babies killed at the school.\n\nAt her presidential campaign announcement Sunday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, declared she was not afraid to join the vast majority of Americans … to stand up to the gun lobby and advocate for universal background checks.\n\nBloomberg recently told the Associated Press that he will decide on a presidential bid by month's end. Through his activism on gun-safety issues, Bloomberg has built a substantial political operation.\n\nEverytown officials say it and its affiliates have 5.7 million supporters. In the last six months alone, the former mayor has attended 17 events in 15 states with volunteers from Moms Demand Action, Everytown's grassroots arm, his aides say.\n\nNo one has done more to lead on gun safety than Mike, his advisor Howard Wolfson said in a statement. Guns would undoubtedly be central to a Bloomberg campaign.\n\nUnder scrutiny\n\nThe NRA faces its own tests in the months ahead.\n\nThe organization is under increased scrutiny from Capitol Hill after alleged Russian spy Maria Butina pleaded guilty last December to attempting to infiltrate the association and other conservative groups before and after the 2016 election. Last week, two Democratic lawmakers, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse wrote to the NRA, demanding it provide more information about its activity to help Trump.\n\nAdvocacy organizations, including a gun-control legal group founded by former Arizona congresswoman and shooting victim Gabby Giffords, have filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission, alleging the NRA illegally coordinated its political advertising with Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and other Republican candidates. Those complaints followed media reports that raised questions about the NRA's relationship with what appeared to be shell companies purchasing ads.\n\nCampaign-finance laws bar outside groups from coordinating their spending activities with federal candidates.\n\nThe NRA complies with all election laws and any suggestion to the contrary is false, NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said in an email to CNN.\n\nAnd the NRA has argued in an ongoing lawsuit against New York state officials that it could be forced to curtail its operations if New York regulators persist with a crackdown that threatens its insurance and banking relationships.\n\nTo be sure, gun-rights groups have had gains in the last year, particularly in red states. NRA officials say 84% of the candidates it endorsed at the state level in 2018 won their elections.\n\nA recent law in Wyoming allows individuals to carry concealed weapons into places of worship. And last month, South Dakota's newly elected Republican Gov. Kristi Noem signed her first bill into law: an NRA-backed measure that allows residents and visitors to carry a concealed handgun without first acquiring a permit.\n\nAt the federal level, an ardent gun-rights advocate, Republican Marsha Blackburn, won an open US Senate seat in Tennessee last November. Two other Republicans favored by the NRA, Josh Hawley in Missouri and Mike Braun in Indiana toppled Democratic incumbents, helping expand the GOP's majority in the Senate.\n\nThose Senate victories have strengthened the NRA's firewall against any efforts in Congress to restrict access to guns, Baker said.\n\nWith (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi and her anti-gun minions in control of the House, we will see an uptick in PR stunts as the House passes every extreme gun-control measure under the sun, Baker said.\n\nBut the fact remains: They do not have 60 votes in the Senate or an anti-gun President in the White House, so their theatrics will be geared towards fundraising and establishing the most liberal records for the 2020 primary election instead of doing their jobs.\n\nNRA officials say the focus on the Senate – where Republicans have retained their power to confirm Trump's judicial picks – already has paid off with the Supreme Court's recent decision to take up a gun-rights case for the first time since 2010.\n\nThat case centers on whether a New York City gun law, restricting where licensed handgun owners can travel with their firearms, violates the Second Amendment. By tackling the issue, the high court's newly reinforced conservative majority may finally re-energize a Second Amendment that has been neglected for too long, the NRA said in a statement.\n\nThe court will hear those arguments in the next term, which starts in October.\n\nAnd despite recent gains by gun-control advocates, few political observers doubt the NRA's ability to rapidly fill its coffers as the 2020 presidential contest heats up. In a video last week, NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch singled out the candidacy of Harris, a former California attorney general, as representing an existential threat to the Second Amendment.\n\nLoesch then urged viewers to donate to the NRA, which she called the one organization powerful enough to disrupt the socialist plan to disarm America.\n\nSmart business?\n\nFor many people who joined the gun-control movement in the past year, Parkland was a defining moment. Survivors led hundreds of thousands of protestors in March for Our Lives rallies around the country a little more than a month after the shooting.\n\nAnd some businesses began to reexamine their policies. Dick's Sporting Goods, for instance, removed assault-style rifles from its Field & Stream stores and stopped selling guns to anyone younger than 21. Walmart raised the age to purchase firearms to 21 from 18. Last September, the iconic denim brand Levi Strauss pledged $1 million to groups working to curb gun violence and partnered with Bloomberg to build a coalition of business executives committed to working on gun control.\n\nAs a father, Mycoskie, the founder of Toms, said he had been shaken by the carnage in Parkland. Last November, however, the violence struck closer: 12 people were shot dead at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California, just 15 minutes from his home.\n\nThe following morning his wife, Heather, called him as he headed into Toms headquarters and said, 'I'm scared, and I don't want to take our (four-year-old) son to school today,' Mycoskie recalled in a recent interview.\n\nShe was very emotional and basically said that somebody has to do something about this.\n\nWithin weeks, Toms had committed $5 million to groups working on gun violence, including Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense, a grassroots arm of Everytown for Gun Safety. He launched a postcard-writing campaign on the Toms website and in its stores, urging Congress to pass universal background checks.\n\nMycoskie, 42, is no stranger to corporate activism. He started the shoe brand in 2006 with a mission of philanthropy and has donated shoes to more than 86 million people so far. The Toms eyeglass brand helps finance eyesight restoration; proceeds from its coffee-roasting operation help supply clean water in poor communities.\n\nJumping into the gun debate was a new risk, however. For starters, the company's internal polling shows its customer base divides equally between Republicans and Democrats, Mycoskie said.\n\nAnd corporations taking gun-safety stands have faced a backlash from gun owners and conservatives. Just last year, Georgia's Republican-controlled legislature blocked a tax break on jet fuel after Delta ended a discount-fare program with the NRA. (A few months later, then-Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, took executive action and halted collection of the tax.)\n\nWhat these corporations and billionaire politicians fail to realize is that the Second Amendment is in the hearts and minds of the American people, said Andrew Arulanandam, another NRA spokesman.\n\nBut for some companies, the benefits of reaching a new segment of shoppers could outweigh the downsides.\n\nMillennials, defined by the Pew Research Center as those born between 1981 and 1996, are poised to overtake Baby Boomers as the nation's largest living generation this year. CNN's 2018 exit polling shows the highest level of support for gun control measures – 66% – among younger voters between the ages of 18 to 29.\n\nThese generational differences underscore the upside potential on the gun issue for brands that appeal to a younger customer base, said Roger Beahm, executive director of the Center for Retail Innovation at Wake Forest University's School of Business.\n\nCorporations have a finger in the wind and they are looking down the road – what's the likely direction in the future? added Robert Spitzer, a political scientist at the State University of New York-Cortland, who has written five books on gun policy.\n\nMany have come to the conclusion that this a good step for them, precisely because it burnishes their social responsibility model, he said.\n\nMycoskie said Toms draws on mothers on the older edge of the millennial generation for the biggest share of its customers, and, so far, the reaction to its gun activism seems mostly positive. The company's review of social media found that about 75% of customers back the move, and about 12% oppose it strongly and say they will boycott Toms brands.\n\nIn theory, we lost about 12% of our customers, which is a big number in a business our size, he said.\n\nBut Mycoskie said direct, e-commerce sales are up about 21% – as people visit the website site to join the postcard campaign and start shopping while there. It's too soon, he said, to gauge the effect on wholesale orders, many of which were placed months before his background-check campaign began.\n\nWe knew going in that if it got positioned as a highly political, left-leaning act that it would be very bad for business, he said. But we felt like we had to take that risk because the other risk we have is that we are a brand that is completely built on standing for something.\n\nWhen things like this happen and we don't act, he said, then there's also a large group of our customers who will lose faith in us.\n\nCNN's Grace Sparks and Alison Main contributed to this story.
(CNN) — In September 1970 Jocelyne Nowaski was working as chief flight attendant on a Pan American World Airways flight from Paris to New York when her life changed forever.\n\nIn her two years at Pan Am the 23-year-old had made friends across the globe, served celebrities including Beatle Ringo Starr and featured with her coworkers in the pages of Paris Match magazine.\n\nPan Am layovers were spent exploring Morocco, on safaris in Nairobi, galloping on horseback on the beaches of Barbados, swimming in Liberia, and browsing the jewelry stalls of Beirut.\n\nAs she recalls it, her career happened almost by accident. Jocelyne had majored in biology at New York City's College of Mount St. Vincent, intending to become a doctor.\n\nBut right before graduation, a friend knocked on her dorm room and told her the luxury airline was interviewing for flight crew at its famous Manhattan skyscraper.\n\nHer friend insisted they should both try out, for a laugh.\n\nWhy not? agreed Jocelyne. She found herself recalling the glossy commercials: Your Pan Am stewardess knows her way around the world like you know your way around the block.\n\nTo become a Pan Am flight attendant, candidates needed a college degree, and to speak a second language. Jocelyne's mother was French-Canadian, so she ticked both boxes.\n\nShe was hired -- her friend wasn't -- and within weeks of graduating, followed by rigorous training, Jocelyne was working her first trip aboard a Boeing 727 to Nassau, in the Bahamas.\n\nJocelyne never became a doctor and never looked back.\n\nIt was the best job, she tells CNN Travel today. It wasn't a job; it was a labor of love.\n\nIn September 1970, love was the last thing on Jocelyne's mind. She'd ended a relationship with a pilot six months previously, and she was having a blast exploring the world with her girlfriends. Her focus was on her career.\n\nThat fall, increased worries about airplane hijackings following the events of September 6, 1970 led to plans for a formalized air security program\n\nIn the interim, fire-arm qualified individuals from organizations like the CIA and FBI were seconded and assigned onto flights.\n\nTraveling back to JFK from Paris in mid-September, Jocelyne recalls she and her crew were told that two security officers would be joining them: one in economy and one in first class.\n\nJocelyne in her uniform, including her gold wings. Courtesy Jocelyne Harding\n\nJocelyne was heading up the economy cabin as purser, and they were readying for takeoff. All the passengers had boarded the Boeing 707, a narrow-body airliner used by Pan Am from 1958.\n\nBut the security officers were late, much to Jocelyne's annoyance. She rolled her eyes even harder when she learned it was because they'd been buying Parisian scarves to impress girls back home.\n\nFinally arriving on board, the economy cabin security officer introduced himself. His name was Tyler Harding, smartly dressed in a suit and tie, a tan overcoat over one arm.\n\nRight away, Jocelyne recalls, she was struck by his charm and good looks, but she wasn't interested in a relationship and didn't think he was seriously interested in her.\n\nI was working with some Swedish girls and the Swedish girls were absolutely stunning, she laughs. I wouldn't even think of competing against them.\n\nTyler took his seat on the second to back row and the aircraft took off, bidding the Paris lights goodbye and setting off across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAir marshals are supposed to blend in, so Jocelyne served Tyler as she would any other passenger, but unlike every other passenger he tried to strike up a conversation every time she came over.\n\nHe was very flirty, Jocelyne recalls. I was not, because I thought: 'Oh, he's just doing this because he wants to talk to my colleagues.'\n\nThis suspicion -- plus the scarves -- made her wary. She kept her tone terse, even teasing him about his drink choice. He was very pleasant, in spite of my being snarky, she says.\n\nAs the aircraft started cruising over the ocean, Jocelyne and her coworkers began their dinner service. Tyler continued to engage her in conversation whenever she walked by.\n\nJocelyne and her Pan Am coworkers enjoyed their layovers in destinations across the world. Here they are on a safari in Nairobi. Courtesy Jocelyne Harding\n\nAfter she'd served the food, Jocelyne did her usual overview of the cabin. While walking down the aisles she glanced at Tyler. He wasn't looking at her at that moment. But she felt herself stop in her tracks, struck suddenly with a thought: I wonder what it'll be like to be married to him?\n\nShe recalls quickly shaking herself out of it. What are you thinking? You don't even know this man.\n\nBut Jocelyne couldn't explain it, even to herself. In that moment she'd been struck by this strange certainty that a future with Tyler was not only likely, but inevitable.\n\nSometime later, she was sitting up top of the plane on the jump seat, when Tyler sat down next to her. At which point he asked her out.\n\nI don't date passengers, she said. And you're probably married anyway.\n\nTyler pointed out he wasn't exactly a passenger, and when Jocelyne still looked unimpressed, he fished out his passport, which back then listed dependents -- or in his case, absence of them.\n\nHe was 29, the black print said, and a resident of Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nJocelyne was relieved, but still wary about dating someone she barely knew. Apparently sensing this, Tyler relented and returned to his seat.\n\nAs the airplane approached Long Island, edging closer to New York City, it was time for Jocelyne to do the last drinks service, carrying a teapot in one hand and a coffee pot in the other.\n\nShe got to Tyler, who requested coffee.\n\nAnd as I'm pouring the coffee in his cup, he looked up at me with those amazing blue eyes, recalls Jocelyne. Naturally, I poured the coffee into his cup. Unfortunately, at the same time I poured tea into his lap.\n\nMortified, Jocelyne grabbed cloth napkins from the back of the plane and handed them to him.\n\nTyler told her not to worry, but was laughing. Now you have to go out with me, he said.\n\nBlushing, Jocelyne dodged the question and went to confide in her friend Mala, who was the purser in first class.\n\nJocelyne Harding As I'm pouring the coffee in his cup, he looked up at me with those amazing blue eyes. Naturally, I poured the coffee into his cup. Unfortunately, at the same time I poured tea into his lap\n\nMala suggested they invite both the flight's security officers to a crew party she was planning at her Queens apartment after they landed.\n\nJocelyne agreed and returned to economy to tell Tyler and hurriedly pass on the address before making preparations for final descent.\n\nAfter landing, she couldn't spot him amid the crowd, and felt disappointed as she traveled from JFK to Mala's home. He was nowhere to be seen as the party got into full swing. Then the doorbell rang.\n\nIt was Tyler, with his fellow security officer in tow.\n\nIt took my breath away. It really did, says Jocelyne.\n\nRight away, the pair went to the kitchen and started chatting over cocktails.\n\nI was leaning against Mala's range with my back to the ring. He was standing in front of me and we must have talked for about three hours.\n\nThe pair discussed their childhoods -- hers in New York and his in California -- their families, dreams, travels, careers.\n\nThe only thing off the table was the true nature of his job -- Tyler couldn't reveal he worked for the CIA. She found that out later.\n\nTyler and Jocelyne ignored the hubbub of the party around them, chatting incessantly.\n\nAt the end of the evening, he looked at me, and he said: 'Will you marry me?'\n\nHer answer, she says, slipped out instinctively, in a moment of clarity and assurance. I said, 'Yes.'\n\nRelated content Mystery of 60-year-old Alaska tourist photos is solved\n\nGlobe spanning romance\n\nJocelyne and Tyler in December 1970, a few months after they met. Courtesy Jocelyne Harding\n\nAfter the party, Tyler and his colleague gave Jocelyne a ride back to her parents' home in New York, where she couldn't help but blurt out her fateful news.\n\nI just met the man I'm going to marry, she told her mother, who laughed.\n\nOh, you're crazy. It doesn't work that way, she said.\n\nBut the very next day Tyler called round to see Jocelyne and meet her parents, hitting it off with them too.\n\nNeither Tyler or Jocelyne had much time in New York City before they were heading on their next work trip -- he to Tehran and she to Rome.\n\nI can't actually marry you yet, Jocelyne told him, before he departed. That would be ridiculous.\n\nTyler just smiled and left his 1968 Mustang parked in her parents' driveway.\n\nIn Rome, Jocelyne had plans lined up with a man she'd been casually dating during her Italian layovers.\n\nHe had a whole weekend plan to take me in his sports car up the Amalfi Coast, she recalls.\n\nUpon landing in Italy, she called him up and, despite his protestations, told him she wouldn't be able to come after all.\n\nJocelyne in Rome, 1970. This photo was taken on the first leg of her trip, right before she met Tyler. Courtesy Jocelyne Harding\n\nInstead, she spent the weekend in Rome with Mala and her other Pan Am colleagues, walking around the city, throwing coins in the Trevi Fountain, and enjoying pasta dinners.\n\nWhen Jocelyne got back to New York, Tyler contacted her right away. Ostensibly, it was under the excuse he needed to collect his car, but they both knew that wasn't the real reason.\n\nThe two started dating, spending all their time together when they weren't traveling for work.\n\nThat October, just a few weeks after they met, Tyler asked Jocelyne to marry him -- again. This time, she said yes with certainty.\n\nThey told their parents on Thanksgiving, and on Christmas Eve 1970, Tyler met her at JFK with an engagement ring.\n\nJocelyne with her friend Mala (left) who was on board the airplane when Tyler and Jocelyne met. Courtesy Jocelyne Harding\n\nJocelyne and Tyler got married March 1971, at the chapel of the College of Mount St. Vincent. For their honeymoon they flew to Fiji, taking advantage of Jocelyne's Pan Am discount to travel first class and spend eight days relaxing.\n\nBack in the US, she moved to Alexandria, Virginia, where Tyler was based, but still flew out of New York.\n\nWe both travelled a lot, says Jocelyne. He went on assignment often for the CIA, and that first Christmas, I remember he was gone for three months on an assignment to Laos, and that was tough.\n\nWhen she could, Jocelyne tried to work round-the-world flights out of New York, so she'd be gone for weeks at a time too, traveling from New York to Tokyo and back.\n\nJocelyne and Tyler on their wedding day on March 28, 1971. Courtesy Jocelyne Harding\n\nAnd towards the end of Tyler's stint in Laos, she decided to surprise him with an unscheduled visit.\n\nI thought, 'I can't believe I'm doing this,' because there was a war going on there then. But I did, and I met him, and we came home together after his assignment. And from then on, it's just been a whirlwind.\n\nIn March 2021, Jocelyne, now 74, and Tyler, 80, will have been married for five decades.\n\nI can't believe it's 50 years already, she says. I can't believe it.\n\nRelated content They met on an airplane to Egypt then fell in love\n\nThe glamor of Pan Am\n\nJocelyne fondly recalls working on the first Boeing 747 flight between Paris and New York.

Regulations had just recently changed to allow married women to continue working as flight crew.\n\nBut she left the company in 1972, when Tyler's job transferred to Thailand.\n\nJocelyne said farewell to her wings with great sadness, but soon embraced the new adventure of a life in Southeast Asia, followed by a stint in Hawaii. The couple had their first child, a daughter, while living in Honolulu.\n\nTyler and Jocelyne then settled back in Virginia for a while, having a second daughter there, but before long they were living in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nThe kids loved it because we took them everywhere on weekends. We went to France, we went to all different parts of Germany, Switzerland, recalls Jocelyne.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the couple bought some farmland in Maryland from the uncle of one of Jocelyne's old Pan Am pals and built the home in which they live today.\n\nJocelyne's still in touch with many of her friends from that time, including Mala. She's part of World Wings International, the organization of retired Pan Am Flight attendants.\n\nWe still entertain like no one entertains, she laughs.\n\nRelated content Pan Am Boeing 377: The luxury airplane with beds in overhead compartments\n\nPan Am's glamorous reputation has lingered on, long after its last flight. That legacy is deserved, says Jocelyne.\n\nEverything was about making the customer happy and elegance on the plane, she recalls. We served the finest wines, the finest of everything. Paris Maxim's [the famed French restaurant] did our catering. It was elegant, it was special, people dressed up.\n\nJocelyne memorably worked the inaugural 747 flight between New York and Paris, a press flight where passengers sipped Moët Chandon Champagne and ate caviar from Tehran. That's when she was featured in Paris Match magazine.\n\nWe were interviewed when we got off the plane. It was terribly exciting, it really was. The 747 was amazing. I did love that plane, but I missed the ambiance of the 707.\n\nShe recalls her team were given special buttons promoting the 747, which they wore on their lapels. Uniforms were blue or tan, with Pan Am wings made of gold.\n\nAlongside their two daughters Jocelyne and Tyler now have five grandchildren. Everybody in the family loves travel, says Jocelyne, with one of their daughters spending two decades living in France, Istanbul and Warsaw, and the other taking a year out to backpack the world after graduation.\n\nJocelyne and Tyler pictured in 2014. Courtesy Jocelyne Harding\n\nThe pandemic has grounded the family in the US for now, but despite their decades of travel, Jocelyne and Tyler still have spots left on their must-visit list. For Jocelyne, it's Bhutan. For Tyler, it's Australia, where the couple have family.\n\nTyler now has some memory issues, but he still fondly recalls that momentous 1970 flight from Paris to New York.\n\nI saw this cute girl and she was kind of snotty to me, he says. But we talked after we got off and after that, we never stopped.\n\nIt's been an amazing journey I wouldn't trade for anything, says Jocelyne. She pauses and laughs.
Empire actor Jussie Smollett leaves Cook County jail following his release, Thursday, Feb. 21, 2019, in Chicago. Smollett was charged with disorderly conduct and filling a false police report when he said he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two men who hurled racist and anti-gay slurs and looped a rope around his neck, a police official said. (AP Photo/Kamil Krzaczynski)\n\nActor Jussie Smollett(C) and team arrive for a court hearing at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse on March 12, 2019 in Chicago. - A Chicago grand jury on March 8, 2019 indicted American actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony counts after allegedly lying to police about being the victim of a racist, homophobic hate crime. Police say Smollett -- who gained fame on Fox musical drama Empire -- staged the attack in a bid to gain publicity and a bigger paycheck.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nMy ex-boyfriend and I were walking home along Hollywood Boulevard late one night about 15 years ago, when, out of nowhere, we were blindsided by two men and their fists. It all happened so quickly, I don't actually remember how it began. My first memory is pushing off one guy and turning around to see my boyfriend on the ground being kicked by the other. They were shouting anti-gay slurs at us. I ran over to my boyfriend, yelling for the guy to get off of him. That's when either a boot or fist knocked me on the chin. I stumbled, dazed for a minute, and the next thing I remember was the blood pouring from my jaw onto the Walk of Fame.\n\nI believe the whole incident only lasted about a minute. Being one of the busiest streets in Los Angeles, other people quickly noticed and began to shout. The two men ran off. They didn't try to grab our wallets or phones. They just wanted to hurt us for being gay.\n\nOver the years, the memories of the attack became less frequent. To be honest, I don't remember the last time I thought about the incident until the Jussie Smollett story broke. Smollett, an actor who appeared on the Fox show Empire, told Chicago police he was attacked by two people who yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, tied a rope around his neck and poured an unknown substance on him.\n\nMy first instinct was to believe anyone who would make up these allegations because I, too, along with my ex-boyfriend, was attacked by two men. It happens. As the news progressed and the story unfolded, like the rest of the country, I was fascinated with the developments. Why would someone make this up? What possible reason could anyone have to want to be a victim of violence? And then, when he was arrested this week and police said he had falsified the attack, my intrigue turned to anger and disappointment.\n\nI've never considered myself a victim, although, I guess technically I am. Having grown up in the era of Matthew Shepard – the young man robbed, beaten and killed in 1998 for being gay – and hearing so many stories from friends about their own encounters with hatred and bigotry, I suppose I wasn't too surprised that I was victimized.\n\nBut I've also been lucky to see the changes we've made in society. I remember when Ellen DeGeneres came out, when Will & Grace premiered, when Massachusetts legalized gay marriage. I was the only gay kid out at my high school, but now there are LGBTQ groups at schools around the country. The progress we've made over the past 20 years is remarkable.\n\nEvery possible scenario I can come up with for why Smollett would make up something like this saddens me. It saddens me for real victims of crime, for minorities who have endured violence in the name of hate and for whatever issues he may personally be struggling with. While we've come a long way, there's still a lot of ignorance in this country, and I'm afraid Smollett's alleged actions may only help perpetuate that ignorance. The bright side is that there are two fewer hateful bigots in our country than first reported.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nMy attackers? They were never caught.\n\nIf the Smollett charges turn out to be true, I can only hope Jussie Smollett recognizes what he's done, apologizes for it and get the help he needs. I know this event will be with him for the rest of his life, just like the scar on my chin will be with me.
Beyoncé graced the cover of the coveted September issue of Vogue in August 2018. She oversaw all aspects of the spread which was shot by photographer Tyler Mitchell, the first African American photographer to land the cover in the magazine's 125-year history.\n\nIn June 2018 Bey and Jay surprised fans by dropping the Everything Is Love album which quickly had folks pouring over the lyrics for hidden meanings. The pair had already announced a stadium tour, OTR II, in March.\n\nIn June 2017 the singer and husband rapper Jay-Z welcomed twins Rumi and Sir Carter. She's seen here with the toddlers in July 2018.\n\nJay Z and Beyoncé arrive at the Met Gala in New York in May 2015.\n\nAt the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyonce was awarded with the Michael Jackson Vanguard Award, which is given to exemplary musicians who have made an incredible and long-lasting impact on pop culture. The singer accepted the award on August 24 from her husband, Jay Z, and daughter, Blue Ivy.\n\nAfter Jay Z's infamous scuffle with Beyonce's sister, the power couple faced numerous rumors that their relationship was on the rocks. But when they started their joint On the Run summer tour in Miami on June 25, they held a united front, playing their never-before-seen wedding video and showing footage of daughter Blue.\n\nJay Z and his sister-in-law Solange Knowles, right, reportedly had an altercation at a Met Gala after-party at New York's Standard Hotel in May 2014. Security camera footage that appeared on TMZ doesn't tell the whole story, but there are plenty of pictures of the rapper, Beyonce, and her sister leaving the party.\n\nTime magazine has praised Beyonce as an industry tastemaker. In April 2014, the magazine called Bey one of the 100 most influential people in the world.\n\nIn December 2013, Beyonce stunned fans by releasing a surprise visual album. The project was well-received and shot to No. 1, spawning platinum hits like the single Drunk In Love.\n\nIn May 2013, Beyonce was the subject of pregnancy rumors as observers noted that her dress to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala conveniently covered her midsection. The speculation grew stronger after she had to cancel a concert due to exhaustion and dehydration. She denied that she was pregnant.\n\nIn early April 2013, the singer and her husband were once again the subject of critical headlines when they took a trip to Cuba to celebrate their fifth anniversary.\n\nKelly Rowland, Beyonce and Michelle Williams reunited as Destiny's Child to perform during the Super Bowl XLVII Halftime Show on February 3, 2013, in New Orleans.\n\nAfter the inauguration dust-up, Beyonce had something to prove when she held a news conference for her Pepsi Super Bowl XLVII Halftime Show on January 31, 2013. After belting out The Star-Spangled Banner, the singer paused and turned to the press and asked: Any questions?\n\nBeyonce found herself at the center a firestorm in 2013 after it was revealed she used a backup track to sing the national anthem at the inauguration of President Barack Obama on January 21.\n\nJust months after giving birth, Beyonce was red-carpet ready at the Costume Institute Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York on May 7, 2012.\n\nWhen Beyonce's daughter with Jay Z, Blue Ivy, was born in 2012, the couple shared a photo of their newborn on their website. A hand-written note accompanying the photos reads, We welcome you to share our joy.\n\nIn 2011, Beyonce stole the show at the MTV Video Music Awards when she walked the red carpet and, with the careful placement of her hands, revealed that she was expecting. The star and husband Jay welcomed Blue Ivy in January 2012.\n\nAfter releasing another best-seller with 2006's B'Day and starring in Dreamgirls that same year, Beyonce was readying to release a third solo album, I Am ... Sasha Fierce when she took the stage at the 50th Grammy Awards Show on February 10, 2008. Somehow, she snuck in a secret marriage to Jay Z that April.\n\nAlthough her solo career had taken off by 2005, Beyonce still performed with Destiny's Child that year in Sydney on the heels of their 2004 album, Destiny Fulfilled.\n\nAt the 46th Grammy Awards Show in February 2004, she joined Prince on stage to perform a medley of his hits. She left the ceremony with five Grammys in hand.\n\nBeyonce was right back at the Super Bowl in 2004, performing the national anthem to kick off Super Bowl XXXVIII on February 1.\n\nThe singer is affectionately referred to as Queen Bey, not in the least because of her heralded work ethic, which is often put to good use on stage. Here, she performs during the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards in New York on August 28, 2003.\n\nHaving stepped out on her own, Beyonce presents the humanitarian award to Michael Jackson at the 2003 Radio Music Awards in Las Vegas on October 27, 2003.\n\nA decade before she wowed viewers at the 2013 Super Bowl Halftime Show, Bey jammed with Carlos Santana during the Super Bowl XXXVII Pregame Show in San Diego on January 26, 2003.\n\nIn November 2002, before they tied the knot, Jay Z and Beyonce fueled rumors that they were dating by becoming musical collaborators. Beyoncé appeared on Jay Z's 2002 single 03 Bonnie & Clyde, and he appeared on her single Crazy In Love the following summer.\n\nWhen Beyonce took the stage in Melbourne on April 29, 2002, she was just a year away from releasing her first solo album, Dangerously In Love.\n\nBeyonce performs with Kelly Rowland, left, and Michelle Williams -- the final version of the group that put her on the map -- for President-elect George W. Bush during a pre-inaugural event in Washington on January 19, 2001.\n\nIn 1998, Beyonce, second from right, was known simply as another member of Destiny's Child, a four-member girl group who released a self-titled debut that year and had a breakthrough with the remix of their single No, No, No, No.\n\nStory highlights Rachel Sklar: Beyoncé's pregnancy announcement is just what the world needed It reminds us that, even in the midst of this political chaos, joyous moments are still occurring everyday, she writes\n\nEditor's Note: Rachel Sklar is a writer and former lawyer based in New York. She is the founder of TheLi.st, a network and media platform for women. The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nBeyoncé sure knows how to get our attention.\n\nShe's done it again and again with her culture-stopping music, videos and and performances.\n\nAll The Single Ladies, which launched countless YouTube videos of toddlers dancing and one infamous Kanye West tirade. Or, how about when she asked Who run the world? (The answer: girls - a theme she would return to again and again). Striding out at the 2014 VMAs flanked by the giant word FEMINIST.\n\nRachel Sklar\n\nOther significant moments: Her 2013 self-titled visual album, stealth-dropped in late December and instantly required listening and viewing. Also, the revelation that was Formation. And her 2016 Superbowl performance (very popular with conservatives). Lemonade, the album that launched a thousand thinkpieces about her politics and identity (sample headline: Beyonce's 'Lemonade' Is an Anthem for the Retribution of Black Women.)\n\nThen, earlier this week, she added her announcement via Instagram - bedecked in flowers, a veil and her glorious fecundity - that she is pregnant with twins.\n\nPredictably, the Internet went bananas. Her post zoomed to most-liked-ever status inside a day. Twitter was beside itself with bee emojis and YASSS QUEEEN updates. The joy was palpable.\n\nJoy – and relief. Because, man did we ever need some good news.\n\nIt has been a rough few weeks in the news cycle (for people who care about democracy and due process and the welfare of their fellow humans).\n\nA breathless pace of executive orders attacking the environment, women, refugees, lawful visa-holders and US parks employees has led to record-breaking protests, an unrelenting call-your-Senator schedule and Jon Stewart channelling just how exhausted we all are. So we really, really needed something to feel good about.\n\nBeyoncé delivered that to us with her announcement, which was styled with the kind of bravado, exuberance and confidence that even a dude who lives in a solid-gold tower could never get away with. And she doubled down on it with a collection of photographs so resplendently gorgeous and near-otherworldly (I mean, just look at this one and this one, and this one) that it actually succeeded in not just distracting us from the dark craziness swirling around the country, but transporting us completely, if momentarily, into another (happier) world.\n\nThis is classic Beyoncé. Beyoncé, who flagrantly loves her body and demands that you respect it, now reminds us that it's a body that can march like a boss in heels but also swell with life and hope, sexy and powerful in all its forms. (And she does it while sitting on a throne of flowers, lest you forget she is the Queen.)\n\nIt is possible, of course, for Beyoncé's pregnancy to exist without reference to Donald Trump. He doesn't get to be part of every story, even as he barges into our every waking moment with new acts of cruelty or rule-flouting or self-aggrandizement or jaw-dropping ignorance. Even so, it's hard not to see a juxtaposition here. Trump's administration has focused on restricting, undoing, and upending. But Beyoncé is creating.\n\nThat was the theme of her photo collection. Called I Have Three Hearts, it was paired with a poem of the same name by the Somalian poet Warsan Shire, who also wrote the poetry in Lemonade – and who, I guess, would not be allowed to enter the United States.\n\nIt reads: There's life growing inside of me and I'm beside myself with dreams. In a real and visceral way, Beyoncé has reminded us that even in times that feel broken, we are vessels of power and glory and hope.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIs what I am saying over the top here? Maybe, but I found those images coupled with that poem to be profoundly moving as a mother and a feminist and, well, a human. I will leave the smart thinkpieces about the poem to other writers, (I'm looking at you, Melissa Harris-Perry) but one line in particular stands out to me: Flowers grow wherever.\n\nFlowers grow wherever. When the books are written about this period in time, I believe that will be an enduring theme – the hope that sprang up out of the chaos, and the real and visceral good that it created. Beyoncé just named it. Creators gonna create.
(CNN) A new bill in Utah that would have required students to learn about consent was shot down by lawmakers this week.\n\nThe proposal was defeated in Utah's House Education Committee by a vote of 7-4.\n\nCurrently, Utah's sex-ed curriculum requires educators to stress the importance of abstinence from all sexual activity before marriage and fidelity after marriage and stress personal skills that encourage individual choice of abstinence and fidelity.\n\nInstruction regarding the intricacies of intercourse or the advocacy or encouragement of the use of contraceptive methods is prohibited.\n\nSupporters of the bill argue that the addition of sex education classes that would teach consent would have been vital to the curriculum.\n\nDeveloping an understanding of consent and bodily autonomy can and will help your child be aware of their own body and make their own choices regarding it, as well as others, Ashley Freddie, president of We Will Utah, a state chapter of the non-profit We Will organization, told CNN affiliate KUTV in January.\n\nThe group aims focuses on sexual education and empowering survivors in an effort to help prevent sexual assault. They are among those fighting to not define sex education it as abstinence-only or comprehensive, KUTV reported.\n\nUtah Rep. Carol Moss told KUTV in January that she sponsored the bill after hearing from two Brigham Young University graduate students, who reached out as a result of their personal experiences and research that revealed that a high percentage of women in Utah are victims of sexual assault and/or unwanted sexual advances.\n\nBy giving young people the knowledge and skills to protect themselves from sexual violence, it will not only ensure that every child in Utah can be protected, Moss told KUTV, but consent education can also help them have healthy relationships.\n\nIn Utah, rape is the only violent crime that is higher than the national average, according to the Utah Department of Health\n\nIn a state where other violent crimes, such as homicide, robbery, or aggravated assault, is historically half to three times lower than the national average, this is of concern, the DOH writes on its website.
Gwyneth Paltrow may have dropped a big hint about her relationship status.\n\nStory highlights Paltrow's ex and her current beau were all smiles She and Martin split in 2014\n\n(CNN) —\n\nGwyneth Paltrow has yet to confirm reports that she is engaged, but she may have dropped a major hint.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress posted a photo Sunday of ex-husband Chris Martin and her reported fiancé Brad Falchuk smiling happily with the caption Sunday brunch #modernfamily.\n\nIt was reported last week that Paltrow and producer Falchuk had gotten engaged, but neither has gone public with the news.\n\nFans are viewing her latest Instagram as proof that Falchuk is about to become an official member of the family.\n\nPaltrow and Martin, the Coldplay frontman, decided to consciously uncouple in 2014 after 11 years of marriage and two children.\n\nShe and Falchuck – a divorced father of two – reportedly have been dating for more than three years. They are said to have met in 2010 on the set of the Fox series Glee, which Falchuk co-created and on which Paltrow guest starred as substitute teacher Holly Holliday.\n\nThe pair went public with their relationship in 2015 when she accompanied him on the red carpet for the premiere of the Fox show Scream Queens.
A version of this story appeared in the January 4 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday\n\n(CNN) The Oxford University/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine was added to the world's arsenal of Covid-19 shots when the first people received it outside of clinical trials in the United Kingdom this morning.\n\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine is the third to be rolled out in the Western world, after the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna inoculations. Health officials are hoping the AstraZeneca vaccine could be a game changer, especially for developing countries, because it is much easier to transport than the Pfizer vaccine which requires ultra-low temperatures.\n\nSo even as more vaccines come to the market, it is becoming clear that their rollouts are more challenging and slower than expected. Top health officials in the United States had repeatedly promised that 20 million people would have been given at least the first doses of a vaccine by the end of 2020. But as of Saturday, only 4.2 million people had been vaccinated , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nGovernment officials around the world are now looking at ways to stretch the vaccine supply. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already said it may be possible to yield six or even seven doses of the Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccines from the vials instead of the five indicated on the label, because the company overfills them. The FDA will consider this week giving half-doses of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine to people aged 18 to 55.\n\nIn the UK, the medicines regulator decided to delay second doses of the Pfizer vaccine in order to prioritize first doses. Separately, the UK government also suggested that while every effort should be made to use the same Covid-19 vaccine for both doses, it was permissible to use a different vaccine for the second dose if the same vaccine used for the first dose was not available, and if a person was high-risk or unlikely to return to the doctor for a shot. The idea raised concerns among experts, including the Doctors' Association UK.\n\nYOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED\n\nQ: If someone already had Covid-19, should they still get the vaccine?\n\nA: Yes. The immunity you get from contracting Covid-19 does last for a certain amount of time, but the nature of the vaccine should provide longer immunity, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.\n\nBoth the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna vaccines come in two doses: the first dose primes the immune system, and the second dose acts like a booster. That makes it a better option for obtaining immunity, Gupta said.\n\nSend your questions here . Are you a health care worker fighting Covid-19?

Now closures loom\n\nMillions of European children have suffered immensely during the pandemic, with months of confinement only giving way to some sense of normality when schools in most countries reopened in the summer and autumn.\n\nNow even that is under threat, Angela Dewan reports . Students in the UK were due to return from the Christmas break on Monday, but then the government announced a last-minute delay for almost all high schoolers and some younger children.\n\nIn Germany, schools switched back to remote learning in mid-December as infection numbers soared, with a decision on the way forward due on Monday. And in Ireland and Spain, teachers' unions and some local leaders are calling on federal governments to delay the return to school too.\n\nStudents practice social distancing measures at City of London Academy Highgate Hill on September 4, 2020 in London, England.\n\nUS Surgeon General says Covid-19 projections are 'scary'\n\nUS hospitals are fighting to stay on top of the surge of coronavirus cases pouring in around the country as the predicted holiday deluge worsens. Surgeon General Jerome Adams called on people to continue to take Covid-19 precautions . I want people to understand that if we get over this current surge, then things will start to get better but it depends on the actions that we all take right now, Adams said.\n\nAdams also said he has no reason to doubt the CDC's Covid-19 death toll , contradicting President Donald Trump's claim that the agency has exaggerated its numbers.\n\nData on new strains' response to vaccines expected this week\n\nWe should know this week whether the new coronavirus variant first identified in the UK might pose a challenge to vaccines , according to a World Health Organization official.\n\nScientists in the UK and elsewhere have taken blood from people who have been vaccinated and are testing it in the lab to see if the antibodies created by the vaccine protect against the new variant, said Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead for coronavirus response. They're also taking blood from people who have been infected with the new variant and testing it in the lab to see how well the vaccine works against it, she told CNN.\n\nScientists are also doing tests to assess the vaccine's efficacy against a variant found in South Africa.\n\nON OUR RADAR\n\nTOP TIP\n\nHow to stay healthy in cold weather\n\nWash your hands often.\n\nAvoid touching your face, something people do between nine and 23 times an hour.\n\nStay hydrated; eight glasses a day of water is a good goal, but that could be more or less depending on lifestyle and the size of the person.\n\nEat a well-balanced diet. Dark green, leafy vegetables are rich in immune system-supporting vitamins; eggs, fortified milk, salmon and tuna have vitamin D.\n\nStay physically active, even during the winter.\n\nClean the hard, high-touch surfaces in your home often.\n\nIf your nose or throat gets dry in the winter, consider using a humidifier.\n\nGet the flu vaccine.\n\nAnd one more important thing this year: When it's your turn, make sure you get the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nTODAY'S PODCAST\n\nThe in-silico methodology is actually a really widely used methodology, obviously, because it can hasten up the drug discovery process and lower the cost of drug discovery. -- Anika Chebrolu, 2020 winner of the 3M Young Scientist Challenge
Story highlights Many Republicans in Washington have withdrawn their support for Moore's candidacy Moore's combativeness has overshadowed his unyielding defense in two episodes that led to his removal from the Alabama Supreme Court\n\n(CNN) —\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Alabama's Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore have put Moore's veracity and character on the line. Last year, so did a special Alabama court that removed him from office.\n\nTrump, as he explained his support of Moore in the face of numerous sexual abuse complaints, emphasized that Moore said it didn't happen.\n\nHe denies it. Look, he denies it. …. He totally denies it.\n\nAt the heart of its decision to oust Moore was the court's unanimous view that he had not been credible when he denied ordering state probate judges to withhold licenses for same-sex marriages. The court focused on Moore's misleading statements and intentional omission. It said Moore's 2016 assertion that his actions and words mean something other than what they clearly express is not a new strategy. The unanimous nine-member court referred to Moore's arguments in 2003 – and an earlier ouster from the bench – related to a huge granite monument of the Ten Commandments he installed at the state courthouse.\n\nOn the national scene, this month's news of sexual abuse claims against Moore, including one by a then-14-year-old girl, have eclipsed earlier charges of a lack of integrity that cost Moore the chief justiceship.\n\nSeveral women have accused Moore, now 70 and running for the US Senate, of pursuing romantic relationships with them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. The Washington Post published the first set of accounts on November 9. Since then, other women have come forward with claims of sexual abuse. Moore has denied the allegations and said on Twitter after the initial Post account that he would NEVER GIVE UP the fight.\n\nTrump broke his silence on Moore last week as he stressed that Moore denies the sexual assault claims. Trump tweeted further support for Moore over Democratic opponent Doug Jones on Sunday. Moore, set to speak to fellow Republicans in Alabama Monday night, recently issued an ad with women vouching for him as a man of character.\n\nMoore and Trump have engaged in separate but similar counterattacks in the Senate race that could have great consequences for the chamber's partisan makeup and Republicans' ability to pass tax-overhaul legislation and other initiatives. Republicans currently hold just a two-vote majority in the 100-member Senate.\n\nMany Republicans in Washington, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have withdrawn their support for Moore's candidacy. If Moore wins on December 12, the chamber could become embroiled in expulsion efforts. That process would require a Senate Ethics Committee investigation and, to succeed, a two-thirds vote of senators.\n\nTrump faced claims of sexual harassment during the 2016 presidential election campaign. He has denied those accusations and called the women who accused him of sexual harassment liars.\n\nMoore's current combativeness has overshadowed his unyielding defense in the two episodes that led to his removal from the Alabama Supreme Court.\n\nHe first served as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court January 2001 until November 2003, when he was kicked off the bench for his willful refusal to obey federal and state court orders to remove a 5,280-pound stone monument of the Ten Commandments. He then was re-elected chief justice in November 2012 and took office in January 2013.\n\nMoore's truthfulness was especially an issue in the more recent episode, when he told probate judges not to perform same-sex marriages but then argued he had not. For his actions and statements in that dispute, the Alabama Court of the Judiciary found Moore guilty of six charges covering failure to uphold the independence and integrity of the judiciary and other breaches of impartiality and propriety.\n\nMoore declared at the time that the complaint against him was a politically motivated effort by radical homosexual and transgender groups to remove me as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court because of outspoken opposition to their immoral agenda.\n\nThe Alabama Court of the Judiciary, however, focused on Moore's explanation for a January 2016 order telling probate judges not to issues same-sex marriage licenses, even though the US Supreme Court in June 2015 had said same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry.\n\nMoore told the probate judges that the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges did not bind any people who were not a party to the case, and he declared, Alabama probate judges have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license.\n\nMoore later said he was providing a status update of the case. The Alabama Court of the Judiciary did not find that credible. It is clear to this court that Chief Justice Moore in fact took a legal position in the January 6, 2016 order the unanimous court said, despite his claim that he was not taking any such position. It also found Moore's use of case law in the order to probate judges incomplete, misleading, and manipulative.\n\nThe Alabama Court on the Judiciary highlighted an assertion by the commission that investigated Moore deeming his 2016 actions worse than the defiance that led to his 2003 ouster, because the order in this case, if complied with, would have put 68 probate judges in direct defiance of federal law.\n\nIn the earlier episode, a federal court said his installment of the Ten Commandments monument violated the US Constitution's prohibition against entanglement of church and state. Federal and Alabama courts ordered it removed. When Moore refused, the Alabama Court of the Judiciary cited him for defying court orders.\n\nThroughout that incident, Moore expressed no remorse and said repeatedly he would do it again.
The state House Judiciary Committee on Monday voted to advance HB 2467 , a bill that would amend the state's sexual battery law, according to committee assistant Kathi Rakestraw.\n\nKansas currently defines sexual battery as the touching of a victim who is not the spouse of the offender, who is 16 or more years of age and who does not consent thereto, with the intent to arouse or satisfy the sexual desires of the offender or another.\n\nThe proposed measure would remove the spousal exception from state law.\n\nThis is the second time in 12 months such a measure has been considered in the state Legislature. In 2019, an identical bill was floated, but it died in committee\n\nThis year's bill was introduced by Judiciary Committee Chair Fred Patton, a Republican, on behalf of last year's sponsor state Rep. Brett Parker, a Democrat, according to the House website.\n\nAccording to Patton, the House had a backlog of bills last year when the measure was originally introduced, so there was an effort to get the bill out of committee early in this new session.\n\nPatton noted that most bills take a week in committee but that members had taken action on this measure within four working days.\n\nWith this exemption on the books, it sends the wrong message that one can abuse their spouse and not be held accountable for it. As we heard in testimony, the current law is especially harmful for those in an abusive marriage. It is well past time that we remove this exemption, Patton said in an email.\n\nThe bill will head to a full House vote in the coming months.\n\nOur Judiciary Committee has spent a good deal of time over the past two years studying ways to effectively combat the horrific violence and abuse real Kansans sometimes experience in broken relationships. I'm looking forward to the entire House addressing such an important issue this session, House Majority Leader Dan Hawkins, a Republican, said in a statement.\n\nThe bill's advancement in the Kansas state House of Representatives was first reported by The Kansas City Star\n\nViolence and abuse have no place in any relationship. This is an important opportunity to make needed changes and bring Kansas law up to date, said Kansas House Speaker Ron Ryckman, a Republican, in a statement.\n\nThe bill is being hailed by advocates, like Kansas Coalition Against Sexual & Domestic Violence, a state organization dedicated to eliminating and preventing domestic and sexual violence. The coalition's executive director, Joyce Grover, told CNN in an email that the exact number of spousal sexual battery cases is unknown, as it is generally accepted that such crimes are underreported in the state.\n\nAccording to state law enforcement statistics , in 2018 only two incidents of spousal sexual battery were reported, an estimated 0.1% of the total for the state for the year -- though not all law enforcement agencies reported the relationships between the parties involved in sexual battery cases.\n\nHistorically, the crime of rape or sexual assault in marriage was not legally possible, as wives and children were generally the property of their husbands or fathers and, as property laws went, one can do what one wants with one's own property, Grover said.
The Rev. Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, who currently serves as a Democratic commissioner in Buncombe County and has long worked to advance LGBTQ rights in the South, made the announcement in a campaign video in which she attacked Cawthorn, pointing to his January 6 speech to supporters of former President Donald Trump, some of whom later participated in the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol.\n\nSome people will say a gay woman who's a Christian minister just can't get elected in the South, Beach-Ferrara said in the video. Not to mention, she's a Democrat. But I say an insurrectionist who flirts with Nazis and fires up a violent crowd to attack our democracy -- well, he shouldn't get reelected anywhere.\n\nThough Cawthorn handily won North Carolina's 11th Congressional District last year, Beach-Ferrara's announcement could mean a rising star of the conservative right will have to fight a costly reelection bid, as Democratic challengers like Beach-Ferrara have raised hefty sums of money in the past when they have taken on Republicans such as Cawthorn who have drawn the ire of national Democrats.\n\nThe congressman has been at the center of several controversies since his election last November, including one caused by a speech he gave at a pro-Trump rally on January 6. Beach-Ferrara's announcement comes as Cawthorn is facing allegations from former college classmates of sexual misconduct, which he has previously denied.\n\nCawthorn also faced backlash during his campaign for photos on his Instagram page showing him visiting Adolf Hitler's vacation house in Germany in 2017 and referring to the dictator as the Führer. After Cawthorn's opponent seized on the images, the then-candidate told WLOS News 13 that he denounces white nationalism, any kind of Nazism.\n\nCNN has reached out to Cawthorn's office for comment on Beach-Ferrara's announcement.\n\nAlready, the Democrat is working to raise funds, having shared a link in a tweet on Wednesday in which she wrote: Chip in to flip this seat blue and unseat Cawthorn.\n\nAfter the Capitol riot, Beach-Ferrara called on Cawthorn to resign in a column in the Asheville Citizen Times, writing that he should be removed from office if he refused to resign because he has violated his oath of office by helping to incite the attack.\n\nOn her campaign website, Beach-Ferrara says she will focus on childhood education, combating the opioid crisis and expanding opportunities for small businesses.\n\nIn 2011, Beach-Ferrara founded the Campaign for Southern Equality, an LGBTQ rights group that has worked to advance marriage equality and increase health access and resources for the LGBTQ community in southern states. Her work with the organization has at times seen her participate in national debates on the issue, including in 2015, when the group filed an amicus brief in the Supreme Court's landmark same sex marriage case. The group argued that gay and lesbian people in the South do not possess political power to achieve equality through the legislative process and urged the justices to act quickly to ensure the freedom to marry across the nation.\n\nI felt a calling, so I got ordained, Beach-Ferrara, who is a minister in the United Church of Christ, said in the campaign video. We took the campaign for marriage equality to small towns all across the South because I believe love wins everywhere and every time.\n\nThe Democrat also serves as a chaplain for Echoing Green, a fellowship program that works to engage in various social issues through funding operations for social innovation.\n\nBeach-Ferrara graduated from Brown University in 1998 with a degree in English before earning an MFA from Warren Wilson College in 2001 and a Master of Divinity from Harvard University in 2010, a biography that contrasts sharply with Cawthorn, who left college before completing a degree, and who at age 25 is the youngest member of Congress.
Laconia, New Hampshire (CNN) Pete Buttigieg isn't known for showing emotion. But on Tuesday, minutes after the first tranche of delayed Iowa caucuses results gave him a narrow lead, he choked up.\n\nThe former South Bend, Indiana, mayor was visibly emotional here in New Hampshire as he reflected on what his success in Iowa -- as the first top tier gay candidate from a major American political party -- could mean to LGBTQ youth across the country.\n\nThis validates the idea that we can have a message, the same message, connect in urban and rural and suburban communities, that we can reach out to Democrats, and to independents, and even to some future former Republicans, ready to bring change to this country, Buttigieg said.\n\nThen Buttigieg's voice started to shake.\n\nThis validates for a kid somewhere in a community wondering if he belongs or she belongs or they belong in their own family, that if you believe in yourself and your country, there is a lot backing up the belief, he said.\n\nButtigieg was joined at the end of his town hall by husband, Chasten Buttigieg. The two embraced on stage to cheers.\n\nButtigieg, in an interview with CNN in New Hampshire on Tuesday, struck that same tone.\n\nIt's extraordinary, he said of his slim lead. It also, I hope, means something to a lot of people wondering if they fit in, people who are different, people who don't know if they belong in their community, or in their family. This is a proof you can believe in yourself and in your country.\n\nButtigieg, who came out in an op-ed in 2015, has reluctantly embraced his unlikely role as a symbol of LGBTQ progress. While he speaks about it across the country, it is not central to his candidacy, nor is it something that regularly comes up at events.\n\nStill, Buttigieg's identity and his campaign have been inextricably linked. Earlier in his run, the mayor often fielded questions about being gay and running for president, and some of his most notable early campaign moments focused on the historic nature of his candidacy.\n\nThe former mayor told an audience in April that, If you had shown me exactly what it was that made me gay, I would have cut it out with a knife.\n\nIf you could have offered me a pill that could make me straight, he added, I would have swallowed it before you could give me a swig of water.\n\nButtigieg also wrote in his pre-campaign memoir that he worried that his coming out would define him beyond what he had accomplished in his young life.\n\nI had strongly supported the causes from the beginning, but did not want to be defined by them, he wrote of LGBTQ rights.\n\nAnd while his identity doesn't come up in every event, some of Buttigieg's most well received lines have been about being gay and his marriage to Chasten, whom he wed in 2018.\n\nSitting down to Christmas dinner at the side of my husband, whose marriage to me, our family -- not its well-being, but its existence -- comes by the grace of single vote on the United States Supreme Court, Buttigieg said in December 2018, just a month before he started exploring a presidential run.\n\nAnd as the Iowa race came to a close, Buttigieg often heralded the fact that same sex marriage was legalized in Iowa in 2009.\n\nI was also not here, but watching, when Iowa took a step that filled me with a lot of hope, Buttigieg said. It was a step that gave me permission to believe that one day, I could wear this wedding ring, that's on my finger.\n\nThe mayor has also used his identity as a way to answer a key question to voters: How will you handle attacks from Donald Trump?\n\nButtigieg, in response, often touts that he grew up gay in Indiana as a proof of his mettle on the campaign trail. And the line usually gets the audience to laugh.\n\nBut this moment on Tuesday is markedly different. Democrats like Annise Parker, the head of the Buttigieg-backing Victory Fund and the former mayor of Houston, heralded the lead as a step forward.\n\nPete's strong showing in Iowa represents a revolution in American politics, upending traditional notions of electability and proving America is ready to elect its first openly gay president, Parker, who was one of the first gay mayors of a major US city when she was elected in 2010, said. With defeating Donald Trump top of mind, Iowa voters determined Pete is the best candidate to do it, a powerful statement about our progress as a country as this primary season begins.

The baker argues, in part, that his cakes are his artistic expression and the government can't compel his speech.\n\nFirst Amendment principles are on the docket in cases concerning the free-speech implications of an abortion regulation in California, so called fair share fees at public sector unions, a Minnesota law that bans voters from wearing ideological clothing at polling places and a retaliatory arrest claim out of Florida. They will also hear two different cases touching on the free speech implications surrounding political gerrymandering.\n\nAll eyes will be on Justice Anthony Kennedy. The possibility of Kennedy resigning hangs over the entire court term, but he in particular has been a fierce supporter of free speech rights and is sometimes the swing vote between the four conservatives and four liberals on the court. It is possible he would want to make a mark on the future of the First Amendment before he leaves.\n\nThe court's interest also comes as President Donald Trump has triggered a broader debate on the implications of free speech. Trump has been engaged in a battle of epic proportions with the press, complaining of fake news and unfair coverage of him and the White House. With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country! Trump tweeted recently.\n\nCandidate and now President Trump has made a number of statements about the reach of the First Amendment – at times using it both as a shield and a sword – but by the end of this term the Supreme Court will have the final word the contours of the First Amendment at least in a number of important areas, said Jessica A. Levinson, who teaches constitutional law at the Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.\n\nThe First Amendment reads that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\nUniting the cases is a desire on the part of justices to more clearly define the outlines of free speech. All the cases fall broadly under the First Amendment, and they touch on different areas, Levinson said. But what unites them is the desire on the part of at least four justices to clearly define the contours of free speech and free expression in our society.\n\nRole of Anthony Kennedy\n\nOne reason for the sheer number of cases may have less to do with the individual issues and more to do with the interests and jurisprudence of Kennedy, who plays a critical role on the court and often casts the deciding vote or crafts the final language of a key opinion, said Frederick Schauer, an expert at the University of Virginia School of Law.\n\nGiven that Justice Kennedy has longstanding sympathy for free speech claims, and that other justices are especially interested in free speech issues, the good lawyer will try to frame (or bend) the facts and law of his or her case to make it a First Amendment case, Schauer said in an interview.\n\nIndeed, lawyers for Masterpiece Cakeshop baker Jack Phillips, who refused to make a cake to honor the wedding of a same sex couple because of his religious objections, brought both free exercise and free speech claims to the high court. During oral arguments, they put more emphasis on their free speech claim.\n\nThe First Amendment prohibits the government from forcing people to express messages that violate religious convictions, said Phillips' lawyer Kristen K. Waggoner. She said that Colorado ordered her client to sketch, sculpt, and hand paint cakes that celebrate a view of marriage in violation of his religious convictions.\n\nSome court watchers suspect that Kennedy, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, may step down at the end of the term next summer, and the cases could give him one last chance to make a mark on how the First Amendment is interpreted.\n\nRELATED: Anthony Kennedy loves his job – and he's still here\n\nEarlier this year, Kennedy spoke passionately about free speech when he wrote to strike down a North Carolina law that made it a felony for a registered sex offender to access a commercial social networking Web site where the sex offender knows that the site permits minor children to become members or to create or maintain personal Web pages.\n\nWith sweeping language, Kennedy wrote to foreclose access to social media altogether is to prevent the user from engaging in the legitimate exercise of First Amendment rights.\n\nKennedy said the law had gone too far restricting cites like Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin. It is unsettling to suggest that only a limited set of websites can be used even by persons who have completed their sentences. Even convicted criminals – and in some instances especially convicted criminals – might receive legitimate benefits from these means for access to the world of ideas, in particular if they seek to reform and to pursue lawful and rewarding lives.\n\nHe noted that the case was one of the first to address the relationship between the First Amendment and the modern internet.\n\nBy prohibiting sex offenders from using those websites, North Carolina with one broad stroke bars access to what for many are the principal sources for knowing current events, checking ads for employment, speaking and listening in the modern public square, and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge, he wrote.\n\nRELATED: Supreme Court decision is 'a constitutional coming out party' for social media\n\nThe opinion was 8-0 but Justice Samuel Alito, joined by the conservatives on the bench (Justice Neil Gorsuch did not participate) wrote separately to distinguish themselves from some of Kennedy's language, saying it went too far.\n\nAlito agreed the law was staggering in its reach and violated the First Amendment, but he worried about what he called the majority opinion's unnecessary rhetoric. Kennedy's language, Alito wrote, is bound to be interpreted by some to mean that the states are largely powerless to restrict even the most dangerous sexual predators from visiting any internet sites, including, for example, teenage dating sites and sites designed to permit minors to discuss personal problems with their peers.\n\n03:11 - Source: CNN Hear Supreme Court arguments about cakeshop\n\nCalifornia Abortion Notices\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom, the conservative organization that represents Phillips, is also behind an abortion-related case that the justices will hear next year. The National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, a crisis pregnancy center, opposes a California law that requires them to disseminate information about the availability of state run programs that provide abortion.\n\nCalifornia now forces licensed centers to communicate the government's message about state-funded abortions to everyone who walks in the door, the group argued in court papers. The state, they said, does not impose such compelled statements to health providers that provide or promote abortion or abortificacients.\n\nThe only ones forced by the state to speak these government messages are those who oppose abortion, they wrote.\n\nBoth Masterpiece and the NIFLA cases involve government coercion of private speech, that's the theme that runs through these cases, said David Cortman, another lawyer at the Alliance Defending Freedom.\n\nLawyers for California say the law was passed in part because some 700,000 California women become pregnant each year and over half of the pregnancies are unintended. The law, they argue, addresses problems including the fact that many women who cannot afford medical care are unaware that public programs are available to them.\n\nUnion Fees and political support\n\nThe justices will also hear a case that concerns whether non-members of public sector unions can be required to pay so called fair share fees germane to collective bargaining.\n\nCourt precedent holds that while a non-union member does not have to pay fees that go to political activities, that exemption does not include fees for issues such as employment conditions and employee grievances.\n\nThe case is brought by Mark Janus, an Illinois public sector employee who argues that the fair share fees violate his First Amendment rights.\n\nIt is a bedrock principle that, except perhaps in the rarest of circumstances, no person in this country may be compelled to subsidize speech by a third party that he or she does not wish to supportJanus' lawyers argue.\n\nUnions are carefully watching this case, fearful that the conservative majority of the court is set to overturn precedent and rule in favor of Janus.\n\nPhotos: Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy PHOTO: Eric Thayer/Getty Images Anthony Kennedy, the longest-serving member of the current Supreme Court, has announced that he will be retiring at the end of July.

Prev Next\n\nPartisan gerrymandering\n\nTwo of the biggest cases of the term concern the issue of partisan gerrymandering and how far politicians can go when they manipulate district maps for partisan advantage. The court has already heard one challenge brought by Democratic voters in Wisconsin who charged that after the last census Republican legislators drew maps unconstitutionally to benefit Republicans.\n\nLawyers for the challengers argued in part that the new maps contravene the First Amendment by penalizing these voters because of their political beliefs.\n\nThat the government may not punish or suppress speech based on disapproval of the ideas or the perspectives the speech conveys is a fundamental principle of the First Amendment, Paul M. Smith, a lawyer for the Democratic voters, argued in court briefs.\n\nWhile Smith also made claims concerning equal protection, it was the free speech aspect that seemed to attract Kennedy at oral arguments.\n\nSuppose the Court, he said, decided that this is a First Amendment issue.\n\nIn somewhat of a surprise, the court announced last week that it would hear another partisan gerrymander case out of Maryland. It's still unclear exactly why justices decided to add the case to the docket when it is already hearing the Wisconsin case.\n\nANALYSIS: Here are the most obscenely gerrymandered congressional districts in America\n\nT-shirts and retaliatory speech\n\nThe court will also hear a case about political apparel at the polling place.\n\nAndy Cilek, a Minnesota voter and executive director of the Minnesota Voters Alliance, was temporarily blocked under Minnesota law from voting because he was wearing a T-shirt that stated Don't Tread on Me at a polling place.\n\nAlthough this court has permitted campaign-free zones that prohibit campaign materials and active solicitation, it has never endorsed a ban on all political speech, lawyers for the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, who are representing Cilek, argued in court papers.\n\nLawyers for the state had urged the Supreme Court to stay out of the case and leave in place a lower court opinion that went against Cilek.\n\nThe court of appeals' legal conclusion that the interior of a polling place is a non-public forum in which speech restrictions are constitutional as long as they are reasonable and viewpoint neutral is the same conclusion reached by every court that has analyzed the issue, wrote Daniel P. Rogan of the Hennepin County Attorney's office.\n\nAnd the justices will hear a free speech case about retaliation sometime next year.\n\nFane Lozman is a critic of redevelopment efforts in Riviera Beach, Florida. During the public comment period at a City Council meeting in 2006, a presiding officer ordered his arrest. After the state's attorney declined to prosecute, Lozman brought suit arguing in part that his free speech rights were violated when the city retaliated against him for having criticized the government.\n\nChristine Farley, from American University Washington College of Law, is anxious to see what will change by the end of the term. She says that although the court, in general, is seen as having a pro-speech bent, that is not always the case.\n\nThe court protected disparaging trademarks, but not offensive license plates. It protected false claims to military medals, but not government whistleblowers' claims, she said.\n\nLevinson agreed it will be an interesting year.\n\nFor First Amendment scholars, this is like drinking water from a fire hydrant, she said.

(CNN) The Methodist Church added united to its name after merging with another denomination in 1968. But for much of the past 52 years, unity has proved elusive.\n\nThat's been especially true at meetings of the church's top legislative body, the General Conference, where factions have fought for decades about sexuality and Scripture. After the church strengthened its bans on partnered LGBTQ clergy and same-sex marriage last year, many Methodists argued that a split was likely inevitable.\n\nThe situation here has become so toxic that the church was basically dysfunctional, said the Rev. Keith Boyette, leader of the conservative Wesleyan Covenant Association.\n\nLast week, Boyette was one of 16 United Methodist leaders to propose a divorce decree for their church. With the help of a renowned mediation lawyer, conservatives, liberals and centrists gathered in secret for months, sweating the details of a pact they hope will split the church without producing messy and expensive lawsuits.\n\nJan Lawrence, head of the pro-LGBTQ Reconciling Ministries Network, called the deal imperfect, but said it will end the othering and marginalization of parts of God's creation.\n\nWhile presenting their proposal last week, Methodlst leaders offered themselves as an example to a polarized country. Look how we agreed to disagree and walk away, they said.\n\nOther Methodists agree: Only lawyers like costly lawsuits. But some also wonder how dividing the church could be a good thing.\n\nThe United Methodist Church is one of the few places in American life where people as different as Hillary Clinton and Jeff Sessions can share the same pew. If the proposed schism is approved, that likely won't be true anymore.\n\nMore churches are breaking in two over LGBTQ issues\n\nIn recent decades four of the seven traditional mainline Protestant denominations have split up over homosexuality or related issues, such as the interpretation of Scripture and frustrations over rehashing the same debate for decades.\n\nThey read like an alphabet soup of American religion: The American Baptist Churches USA, the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Presbyterian Church USA.\n\nReligious historians say we haven't seen so many church schisms since 19th-century debates over slavery, when denominations split into Northern and Southern branches.\n\nAnd the current breaks over homosexuality could be just the early tremors of an earthquake that will scatter the country's entire Christian landscape, some scholars argue.\n\nThe mainline Protestants are like the shock troops, said James Hudnut-Beumler, a professor of religious history at Vanderbilt University. They absorb the first body blows. But as the mainline goes, so more conservative and evangelical will go eventually.\n\nSome mainline churches are going through an identity crisis\n\nSo what is a mainline Protestant, why are they fighting, and why do I care if they break up?\n\nAccording to some historians, the term mainline derives from the suburbs outside Philadelphia, which, like a lot of towns in America, built churches along its major thoroughfares, aka the mainline.\n\nThese Baptists, Episcopalians and Presbyterians dominated American life in the 20th century. They were old, established and largely centrist.\n\nAlyss Swanson, a transgender United Methodist deacon from California, speaks with Bishop Samuel Quire of Liberia during the General Conference of the United Methodist Church in February 2019.\n\nBut mainline Protestant denominations have declined for decades. The pastors and church leaders considered themselves custodians of the culture, and for many years they were. And then the culture changed.\n\nNow some mainline denominations are going through an identity crisis, said Maria Erling, a professor of church history at United Lutheran Seminary.\n\nIf you try to be welcoming and open to all people, the question becomes: Who are you? What are you offering? she said.\n\nAt the same time, mainline Protestant birth rates are declining, baptisms have dropped and the pews are filled with grey hairs, if they filled at all. According to one study , less than 4 in 10 millennials raised in a mainline Protestant church stay there.\n\nThe benefits of breaking up\n\nConservatives have been leaving, too, founding or joining more theologically traditional denominations.\n\nIn 2009, conservative Episcopalians broke away and founded the Anglican Church in North America after decades of debate over LGBTQ clergy.\n\nThe new denomination, which does not ordain LGBTQ pastors or allow same-sex marriages, is small. It has about 134,000 members, while the Episcopal Church has 1.5 million.\n\nBut it is adding new members and congregations nearly every year, said the Rev. Andrew Gross, a spokesman for the Anglican Church in North America.\n\nSome churches and dioceses are still battling the Episcopal Church in court over church property. But for the most part, Gross said, they have moved on.\n\nHonestly, we don't spend a lot of time thinking about the past or fighting old battles anymore, he said.\n\nAn LGBTQ flag flies over Union United Methodist Church in Boston on January 5, 2020.\n\nLiberals who remained with their home denomination seem just as relieved to have laid down their swords.\n\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Church of America fought about allowing LGBTQ clergy for decades before finally voting yes in 2010. Thousands of conservatives then defected to form a new church.\n\nWithout those conservatives in the fold, liberal Lutherans were able to make major moves in the church's last General Synod, voting to declare itself the country's first sanctuary church body for immigrants. It's the kind of bold step that would have been thwarted or put off to deal with sexual issues at past synods, Lutherans say.\n\nSo there is a benefit to breaking up. Both sides seem happier, more focused on their missions and less concerned with internal battles.\n\nBut any time a church as big as the United Methodist Church threatens to disintegrate before our eyes, it's worth asking what's lost.\n\nThere's value in worshiping beside someone who's different\n\nIf the Methodist proposal is approved at this summer's General Conference in Minneapolis, it would be by far the largest Protestant schism in decades.\n\nAs many of 30% of the church's US members and 80-90% of Methodists in Africa and Asia could leave the United Methodist Church for the new conservative denomination, Boyette told CNN. That would drastically reduce the church's roll of 12.5 million members, about 7 million of whom live in the United States.\n\nProtestants, born of a split with the Catholic Church, are pretty well-practiced at spiritual break ups. There are 47,000 Christian denominations in the world, by one estimate, including dozens of Methodists branches in the United States. Protestants gonna protest, you know?\n\nAnd denominations, despite their functionality, get a bum rap. Nobody likes a bureaucracy, even if helps connect and pool resources for charities around the world. And for generations, big-tent denominations like the Methodist Church helped hold the country together.\n\nShelby Ruch-Teegarden, center, joins other protesters during the United Methodist Church's special session of its General Conference in St. Louis on February 26, 2019.\n\nNow, online and in real life, we seem to only want to associate with like-minded people, clustering into our dissent-free echo chambers.\n\nChurches can force us out of those bubbles, helping us connect across all kinds of social, political and racial barriers. There's value in worshiping next to someone different from you.\n\nThere's also a spiritual reason to lament Christian divisions, said Will Willimon, a bishop in the United Methodist Church and theologian at Duke Divinity School.\n\nIn the Garden of Gethsemane, just before he was crucified, Jesus prayed that his followers would live as one. Every new denomination -- even the Protestant Reformation itself -- can be seen in some ways as a failure, a step away from that prayer, said Willimon.\n\nI wonder in the present moment, if Jesus Christ is looking at us and saying, 'Look at what you all are fighting over now.'

Hong Kong (CNN Business) British tabloids are hammering Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and her husband Prince Harry after their explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey.\n\nMeghan revealed during the sit-down conversation that life within the royal family was so isolating, lonely and lacking in support that she had experienced suicidal thoughts. She also said that individuals within the institution had raised concerns about the color of their son Archie's skin.\n\nEven before the interview — Meghan's first since she and her husband announced plans to step back from senior roles in the British royal family — the UK media had been criticizing the event. The relationship between the couple and the country's press, and particularly newspaper tabloids, has long been tumultuous\n\nThe Daily Mail ran wall-to-wall coverage of the interview, and tried to fit all of the bombshells into a single headline this way: Meghan claims she was suicidal when she was 5 months pregnant, Kate made HER cry and Royals refused to make Archie a prince because they were worried how 'dark' he would be, as Harry reveals their new baby will be a GIRL. The website was dominated with coverage, including at least 13 articles about the interview that included photos.\n\nThe interview aired Sunday on CBS during primetime US hours, and 1 a.m. local UK time.\n\nThe tabloid's website also included a prominent banner that read: I WANTED TO KILL MYSELF, and featured a clip playing on loop from the interview, which showed Meghan saying, with subtitles: I just didn't want to be alive anymore.\n\nAnother article on the website ripped into the couple's discussion during the interview about life in the United States, where they are raising chickens.\n\nBack to basics at their $14.5 million mansion, read one headline.\n\nMonday's print edition of the Daily Mail, meanwhile, highlighted the allegations about concerns of Archie's skin color: MEGHAN ACCUSES PALACE OF RACISM, the front page of Monday's edition of the Daily Mail read. While other news outlets used images provided by Harpo Productions, Winfrey's production company, the Daily Mail chose a closely cropped image focused on Meghan's face.\n\nThe deluge of stories on the Daily Mail homepage follows a dismissive pre-interview banner headline earlier on Sunday, in which the outlet attempted to lambast the CBS special as a sideshow.\n\nOther newspapers were also quick to weigh in on the potential fallout of the interview.\n\nMeghan Markle may never return to Britain after angering Royal Family with bombshell Oprah interview, The Sun newspaper wrote , referring to Meghan's name before marriage. It cited insiders [who] fear she and Prince Harry could have burnt their bridges by failing to tell family members what was in the two-hour chat before it was shown.\n\nThe publication has come up with a new nickname for Meghan amid her rift with the royal family: Megxile. Previously, British tabloids have labeled the couple's decision to step away from their royal duties Megxit, a riff on the term used to describe the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union.\n\nQueen: Duty and family unite us, read the front page of the Daily Express newspaper. That's public service for you, Harry and Meghan ... NOT a self-serving TV chat with Oprah.\n\nEven ahead of the program, British tabloids came armed for the occasion, which was among the biggest royal interviews in decades.\n\nOn Monday, the Daily Mirror's print edition will point to Princes Charles & William's 'immense sadness' amid Oprah interview fallout, Sky News reported\n\nBoth the duke and duchess have increasingly opened up about the harsh media scrutiny they have received.\n\nLast month, Prince Harry told late night talk show host James Corden that his experiences had prompted him to take a step back from the royal family. We all know what the British press can be like, and it was destroying my mental health, he said\n\nAnd in April of last year, Harry and Meghan said they would cut off all dealings with four of the United Kingdom's biggest tabloid newspapers after years of strained relations . The couple has also tussled with the media in court\n\nIn the interview with Oprah on Sunday, Meghan said that it had become painfully clear that there were double standards in how the media covered her and Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge and wife to Prince William, who is second in the line of succession to the British throne.\n\nI can see now what layers were at play there. And again, they really seemed to want a narrative of a hero and a villain, said Meghan.\n\nCoverage of the interview with Meghan and Harry was not limited to the tabloids. British morning shows and broadsheets also featured excerpts prominently on Monday.\n\n-- Brian Stelter contributed to this report.
(CNN) Ellen DeGeneres was honored on Sunday with The Carol Burnett Award at the Golden Globe Awards and the comedian, who knows first-hand the way television can change people's lives, used her time to pay tribute to the power of the medium.\n\nAll I've ever wanted to do is make people feel good and laugh, and there is no greater feeling than when someone tells me that I've made their day better with my show, or that I've helped them get through a sickness or a hard time in their lives, she said. But the real power of television, for me, is not that people watch my show, but people watch my show and then they're inspired to go out and do the same thing in their own lives. They make people laugh or be kind or help someone that's less fortunate than themselves.

The Governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his State of the State address in February. Governor Abbott was joined for the press conference by Senator Paul Bettencourt and Representative Briscoe Cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in Texas\n\n(CNN) —\n\nEditor's Note: This story was originally published on February 8. The headline has been updated to reflect Amazon's February 14 announcement that it is canceling plans for a New York headquarters amid an ongoing political backlash.\n\nLanding Amazon HQ2 was supposed to be a big win for Democrats who run New York, but instead it's turned into a monstrous headache that's exposing deep political fissures inside the party.\n\nOne one side is Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who joked he'd change his name to 'Amazon' to win the company's business, and Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nOn the other is freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who on Friday declared victory amid reports that the company might be having second thoughts – and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who suggested that Amazon doesn't really need any more tax breaks.\n\nThe Amazon deal is the odd issue in US politics that can tie de Blasio and Cuomo together on one side, and Bloomberg and Ocasio-Cortez on the other.\n\nIt turns out that what some Democrats call economic improvement, others see as corporate charity.\n\nTo recap, the Internet behemoth promised billions of dollars in new tax base, tens of thousands of high-paying jobs and the honor of being home to HQ2.\n\nPolicymakers nationwide were eating from the Internet giant's hands and falling over each other to sweeten Amazon's pot with tax breaks and infrastructure improvements, all but begging Jeff Bezos to pick them and move in.\n\nIt was like a nationwide real-life season of The Bachelor, with rounds of courtship and periodic cuts. The rose was ultimately split between Queens, New York, and Crystal City in Arlington, Virginia. A smaller campus is also planned for Nashville.\n\nVirginia consummated things Tuesday when embattled Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam signed into law a $750 million incentive package.\n\nBut at least part of the resulting three-way marriage feels about as sturdy as a match made on TV.\n\nNew York is supposed to grant $1.5 billion in incentives contingent on the company creating 25,000 jobs with an average salary of $150,000.\n\nWe can't find two nickels to rub together to make the subways run on time or to build affordable housing or to build enough schools for our kids – in this very neighborhood, mind you – and yet we're showering Jeff Bezos with all this money that he clearly doesn't need, said Michael Gianaris on CNN. He's the deputy majority leader of the New York State Senate, represents Queens and has emerged as a top critic of the deal.\n\nPHOTO: DON EMMERT/AFP/Getty Images Protesters gather in Long Island City to say No to the Amazon HQ2 decision on November 14, 2018 in Long Island City, New York.\n\nHe was appointed by the Democrats who took control of the state Senate after elections in November to be on the Public Authorities Control Board, and he could ultimately have the power to essentially veto the deal, according to reports.\n\nIt was Democrats de Blasio and Cuomo who cheered the deal when it was announced. It's Democrats like Gianaris who could kill it.\n\nThe Washington Post, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Amazon was considering ditching Queens and putting the 25,000 promised jobs elsewhere.\n\nThe key line, anonymously sourced, in the Post report about Amazon's thinking:\n\nThe question is whether it's worth it if the politicians in New York don't want the project, especially with how people in Virginia have been so welcoming.\n\nOcasio-Cortez hailed the Washington Post report on Friday as a victory of the citizen over the corporation, when she tweeted a link to the Post article and added:\n\nCan everyday people come together and effectively organize against creeping overreach of one of the world's biggest corporations? Yes, they can.\n\nAmazon subsequently denied it might pull out of the deal and has said it would try to win over New Yorkers, as it did with a recent ad campaign.\n\nCriticism from the opponents is based not only on the tax incentives, which many say the company doesn't need, but also on the secretive way the deal was negotiated, outside of public view.\n\nAmazon dares to dictate to us whether our government can even talk to us about what these deals are as they are unfolding. They made the state sign a secrecy agreement. Lo and behold, when the agreement becomes known it's horrible, said Gianaris.\n\nCuomo lashed out at the state Senate on Friday, worried the deal could be in trouble.\n\nIt's a very small group of politicians who are pandering to the local politics, he said, according to the New York Post. I've never heard such an absurd situation where political pandering defeated a bona fide, sound economic development project.\n\nHe didn't acknowledge the very real concerns of local anti-development activists, who don't want to see their neighborhoods taken over and their property values explode out from under them.\n\nOpposition to the deal was clear late last month when New York City Council members had tough questions for Amazon officials at a public hearing, suggesting the company had misled about the economic benefits its new campus would bring. The council issued its own report suggesting the data on the benefits pushed by the governor and mayor was overblown.\n\nIt's not just the local politicians and strong progressives who are questioning the deal.\n\nThe former mayor, the billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who might run for President as a Democrat, had this to say, according to Politico:\n\nBut the reason they came here was not the tax breaks they got, which I didn't think they needed.
(CNN) —\n\nMost of them aren't old enough to vote yet, but Generation Z shows signs of being as liberal as millennials on a number of political and social topics, and they're more liberal when it comes to their belief about the role of government, according to a new report from Pew.\n\nPew defines Gen Z as those born from 1997 to 2012. They'll be ages 7 to 22 in 2019, and recent Pew surveys of teenagers and adults on political and social issues found members of Gen Z are often within just a few percentage points of millennials, who according to Pew were born from 1981 to 1996. Here are some of the issues where the two generations line up:\n\nApprove of President Trump's job performance\n\nMillennials: 29%\n\nGen Z: 30%\n\nBelieve increasing racial and ethnic diversity is good for society\n\nMillennials: 61%\n\nGen Z: 62%\n\nBelieve the Earth is getting warmer due to human activity\n\nMillennials: 56%\n\nGen Z: 54%\n\nApprove of NFL players kneeling during the National Anthem to protest racial injustice\n\nMillennials: 62%\n\nGen Z: 61%\n\nBelieve same-sex marriage is either a good thing or doesn't make a difference\n\nMillennials: 84%\n\nGen Z: 84%\n\nThe two generations have a more substantial gap when it comes to beliefs about the role of government, one of the defining issues that separate conservatives and liberals.\n\nMillennials have led their older counterparts in support of a larger government. In 2014, Pew found that 53% wanted a bigger government with more services, while 38% wanted a smaller government with fewer services. Millennials were then the only generation with a majority supporting a bigger government.\n\nIn Pew's latest survey, though, 64% of millennials said they believe government should do more to solve problems, a figure higher than those older than them but lower than Gen Z, 70% of whom said government should do more to solve problems.\n\nMost Gen Z members are too young to vote, and their political beliefs could evolve as they're shaped by political and social conditions and age. But Pew's early data suggests they could be as liberal if not more than millennials, reshaping American politics decades down the road.\n\nPew Research Center's results come from two online surveys derived from probability-based panels. Results among adults are based on a survey conducted Sept. 24 through Oct. 7, 2018. Results among those under 18 are from a survey conducted Sept. 17 through Nov. 25. Results among 2,674 millennials have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points, among the 1,178 Gen Z respondents, the error margin is plus or minus 4.2 points.
Hong Kong (CNN) Taiwan goes to the polls Saturday for elections dominated more than ever by relations with Beijing , which has been accused of trying to bully voters and distort the results in its favor.\n\nTaiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen is expected to claim an easy victory, capping a remarkable comeback after devastating local election results in 2018 saw her step down as leader of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) following its crushing defeat in races across the self-governing island.\n\nTsai's resurgent popularity has been largely courtesy of domestic fears over China. The main opposition candidate, Han Kuo-yu of the Kuomintang (KMT), is seen by some voters as being too close to Beijing, as many look with concern at unrest in Hong Kong -- once seen as a model for some in China for a potential future takeover of de facto independent Taiwan.\n\nOver the past few years, China's diplomatic offensives, military coercion, interference and infiltration have continued unabated. China's objective is clear: To force Taiwan to compromise our sovereignty, Tsai said in her New Year's address . Democracy and authoritarianism cannot coexist within the same country. Hong Kong's people have shown us that 'one country, two systems' is absolutely not viable.\n\nOne country, two systems, is the principle by which Hong Kong has been governed since being handed over from British to Chinese control in 1997. But it's a model many opposition figures in the city see as fundamentally broken, unable to balance growing encroachment from Beijing with demands for greater democracy.\n\nThe huge, often violent protests which have been taking place in the city for more than six months have renewed skepticism over one country, two systems -- particularly in Taiwan, where both Tsai and Han have denounced it as a potential model for any unification with China.\n\nHan Kuo-Yu, Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate, attends a campaign rally in Tainan in southern Taiwan on January 4, 2020.\n\n'One country, two systems' can never be implemented in Taiwan. Taiwanese people can never accept it, Han told a rally in June, though he recently knocked Tsai in a debate for enjoying electoral gains while Hong Kongers are bleeding from fighting against China.\n\nTsai Chia-hung, director of the Election Study Center at Taiwan's National Chengchi University, told CNN that the situation in Hong Kong has influenced this election a lot.\n\nThe relationship between Taiwan and China is always a dominant issue in Taiwan's elections, he said, adding that in the wake of the protests in the city and Beijing's hardline reaction, people are really worried about the future of Taiwan and they ... want to voice their concern over the relationship between Taiwan and China.\n\nFears of China\n\nTaiwan is a democratically-governed island of 23 million people in the South China Sea. A Japanese colony until 1945, it was taken over by the Kuomintang after they lost the Chinese civil war and moved their Republic of China (ROC) government to the island.\n\nKMT-ruled Taiwan was a dictatorship for many decades, before democratic reforms began in the late 1980s, leading to its first direct presidential election in 1996. Since then, the island has gone through a major change it is identity, with many, particularly younger people, regarding themselves as Taiwanese rather than Chinese, and supporting full independence from the mainland -- meaning the ROC, as Taiwan still calls itself, would become the Republic of Taiwan.\n\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) has never controlled Taiwan, but that has not stopped the Communist government regarding the island as an integral part of its territory, and vowing to retake it, by force if necessary\n\nIn the past, as Taiwan has appeared poised to drift further out of its orbit, Beijing has resorted to aggressive measures -- for instance, firing missiles into the sea near the island ahead of the 1996 elections. Last month, Beijing sailed its new aircraft carrier into the Taiwan Strait, which divides the island from mainland China, along with several naval frigates. The move was greeted with some alarm by Taipei, which urged Beijing to uphold peace and stability across the strait and in the region.\n\nSupporters of Taiwan's current president and Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate, Tsai Ing-wen, cheer at a rally in Taoyuan on January 8, 2020.\n\nThis week, the Global Times, a nationalist Chinese state-run tabloid, quoted Chinese officials and analysts as warning that reunification of the motherland is an inevitable trend regardless of who wins.\n\nAccording to some, in addition to bellicose statements and shows of force, Beijing is also pursuing a more subtle approach to influence the elections, targeting Taiwanese voters with fake news and misleading information.\n\nThe Taiwan FactCheck Center, an independent NGO, has tracked numerous instances of disinformation regarding voting procedure, party policies, ID requirements and Tsai herself. One particularly prevalent piece of fake news is that Tsai's PhD from the London School of Economics is somehow illegitimate, despite the university repeatedly confirming the degree\n\nTaiwan's Central Election Commission has also warned of a surge in fake news and disinformation in the run up to Saturday's vote.\n\nOn December 31, Taiwan's parliament -- in which the DPP has a majority -- passed an Anti-Infiltration Act aimed at reining in Chinese influence over the island's elections. The move has been denounced by some opposition figures as endangering free speech and legitimate cross-straits ties, leading Tsai to reassure voters in her New Year's address that it was only designed to more strongly protect Taiwan's democracy and freedom.\n\nBoth Twitter and Facebook have launched dedicated services for tracking misinformation and manipulation ahead of Saturday's vote. In December, Facebook reportedly removed more than 200 fan pages, groups and accounts targeting Taiwan for violating its guidelines.\n\nChinese officials have pushed back against claims of attempting to influence the election. In the Global Times report, the paper quoted experts saying to blame Beijing for meddling in the election was groundless as reunification is inevitable and the mainland will not see the election result as an important factor affecting this process.\n\nJUST WATCHED China celebrates 70th anniversary of Communist rule Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH China celebrates 70th anniversary of Communist rule 02:14\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nMore than 19 million Taiwanese are eligible to vote when polls open on Saturday, according to the government-run Central News Agency . Polls close at 4 p.m. local time (3 a.m. ET), with results expected later that night.\n\nA victory for Tsai is likely to entrench poor relations with China, which has massively ramped up pressure on the island since her election in 2016. Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping issued an open threat to supporters of Taiwanese independence , saying not a single inch of our land could be ceded from China and the country was prepared to fight the bloody battle against our enemies.\n\nAny Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be a bloody, logistical nightmare and could drag in the United States, sparking a much vaster, more devastating conflict. Despite this, some observers fear that Beijing could use the Taiwan issue as a way of drumming up nationalist sentiment if in future support for the Communist Party was waning, regardless of feelings on the island itself.\n\nTsai will be looking to not only retain the presidency on Saturday, but also the DPP's majority in the Legislative Yuan, Taiwan's parliament, which it took for the first time in 2016 in a major swing against the KMT following anti-China protests in 2014 known as the Sunflower Movement.\n\nHan Kuo-yu and KMT election candidates seen on posters at a campaign rally in New Taipei City on December 8, 2019.\n\nThe DPP's poor performance in the 2018 local elections appeared to mark a resurgence for the KMT however, particularly for a new wave of figures such as Han. Going into 2019 it seemed like Tsai might lose both the presidency and the legislature, and while the former seems very unlikely at this point, the KMT still has a strong chance of regaining control of the Yuan.\n\nSuch a result would strongly limit Tsai's ability to finally deliver the type of progressive agenda she promised in her first term -- with many Taiwanese liberals in particular upset over the DPP dragging its feet over same-sex marriage. Last year, Taiwan became the first place in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage only after the island's top court ruled the previous law unconstitutional.

Five of the defendants who were spared the death penalty are sentenced to 20 years in prison, one defendant is handed a sentence of 10 years, and the two others face seven years in prison. Agnes Callamard, the UN Special Rapporteur for Extrajudicial Killings who lead an independent investigation into the murder, calls the verdicts a parody of justice.\n\nFebruary 26, 2021 - A declassified US intelligence report is released that says the crown prince approved the operation to capture or kill Khashoggi.
(CNN) -- South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, just back from a secret trip to Argentina unknown to his staff or his wife, admitted Wednesday he has carried on an extramarital affair with a woman in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford chokes up on Wednesday as he admits to having an affair.\n\nI've been unfaithful to my wife, Sanford told a news conference in Columbia, South Carolina. I developed a relationship with what started as a dear, dear friend from Argentina.\n\nHis voice choking at times, Sanford apologized to his wife and four sons, his staff and supporters, and said he would resign immediately as head of the Republican Governors Association.\n\nThe affair began in the last year and was discovered five months ago, Sanford said without elaborating. He added that he and his wife were trying to work through it. Watch Sanford admit to the affair »\n\nIn a statement issued later Wednesday, Sanford's wife, Jenny, said she asked him to move out two weeks earlier but was still open to a reconciliation for the benefit of their children.\n\nI remain willing to forgive Mark completely for his indiscretions and to welcome him back, in time, if he continues to work toward reconciliation with a true spirit of humility and repentance, Jenny Sanford said.\n\nThe South Carolina governor had not been seen in public since June 18. When questioned, Sanford's staff told media outlets Sanford was hiking on the Appalachian Trail. But Sanford was spotted Wednesday in Atlanta, Georgia's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.\n\nSanford said he had been in Buenos Aires. He said it was his fault for shrouding this larger trip.\n\nI'm a bottom-line kind of guy. I'll lay it out, it's going to hurt, and we'll let the chips fall as they may, Sanford told reporters. View a timeline of the events »\n\nThe affair began as a friendship eight years ago, but over this last year, it developed into something much more than that, Sanford said.\n\nAll I can say is that I apologize, he said, adding that he would appreciate a zone of privacy for the sake of his family.\n\nSanford also traveled to Argentina a year ago as part of a South Carolina Commerce Department-funded trip to South America, according to an itinerary of the trip obtained by CNN. It was unclear if he met with the woman on that trip.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sanford said he footed the bill for his most recent trip to Buenos Aires. The governor said earlier in the day he had traveled to Argentina twice before.\n\nWhen asked if he is trying to reconcile with his wife, Sanford nodded, I am, yeah. Asked if he and his wife are separated, he said, I don't know how you want to define that. I mean, I'm here and she's there. I guess in a formal sense we're not, but what we're trying to do is work through something that we've been working through for a number of months now.\n\nHowever, the statement by Jenny Sanford said the couple was in a trial separation after trying to work through the problem in recent months.\n\nWe reached a point where I felt it was important to look my sons in the eye and maintain my dignity, self-respect, and my basic sense of right and wrong, she said in the statement. I therefore asked my husband to leave two weeks ago. This trial separation was agreed to with the goal of ultimately strengthening our marriage.\n\nJenny Sanford said there was no contact with her husband during the separation, and she did not know he was in Argentina in recent days.\n\nAlso Wednesday, The State newspaper of Columbia published e-mails between Sanford and a Buenos Aires resident named Maria from July 2008.\n\nIt said the e-mails were acquired in December, and that the governor's office confirmed their authenticity. When contacted by CNN, a spokesman for the governor would neither confirm nor deny the authenticity of the e-mails.\n\nYou have a particular grace and calm that I adore. You have a level of sophistication that so fitting with your beauty, Sanford wrote on July 10, according to the e-mails published on the newspaper's Web site. I could digress and say that you have the ability to give magnificent gentle kisses, or that I love your tan lines or that I love the curve of your hips, the erotic beauty of you holding yourself (or two magnificent parts of yourself) in the faded glow of the night's light -- but hey, that would be going into sexual details.\n\nThe e-mail continues, While all the things above are all too true -- at the same time we are in a ... hopelessly impossible situation of love. ... How in the world this lightening strike snuck up on us I am still not quite sure. As I have said to you before I certainly had a special feeling about you from the first time we met, but these feelings were contained and I genuinely enjoyed our special friendship and the comparing of all too many personal notes.\n\nThe long-term political fallout for Sanford, 49, is unclear. He has been mentioned as a potential Republican presidential candidate in 2012, after his current second consecutive term as governor ends. South Carolina's constitution forbids a third straight term.\n\nMississippi Gov. Haley Barbour immediately takes over as head of the Republican Governors Association, CNN has learned. Recent political sex scandals »\n\nThe news revealed today hurts all of us who have gotten to know Gov. Sanford over the years and so it is with regret that the RGA accepted Gov. Sanford's resignation as chairman, Barbour said in a statement. While this news is deeply disappointing, I also know it's important to remain focused on the future and Gov. Sanford's resignation allows him and us to do just that.\n\nShortly after Sanford's announcement, Nathan Daschle, executive director of the Democratic Governors Association, issued a statement saying, Our thoughts and prayers are with Gov. Sanford and his family, and I wish them the best as they try to heal this wound. Watch the lieutenant governor blast Sanford's trip »\n\nHowever, the Republican leader in the South Carolina Senate questioned Sanford's abdication of responsibility for leaving without notice last week.\n\nI'm deeply disturbed that no one knew where Gov. Sanford was over the last five days, state Sen. Harvey Peeler said in a statement, adding: We cannot let the governor's personal life overshadow his public responsibility, or in this case, his negligence of gubernatorial authority.\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Party Chairman Karen Floyd pledged every effort to ensure that the party maintains the trust of South Carolina's voters.\n\nIn the hours and days ahead, I will reach out to and work with Republican office-holders, candidates, and activists to regain public confidence and win the next round of elections, Floyd pledged.\n\nSanford has had a bruising year, losing his fight to turn down $700 million in federal stimulus money. Sanford initially tried to require that any stimulus money pay down the state debt, a stance rejected by the Obama administration.\n\nThe South Carolina's Supreme Court ruled earlier this month that Sanford had to accept the stimulus funds.\n\nCNN's Peter Hamby and Kristi Keck contributed to this story.\n\nAll About Mark Sanford • South Carolina • Appalachian National Scenic Trail

Both are Democrats, both have a background in law, both have a mixed-race background. There is an obvious convenience to the comparison.

But it's also symptomatic of a lazy habit that infantilizes high-profile women in America and abroad, and skims over the personal details and unique circumstances that shaped them.\n\nKamala Harris is the first Indian-American woman to have a seat in the US Senate. She was also the first woman, black, Indian-American or South Asian, to serve as district attorney of San Francisco, and as California's attorney general. The most famous instance of public sexism she faced before announcing her presidential bid occurred in 2013, when none other than Barack Obama called her the best-looking attorney general. Obama later apologized to Harris after the remark was widely criticized (rightly) as sexist.\n\nThe two are very different political beings. Obama, with some liberal moves such as reduced sentences for drug offenses aside, did not make prison reform a priority, and was against mass incarceration. But the prison system is a subject close to Harris' heart.\n\nDespite personal reservations, she promised to defend the death penalty in California as attorney general, and proved herself an often harsh prosecutor, favoring long periods of imprisonment. In other areas, Harris has positioned herself further to the left than the former President. Those only aware of her overlap with Obama might make assumptions about her attitudes elsewhere, which would turn out to be untrue.\n\nHarris is far from the only female politician to receive this media treatment – and that treatment isn't always limited to comparisons to more famous men (though admittedly that's overwhelmingly the case when it comes to world leaders).\n\nTake Theresa May. Coverage of the British Prime Minister is regularly peppered with references to Margaret Thatcher. Throughout her negotiations over the Brexit deal in Brussels, Belgium, in December, newspapers referred to May's handbag-wielding Maggie moments – Thatcher's handbag being the mythical weapon with which she would supposedly clobber her opposition.\n\nConsidering Margaret Thatcher was in favor of Europe, fought for Britain's interests within the EU, and for Britain to strengthen its position as a member of the EU, this likeness is especially ironic.\n\nTheresa May's Brexit strategy has been to make determined noises while championing a cause – leaving the EU – she campaigned and voted against, and she consistently makes zero productive headway with it. Her predecessor David Cameron's negotiation of the ultimately null EU reform deal in 2016 was far more Thatcheresque in its intention and execution (even if the referendum he called subsequently was not). Coverage of his doings, however, didn't call him Maggie – or indeed, refer to other male PMs who went before him.

Kramp-Karrenbauer is extremely conservative on same-sex marriage, and has likened it to incest in the past. Her stance on migration is also vastly stricter than Merkel's, and she has made it clear she is keen to dial down the more liberal attitude exhibited by the party in the last decade.\n\nWhile Merkel's political career was catalyzed by the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification, Kramp-Karrenbauer's has been forged in the wake of Merkel's.

Although he later denied the accusations, the former Davao City mayor admitted his links to the alleged Davao death squad in a May 2015 broadcast of his local television talk show.\n\nAt a CNN Philippines Townhall event in February 2016, Duterte, admitted that he had three girlfriends and a common-law wife. His marriage to Elizabeth Zimmerman was annulled due to his womanizing, but he denied this meant he objectified women.\n\nHe also lashed out at the womens' group that filed a complaint against him before the Commission on Human Rights (CHR).\n\nDuterte made international headlines in April 2016 with his inflammatory comments on the 1989 rape and murder of an Australian missionary that took place in Davao City.\n\nDuring the third and last presidential debate, Duterte had said that he would plant a Philippine flag in disputed territories should China refuse to recognize a favorable ruling for the Philippines.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference to unveil his new cabinet on May 31 2016, Rodrigo Duterte said journalists killed on the job in the Philippines were often corrupt.\n\nIn September 2016, Duterte likened himself to the Nazi leader and announced that he wants to kill millions of drug addicts.\n\nDuterte apologized to the Pope after cursing him for the traffic he caused during a 2015 Papal visit to the Philippines.\n\nForeign diplomats weighing in on Rodrigo Duterte's controversial remarks did not sit well with the then-mayor.\n\nThe Philippines president-elect effectively said he supported vigilantism against drug dealers and criminals in a nationally televised speech in June 2016.\n\nAs he addressed troops at the country's Armed Forces Central Command Headquarters on August 5, Duterte recounted U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's visit to the country, saying in Tagalog that he was feuding with U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Philip Goldberg.\n\nAfter US president Barack Obama said he would raise extrajudicial killings in a meeting with Duterte, the Philippines President responded angrily on September 5, first in English then in Tagalog. As a result, Obama canceled the meeting.\n\nDuring a state visit to China in October 2016, Duterte announced his economic and military 'separation' from the US.\n\nAfter reports emerged of a potentially blocked arms sale, Duterte told CNN Philippines in November 2016 that he would turn to Russia for weapons.\n\nThe day after Trump won the US presidential election in November 2016, Duterte said he and Trump share some traits.\n\nSpeaking at a business forum in Manila in December 2016, Duterte admitted killing suspected criminals during his time as mayor of Davao City.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nPhilippines President Rodrigo Duterte has sparked outrage after kissing a woman on the lips during a meet and greet event in South Korea.\n\nOpposition senator Risa Hontiveros described the act as a despicable display of sexism and grave abuse of authority, and accused the controversial leader of acting like a feudal king.\n\nIn the incident in Seoul on Sunday, part of the Filipino leader's official visit to South Korea, Duterte called two overseas Filipino workers (OFW) onstage.\n\nAfter offering each woman a copy of a book, reportedly a title which is critical of the Catholic church, he pecked one of the two women on the cheek.\n\nAs the other presented the side of her face, Duterte instead gestured to his lips, indicating that he wanted the woman to kiss him squarely on the mouth, to whoops and cheers from the crowd.\n\nDuterte, who has a long-term partner with whom he has a daughter, reportedly asked the woman if she was single while onstage.\n\nAre you single? You're not separated from (your husband)? But you can tell him that this is just a joke? he asked, according to a report by Philippines news outlet Rappler.\n\nAccording to Philippines state media PNA, the woman, identified as Bea Kim, is married to a South Korean national and has two children.\n\nKim said that there was no malice in the kiss, and that it didn't mean anything except to entertain and make other Filipinos in the gathering happy.\n\nOn his trips to foreign countries, the president often takes time to meet members of the Filipino diaspora.\n\nThe office of the president has not responded to a CNN request for comment, and the Philippines government has yet to comment publicly on the incident.\n\nSocial media support, condemnation\n\nThe kiss in Seoul stirred heated debate among Filipino politicians, activists and social media users, amid accusations of misogyny and unstatesman-like behavior.\n\nHontiveros – the sister of a CNN Philippines anchor – said that Duterte acted like a feudal king who thinks that being the President is an entitlement to do anything that he pleases, adding that uneven power relations meant that the kiss wasn't an act between consenting adults.\n\nFacebook user RJ Barrete, whose profile identifies him as a young journalist, also commented that the power dynamics meant that it was impossible for the woman to properly consent to being kissed.\n\nDon't blame it on women! So much disgust for this 'man.' And if you're going to check the video, he was initiating to do it, (kissing) the woman even if it's becoming uncomfortable for her, his post reads.\n\nThis is not an issue of who initiated it, not even about consent because obviously, power was at play! And most importantly, as the President of a country you don't initiate an act like this in an official event!\n\nWomen's rights group Gabriela also denounced the act, saying that it represented disgusting theatrics of a misogynist president who feels entitled to demean, humiliate or disrespect women according to his whim.\n\nOthers, however, have come out in support of the president. He got a hug and a kiss on the lips. Wahahaha (Duterte) is so mischievous, said one, according to CNN affiliate CNN Philippines.\n\nAnother said that his actions were typical of the way Visayans – his ethnic group – joked around.\n\nControversial figure\n\nThe outspoken leader has a history of disparaging remarks about women, notably saying on the campaign trail in 2016, when he said that the rape and murder of an Australian missionary who was visiting a Filipino jail was a waste and that he should have been first to sexually assault the woman. He later apologized for the remarks.\n\nAt a CNN Philippines town hall event in February that year he admitted that he had three girlfriends and a common-law wife. His previous marriage was annulled due to his womanizing, but he denied this meant he objectified women.\n\nHe has also drawn widespread condemnation for his initiation and support of a bloody war on drugs, which has seen thousands of suspected drug users and dealers killed by police and vigilantes.

(GREG BAKER/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe night they fled, Reem and Rawan didn't dare sleep.\n\nIt was September 6, 2018. The two Saudi sisters were on a family vacation in Colombo, Sri Lanka. For weeks, they had helped their mother organize the trip, feigning excitement at the possibility of two weeks away from Riyadh, but knowing that if all went to plan, they'd never go back.\n\nFailure was not an option. Every step of their escape from Saudi Arabia carried the threat of severe punishment or death.\n\nWe knew the first time, if it's not perfect, it will be the last time, Reem says.\n\nCNN has changed the sisters' names and is not showing their faces, at their request for their safety.\n\nThe sisters say years of strict Islamic teaching and physical abuse at home had convinced them that they had no future in a society that places women under the enforced guardianship of men, and limits their aspirations.\n\nIt's slavery, because whatever the woman will do it's the business of the male, Rawan says.\n\nThat's why they say they renounced Islam.\n\nAnd that's why aged 18 and 20, they stole back their own passports, hid their abayas under the bedcovers, snuck out of their holiday home and boarded a flight from Colombo to Melbourne, via Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong stopover was supposed to take less than two hours.\n\nTwo hours has turned into five months.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN This photo was taken in a restroom in an airport during a trip to Turkey. The sisters wore this type of niqab when they were traveling outside Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhy they fled\n\nGood girls do what they're told, are quiet, don't argue or risk embarrassing their families. Reem and Rawan say they had turned being good girls into a fine art.\n\nIn our house, we (were) always the good girls they wanted us to be. So, if they want us to clean, we will clean. If they want us to cook, then we will cook, 18-year-old Rawan says.\n\nThe last two years it was really bad, because I just forget who I am, I am just pretending (to be) like an Islamic girl, says her 20-year-old sister, Reem.\n\nThey went to school, studied hard and avoided confrontation. Of course, the same rules didn't apply to their brothers. Beat your sisters, the siblings say their brothers were told, it'll make you better men.\n\nReem and Rawan are reluctant to talk about the abuse at the hands of their family. They say it didn't happen all the time, just enough to remind them of the rules. And enough to fill them with terror about what might happen if anyone found out about their plan or, worse still, caught them carrying it out.\n\nThe escape\n\nLeaving Saudi Arabia is not a simple undertaking for women who rebel against the system. Permission is needed from a male guardian for many basic activities, including international travel.\n\nReem and Rawan say they had been planning their escape in secret for two years. They didn't dare discuss it in case they were overheard, so, instead, they swapped WhatsApp messages, even while alone at night in their shared room.\n\nBefore they fled, the Sri Lanka vacation was just like any other. They wore their niqabs to the beach and sat away from the surf while their brothers swam and joked. They cooked the meals and spent most of their days inside. It was humid. Their niqabs stuck to their skin and made it hard to see.\n\nWe travel to move from a box to another box. From home to hotel, nothing will change, Rawan says. They will go out, they will live freely, the men, of course, we will sit away, watching them doing what they want.\n\nTheir five-year-old sister played in the sand, but their 12-year-old sister, like them, didn't. She too was learning that it's OK to be a girl in Saudi Arabia – until you grow up.\n\nDuring the trip, Rawan turned 18. The timing was no accident. The vacation was planned with gentle persuasion to coincide with a birthday that, unbeknown to their mother, allowed Rawan to apply for an Australian tourist visa.\n\nOn the last night of the trip, the sisters launched into action. Reem pre-booked the taxi. It was Rawan's job to retrieve their passports from a bag stored in their parents' bedroom. Around 2 a.m., she tiptoed past them as they slept, took the bag with their passports, then snuck back in again to return the bag so as not to raise suspicion.\n\nIt's a really great memory, exciting, Rawan tells CNN, smiling. Of the two sisters, she's the more talkative, taking the lead and occasionally looking to her sister for advice on the right word in English. Reem is more reserved. She's careful about what she says and who to trust. They both have dark, short, curly hair and being small in stature seem much younger than their years.\n\nWhen the cab driver arrived at 5 a.m., the sisters say they did something they'd never done before. They pulled on jeans they'd bought in secret and walked out of the house without their abayas.\n\nIt was only after they arrived at Colombo Airport that the sisters booked the flight they'd meticulously researched online: SriLankan Airlines flight UL892 departing Colombo at 9 a.m., arriving Hong Kong at 5:10 p.m. local time. From there, they'd take Cathay Pacific flight CX135 departing at 7:10 p.m. for Melbourne, Australia.\n\nThey had no trouble boarding the plane for the roughly six-hour flight to Hong Kong.\n\nIt was after they arrived at Hong Kong International Airport that things started to go wrong.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The younger sister takes a selfie in a hotel room. They say they felt like ghosts under the full-length black robe, as if they were invisible, not there.\n\nArriving in Hong Kong\n\nWhat happened in the transit area was something the sisters might have anticipated had they known their uncle had connections to the Saudi Interior Ministry or had realized the power Saudi officials could have over local airport staff.\n\nAs soon as the women stepped off the plane, they say two men approached them and asked if they were going to Melbourne. The women say the men asked for their passports and boarding passes, first saying they might miss their flight, then suggesting there was something wrong with their Australian visas.\n\nIn a letter to the sisters' lawyer obtained by CNN, SriLankan Airlines has identified the men as Naeem Khan, SriLankan Airlines station manager, and Noman Shah, a staff member for ground handling agent, Jardine Aviation Services.\n\nThe sisters say the men led them to another area of the airport, where their lawyer Michael Vidler says they canceled the women's Cathay Pacific flight to Melbourne and booked them, without their knowledge, on an Emirates flight to Riyadh, via Dubai.\n\nCathay Pacific tells CNN that the sisters' flight was canceled by representatives of SriLankan Airlines.\n\nSriLankan Airlines told CNN its staff members canceled the flight at the explicit request of the Saudi Consulate, which had already booked the sisters on the flight to Riyadh.\n\nThe airline said consular officials told its staff the women's father had phoned and said the sisters needed to go back to Saudi Arabia as soon as possible as their mother was terminally ill.\n\nThe women knew their mother wasn't ill and were quite sure there was nothing wrong with their visas.\n\nWe allege that they were the subject of an attempted kidnapping in an international airport in a restricted area, Vidler tells CNN. The Saudi Consulate was actively trying to deceive them.\n\nCNN has approached the Saudi Consulate in Hong Kong and the Saudi Foreign Ministry for comment on the sisters' claims and has not received a response. Hong Kong Police have confirmed that they're investigating the allegations.\n\nSriLankan Airlines says at no time did the sisters indicate there was a problem. The women disagree.\n\nVidler says that closed-circuit television seen by his team appears to confirm that Saudi Consul General Omar Al Bunayan was at the airport, speaking to the women and airline staff.\n\nThe presence of senior Saudi officials at the airport filled the women with dread. They'd heard about Dina Ali Lasloom, the 24-year-old Saudi woman who was forced onto a plane to Riyadh at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila in April 2017. Her hands, feet and mouth had been bound with duct tape, one witness told Human Rights Watch.\n\nReem and Rawan feared the same could happen to them.\n\nThey excused themselves to go to the bathroom where they made the decision to flee. As they emerged, they said they saw one of their passports on the table. Rawan tried to grab it.\n\nThe teenager says one of the men immediately slapped her hand, prompting the sisters to scream in Arabic, You kidnap us!\n\nThe sisters say they caused such a scene that the Consul General suggested they move to a quieter area where he presented them with their passports and new boarding passes – for Dubai.\n\nThey ran. First to the Cathay desk where counter staff told them their flights had been canceled. Then to the Qantas desk, where they'd hurriedly booked the next flight to Melbourne, QF30, departing at 7:00 p.m.\n\nSoon after they were issued boarding passes, the women say Shah, the ground handling staff member, tried to snatch them.\n\nJardine Aviation Services, whose staff members carry out a number of tasks within the airport, says its employees didn't tell the women their mother was ill or that was there was an issue with their Australia visas. It denies its staff members slapped Hawan's hand or tried to grab the sisters' boarding passes.\n\nHong Kong's Airport Authority has refused to give CNN a closed-circuit recording of the events that unfolded due to privacy concerns.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The women shared selfies they'd taken of their life before they fled. They wore niqabs in public from the age of 11 and at home were told to wear long gowns, so as not to tempt their brothers.\n\nFor the second time in two hours, the sisters say senior Saudi officials stopped them from flying. The sisters say Saudi Vice Consul Al Sharif told staff at the Qantas check-in desk they were running away, had stolen money, and weren't tourists.\n\nAustralian immigration officials were summoned on the phone and after a conversation with the women, Canberra canceled their visas.\n\nThe only issues with the visa occurred when the Vice Consul made what we believe to be false representations to the Australian authorities at the boarding gate of Qantas airlines, Vidler says.\n\nA spokesperson from Australia's Home Affairs department declined to comment on individual cases. Qantas also declined to comment but a spokesman pointed out that the airline does not make visa assessments.\n\nThe sisters say they stayed at the airport for three hours before asking Cathay Pacific counter staff for permission to leave. They wrote their names and a fake Hong Kong contact address then caught a train to the city.\n\nKhashoggi case puts Saudi Arabia under scrutiny\n\nReem and Rawan escaped Saudi Arabia weeks before the world's attention turned to the kingdom and the disappearance of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. They watched from Hong Kong as gruesome details emerged of Khashoggi's murder inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, allegedly by a team of hitmen who cut up his body with a bone saw.\n\nIn November, a source told CNN that the CIA had determined that Khashoggi was killed on the instruction of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, known as MBS, a claim the kingdom denies.\n\nThe Saudi sisters shrug when asked if they are surprised by Khashoggi's murder and the allegation that their country's de facto leader ordered it.\n\nWe know that Saudi Arabia can do stuff like this, Reem says. They are chasing innocent girls, not even important girls, Rawan agrees. We're just normal young women trying to find a life far away from violence.\n\nSoon after the women arrived in Hong Kong, their father and uncle came to the city to find them. Hong Kong police confirmed to CNN that a missing persons report had been filed.\n\nUsing a passport tracking system linked to hotel check-ins, Hong Kong police officers located the sisters on Monday, September 10 and took them into custody for questioning.\n\nThe women say they were held in a room in the imposing Wan Chai police headquarters for six hours, where they repeatedly refused requests from their father and their uncle to see them.\n\nPolice eventually drove them back to their hotel. By that time, it was after midnight and the women hurriedly packed their bags and fled.\n\nIn the five months since, they've moved from shelter to shelter, hotel to hotel, to evade detection and their potential forced return to Riyadh.\n\nThe sisters have not sought asylum in Hong Kong, however. Doing so would have put them at the end of a long queue of claimants caught in Hong Kong's Unified Screening Mechanism (USM), a system used by the government to process asylum claims. The UNHCR doesn't assess claims in Hong Kong.\n\nThrough their lawyer, Reem and Rawan are seeking a visa in a safe country. Vidler says they have few options. Their Saudi passports have been canceled and they don't have formal permission to stay in Hong Kong.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The sisters say being forced to wear the niqab robbed them of their identities. They knew they'd be expected to wear one for the rest of their lives, like their mother.\n\nLife in Saudi Arabia\n\nAt home in Riyadh, the sisters say they were beaten by their father and brothers for a reason and no reason.\n\nOne day when she was 14, Reem says her brother started hitting her for talking and laughing with Rawan. He said that people will hear my voice and it will bring shame, she says.\n\nThe sisters knew it was likely there would be an arranged marriage. There was talk of Rawan marrying her younger cousin, a boy still in high school.\n\nReem was the first to renounce Islam in October 2016, followed by Rawan in May 2017. They didn't dare tell anyone but say they announced it under fake names on Twitter.\n\nI knew If I told my family they will hurt me and I'll be killed. Because that what we studied in schools, that whoever left Islam should be killed. I knew no one will protect me because all my family are so religious and none of them will support me. I was afraid of them finding out, Reem says.\n\nThere are no firm figures on how many Saudi women have escaped the country – or how many have failed in their attempt to leave – but the total number of Saudi asylum seekers is rising.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, 575 Saudi nationals applied for asylum in 2015. Two years later, that figure had more than doubled to over 1,200.\n\nThe period coincides with the rising influence of MBS who in June 2017 was appointed heir to the Saudi throne by his father King Salman.\n\nSince then, MBS has made it clear that dissent won't be tolerated, even as the kingdom has earned international plaudits for new female-focused policies, including lifting the ban on women drivers.\n\nRana Ahmad, a 33-year-old Saudi national who runs the Atheist Refugee Relief agency in Germany, says the jailing and torture of the same women who campaigned for the right to drive had sent a message to some Saudi women that they have no future in the country.\n\nThey look at these women, they're trying to do something and the government puts them in jail. So they see no hope anymore, they want to leave, she said.\n\nAdam Coogle, a Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW), says women whose escape plans are thwarted are at serious risk of abuse.\n\nPunishments range from being locked in their room for months on end or banned from using a mobile phone, to criminal prosecution by the state for disobeying their parents or harming the kingdom's reputation. The women themselves say they fear they'll be killed by their own families.\n\nCoogle says there are few safe corridors for women to leave, because of political pressure the Saudi government applies to some foreign countries to return runaways without giving them the opportunity to claim asylum or put their case forward.\n\nAnywhere you go that doesn't have some sort of respect for refugee law or a strong record of rule of law is a problem because they're the countries where Saudi Arabia can apply its diplomatic pressure to get countries to cooperate, he says.\n\nFew regrets\n\nReem and Rawan say they could see signs of change in Saudi Arabia, but it wasn't moving fast enough for them. They laugh at the suggestion that progress was made by giving Saudi women the right to drive.\n\nDriving cars is not something to celebrate, Reem says. There is a woman abused in the house, and no one hears their voice, and they want us to celebrate a car? Rawan adds.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the sisters watch Netflix to pass the time. Wearing jeans and trainers, they could easily be mistaken for one of the millions of tourists that come through the city each year.\n\nSometimes Reem wears lipstick. She seems relaxed but has a habit of picking at the skin on her fingers when she's nervous. Sometimes, she does it so much that they start to bleed.\n\nThe sisters are anxious about what comes next. But even after five months of uncertainty and fear, they have few regrets.\n\nI regret not waiting, but not leaving, Reem says. From my childhood, I knew this is not my home. I always knew my rights would be taken.\n\nRawan says she too knew there was no life for her in Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhen I was growing up I saw my brothers do whatever they want, have whatever they want. But for me, I should be a good girl, a good woman, to marry someone, my cousin, because I should not even dream to choose my husband, to choose my partner.\n\nI want to study what I want, I want to work what I want, I want to choose the day I marry. To choose the man I marry. Even if I don't want to marry, I want the right to choose.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated with new information from human rights lawyer Michael Vidler who said he originally misspoke about which Saudi consulate official was at the Hong Kong airport speaking to the Saudi sisters and airline staff. Only the Consul General was seen by Vidler's team on closed circuit television.
(CNN) Tom Hanks got visibly emotional on Sunday while accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Globes.\n\nThe actor, who was given the award by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for what it said is his lasting impact on the film industry, had to take a moment to compose himself during his acceptance speech, particularly when paying tribute to his family.\n\nA man is blessed with a family sitting down front like that -- a wife who is fantastic in every way, who has taught me what love is, he said. Five kids who are braver and stronger and wiser than their old man is. And, uh, a loving group of people who have put [up] with me being away months and months and months at a time.\n\nBlaming a cold for his state, he joked at one point after choking up, It's the cold that is making this happen.

Former Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar listens during the sentencing phase in Eaton, County Circuit Court on January 31, 2018 in Charlotte, Michigan. Last week Nassar was sentenced in Ingham County to 40 years to 175 years in prison. The number of identified sexual abuse victims of former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar has grown to 265, a Michigan judge announced Wednesday as a final sentencing hearing commenced. Prosecutors said at least 65 victims were to confront Nassar in court, in the last of three sentencing hearings for the disgraced doctor who molested young girls and women for two decades in the guise of medical treatment. / AFP PHOTO / JEFF KOWALSKY (Photo credit should read JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nZURICH, SWITZERLAND - SEPTEMBER 22: Harvey Weinstein attends the 'Lion' premiere and opening ceremony of the 12th Zurich Film Festival at Kino Corso on September 22, 2016 in Zurich, Switzerland.

John Conyers until 2005 The House Ethics Committee announced last week it will investigate Conyers\n\n(CNN) —\n\nAnother former aide to Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan is accusing him of sexual harassment.\n\nDeanna Maher told CNN that Conyers made three sexual advances toward her when she worked for him in his district office in Detroit from 1997 to 2005.\n\nMaher says she considered telling her story over the years, but never went on the record with it until now. The Detroit-News first published her allegations Tuesday based on an interview she gave the newspaper this week. She told CNN last week that the societal moment of reckoning on issues of sexual harassment and abuse of power across the country that gave her the confidence that she would finally be believed.\n\nFor the young people that Conyers continually brought in … I can't forget them. I cannot forget them, Maher told CNN. I saw all the lives that were impacted by the system. I call it 'system' in Capitol Hill, of how these members protect each other.\n\nArnold E. Reed, a lawyer representing Conyers, told CNN on Tuesday that the Congressman does not plan to resign and denied the former staffer's allegations.\n\nMr. Conyers has indicated from day one that he hasn't done anything wrong, hasn't engaged in any type of sexual harassment with any former employee or anyone, Reed said, adding that the allegations are serious and are being taken seriously.\n\nReed reiterated that Conyers would cooperate fully with any investigation, and that the process will play itself out.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee announced last week it has opened an investigation into allegations against Conyers after Buzzfeed reported that he settled a wrongful dismissal complaint in 2015 after allegedly sexually harassing a staffer. Conyers denied wrongdoing in that case as well but acknowledged that there had been a financial settlement to that complaint.\n\nConyers stepped down from his position as top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee on Sunday.\n\nMaher, who left Conyers' office in 2005, said that Conyers office had a sexually suggestive culture that made her uncomfortable many times. She said that one of his staffers also sexually assaulted her in January 2001, forcibly kissing her.\n\nBut an FBI document obtained by Maher shared with CNN the FBI claimed she did not wish to prosecute – something she disputes.\n\nMaher made similar reports to the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in January 2004. She shared those reports and other supporting documents with CNN.\n\nThe committee said they have no comment on the reports. The FBI could immediately be reached for comment.\n\nIt wasn't until she left the office that she also began telling people that Conyers also put her in uncomfortable situations at least three times.\n\nThe first instance was in 1997, when Conyers invited her to Washington for a conference, and she realized upon arrival she had to stay in his two-bedroom hotel suite.\n\nSo I got into bed and all of the sudden, John Conyers walked into my bedroom, Maher told CNN. If you can imagine how ridiculous I looked, I put on my suitcoat. I had a suit coat on in bed. I was shaking. I was absolutely shaking. And he took off his clothes and then I figured it out: 'Oh my God. What did I do? How stupid. At my age, that I walked in and got myself into a situation like that.'\n\nMaher says she was in her 50s at the time. So, it was just silent with the TV on and I'm sitting there in bed with my suit coat on, shaking, she said. He didn't touch me, so he just stormed out of the room because I didn't say anything.\n\nShe locked the door, and the next morning got her own hotel room.\n\nMaher was one of two women who spoke out about different allegations of Conyers' misconduct to CNN's Drew Griffin in 2006. The story focused on Conyers use of Congressional staff to babysit his kids. Maher said she was forced to babysit for weeks at a time.\n\nThat babysitting incident, she later told CNN, made her feel that Conyers wanted a sexual relationship with her.\n\nBut two more incidents cemented her gut feeling, she said.\n\nIn the Spring of 1998, she said, I was instructed to drive him to the airport and he was driving erratically. … Erratically because his hand was feeling me all over my — what do you call it? — all over my abdomen.\n\nShe shoved his hand away, she said, and the incident ended when she says Conyers was stopped by police for bad driving and given a warning.\n\nAnother time, she said, she was helping him host an event in the Detroit suburb of Highland Park. She believes this was in 1999.\n\nHe walked up on a stage, and this was in front of a lot of people, and he walked up to act like he was whispering in my ear something about the town hall meeting and he stuck his hand up my dress, and whispered in my ear 'Wow, you've got great looking legs.' I don't know if anyone else there saw it. I don't know. But if anyone did see it, no one would report it.\n\nMaher said that she never reported Conyers at the time because she was afraid to lose her job.\n\nI wasn't, well, I don't want to say desperate, but I was coming out of a marriage, Maher told CNN. I had no income. I didn't settle for quite a while and I needed money to live on so I know that, that particular predicament that you're in. And it's awful, you're so vulnerable and you're willing to say OK, OK. The person says jump, you say how high.\n\nI came out relatively unscathed, luckier than most, and I felt so badly for the young people, young people that I left behind, she said.\n\nThis story has been updated and will continue to update with additional developments.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct when Maher gave an interview describing the sexual harassment she endured from Conyers.\n\nCNN's Juana Summers and Sophie Tatum contributed to this report.

In a sense, I have a Ph.D in cheer.\n\nSince its release earlier this month, the Netflix docuseries has introduced millions of viewers to 21st century cheerleading, a decidedly more dynamic, athletic variant of the activity than FDR -- our first, but not last, cheerleader in chief (Harvard College) -- could have envisioned.\n\nA primer on all things cheer, the show takes fans, many of them previously unaware of this sport and its often-insular ecosystem, from the sidelines to the competition stage and everywhere in between.\n\nWhether you're measuring success by a trending or popular algorithm on Netflix or by the attention of cultural critics taking the pulse of fans, Cheer has become a phenomenon . As someone who spent a number of years delving into the history and culture of cheerleading, I'm less interested in identifying or celebrating this phenomenon and more in understanding its place in the cultural pantheon of cheer.\n\nPart of what makes the show so compelling for me is how it stands on the shoulders of previous pop culture representations of the sport to make nuanced and necessary critiques around gender, race, class, sexuality and culture that move far beyond the world of the mat.\n\nA pop culture history of cheerleading (and more)\n\nTo understand Cheer, you need to know a little history. The cheerleader is an American icon, a trope of pop culture almost since its inception in the 19th century. And it's not going anywhere.\n\nAs a cultural representation of the sport, Cheer benefits from the strides made by Buffy the Vampire Slayer in the 1990s -- unlike Buffy's hit TV series, the cult film that preceded it centralized cheerleading as a part of its plot. Fans of the show may not remember that Buffy was a cheerleader, but her fight sequences read like tumbling passes, where gymnasts competing on floor exercise execute acrobatic feats like handsprings and full twists.\n\nThere was also NBC's mid-2000s show Heroes (with its tagline Save the cheerleader; save the world), and movies such as Jennifer's Body and Fired Up!. And of course, the big screen juggernaut Bring It On and its stable of sequels (which even includes a musical adaptation of the third film iteration).\n\nWhat's been missing from the pop culture understanding of the sport is that competitive cheerleading -- the majority of what Cheer depicts in its portrayal of the Navarro College coed squad in a small town in northeast Texas -- is a standalone activity. It exists apart from its sideline variant, in which squads lead crowds in call-and-response yells in an attempt to encourage an athletic team to victory.\n\nDuring competitions, squads cheer solely for themselves. This turn toward competition -- often not segregated by gender, as is the case with Navarro's coed squad -- reflects a particularly late-20th century ideal of cheer as collective action. The animated Disney series Kim Possible, with crime-fighting superhero cheerleader Kim and her sidekick Ron Stoppable, is but one example. Group solidarity, in service of the greater good, is paramount.\n\nIn interviews interspersed throughout Cheer, historian Natalie Adams remarks on the all-American reputation of cheerleaders; what she doesn't note, though, is that athletic girls entered cheer for lack of other options before the passage of Title IX, the federal civil rights law mandating equality in education programs, including sports.\n\nThough Bring It On was released in 2000, well after the advent of the girl power Title IX helped to usher in, even that film nods to the role played by competitive cheerleading as a haven for women athletes who need an outlet. Star Eliza Dushku's character famously shows up at cheerleading tryouts to mockingly cheer out why she's there: I moved here from Los Angeles (clap/stomp), your school has no gymnastics team (clap/stomp), this is a last resort!\n\nCheerleading hasn't always been about patriotism and school spirit. Sometimes it's about options. Part of the genius of Cheer is in its selection of which stories to privilege.\n\nThe stories 'Cheer' puts front and center on the mat\n\nBy focusing on cheerleaders Jerry Harris and Lexi Brumback, for instance, viewers gain insight into the vast inequities of the sport -- the outrageous costs and time commitments that can drain even an economically stable family's resources. The outlay for participants in one season of competitive cheerleading ranges anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000.\n\nHarris, a black man from the Chicago suburbs, and Brumback, a white woman from Houston, both began cheering as youth, on elite squads in private gyms that required expensive tuition and competition fees, travel expenses to tournaments, uniforms, and other costs that neither could afford.\n\nHarris's mother struggled to meet these demands before she died when he was in high school. Brumback also lacked the family support so many of her teammates had growing up but says that she never paid to cheer. When their circumstances held them back, their skills propelled them forward. Harris's cheer community rallied around him in the wake of his mother's death, providing financial and other material support; gyms and teams that wanted Brumback badly enough often waived her participation fees in exchange for her talent and time.\n\nCheer filmmakers highlight the danger and injury rate of the squad's stunts, especially when zeroing in on Mackenzie Sherbs Sherburn, who is thrown to seemingly no one during one pyramid practice. Allie Ross suffers multiple concussions during the season.\n\nJerry Harris in an episode of Netflix's 'Cheer.'\n\nWhile there is research to suggest that injury rates are decreasing, cheerleading remains one of the most dangerous sports for women and girls. Joint injuries and sprains are common and underreported; catastrophic injuries (spinal cord, traumatic brain injuries, e.g.) can result from the high degree of difficulty competitive cheer's stunts and tumbling require.\n\nA black gay man from Florida, La'Darius Marshall is one of Navarro's best stunters and tumblers. At times outspoken and bombastic, especially in his critique of the squad's shortcomings, Marshall's confident personality combined with his backstory (sexually abused, bullied) allows the show to comment on the place of gay men in cheer, and his talent for dance foregrounds cheer's performative aspects.\n\nThe rise of YouTube has made it easier for audiences to find and follow individual cheerleaders. Gabi Butler's family capitalized on this when she was a child, making her into a bona fide online cheerlebrity, and thereby introducing the relatively new wrinkle of social media into the mix, an essential component of millennial feminism. (If you've seen the show: Someone please tell her father that eggs are not dairy.)\n\nAnd no one personifies the squad's emphasis on chosen family more than Morgan Simianer, who was abandoned by both of her parents and left to survive alone in a trailer in Wyoming before her grandparents stepped in and she found her way to Navarro.\n\nWhy it's hard to stop watching 'Cheer'\n\nCameras followed the squad for more than four months on its quest to defend the NCA Coed Cheer Junior College National Championship title. These four months are distilled into six hours of programming, and lest we forget it's a reality show disguised as a sports documentary, we see the cheerleaders in their dorm rooms on their beds, talking and laughing, doing their own hair and each other's; riding in cars; on the phone, talking, texting and FaceTiming; applying makeup and body glitter. There are lots of tears.\n\nIn one classroom scene, cameras toggle back and forth between one of the gay male cheerleaders and a teacher lecturing the class that Texans believe marriage should be between a man and a woman -- a scene that brings to mind the Jamie Babbit film But I'm a Cheerleader (which first introduced the concept of gay conversion therapy to maintream pop culture). (For the record, Texas is not entirely or even overwhelmingly conservative. It may even go blue in November .)\n\nMonica Aldama, the coach of Navarro Cheer.\n\nMuch is made of Navarro head coach Monica Aldama -- her work ethic, her drive, her success. And she refers to the cheerleaders as her kids, amplifying the notion of the Navarro College cheerleading squad as a family. Aldama is Texan through and through, and like much of the town, identifies as a Christian. Aldama speaks in Cheer about long conversations with her pastor, and told Oprah magazine in an interview: I definitely am a person of faith. I believe that God loves all people.\n\nThe entire squad, it seems, leans into a sort of nondenominational Christianity, repeating the Serenity Prayer together and asking one another to pray for their injured squad mates, a spirit fingers laying-on-of-hands, if you will. What to make of the disconnect between what the show portrays as a hostile town environment for LGBTQ folks and Aldama's support for her student-athletes expressing their full senses of self? Aldama acknowledges this conflict and with the next breath rejects it. She expects perfection on the mat, but she preaches acceptance everywhere else. And with 14 national championships in 19 years, it's hard to argue with her methods.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.

The TV adaptation of Megan Abbott's novel Dare Me, out now, is another, as is Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. What the intensely positive response to the docuseries has shown, though, is that cheerleaders can sustain their own fan base.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee granted cheerleading provisional Olympic status almost four years ago; we may see it in Paris 2024 or Los Angeles 2028. Will Monica Aldama coach that team?

(Photo by Mark RALSTON / AFP) (Photo credit should read MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nA few hours after Jeff Bezos and his wife MacKenzie announced their divorce, the National Enquirer had an announcement of its own.\n\nThe Enquirer said it had been investigating Bezos for four months, tracking the Amazon CEO across five states and 40,000 miles. The tabloid said it had evidence that Bezos has been whisking his mistress off to exotic destinations on his $65 million private jet.\n\nThe Enquirer and other outlets identified the woman as Lauren Sanchez, a former anchor for Fox's local station in Los Angeles.\n\nRepresentatives for Bezos have had no comment on the reports about Sanchez. CNN has reached out to Sanchez for comment, but has not heard back.\n\nAccording to the Enquirer, Bezos' lawyer told the publication that it was widely known that Bezos and his wife had been long separated.\n\nBut the Enquirer's apparent scoop created a subplot all its own. In a statement on Thursday, the magazine's parent company, American Media Inc., suggested that its investigation prompted Bezos to go public with his divorce plans.\n\nThe National Enquirer has been doggedly investigating this story for four months and the extraordinary details and evidence uncovered by our team, and presented to Mr. Bezos' representatives for comment early this week, underscores the kind of investigative reporting that the publication has long been known for, a spokesman said.\n\nBy the looks of the Enquirer's new cover, which is scheduled to hit newsstands Thursday, it was ready to publish a story before Bezos issued a statement on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe cover promises to show readers the cheating photos that ended his marriage with not one, not two, but 11 pages of exclusive photos.\n\nThe tabloid is best known for sensational stories about Hollywood stars, not tech billionaires. Why did the Enquirer decide to pursue Bezos?\n\nMedia insiders immediately wondered about a Donald Trump connection, given that the president has repeatedly criticized Amazon as a company and Bezos as an individual. Trump has repeatedly attacked Bezos on Twitter for how his administration is covered by The Washington Post, which Bezos has owned since 2013.\n\nConsider: Trump had a friendly relationship with American Media Inc. boss David Pecker for decades. Pecker worked with Trump and former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen to squash embarrassing stories during the 2016 campaign. At the same time, the tabloid played up positive stories about Trump and negative stories about his opponents on its cover.\n\nAfter the election, the Trump-Enquirer collaboration continued. There were allegations – leveled by MSNBC hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski – that the Enquirer was used as a weapon against Trump critics.\n\nBut the partnership visibly ended in April when the FBI raided Cohen's office and subpoenaed records from the Enquirer.\n\nLast August, when Cohen pled guilty to campaign finance violations, he admitted to working with an unnamed media company CEO at the request of the candidate to squelch stories. That unnamed CEO is known to be Pecker.\n\nIn December, prosecutors announced a non-prosecution agreement with National Enquirer parent company American Media Inc., effectively ruling out charges for the publisher, Pecker, and his top deputy Dylan Howard.\n\nThis confirmed that the Enquirer had flipped on Trump, so to speak.\n\nAccording to the agreement, the company is obligated to cooperate with authorities and disclose all information with respect to the activities of itself and its officers, agents, and employees concerning all matters investigators inquire about for a period of three years or until prosecutions are completed.\n\nCNN's recent review of the Enquirer's cover stories showed that the tabloid suddenly stopped promoting Trump – or mentioning him at all – in April.\n\nThis timeline would seem to challenge the theory that the Enquirer is out to get Bezos because Bezos is on Trump's enemies list.\n\nStill, it was notable to see Howard – the chief content officer for American Media – sharing one of the bylines on the Enquirer's Bezos story.\n\nBusiness Insider published a story on Wednesday with a headline that read The National Enquirer, a longtime ally of President Trump, says it's about to release scandalous photos of Jeff Bezos' alleged affair.\n\nMSNBC's Chris Hayes shared a link to the Enquirer's exclusive on Twitter and said, Given everything we know about how Pecker's National Enquirer has functioned as essentially an arm of Trumpworld, this prompts some questions.\n\nA source with ties to the Enquirer offered a different rationale for the reporting effort: It's fanciful to suggest that the Enquirer pursued this because Bezos is a perceived enemy. It was pursued because he's the world's richest man and a newsworthy subject.\n\nThe source said the Enquirer decided to look into Bezos about five months ago. Conversations with sources led to a specific tip four months ago, the person said.\n\nA handful of photographers worked with a group of reporters on the investigation, the person added. The tabloid, likely in a bid to sell more copies, is touting this as the largest investigation in Enquirer history.\n\nAnother source, a person familiar with the National Enquirer's operation, also rejected the theory that the Enquirer was trying to help Trump.\n\nAnyone who knows Dylan Howard knows he is looking to regain credibility. This is his redemption piece after all the recent scandals, the source said.\n\nTrump, who has been divorced twice, was asked about the Bezos news during a Q&A with reporters on Thursday.\n\nI wish him luck, Trump said. It's going to be a beauty.
Imagine if Ben sued Jerry. If Black sued Decker. If Johnson sued Johnson.\n\nNew Yorkers are coping with the news that Cellino & Barnes, a personal injury law firm known for its ubiquitous advertising, is splitting. And it's not pretty.\n\nRoss Cellino sued Stephen Barnes in a case that appears to call for the dissolution of Cellino & Barnes.\n\nCellino & Barnes' earworm ad jingle is a trademark tune. If you've heard it once, you've heard it a thousand times. It's catchy -- and it's grating. But it's about as New York as pizza by the slice and getting elbowed on the subway.\n\nDocuments related to Cellino's suit against his firm, filed on Wednesday, have been sealed but the court. But Cellino & Barnes (the firm, not the individuals) said in a statement that Cellino intends to break up the team.\n\nMr. Barnes and the firm plan to aggressively oppose the dissolution papers filed by Mr. Cellino; however, we reiterate that regardless of outcome, the firm will continue to do business in the many markets we serve, it said on Wednesday.\n\nCellino & Barnes, which has 300 staff members, handles personal injury cases in California and New York. It was founded by Cellino's father, Ross Cellino Sr., who established the firm as Cellino & Likoudis in 1958.\n\nNeither Cellino nor Barnes responded to a request for comment. Terrence Connors, who is listed in court documents as Cellino's attorney, also did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNew Yorkers spent much of Wednesday and Thursday mourning the potential loss of the dynamic duo, whose phone number many know by heart (for the uninitiated, it's 800-888-8888).\n\nCELLINO IS SUING BARNES — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) May 11, 2017\n\nWhen they split up all their stuff, both of their phone numbers are going to be 400-444-4444. https://t.co/MwbLdcEFj8 — Josh Gondelman (@joshgondelman) May 11, 2017
(CNN) —\n\nA heterosexual couple in Britain have lost their court battle for the right to enter into a civil partnership – an alternative to marriage that is reserved for same-sex couples in the UK.\n\nThe Court of Appeal in London rejected a claim by Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, who argued they were discriminated against because civil partnerships are not available to people of the opposite sex.\n\nSteinfeld and Keidan oppose traditional marriage because they regard it as a patriarchal institution. Speaking outside court, Steinfeld said they were deeply disappointed by the ruling.\n\nThe 2004 Civil Partnership Act allowed same-sex couples in Britain to enter a legal partnership for the first time. It conferred almost the same legal rights as traditional marriage, except for the right to marry in a religious setting. Same-sex civil partners did not have the right to declare themselves married for legal purposes.\n\nBritain legalized same-sex marriage in 2013, but retained civil partnership legislation.\n\nSteinfeld and Keidan had argued in lower court hearings that the provisions around civil partnership were incompatible with equality law.\n\nThe government argued that it would make a final decision on whether to abolish civil partnerships or extend them to everyone after evaluating the impact of the later same-sex marriage law.\n\nThe three judges who heard the case at the Court of Appeal agreed the unequal treatment of heterosexual and same-sex couples could not continue forever. Two judges said the government should have more time to evaluate the best way forward on civil partnerships and marriages. The third judge dissented, according to a summary of the judgment released by the Court of Appeal, saying the law needed to be changed immediately.
The CEO of Australian airline Qantas says he'll continue to publicly support same-sex marriage after he was attacked with a pie over the issue.\n\nMy opinion on this has not changed, Alan Joyce said in a statement Wednesday. We'll continue to speak about important social issues including indigenous reconciliation, gender diversity and marriage equality, because it's the right thing to do.\n\nA man rubbed a pie in Joyce's face at a business event on Tuesday morning just as the CEO began delivering a speech.\n\nRelated: Airline CEO attacked with cream pie\n\nThe assailant, Tony Overheu, has since spoken to Australian media, saying he wanted to make a statement about Joyce's support for same-sex marriage.\n\nThere's some really crude stuff going on here, and Joyce has been very much leading the issue, Overheu told 7News.\n\nIn March, Joyce and other top Australian CEOs sent a letter urging the government to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nNo attempt at bullying us into suppressing our voice will work, Joyce told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nRelated: Gay marriage in Australia unlikely for years\n\nQantas (QABSY) and other big companies, including Airbnb and eBay (EBAY), are backing the Until we all belong campaign, which launched last month in an effort to increase pressure on the Australian government over same-sex marriage.\n\nA push to change the law last year got stuck in a political quagmire in the Australian parliament.

(CNN) — Bobbi Brown is best known for the beauty brand bearing her name. The minimalist, flattering eyeshadows and lipsticks won many busy working women as fans, but Brown sold the company to Estee Lauder in 2016 and has been looking for a new project ever since.\n\nThe answer came in a form she didn't expect -- a hotel in her pretty suburban New Jersey hometown.\n\nUnlike many in the beauty and fashion worlds, Brown was content not to be a regular on the New York City party scene, preferring a quieter life with her husband, developer Steven Plofker, and three sons in Montclair, about 45 minutes outside of Manhattan. Montclair is a picturesque, sleepy college town that refutes the cliche of New Jersey as dirty and industrial.\n\nDoes this mean that A-listers might abandon Manhattan for the 'burbs? Brown thinks it's worth taking the risk, and she spoke to CNN Travel about her new life as a hotelier.\n\nMeet George\n\nShades of gray: Brown obsessed over gray tones until she found the perfect ones. Photography by Lesley Unruh for One Kings Lane\n\nBrown didn't plan to get into hotels -- and she claims to have zero interest in building another brand. But after her youngest son went off to college and her husband began exploring a property in central Montclair, it seemed only natural for Brown and Plofker to merge their talents.\n\nEnter The George, a 32-room boutique hotel named after, and inspired by, George Washington. (The nation's first president spent lots of time in New Jersey.) It officially opens to the public on April 1, 2018.\n\nRelated content A night with the stars: 8 fabulous celebrity hotel suites\n\nLet me tell you, it was not easy having a very creative developer alongside someone who considers herself an expert in color, Brown laughs. [My husband and I have] been married 30 years in September. We raised three boys together. We have a happy marriage, but we're very strong-minded people and have learned when something is non-negotiable.\n\nAmong those non-negotiables? Dyson hair dryers and bathrobes from Ikea -- both things that Brown herself swears by and uses at home. She spent years traveling the world for her work and considers herself an expert on what hotels are doing right -- and what they're doing wrong.\n\nA few of her favorite things\n\nWhile the expensive Dyson hair dryers will have to be signed out from the front desk to prevent thievery, Brown had a very specific idea of which things guests would need in grabbing distance, namely coffee -- so there are Nespresso coffee makers in every room to prevent pre-caffeinated guests from having to interact with other humans.\n\nBrown, who loves the Soho House hotels around the world and opts for boutique stays over big-name brands with loyalty programs, also wanted to keep things personal. Since she has strong reactions to fragrances, she chose a delicate peppermint lavender scent for all the in-room toiletries, and has a policy against using perfumes or room sprays in common areas.\n\nJust like home: Many of The George's interiors come from Brown's home goods line with Lord & Taylor. Lesley Unruh\n\nWe're very hands-on people, Brown says about why the hotel project suited her and Plofker so well.\n\nI get into the details. We're going to be serving breakfast and brunch both to hotel guests and the community, we'll have an afternoon tea and smoothies. It matters what yogurt we serve. I will be curating everything, Brown says. It's a small hotel, so it's about customer experience and accommodating.\n\nAnd customer-friendly service doesn't just extend to guests of the human persuasion. Brown, a dog lover, has made The George extremely animal-friendly. Not only are there special doggie treats and beds, but travelers can pick out their pup's accessories (such as a food bowl) ahead of time when they make their reservation so that everything in the room will be ready to go upon arrival.\n\nAnother challenge for Brown and Plofker was negotiating Montclair's quirky local laws. The town has a very small number of liquor licenses, which can make it tough for a new bar or restaurant to open.\n\nWhile The George does not have one of those licenses, Brown has come up with creative ways to bring booze onto the property, such as having a favorite local wine store host on-site tastings. (The licenses are portable, which works out nicely.) Her team can also arrange for deliveries to individual guest rooms.\n\nThe hotel's small size also makes it easy to accommodate specific dietary needs, from gluten-free to diabetic-friendly.\n\nThe one thing The George will never have, though? A spa.
(CNN) Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West are figuring out their future and whether they are going to stay married, according to two sources close to Kardashian West who spoke to CNN.\n\nThe sources confirmed that West has been living at their home in Wyoming in recent months, while his wife stayed in California with their children.\n\nThey have been living separately for the last few months, a friend of Kardashian West told CNN but requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation. They have been in marriage counseling and have discussed divorce, it's on the table.\n\nDivorce is something that has been discussed off and on for the past year but Kim has not wanted to move forward on that, the second source said. There is no drama or contentious relationship the individual added, they are amicable and fully aligned when it comes to the kids.\n\nReports claimed that Kardashian West has also hired divorce attorney Laura Wasser. However, CNN has learned that while Kardashian West is consulting with her, the high-profile attorney has been on retainer for years. Wasser represented Kardashian West in her divorce from now retired NBA player Kris Humphries which was finalized in 2013. Kardashian West was also previously married to music producer Damon Thomas. Kanye West was previously engaged to designer Alex Phifer.\n\nCNN has reached out to representatives for the couple for comment.\n\nThe two stars, who married in a lavish wedding in Italy in 2014, are the parents of four children.\n\nThey first met in the early 2000s, but it would be years before they became romantically involved.\n\nKanye West and Kim Kardashian at the Costume Institute Gala at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 2, 2016 in New York City.\n\nIn 2019, West interviewed Kardashian West for Vogue Arabia and asked her about the first time they met.\n\nThis was before you released your first album and you were known as a music producer. I was really shy. You thought I was [singer] Brandy's assistant, which I wasn't, Kardashian West recalled. Ever since you said that, it's everywhere... like Kim is Brandy's assistant. I was her friend and stylist. [laughs]. I thought you were attractive, nice, very charming, really funny, powerful -- I was in awe of you, but I was really shy, quiet, and a little nervous, to be honest.\n\nBut both would have high-profile relationships before they went public with their love in 2012.\n\nDaughter North was born in 2013, and West famously proposed to his daughter's mother in a nearly empty sports stadium and hiring an orchestra while her family watched from nearby -- all of which was documented and shared on their popular E! reality series, Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\n\nFollowing their wedding in Florence, Italy they welcomed son, Saint, in 2015, followed by daughter, Chicago, in 2018 and son, Psalm, in 2019.\n\nThe couple supported each other through tough times, including Kardashian West being robbed at gunpoint in Paris in 2016 during a home invasion.\n\nIn 2018, he tweeted his admiration for his wife.\n\nGratitude and happiness best describe what my wife means to me, he wrote. I'm deeply grateful and purely happy.\n\nKanye West and Kim Kardashian West in 2018.\n\nShe often spoke out in defense of her husband, who has stirred controversy at times for provocative tweets and comments, as well as for his support of President Donald Trump.\n\nIn 2018, his infamous rant inside the oval office, spanned topics from his mental health to prison reform to what kind of plane Trump should fly in.\n\nWest has spoken publicly about his mental health and bipolar disorder.\n\nYou have this moment [where] you feel everyone wants to kill you. You pretty much don't trust anyone, West told David Letterman, in 2019, as part of Letterman's Netflix series, My Next Guest Needs No Introduction.\n\nWest described what it's like to have a manic episode with bipolar disorder.\n\nWhen you're in this state, you're hyper-paranoid about everything, everyone, West explained. This is my experience. Other people have different experiences. Everyone now is an actor. Everything's a conspiracy. You feel the government is putting chips in your head. You feel you're being recorded. You feel all these things, he said.\n\nHis wife called it an emotional process in an interview with American Vogue in 2019.\n\nWe can definitely feel episodes coming and we know how to handle them, she said. For him, being on medication is not really an option, because it just changes who he is.\n\nI understand Kanye is subject to criticism because he is a public figure and his actions at times can cause strong opinions and emotions, she wrote in a statement shared on social media. He is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressures of being an artist and a black man, who experienced the painful loss of his mother, and has to deal with the pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bi-polar disorder. Those who are close with Kanye know his heart and understand his words sometimes do not align with his intentions.
Editor's Note: Una Mullally is a journalist, author and screenwriter from Dublin. She is a columnist with the Irish Times and contributes to the Guardian. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThis week, 47 years ago, a group of Irish feminists boarded what became known as the Contraceptive Train – a train to and from Belfast so they could buy condoms, take them back to Dublin and goad the police to arrest them.\n\nThe protest against the illegality of contraceptives was a landmark moment in Irish society, a perspective that could not be unseen and a point of view that shifted public discourse.\n\nThe women's movement in Ireland has fought many battles: from the glorious stunt of that train journey to the divorce referendum in 1995.\n\nBut 2018 presents the greatest challenge yet: will the Irish people remove the eighth amendment from the constitution – a ban on abortion introduced in 1983 – by referendum on May 25?\n\nIf the past is a different country for most nations, in Ireland, it's a different continent. The social change that has occurred here since the 1990s – when the scale of the sexual abuse of children by members of the Catholic Church began to be revealed – is profound.\n\nMarriage equality was legalized by popular vote in 2015, and Ireland has some of the most progressive legislation on transgender rights in the world. Yet legal abortion has been the third rail of Irish politics for so long.\n\nThe international perception of Ireland also at times languishes in the past.\n\nGeneralizations of a conservative, Catholic, Atlantic outpost, are not without merit, when considering the country's reluctance to provide the type of reproductive health care that many other nations don't even bother debating anymore.\n\nYet there is also a frustration in Ireland about the tweeness that colors global assumptions about the country.\n\nAs the international media descends this week on Dublin – a cosmopolitan city home to the European headquarters of so many tech companies – that perception rears its head again.\n\nPHOTO: Kara Fox/CNN Signs from the No campaign are seen on a Dublin street.\n\nHow can a country legalize gay marriage but not abortion? How can Irish people say the Catholic Church has lost its moral authority and power while Irish women still can't access basic health care?\n\nThe answer lies in a complex legacy of control and oppression of women that is as off-putting to many Irish women as it is to their global sisters.\n\nIn the aftermath of the marriage referendum, the country seized a progressive energy, and a newly politicized generation began to challenge something that 35 years of activism failed to dismantle.\n\nAcross the country, the mobilization of canvassers and grassroots activists advocating for a Yes vote has been phenomenal.\n\nThey have been contending with a No campaign that holds on to that old Ireland, one where Catholic dogma is viewed as a positive force and our status as a place where women cannot access abortion is praised as special.\n\nThe practicalities of illegal abortion are stark. On average, nine women travel from Ireland every day to Britain in order to have an abortion.\n\nAn estimated three women a day take abortion pills, bought illegally online, without medical supervision. But the shame and stigma that surrounded such a culture has been broken.\n\nOver the past few years, women have spoken out about their own experiences of traveling for abortions. Couples have talked about having to travel to England after diagnoses of fatal fetal abnormalities, couriering the remains of their babies home. Such cruelty has shattered the silence this theocratic law depends on.\n\nThe vote will be tight. But the resolve to remove the eighth amendment is strong.\n\nIn the face of a No campaign that has been emotive to the point of hysterical – graphic posters shock tourists in the capital – the Yes campaign has taken on a steely resilience.\n\nWith just days to go, a profound change may be about to happen. But more profound will be what that change is actually reflecting: a modern country that seeks to remove shackles that have bound it – and its women – for far too long.

In that video, Buttigieg leans into how he took over South Bend when he was 29 years old and claims he turned around what had been referred to as a dying city.\n\nThere's a new generation of voices emerging in our country, walking away from the politics of the past and ready to deliver on our priorities. There is no 'again' in the real world; that's not a bad thing, Buttigieg says in the video. We are ready for a fresh start.\n\nButtigieg's 2020 argument is that he would like to do the same for the country that he did for South Bend, even if he knows the odds are against him, and that the only way to accomplish change like that is through a generational shift in American politics.\n\nWhat will America look like in 2054, when I reach the age of the current president, he asked in his email to supporters. How will we look back on 2020?\n\nButtigieg, who most recently ran for chair of the Democratic National Committee after the 2016 election, has been exploring a presidential bid for over a year, moving closer with a trip to Iowa in December where he was well received by an audience of progressives in Des Moines.\n\nThe mayor, who has little national name recognition and could struggle to get attention in a crowded field including heavyweights like Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\n\nButtigieg followed up his announcement with a news conference in Washington where he told reporters that there has been a total realignment in the politics of this country and that his age would be a selling point in a crowded Democratic field. But he also acknowledged his long odds.\n\nWe are not going to be the most established, we are not going to be the most well-funded, I am obviously not stepping onto this stage as the most famous person in this conversation, he said. But I belong to a party whose characteristic has always been to look for fresh voices, new leadership and big ideas, and I think that is what 2020 is going to be about.\n\nIn an interview with CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Buttigieg said, if you are planning to be here for decades, you just look at the world a little bit differently than older candidates.\n\nI think when you run at this age, your face is your message in a lot of ways, he said. And part of what we are looking at is the idea that it's time for a new generation in American leadership.\n\nButtigieg was born and raised in South Bend and went on to attend Harvard College and later became a Rhodes scholar. After a three-year stint at the consulting firm McKinsey and Company, Buttigieg came back to Indiana and lost a race for state treasurer in 2010. The race helped him with his name recognition in the state, however, and he successfully won his first term as mayor of South Bend in 2011. Buttigieg was first deployed to Afghanistan two years later in 2013.\n\nAnother issue for the mayor's bid is how to pronounce his last name, something that has become a bit of a running joke between he and his husband, Chasten, who tweeted a list of possible pronunciations in 2018 that included boot-edge-edge, buddha-judge and boot-a-judge.\n\nOptions:\n\n\n\nboot-edge-edge\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n\nBuddha-judge\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n\nBoot-a-judge\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n\nBoo-tuh-judge — Chasten Glezman Buttigieg (@Chasten) December 17, 2018\n\n(Buttigieg's name is Maltese and roughly translates to lord of the poultry. He told reporters that people in South Bend call him Mayor Pete and that is fine with me.)\n\nButtigieg, who came out in 2015, will also be the first openly LGBTQ elected official to run for President, according to the LGBTQ Victory Fund.\n\nIn an interview with CNN in December, Buttigieg wondered if his sexuality would be an issue for more conservative Democrats.\n\nThe only way to know is to get out there, he said. I will say I got re-elected with 80% of the vote after I had come out while Mike Pence was governor of Indiana. I don't think these things decide your fate.\n\nBut the party has shifted dramatically on same-sex marriage over the last decade, with a Gallup poll in 2018 finding that 83% of Democrats support it.\n\nAnnise Parker, the openly gay former mayor of Houston and President of LGBTQ Victory Fund, called Buttigieg's announcement a historic and powerful moment for the LGBTQ community and the entire country.\n\nIn such a wide-open presidential race, Mayor Buttigieg would be a welcome contribution to the marketplace of ideas that will determine where our nation is headed in 2020 and beyond, she said. And while he is not running on his sexual orientation, his presence will undoubtedly elevate LGBTQ issues in the Democratic primary.\n\nAnd after his speech in Iowa in December, a number of attendees commented that they appreciated that he embraced who he was and made it part of his broader story.\n\nI like that Mayor Pete guy, one woman standing near the elevator was overheard by CNN. He's gay and going places.\n\nButtigieg told reporters his sexuality was a fact of life and that the race was not just about profile, but he was mindful of the fact that this just might make it a little easier for the next person who comes along.\n\nOne of the things that every person should think about in the run-up to 2020, especially because there are so many people, is that it is not only the outcome, but it is the conduct of campaigns that will make an impact on political life in our country, he said when asked about some of the response to the historic nature of his candidacy. The world is changing, but it is not changing on its own. So, if by bringing forward good ideas I can be part of chipping away at that, that is one more reason to give this a look.\n\nRepublicans quickly blasted Buttigieg's announcement, suggesting his leadership of South Bend does not merit a presidential run.\n\nBefore Buttigieg wastes time on a presidential campaign, he should focus on his town's sea of potholes and sky-high crime rate, said Michael Ahrens, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. His bid isn't just bad news for residents, it's more proof that Democrats are about to endure the most crowded, divisive, and contentious primary in history.\n\nButtigieg's first book, Shortest Way Home, will come out in March and will serve as an explanation for his longshot 2020 bid. The subtitle of the book is One mayor's challenge and a model for America's future, and the youthful-looking Buttigieg is on the cover rolling up his sleeves.\n\nButtigieg told CNN last year that despite his long odds, he felt like he had to give running for president a shot.\n\nA field that is spread very thin probably works to the advantage of a newcomer if you are very good at it, he said with a smile.

(CNN) Scroll past the teens who film themselves flossing (that's the dance , not the act of dental hygiene) and the young activists satirizing the issues of the day, and you might find a board-certified physician thrusting furiously to a Ciara song, extolling the virtues of complex carbohydrates.\n\nThat may sound like a sentence straight out of Mad Libs. It's not.\n\nMedical professionals are navigating the testy waters of TikTok , one of the most popular social media platforms in the world, en masse.\n\nThe hope is, if TikTok's primarily teen demographic doesn't get adequate health education in school, maybe they can pick up a tip or two in between all the lip syncing. Just make it funny, self-aware enough and, if possible, frame it like a meme.\n\nThey don't always get it right.\n\nHealthcare-themed TikToks that have gone viral as of late have been widely derided. A now-deleted clip from a user named Nurse Holly was widely criticized this month for stating that abstinence is the best form of STI prevention . Before that, a nurse who goes by D Rose on TikTok who mocked patients for faking their symptoms accidentally kicked off a hashtag movement that led thousands of users to share moments when their medical providers didn't believe them.\n\nAnd when a few people get it wrong, experts worry that their slip-ups, shared far and wide, could sow growing distrust in the medical profession.\n\nSocial media is absolutely an important space for medical professionals to be having conversations around things like public education, trying to combat some of the misinformation and pseudoscience that's just running rampant on all these different platforms, said Sarah Mojarad, a lecturer at the University of Southern California and science communications expert.\n\nBut people are just posting content. They're not really thinking about their role as a medical professional and how that's going to impact the public's perception of medical professionals, she told CNN.\n\nThere's no precedent for viral physicians\n\nTikTok is taking over the world, gradually in older spheres, all at once among young people. The short-form video platform is mostly populated by teens, who become its stars.\n\nBut not exclusively. The Washington Post Reese Witherspoon and Julian Castro are among the decidedly hip platform's recent additions. Now healthcare providers are getting in on the fun. All of them package their messages in bite-sized clips that almost always feature lipsyncing.\n\nIf the statistics are any indication, users with a message are doing something right by joining the platform: ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, has more than one billion active users across its apps. TikTok, already at 1 billion downloads since its 2017 rebranding, is wildly popular.\n\nBut there's never really been a precedent for what doctors can -- or should -- say in humorous videos that lampoon their profession.\n\nDr. Matthew Burke, a neurologist who teaches at the University of Toronto and has written about the dissolution of patient-physician trust , said flippant clips about healthcare, made and shared by healthcare professionals, are emblematic of a broader issue within medicine.\n\nThis is just really symptomatic of this bigger problem: The fact that patients with complex, medically unexplained symptoms ... they're often dismissed, and a lot of mainstream physicians think that patients are faking it, he told CNN. And that has gradually eroded some of the patient-physician relationships.\n\nThe public's trust in physicians has continuously waned. A 2014 Harvard School of Public Health study found that Americans are less trusting of medical professionals than residents of other countries, even if they like and trust their own provider.\n\nAnd yet for the 18th year in a row, a recent Gallup poll named nursing the most honest and ethical profession. It's a badge the American Nurses Association wears with pride -- and likely why it's encouraging nurses to think twice, and maybe three times, before posting something personal.\n\nThere's a difference between talking about what one does in their role as a nurse and mocking someone or what someone was experiencing, said Kendra McMillan, the American Nurses Association's senior policy advisor and a registered nurse. It's our responsibility to respect and value patients who are trusting us.\n\nThe Christian nurse accused of shaming patients\n\nHolly Grace, who declined to provide her full name but performs on TikTok as Nurse Holly , downloaded the app a bit over a year ago after undergoing unexpected brain surgery. She cosplays about her daily experiences at work, usually filming in her room wearing scrubs. Much of her content relates to her Christian faith.\n\nUsing humor, I performed skits highlighting some of the chaotic things nurses do throughout the day, while showing people it's OK to laugh at oneself and to make mistakes, she told CNN.\n\nHer videos are wholesome, for the most part. Though she's made clips about her brain injury, sexual abuse, depression and eating disorders. In one wordless clip , she references them all. A text bubble appears above her downtrodden face and says God helped her heal from all of them -- she brightens, then a new bubble appears -- He can heal you too.\n\nBut in her most widely criticized TikTok, Holly suggests the best way to prevent sexually transmitted infections is to stay celibate until marriage.\n\nAbstinence is one of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendations to avoid STIs, along with vaccines, condoms and mutual monogamy. But users took issue with the nurse seemingly shaming her patients, overlooking cases of STIs transmitted through rape and infidelity and relying on her moral beliefs in a clinical setting.\n\nMojarad, the USC lecturer, said to hear calls for abstinence from a registered nurse is incredibly harmful.\n\nStudies have confirmed that abstinence education in high school is just something that's not working, she said.\n\nHolly said she's made mistakes online but asserted that she doesn't insert her moral beliefs into her work.\n\nAlthough my faith-based posts are the ones I received the most harsh criticism on, my intent has never been to 'force my faith' on anyone, as I believe everyone has the right to choose what to believe for themselves, she said. These faith-based posts are simply to show others how I deal with the struggles in my life, because I know there may be others that need that hope and encouragement as well.\n\nMost of her 1.7 million followers are young girls in elementary and middle school, she told CNN.\n\nWhile (the criticism) can be difficult at times, I try to use it as a learning experience on how I can better create a positive environment and address health issues for my followers, she said. I was a young girl like them not too long ago, so I hope to show young girls that they too can persevere through difficulties.\n\nThe nurse who kicked off a movement\n\nBefore Nurse Holly's brush with controversy, there was Danyelle Rose. Also known as D Rose , she's a former Vine star who briefly quit social media to pursue nursing until a few months ago, when she took up TikTokking. She didn't share her legal name with CNN.\n\nWhere Nurse Holly's clips sometimes play like Hallmark TV movies in miniature, D Rose is irreverent and goofy, with a decidedly more adult sense of humor. She communicates with her 285,000-plus followers almost exclusively through lip syncs, and she films herself at work.\n\nIn her most infamous video, D Rose plays herself at work, dancing and chanting while a patient (whom she also plays) is dry-heaving in a hospital gown. The patient stops breathing heavily almost immediately after D Rose, dressed in her nursing scrubs, mocks her.\n\nShe tweeted the TikTok with the caption, We know when y'all are faking.\n\nWe know when y'all are faking 😂😂 pic.twitter.com/uBV9LjXN3W — D Rose (@DamnDRoseTweets) November 19, 2019\n\nThe backlash followed swiftly and furiously, spurring the hashtag #PatientsAreNotFaking . Thousands of users shared stories of loved ones who weren't believed by their doctors or nurses. In many cases, users said their diagnoses followed only after they were initially turned away.\n\nI think the video reminded some people of times they received improper care, regardless of whether it was negligence or genuine accidental misdiagnosis, she told CNN in an email. I can only speak for myself when I say that I have never worked with a medical professional whom I have felt is maliciously disregarding their patients.\n\nShe wasn't insensitive to the stories users shared, she said. She read many of them. But to say there aren't patients who fake their illnesses is not true.\n\nShe noted that much of the criticism lobbed at her involved race -- black women are significantly more likely to be stereotyped by their physicians and are more frequently diagnosed with chronic illnesses that don't always present physical symptoms, like sickle cell anemia\n\nD Rose bristles at that criticism.\n\nI myself am mixed with black, and race had absolutely nothing to do with my video, she said.\n\nThe sense of humor in the video hews closely to other clips she's posted about nursing, like those poking fun at parents who oppose vaccines and critics who say she shouldn't film TikToks at work. She said comedy has made her a better nurse.\n\nI think I'm funny, she said. My humor has helped many patients smile on what may be their worst day. I know my heart is in the right place, and I know that I love my patients. That's good enough for me.\n\nSocial media as a tool for good\n\nTikTok, it seems, has yet to be tamed by the brave medical professionals who dare to test it. But on YouTube, more doctors and nurses have successfully harnessed viral fame -- and turned it into an educational tool.\n\nJust take Dr. Mikhail Mike Varshavski, better known by the social media shorthand Doctor Mike. He's a primary care physician in New York with a massive following.\n\nLike Mojarad, he thinks medical professionals have a valuable role to play on social media. When he first started documenting life as a medical school student on Instagram and again when his profile went viral , his colleagues deemed his online presence unprofessional.\n\nNow, he says, his coworkers understand the value in what he does -- which includes debunking medical myths and packaging conversations about healthcare in palatable ways for his nearly 5 million YouTube subscribers\n\nEveryone really turned around and understood the value of what we're doing -- we're a reliable voice in the media for medicine, he told CNN. But medical ethics come first.\n\nHe's set a few ground rules for himself: He doesn't film at his workplace, and to avoid HIPAA hiccups, he omits names and changes details of his patients' injuries, genders and anything that could identify them when he's discussing cases.\n\nPerhaps the most important tip he has for physicians who are more candid about their work, he said, is staying conscious -- and cautious -- about what they post.\n\nExpect that everyone is going to see this, so if you're planning on venting, you're going to be venting not just to your colleagues but to your patients, he said. And patients consider that they're being attacked.\n\nThe American Nurses Association outlines some social media etiquette for nurses, too. And aside from the obvious, like violating HIPAA and discussing patients' private medical details and identifying characteristics, nurses are expected to observe ethically prescribed professional patient-nurse boundaries.\n\nBecause this is such a new space, there's bound to be missteps, bad actors, who say things that are toxic to the field, Varshavski said. But that doesn't mean we should throw away social media for all medical professionals.\n\nThere's room for improvement\n\nMojarad doesn't think a few mistakes with millions of views should spook healthcare professionals off social media -- she regularly engages with physicians on Twitter , polling them about best online practices.\n\nMedical professionals should be engaging with users, educating, advocating and expressing themselves in ways that show their personal autonomy, she said. She's hopeful online transparency will humanize physicians and nurses.\n\nThere are already some hopeful medical-media users who take their posts seriously. A few of them are taking advantage of TikTok's young audience to prepare viewers for an eye doctor's appointment or their first pelvic exam\n\nI think each of these cases should be looked at as an educational opportunity to learn from, she said. This is a space that's evolving. There hasn't been much training on how to navigate it. People are learning as they go.

How rich will she be after her divorce from Jeff Bezos? And how rich does she deserve to be after 25 years of marriage to the man who is now considered the world's richest?\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy of Philip Cohen Philip Cohen\n\nAs of Friday, Forbes listed Jeff's wealth as $135.6 billion. But by Washington state law the couple should evenly divide the wealth they accumulated during their marriage. Since Amazon was founded the year after their marriage, isn't his net worth more like $68 billion, as is hers?\n\nThe answer to that question depends on the meaning of marriage. Until the late 19th century, under the doctrine of coverture, US law treated married couples as one person – him. Everything they owned was his, and he ruled the roost. The history since then has been an uneven progression toward women's rights with regard to marriage – away from the idea that a married couple is a single unit.\n\nAfter granting women their right to vote, this evolution included the right to divorce, the legal recognition of marital rape as a crime, and the extension of paternal obligations to absent fathers. Through the extension of individual rights to women, marriage has become more of an arrangement between legally equivalent individuals. It's less sacred, and less oppressive to women.\n\nYet still, when a couple doesn't create their own division of property by, for example, keeping money in separate accounts or signing a prenuptial agreement, they are in essence voluntarily relinquishing some of that individual existence. And in community property states, that means it gets divided evenly in the event of divorce.\n\nThe Bezoses have lawyers; they must have known this. Maybe when you're really in love you just don't worry about a few tens of billions of dollars here and there. Whatever their logic, MacKenzie should get half of their fortune because they're married – unless they have made other arrangements.\n\nBut seriously, are we worried about either Jeff or MacKenzie Bezos?\n\nThere is a serious fairness issue here, but it doesn't have to do with whether MacKenzie ends up with $1 billion or $68 billion. It's that too many people can't realistically exercise the same individual freedom that the Bezoses have – to choose to leave a failing or abusive marriage without facing crushing economic stress or hardship.\n\nFor regular people, beyond the potential for emotional distress, divorce is expensive. It involves not only legal fees but also the costs of moving, establishing at least one new household, and possibly assuming the role of a single parent (which is costly in both time and money).\n\nWhile people may chuckle at the price Jeff is about to pay (President Trump said, I wish him luck), it is usually much more financially difficult for women than for men. The poverty rate for divorced women living with at least one child in 2018 was 19%, more than twice the rate for divorced men living with one or more children, according to calculations based on data from the Current Population Survey.\n\nHowever unfortunate their split, we don't need to worry about the Bezoses. But we should worry about two things: First, no one should be able to amass the wealth they jointly have. The reason they are so excessively rich is that taxes on the superrich are too low. Which means that, second, and not coincidentally, divorce is made harder by our insufficient social safety net and inadequate public support for raising children. And that harms women more than men. Higher taxes on the wealthiest – like the Bezoses – if applied to social programs that would benefit single parents or those who are financially strained, could make divorce much less stressful for many.\n\nIn fact, as I calculated in my book, Enduring Bonds: Inequality, Marriage, Parenting, and Everything Else That Makes Families Great and Terrible, for about half of the Bezos fortune – $62 billion – we could eliminate child poverty in the United States for an entire year by simply giving poor families money for living expenses. That wouldn't solve the problem of poverty forever, of course, but it could lighten the load for a single mom – and it provides a sense of the scale of the Bezos's wealth in relation to the very real problem of poverty.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWith more appropriate taxes on the superrich and a stronger social safety net, we could make divorce less damaging and less disadvantageous for the partner with lower earning potential or accumulated wealth – usually women. If we enhanced the social supports for parents and children – family leave, child care, health care, education and jobs with a living wage – that would help realize the unfulfilled promise of individual self-determination that we've been moving toward since the days of women's complete subordination. And it would help ensure that the people who remain married do so because they're happy, rather than because they can't afford a way out.\n\nJeff and MacKenzie Bezos have that freedom, but too many people don't.
(CNN) Hollywood gathered Sunday night to celebrate the best in television and film at the 25th annual Critics' Choice Awards.\n\nTaye Diggs returned as host of the event and made sure to keep the crowd laughing.\n\nEddie Murphy received a lifetime achievement award, while Kristen Bell, who was honored with the #SeeHer Award, moved the audience with an inspiring speech.\n\nMy immediate reaction is always to answer with words like 'strong' and 'brave' and 'powerful,' but if I'm being honest, to me, being a woman is not about being brave or being strong or being powerful. It's not about being anything specific, Bell said. It's just about giving yourself permission to be the things that you already are, which seems very easy, but it is not. Because women have been conditioned to fit into boxes; usually tiny, pretty, sparkly boxes with bows on the them.\n\nThe night's top prize for best picture went to Once Upon A Time ...

The baker argues, in part, that his cakes are his artistic expression and the government can't compel his speech.\n\nFirst Amendment principles are on the docket in cases concerning the free-speech implications of an abortion regulation in California, so called fair share fees at public sector unions, a Minnesota law that bans voters from wearing ideological clothing at polling places and a retaliatory arrest claim out of Florida. They will also hear two different cases touching on the free speech implications surrounding political gerrymandering.\n\nAll eyes will be on Justice Anthony Kennedy. The possibility of Kennedy resigning hangs over the entire court term, but he in particular has been a fierce supporter of free speech rights and is sometimes the swing vote between the four conservatives and four liberals on the court. It is possible he would want to make a mark on the future of the First Amendment before he leaves.\n\nThe court's interest also comes as President Donald Trump has triggered a broader debate on the implications of free speech. Trump has been engaged in a battle of epic proportions with the press, complaining of fake news and unfair coverage of him and the White House. With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country! Trump tweeted recently.\n\nCandidate and now President Trump has made a number of statements about the reach of the First Amendment – at times using it both as a shield and a sword – but by the end of this term the Supreme Court will have the final word the contours of the First Amendment at least in a number of important areas, said Jessica A. Levinson, who teaches constitutional law at the Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.\n\nThe First Amendment reads that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\nUniting the cases is a desire on the part of justices to more clearly define the outlines of free speech. All the cases fall broadly under the First Amendment, and they touch on different areas, Levinson said. But what unites them is the desire on the part of at least four justices to clearly define the contours of free speech and free expression in our society.\n\nRole of Anthony Kennedy\n\nOne reason for the sheer number of cases may have less to do with the individual issues and more to do with the interests and jurisprudence of Kennedy, who plays a critical role on the court and often casts the deciding vote or crafts the final language of a key opinion, said Frederick Schauer, an expert at the University of Virginia School of Law.\n\nGiven that Justice Kennedy has longstanding sympathy for free speech claims, and that other justices are especially interested in free speech issues, the good lawyer will try to frame (or bend) the facts and law of his or her case to make it a First Amendment case, Schauer said in an interview.\n\nIndeed, lawyers for Masterpiece Cakeshop baker Jack Phillips, who refused to make a cake to honor the wedding of a same sex couple because of his religious objections, brought both free exercise and free speech claims to the high court. During oral arguments, they put more emphasis on their free speech claim.\n\nThe First Amendment prohibits the government from forcing people to express messages that violate religious convictions, said Phillips' lawyer Kristen K. Waggoner. She said that Colorado ordered her client to sketch, sculpt, and hand paint cakes that celebrate a view of marriage in violation of his religious convictions.\n\nSome court watchers suspect that Kennedy, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, may step down at the end of the term next summer, and the cases could give him one last chance to make a mark on how the First Amendment is interpreted.\n\nRELATED: Anthony Kennedy loves his job – and he's still here\n\nEarlier this year, Kennedy spoke passionately about free speech when he wrote to strike down a North Carolina law that made it a felony for a registered sex offender to access a commercial social networking Web site where the sex offender knows that the site permits minor children to become members or to create or maintain personal Web pages.\n\nWith sweeping language, Kennedy wrote to foreclose access to social media altogether is to prevent the user from engaging in the legitimate exercise of First Amendment rights.\n\nKennedy said the law had gone too far restricting cites like Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin. It is unsettling to suggest that only a limited set of websites can be used even by persons who have completed their sentences. Even convicted criminals – and in some instances especially convicted criminals – might receive legitimate benefits from these means for access to the world of ideas, in particular if they seek to reform and to pursue lawful and rewarding lives.\n\nHe noted that the case was one of the first to address the relationship between the First Amendment and the modern internet.\n\nBy prohibiting sex offenders from using those websites, North Carolina with one broad stroke bars access to what for many are the principal sources for knowing current events, checking ads for employment, speaking and listening in the modern public square, and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge, he wrote.\n\nRELATED: Supreme Court decision is 'a constitutional coming out party' for social media\n\nThe opinion was 8-0 but Justice Samuel Alito, joined by the conservatives on the bench (Justice Neil Gorsuch did not participate) wrote separately to distinguish themselves from some of Kennedy's language, saying it went too far.\n\nAlito agreed the law was staggering in its reach and violated the First Amendment, but he worried about what he called the majority opinion's unnecessary rhetoric. Kennedy's language, Alito wrote, is bound to be interpreted by some to mean that the states are largely powerless to restrict even the most dangerous sexual predators from visiting any internet sites, including, for example, teenage dating sites and sites designed to permit minors to discuss personal problems with their peers.\n\n03:11 - Source: CNN Hear Supreme Court arguments about cakeshop\n\nCalifornia Abortion Notices\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom, the conservative organization that represents Phillips, is also behind an abortion-related case that the justices will hear next year. The National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, a crisis pregnancy center, opposes a California law that requires them to disseminate information about the availability of state run programs that provide abortion.\n\nCalifornia now forces licensed centers to communicate the government's message about state-funded abortions to everyone who walks in the door, the group argued in court papers. The state, they said, does not impose such compelled statements to health providers that provide or promote abortion or abortificacients.\n\nThe only ones forced by the state to speak these government messages are those who oppose abortion, they wrote.\n\nBoth Masterpiece and the NIFLA cases involve government coercion of private speech, that's the theme that runs through these cases, said David Cortman, another lawyer at the Alliance Defending Freedom.\n\nLawyers for California say the law was passed in part because some 700,000 California women become pregnant each year and over half of the pregnancies are unintended. The law, they argue, addresses problems including the fact that many women who cannot afford medical care are unaware that public programs are available to them.\n\nUnion Fees and political support\n\nThe justices will also hear a case that concerns whether non-members of public sector unions can be required to pay so called fair share fees germane to collective bargaining.\n\nCourt precedent holds that while a non-union member does not have to pay fees that go to political activities, that exemption does not include fees for issues such as employment conditions and employee grievances.\n\nThe case is brought by Mark Janus, an Illinois public sector employee who argues that the fair share fees violate his First Amendment rights.\n\nIt is a bedrock principle that, except perhaps in the rarest of circumstances, no person in this country may be compelled to subsidize speech by a third party that he or she does not wish to supportJanus' lawyers argue.\n\nUnions are carefully watching this case, fearful that the conservative majority of the court is set to overturn precedent and rule in favor of Janus.\n\nPhotos: Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy PHOTO: Eric Thayer/Getty Images Anthony Kennedy, the longest-serving member of the current Supreme Court, has announced that he will be retiring at the end of July.

The court has already heard one challenge brought by Democratic voters in Wisconsin who charged that after the last census Republican legislators drew maps unconstitutionally to benefit Republicans.\n\nLawyers for the challengers argued in part that the new maps contravene the First Amendment by penalizing these voters because of their political beliefs.\n\nThat the government may not punish or suppress speech based on disapproval of the ideas or the perspectives the speech conveys is a fundamental principle of the First Amendment, Paul M. Smith, a lawyer for the Democratic voters, argued in court briefs.\n\nWhile Smith also made claims concerning equal protection, it was the free speech aspect that seemed to attract Kennedy at oral arguments.\n\nSuppose the Court, he said, decided that this is a First Amendment issue.\n\nIn somewhat of a surprise, the court announced last week that it would hear another partisan gerrymander case out of Maryland. It's still unclear exactly why justices decided to add the case to the docket when it is already hearing the Wisconsin case.\n\nANALYSIS: Here are the most obscenely gerrymandered congressional districts in America\n\nT-shirts and retaliatory speech\n\nThe court will also hear a case about political apparel at the polling place.\n\nAndy Cilek, a Minnesota voter and executive director of the Minnesota Voters Alliance, was temporarily blocked under Minnesota law from voting because he was wearing a T-shirt that stated Don't Tread on Me at a polling place.\n\nAlthough this court has permitted campaign-free zones that prohibit campaign materials and active solicitation, it has never endorsed a ban on all political speech, lawyers for the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, who are representing Cilek, argued in court papers.\n\nLawyers for the state had urged the Supreme Court to stay out of the case and leave in place a lower court opinion that went against Cilek.\n\nThe court of appeals' legal conclusion that the interior of a polling place is a non-public forum in which speech restrictions are constitutional as long as they are reasonable and viewpoint neutral is the same conclusion reached by every court that has analyzed the issue, wrote Daniel P. Rogan of the Hennepin County Attorney's office.\n\nAnd the justices will hear a free speech case about retaliation sometime next year.\n\nFane Lozman is a critic of redevelopment efforts in Riviera Beach, Florida. During the public comment period at a City Council meeting in 2006, a presiding officer ordered his arrest. After the state's attorney declined to prosecute, Lozman brought suit arguing in part that his free speech rights were violated when the city retaliated against him for having criticized the government.\n\nChristine Farley, from American University Washington College of Law, is anxious to see what will change by the end of the term. She says that although the court, in general, is seen as having a pro-speech bent, that is not always the case.\n\nThe court protected disparaging trademarks, but not offensive license plates. It protected false claims to military medals, but not government whistleblowers' claims, she said.\n\nLevinson agreed it will be an interesting year.\n\nFor First Amendment scholars, this is like drinking water from a fire hydrant, she said.
(CNN) Ireland began its official vote count Sunday as the nation waits for a clearer picture of its future government, following an exit poll that suggested the general election ended in a three-way dead heat.\n\nThe exit poll, released as voting ended at 10 p.m. (5 p.m. ET) on Saturday, showed Taoiseach, or Prime Minister, Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael party with 22.4% of first preference votes. Sinn Féin won 22.3% while Fianna Fáil gained 22.2%.\n\nSinn Féin's leader Mary Lou McDonald has helped transform the party to attract younger voters.\n\nWith a margin of error of 1.3%, the poll meant the election was too close to call Saturday, but indicated a hung parliament was almost inevitable and that long political negotiations were ahead.\n\nThe once-marginal Sinn Féin -- which was the political wing of the IRA during its drive to force Britain out of Northern Ireland -- appears to have successfully reshaped its image. According to the exit poll by Ipsos MRBI for The Irish Times, RTÉ and others, the party has become a popular option for young Irish voters frustrated with issues such as housing unaffordability.\n\nSinn Féin -- led by Mary Lou McDonald, who took over from longtime leader Gerry Adams two years ago -- was never in the running to command the Irish Dáil, or parliament, outright and form a government. It only fielded 42 candidates, short of the 80-seat threshold. There are 160 seats in the Dáil. The speaker is automatically re-elected and not considered a lawmaker with voting rights.\n\nRead More
(CNN) —\n\nJournalist Connie Schultz, who is the wife of Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, said Sunday that the couple will know within the next two months whether or not he will launch a bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nAppearing on CNN's Reliable Sources, Schultz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist, discussed a potential run with anchor Brian Stelter.\n\nWhen do you think there will be a decision? Stelter asked.\n\nI think we're going to know within the next two months. I mean, we have to, Schultz replied, adding, And I'm not trying to be coy. I wouldn't do that to a fellow journalist, first of all.\n\nBrian, it's incremental, at least in our case, Schultz continued. How do I describe this? Think of any big decision you've made in life. Unless you're forced to make it instantly, it's something you have to get used to thinking about. I am lucky and burdened to be married to a man who will not do this if I don't wholeheartedly want to be a part of it all – he just won't. So there it is.\n\nI think we're going to know within the next two months. We have to, @ConnieSchultz says about her and her husband @SenSherrodBrown's timeline on making a decision about running for president in 2020. pic.twitter.com/czLOgmWdzE — Reliable Sources (@ReliableSources) January 6, 2019\n\nBrown is one of more than a dozen potential candidates in the upcoming race for the Democratic nomination. In a recent CNN poll, Brown scored above average on the question of electability, finishing higher up on the poll than Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who announced nearly a week ago that she was forming a committee to explore a potential 2020 bid.\n\nSchultz also told Stelter that a presidential bid can be like an earthquake for a family.\n\nConsidering running for the presidency is an earthquake in a marriage – in the best of marriages, and we have a great one, she said.\n\nShe also said that the upcoming election, in which President Donald Trump will face a challenger at the ballot box, will be a tough one.\n\nI'm much more concerned about the horrible, dirty tactics particularly of the Trump campaign, Schultz said, adding, and 'worried' might not be the word. I just anticipate that.\n\nI mean, people keep telling us – even people who are, you know, longtime activists in politics, who are trying to convince us to run, also warn us that this will be the ugliest race that perhaps we've seen in this country, Schultz said.
Former Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar listens during the sentencing phase in Eaton, County Circuit Court on January 31, 2018 in Charlotte, Michigan. Last week Nassar was sentenced in Ingham County to 40 years to 175 years in prison. The number of identified sexual abuse victims of former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar has grown to 265, a Michigan judge announced Wednesday as a final sentencing hearing commenced. Prosecutors said at least 65 victims were to confront Nassar in court, in the last of three sentencing hearings for the disgraced doctor who molested young girls and women for two decades in the guise of medical treatment. / AFP PHOTO / JEFF KOWALSKY (Photo credit should read JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nZURICH, SWITZERLAND - SEPTEMBER 22: Harvey Weinstein attends the 'Lion' premiere and opening ceremony of the 12th Zurich Film Festival at Kino Corso on September 22, 2016 in Zurich, Switzerland.

John Conyers until 2005 The House Ethics Committee announced last week it will investigate Conyers\n\n(CNN) —\n\nAnother former aide to Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan is accusing him of sexual harassment.\n\nDeanna Maher told CNN that Conyers made three sexual advances toward her when she worked for him in his district office in Detroit from 1997 to 2005.\n\nMaher says she considered telling her story over the years, but never went on the record with it until now. The Detroit-News first published her allegations Tuesday based on an interview she gave the newspaper this week. She told CNN last week that the societal moment of reckoning on issues of sexual harassment and abuse of power across the country that gave her the confidence that she would finally be believed.\n\nFor the young people that Conyers continually brought in … I can't forget them. I cannot forget them, Maher told CNN. I saw all the lives that were impacted by the system. I call it 'system' in Capitol Hill, of how these members protect each other.\n\nArnold E. Reed, a lawyer representing Conyers, told CNN on Tuesday that the Congressman does not plan to resign and denied the former staffer's allegations.\n\nMr. Conyers has indicated from day one that he hasn't done anything wrong, hasn't engaged in any type of sexual harassment with any former employee or anyone, Reed said, adding that the allegations are serious and are being taken seriously.\n\nReed reiterated that Conyers would cooperate fully with any investigation, and that the process will play itself out.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee announced last week it has opened an investigation into allegations against Conyers after Buzzfeed reported that he settled a wrongful dismissal complaint in 2015 after allegedly sexually harassing a staffer. Conyers denied wrongdoing in that case as well but acknowledged that there had been a financial settlement to that complaint.\n\nConyers stepped down from his position as top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee on Sunday.\n\nMaher, who left Conyers' office in 2005, said that Conyers office had a sexually suggestive culture that made her uncomfortable many times. She said that one of his staffers also sexually assaulted her in January 2001, forcibly kissing her.\n\nBut an FBI document obtained by Maher shared with CNN the FBI claimed she did not wish to prosecute – something she disputes.\n\nMaher made similar reports to the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in January 2004. She shared those reports and other supporting documents with CNN.\n\nThe committee said they have no comment on the reports. The FBI could immediately be reached for comment.\n\nIt wasn't until she left the office that she also began telling people that Conyers also put her in uncomfortable situations at least three times.\n\nThe first instance was in 1997, when Conyers invited her to Washington for a conference, and she realized upon arrival she had to stay in his two-bedroom hotel suite.\n\nSo I got into bed and all of the sudden, John Conyers walked into my bedroom, Maher told CNN. If you can imagine how ridiculous I looked, I put on my suitcoat. I had a suit coat on in bed. I was shaking. I was absolutely shaking. And he took off his clothes and then I figured it out: 'Oh my God. What did I do? How stupid. At my age, that I walked in and got myself into a situation like that.'\n\nMaher says she was in her 50s at the time. So, it was just silent with the TV on and I'm sitting there in bed with my suit coat on, shaking, she said. He didn't touch me, so he just stormed out of the room because I didn't say anything.\n\nShe locked the door, and the next morning got her own hotel room.\n\nMaher was one of two women who spoke out about different allegations of Conyers' misconduct to CNN's Drew Griffin in 2006. The story focused on Conyers use of Congressional staff to babysit his kids. Maher said she was forced to babysit for weeks at a time.\n\nThat babysitting incident, she later told CNN, made her feel that Conyers wanted a sexual relationship with her.\n\nBut two more incidents cemented her gut feeling, she said.\n\nIn the Spring of 1998, she said, I was instructed to drive him to the airport and he was driving erratically. … Erratically because his hand was feeling me all over my — what do you call it? — all over my abdomen.\n\nShe shoved his hand away, she said, and the incident ended when she says Conyers was stopped by police for bad driving and given a warning.\n\nAnother time, she said, she was helping him host an event in the Detroit suburb of Highland Park. She believes this was in 1999.\n\nHe walked up on a stage, and this was in front of a lot of people, and he walked up to act like he was whispering in my ear something about the town hall meeting and he stuck his hand up my dress, and whispered in my ear 'Wow, you've got great looking legs.' I don't know if anyone else there saw it. I don't know. But if anyone did see it, no one would report it.\n\nMaher said that she never reported Conyers at the time because she was afraid to lose her job.\n\nI wasn't, well, I don't want to say desperate, but I was coming out of a marriage, Maher told CNN. I had no income. I didn't settle for quite a while and I needed money to live on so I know that, that particular predicament that you're in. And it's awful, you're so vulnerable and you're willing to say OK, OK. The person says jump, you say how high.\n\nI came out relatively unscathed, luckier than most, and I felt so badly for the young people, young people that I left behind, she said.\n\nThis story has been updated and will continue to update with additional developments.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct when Maher gave an interview describing the sexual harassment she endured from Conyers.\n\nCNN's Juana Summers and Sophie Tatum contributed to this report.

(Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nRihanna claims her father and his business partner fraudulently used her name to make money and she's suing them over it.\n\nThe singer alleges that her father, Ronald Fenty, and his partner, Moses Perkins, falsely represented their company's affiliation with her.\n\nAlthough Mr. Fenty is Rihanna's father, he does not have, and never has had, authority to act on Rihanna's behalf, nor has he ever been authorized to use her name, intellectual property or publicity rights, the suit obtained by CNN reads. Similarly, neither Mr. Perkins nor the Company has any affiliation whatsoever with Rihanna.\n\nThe pair launched Fenty Entertainment, a production and talent company, in 2017.\n\nRihanna's popular Fenty Beauty line of cosmetics also launched in 2017. She has a lingerie product line as well.\n\nThe suit states that Fenty and Perkins have repeatedly been asked to stop misrepresenting themselves and to cease and desist all activity and efforts to exploit Rihanna's name and the goodwill associated with the Fenty brand.\n\nThe pair unsuccessfully attempted to register the Fenty name for a line of resort hotels, according to the suit.\n\nRihanna also alleges that Fenty and Perkins negotiated an unauthorized deal for her to perform 15 shows in Latin America for $15 million, and two 15-minute sets at Calibash at Staples Center and T-Mobile Arena for $400,000.\n\nThe singer is seeking to stop the pair from using her name or the Fenty brand, as well as damages and attorney's fees.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Rihanna talked about her complicated relationship with her father, who, she said, had a tumultuous marriage with her mother.\n\nHe taught me everything, Rihanna told Winfrey. As awful as he was to my mom at times, it didn't compare to how great he was as a father.\n\nCNN has reached out to Rihanna, Fenty and Perkins for comment.

It is broadcast to millions of people in countries that don't compete, such as the United States, Canada, New Zealand and China.\n\nPHOTO: FRANCISCO LEONG/AFP/Getty Images Estonia's Elina Nechayeva performs La Forza during the 2018 Eurovision semifinals.\n\nNow, there may be reason for more countries to participate.\n\nA new study suggests that when a nation takes part in Eurovision, it has a 13% chance of higher life satisfaction among its population compared with those who don't.\n\nThis life satisfaction may in turn benefit their physical and mental health, according Filippos Filippidis, an epidemiologist in public health at Imperial College London, who led the study published Friday in the journal BMC Public Health.\n\nHis team found that people were 4% more likely to be satisfied with their life for every increase of 10 places on the final score board – for example, if their country finished second rather than 12th.\n\nPHOTO: SERGEI SUPINSKY/AFP/Getty Images The teams of Latvia reacts as they go to final after the semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2017.\n\nHowever, doing badly in the contest was also associated with a greater increase in life satisfaction compared with not taking part at all. So, achieving nul points – a zero score – is not so bad after all.\n\nThe research backs up studies showing that hosting or succeeding in sporting fixtures like the US Super Bowl and the football World Cup can boost a city or nation's well-being and productivity.\n\nOne US study found that making the playoffs or finals in professional sporting events related to a decline in suicide in 30 US metropolitan areas between 1971 and 1990, while another found increased productivity in the city of the winning Super Bowl team.\n\nAnother study of the Olympic Games, the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship found that the feel-good factor associated with hosting football events is large and significant, although an effect on happiness was not found.\n\nIreland must have been particularly happy in the 1990s, when it won the contest seven times.\n\nPrevious high-profile wins include Swedish supergroup ABBA, who took the crown in 1974 with Waterloo; Bucks Fizz, who won for the UK with Making Your Mind Up in 1981; and Céline Dion, who won in 1988 for Switzerland.\n\nPHOTO: Independent News and Media/Getty Images Eurovision Song Contest Winner Celine Dion of Switzerland in 1988.\n\nBut David Spiegelhalter, the Winton Professor for the Public Understanding of Risk at Cambridge University, said that although it may be interesting to think of reasons for this association, he would be very skeptical of there being a causal link between the two. He was not involved in the new study.\n\nFilippidis said more research was needed to confirm the association but added that the work showed the importance of considering the unintended consequences of events that reach a wide audience.\n\nHis team – from competing countries Greece, Italy, Ireland, Australia and the UK – is usually researching the effect of public policies, environmental factors and economic conditions on people's lifestyle and health.\n\nBut last year, during the competition, they began discussing whether it could also affect a country's national well-being and decided to investigate.\n\nPHOTO: Olle Lindeborg/AFP/Getty Images Swedish pop group Abba, performs during the the Eurovision Song Contest 1974.\n\nThey collected data from the Eurobarometer survey, which included answers from over 160,000 people from 33 European countries to a question on life satisfaction taken just after the finals of the contest between 2009 and 2015. They also analyzed each country's performance in the contest, ranking those at 20th place or below as terrible.\n\nWinning was not associated with improved life satisfaction, but the higher the ranking per 10 places, the higher the odds of being very satisfied.\n\nPHOTO: Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images The audience watches the screen as they wait for results at the Eurovision Grand Final on May 14, 2017 in Kiev, Ukraine.\n\nThe scientists also compared data from countries that participated but did badly with those that didn't take part at all. They found that taking part but finishing near the bottom of the table was associated with a 13% higher chance of life satisfaction compared with not taking part in the competition.\n\nFilippidis said the results surprised him. I thought there may be something there, but the results were quite consistent across countries.\n\nIf England win the football World Cup, even if you are not interested in football, you will see that other people are happy talking about it and smiling. Being happy is contagious, and it can be the same for misery and bad moods.\n\nProfessor Mike Berry, consultant clinical forensic psychologist at Birmingham City University, wasn't involved in the study but described the work as a really interesting, amusing and well-designed study.\n\nHe added that although it did not show causation, the link with greater satisfaction sounded feasible. However, he said the problem was that the effect was fleeting.\n\nThere was a marked increase in attendance and productivity during the 1966 World Cup soccer finals in England, which England won, he explained. Workers attended factories every day, so they could talk about the various games.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nBerry was also not surprised that winning was not the important part. We just had the end of the Championship football last weekend. The teams and their fans avoiding last-minute relegation were often happier than the team that actually was promoted.\n\nIn the UK, he said, the next event hat may impact the nation's satisfaction was next week's marriage of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle.\n\nFor a few days, there will be a major increase in public mood, but more worrying the number of babies born nine months later and being named Harry or Meghan.

Phiri was the first African woman to win a prestigious World Boxing Council Gold title in 2016.\n\nHowever, her battles haven't just been in the ring.\n\nPhiri is from a poor family and she's thrown punches to patriarchy too: Catherine Phiri has said no to marriage, she has concentrated on her career and education, Malambo Frank, Phiri's headteacher, told CNN.\n\nI knew that one day… she was going to make it, said her coach Mike Zulu.\n\nIn the ring\n\nPHOTO: FINBARR O'REILLY/REUTERS/Newscom Zambia's Esther Phiri paved the way for the country's boxing boom.\n\nZambia isn't a country that instantly springs to mind when you think of boxing, unlike Cuba, USA and the UK. However, the popularity of the sport is growing fast.\n\nEsther Phiri, not related to Catherine, is an old-hand (or glove) of Zambian boxing. She's a former-welterweight world champion, and has inspired youngsters in the capital Lusaka to get into the ring.\n\nTournaments take place every Saturday for amateurs to fight in. Clubs in the city's poorer neighborhoods, like Exodus International Boxing Promotions which has five girls in the under-20 national team, use these competitions to showcase their best talent.\n\nCatherine Phiri was no different, and despite initially playing football, once she started throwing punches she didn't want to stop.\n\nJourney to the top\n\n07:27 - Source: CNN Rising Stars of female boxing\n\nI was 16 when I started boxing and before I started boxing, my passion was football but I wanted something which was individual, Phiri told CNN.\n\nPhiri was quickly picked up by boxing coaches who admired her technique and clean fighting abilities.\n\nMy colleague Chris Mulunga, he was the one who first spotted Catherine Phiri. He came to me and said: 'Mike, there's a female boxer that I think if we bring her here and she's under your tutelage, I think she can go very far,' said Zulu.\n\nAfter achieving success on the amateur circuit, Phiri turned to professional boxing. She joined a boxing club run by Christopher Malunga, and made big gains.\n\nIn 2013, she won her first World Boxing Council title fight in Lusaka, to become the African Boxing Union Bantamweight Champion.\n\nHowever her dedication to the sport meant she had previously sidelined education. I was very determined to become a world champion but by then I had no interest to be in school so that's why I chose boxing over school, said Phiri.\n\nEducation and elite sport don't always make time for each other, but Malunga insisted, and eventually persuaded her to go back to school at the age of 18 on a scholarship.\n\nHer dedication has paid off, and the hours in school didn't appear to damage her boxing prospects. Phiri is now a legend of Zambian boxing.\n\nTraining to be the best\n\n06:20 - Source: CNN Inspiring the next generation of female boxers\n\nIf you've even seen any boxing film, you'll know the lengths boxers go to to be the best. The sweat, the blood and broken noses, and the hours spent mentally and physically preparing to fight.\n\nPhiri's training routine is no different.\n\nIn amateur, I used to train once a day. As a professional boxer, at Oriental (boxing club), we train three times a day when preparing for a big fight, she said. In the morning we go for a run which is about 10 to 12 kilometers and then in the afternoon it's physical work and then at 5pm it's boxing.\n\nPhiri has broken new ground in African boxing and is now a global success. However, she wants women's boxing to have more dedicated events.\n\nFor me, what I desire most is that one day we promote only girls whereby we call it Ladies Night like they do in South Africa and East London where we see only ladies fighting on that same bill. I'm sure it will happen, looking at the girls who are coming up from amateur, it will happen, said Phiri.
San Francisco challenges state's same-sex marriage ban in court\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- The city of San Francisco Thursday filed a lawsuit against the state of California, challenging the state law that defines marriage as being between one man and one woman only, the city attorney's office said.\n\nSame-sex couples who want the opportunity to sanctify their relationships and solemnize their relationships are entitled to the same protections under the law as opposite-sex couples, said City Attorney Dennis Herrera.\n\nThe action comes one week after newly elected Mayor Gavin Newsom ordered the county clerk to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Nearly 3,000 couples have taken advantage of it, despite the filing of two lawsuits against the practice.\n\nHerrera said the grounds of the state constitutional challenge are equal protection and due process.\n\nWhat we're asking for in our declaratory relief action ... is simply that the three sections of the California Family Code, which exclude same-sex marriage, be declared unconstitutional, Herrera said.\n\nWhen asked if the state had rejected the same-sex marriage licenses as invalid, Herrera said he had not heard of any instances of that.\n\nWe've said all along we think that they're legal, he responded.\n\nThe attorney said he hopes to consolidate the cases against same-sex marriage pending against the city with the city's lawsuit against the state. A hearing on that matter is scheduled for Friday at 11 a.m. PT (2 p.m. ET).\n\nI would anticipate that this case is going to have a long life, Herrera replied when asked about the national ramifications of the city's move.\n\nOne of the suits against the city was to resume in San Francisco County Superior Court at 2 p.m. PT (5 p.m. ET) Friday. Judge Ronald Quidachay had continued the case from Tuesday. That lawsuit was filed by the Campaign for California Families and the Alliance Defense Fund, which contend the city's issuing of same-sex marriage licenses violates current state law. They asked the judge to stop the practice immediately.\n\nA separate suit, filed by the Proposition 22 Legal Defense and Education Fund, was continued until March 29 to allow city attorneys time to prepare to show cause as to why Newsom's action is allowable.\n\nAcross the street from the Superior Court is City Hall, where lines of people snaked out the front door and down the steps as gays and lesbians from inside and outside the state hurried to get their relationships validated in the eyes of the law.\n\nNewsom has said that marriage between same-sex couples is inevitable and that anything less is fundamentally wrong.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of Americans do not think same-sex marriages should be recognized as legally valid, according to a new CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll.\n\nBut the 1,006 people polled on Monday and Tuesday were almost split over whether individual states or the federal government should determine laws regarding marriages between gays or lesbians.\n\nPresident Bush Wednesday repeated his belief that marriage should be restricted to heterosexual couples, adding that he was troubled by what was happening in San Francisco.\n\nThe president said the definition of marriage should be made by the people -- not by activist judges. (Full story)\n\nRobert Tyler, of the Alliance Defense Fund said the law is on his side.\n\nWhat we're doing is right, we are on the right side of the law, he said. The mayor is on the wrong side of the law.\n\nDan Johnson, who this week married his partner of 11 years, Bill Hinson, said he doesn't want to give up his marriage license.\n\nNot without a fight. It was a wonderful feeling to get married, he said. I don't want it taken away now.\n\nSupporters of same-sex marriage say denying gay and lesbian couples marriage licenses denies them basic rights.\n\nWe're talking about state inheritance, we're talking about state property issues, we're talking about children's issues, we're talking about power of attorney, Ralph Neas, president of the group People for the American Way, said.\n\nIt's an equal protection issue. It's a fundamental civil rights issue, he added.\n\nCritics of same-sex unions say those rights can be afforded through other means, and homosexual couples don't need a marriage certificate to validate them.\n\nGenevieve Wood, vice president of the Communications Family Research Council, said that redefining marriage might be a slippery slope.\n\nIf we're going to get into redefining marriage, why would we stop at just allowing homosexual marriage? she asked.\n\nThere are people out there ... who want to engage in polygamy, they think that's a good family structure. There are others who think that group marriages are a family structure, Wood added.\n\nCNN correspondent David Mattingly contributed to this report

Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN\n\nA rare Winston Churchill painting that was gifted to US President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II and eventually made its way into actor Angelina Jolie's collection has become the most expensive painting by the former British prime minister to sell at auction, fetching nearly £8.3 million ($11.5 million) after fees.\n\nThe work, Tower of Koutoubia Mosque, was sold March 1 by the Jolie Family Collection and features the long shadows and warm tones of a sunset in Marrakech, Morroco -- a favorite subject of Churchill's to paint.\n\nThe Tower of Koutoubia Mosque, a gift for former US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was the only painting Churchill made during World War II. The work is now the most expensive Churchill painting to sell at auction. Credit: TOLGA AKMEN/AFP via Getty Images\n\nChurchill first visited Morocco in 1935 where he fell in love with the quality of light there, said Nick Orchard, head of modern British art at Christie's in London, where the auction took place. He felt that his paintings of the country were among his best.\n\nThe sale more than tripled its high estimate of £2.5 million ($3.5 million). Churchill's previous record was £1.7 million ($2.7 million) in 2014 at Sotheby's London.\n\nAccording to a source with knowledge of sale, actor Brad Pitt bought Churchill's sunset scene as a gift to Jolie in 2011. The couple separated in 2016 after two years of marriage.\n\nTower of Koutoubia Mosque is the only painting that Churchill made between 1939 and 1945, during World War II.\n\nIn January of 1943, after jointly attending the Casablanca Conference in Morroco to strategize against Nazi Germany, Churchill convinced Roosevelt to join him in nearby Marrakech and watch the sun drop behind the Atlas Mountains. Their brief sojourn together was memorialized by the painting, which Churchill created the very next day following Roosevelt's departure. After the conference, the two leaders demanded unconditional surrender from Germany, Italy and Japan -- a historic declaration that had a far-reaching impact on the war.\n\nActor Brad Pitt bought Churchill's painting for Angelina Jolie in 2011, before they married and ultimately separated after more than a decade together. Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nPitt purchased the painting from antiques dealer Bill Rau, who previously told CNN President Roosevelt's son had sold the piece to a filmmaker in the 1960s. According to Rau, the painting eventually ended up in New Orleans, where it was kept in a local family's closet for more than five decades before a family member contacted his gallery, M.S. Rau.\n\nThe painting depicts the very moment the two world leaders shared as they viewed the majestic landscape of Marrakech as the sun set over the Atlas Mountains, and to know Churchill gifted the painting to FDR after their time together excited me even more, Rau said\n\nScene at Marrakech, another Morrocan sunset work of Churchill's, sold for triple its high estimate during the same sale. Credit: courtesy Christie's\n\nChurchill began painting well into adulthood, around age 40, following a failed naval attack during World War I that cost him his title of First Lord of the Admiralty. Nevertheless, he was prolific, producing over 500 works in his lifetime.\n\nThe market for the former prime minister's art only continues to grow. In addition to Tower of Koutoubia Mosque, two other works of his overperformed at the Christie's Modern British Art evening sale.\n\nScene at Marrakech, another light-filled composition of Churchill's favorite place, went for close to £1.9 million ($2.6 million), and St Paul's Churchyard, sold at nearly £1.1 million ($1.5 million). Both sale prices were more than triple their high estimates.\n\nThe appetite for Winston Churchill's artwork was demonstrated to great effect at Christie's, Orchard said.
A file photo of President Julius Maada Bio of Sierra Leone attending a press conference on May 4, 2018.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nSierra Leone President Julius Maada Bio has declared rape and sexual violence a national emergency, following a series of cases involving minors in the country.\n\nBio said those found guilty of raping minors could face life imprisonment and directed all public hospitals to provide free medical services for victims of sexual assault.\n\nAs a nation, we must address this scourge. Sexual penetration of minors is punishable by life imprisonment, Bio said on Thursday while speaking at the State House in the capital, Freetown.\n\nThe announcement comes amid calls by activists and Sierra Leone's First Lady Fatima Bio for stricter punishment for perpetrators of sexual violence.\n\nPresident Bio said his government would work with civil societies and development partners to improve laws criminalizing rape and other forms of gender violence.\n\nReported cases of sexual-based and domestic violence have been on the rise in Sierra Leone in the last three years, with 12,029 cases reported in 2017, 11,362 in 2016, and 10,544 in 2015, according to police figures.\n\nPHOTO: ERNEST HENRY/EPA Sierra Leone first lady Fatima Bio is championing a campaign against rape and child marriage.\n\nIn December, Bio, while lending support to the Hands Off Our Girls campaign, promised to enforce stricter laws to serves as a deterrent for rape. Currently a person convicted of rape in Sierra Leone spends between five and 15 years in prison.\n\nThe campaign, which seeks to end sexual abuse against women and girls and child marriage in the country, is championed by the First Lady.\n\nMy government will ensure that men who rape have no place in society and also any man who rapes will be jailed forever so that a single rape becomes the last rape, President Bio said.\n\nHe called on citizens to join in the fight to the restore the pride and dignity of women and girls in the country.

(CNN) President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris weren't the only ones in their families to receive new titles on Wednesday after the Inauguration Day ceremonies.\n\nThere were several young faces on the US Capitol platform where Biden and Harris took their respective oaths of office, and later accompanied them as they walked onto the White House grounds -- the children of the new first and second families.\n\nThe President's grandchildren and the children in Harris' family played a special role in their campaigns. Biden's grandchildren were the ones who informed him that the presidential race had been called in his favor, a source on the campaign told CNN. And during the Democratic National Convention, Harris was officially nominated to the Democratic presidential ticket by her sister Maya, niece Meena and stepdaughter Ella Emhoff.\n\nBiden and Harris were flanked by their large families Wednesday for much of the day, and the President's family will have a presence inside the Oval Office -- a table behind the Resolute Desk was filled with photos of Biden's adult children and grandchildren, including a prominent photo showing a much younger Biden holding his son Beau, who died in 2015 at the age of 46.\n\nThis is who's who among Biden's grandchildren and Harris' stepchildren, niece and great-nieces:
Wikipedia has barred citations of The Daily Mail after editors of the online encyclopedia concluded Wednesday that the British tabloid is generally unreliable.\n\nThe decision came after a spirited, years-long debate over the Daily Mail's credibility among Wikipedia's active community of volunteer editors. The editors explained Wednesday that the decision stemmed from the Daily Mail's reputation for poor fact checking, sensationalism, and flat-out fabrication.\n\nAs a result, the Daily Mail and its online offshoot have been generally prohibited as a reference on Wikipedia, especially when other more reliable sources exist.\n\nThe editors recommended installing an edit filter that will warn editors attempting to use the Daily Mail as a reference. They also encouraged the volunteers to review the thousands of Daily Mail citations already on Wikipedia, and to remove/replace them as appropriate.\n\nA spokesman for the Daily Mail did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSuch a move is unusual for Wikipedia, which has faced its own share of scrutiny for inaccuracies. But the site has a dedicated group of editors who actively police entries for any errors or dubious citations.\n\nSome of those editors opposed the prohibition on the Daily Mail, saying the tabloid is reliable on certain topics. They also argued that singling out an individual source ignores other questionable sources that are still allowed on Wikipedia.\n\nThe Daily Mail is one of the UK's most commercially successful tabloids, and its website -- churning out upwards of 1,600 stories a day -- is the most-read online newspaper in the world. But the publication has at times been as wildly inaccurate as it is widely read.\n\nIn 2014, George Clooney ripped the Daily Mail for a story claiming that the mother of Clooney's then-fiancee, Amal Alamuddin, opposed their marriage for religious reasons. The story, littered with false claims, was eventually deleted.\n\nEarlier this week, a lawyer for First Lady Melania Trump re-filed a lawsuit against the Daily Mail over an already-retracted story detailing claims that she used to be involved in a high-end escort service.\n\nRelated: What's at stake in Melania Trump lawsuit: The first lady's reputation, earning potential\n\nBut the Daily Mail has also racked up its share of legitimate scoops over the years, including during last year's presidential race when it reported that Anthony Weiner allegedly had an online sexting relationship with a 15-year-old girl.
(LifeWire) -- When actor Richard Gere swept Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty into his arms and planted several kisses on her during an AIDS awareness event in New Delhi, the act prompted an Indian court to issue a warrant for his arrest.\n\nThough Gere's behavior was tame by American standards, it was deemed obscene in India, where such public displays of affection (also known as PDA) are frowned upon.\n\nReaction to that caress earlier this year was so intense that posters of Shetty and effigies of the Pretty Woman actor were burned. Five months later, the actress was wrongfully detained on the obscenity charges, her publicist, Dale Bhagwagar, told The Associated Press.\n\nThat kiss involved two actors at a publicity event in Asia, but even in the United States, people struggle with PDA and deciding how much is too much. And even married couples can take some heat over the issue.\n\nFormer Vice President Al Gore set off a media storm when he kissed his wife, Tipper, after accepting his party's nomination for president in 2000. It was described as a can't-wait-to-get-back-to-the-hotel-room type of kiss by Lance Morrow on Time.com.\n\nMeanwhile, so-called cuddle parties -- where adults are invited to don pajamas and enjoy platonic intimacy -- have been popping up in cities like New York and San Francisco in the past few years. Organizers like cuddleparty.com enforce a strict non-sexual code, promising a playful, social event designed for adults to explore communication, boundaries and affection, according to their Web site.\n\nHowever, PDA can be an issue for couples, especially when the twosome has different thresholds for modesty. Here's the lowdown on how to be affectionate without offending your mate or the people around you:\n\nPDA: Acceptable or tacky?\n\nDon't Miss Bollywood actress still hurting from Gere kiss\n\nBollywood actress still hurting from Gere kiss Mental Floss: 8 smooches that sort of shook the world\n\nIn moderation, and in the right venue, they're fine. Assuming that one half of the couple isn't leaving for a two-year deep-space mission, I'll say that any PDA beyond the hand-holding, arm-around-the-waist, closed-mouth-kiss type is out of order, says Charles Purdy, aka Mr. Social Grace, a Vancouver, British Columbia-based etiquette columnist and author of Urban Etiquette: Marvelous Manners for the Modern Metropolis.\n\nExtreme PDA -- hands under clothes, deep tongue kissing -- just makes the couple look incredibly immature or, possibly, drunk, Purdy adds. In other words: keep it PG-rated, kids. Don't do anything you wouldn't want your mother to see.\n\nRight place at the right time\n\nYou may think you're being sneaky, but just because it's dark in the movie theater doesn't mean it's a good place to engage in heavy petting sessions.\n\nThe problem isn't that most people don't know where PDA is tacky or inappropriate. The problem is that some people just don't care, says Purdy. When in doubt, simply pay attention to the behavior of the people around you.\n\nAn intimate dinner at a chic restaurant? Reel in your lust and keep it to longing glances or holding hands. A weekend at the Burning Man festival of art and self-expression? Let the love flow freely.\n\nHow to make it work\n\nDoes hand-holding in public make you cringe? Is your partner constantly pulling away from your kisses? Marguerite Salmon, a licensed marriage and family therapist in San Francisco, outlines a three-step plan for being in a relationship with someone whose sensitivity to PDA is not in sync with yours.\n\n1. Discuss the issue. Ask them what makes them feel uncomfortable, says Salmon. Are they averse to hand-holding, or is it just kissing? Ask them exactly which actions make them cringe, as well as which situations. Your partner may not feel comfortable openly kissing in the neighborhood where he or she works, for instance, but may not be so opposed elsewhere. Then, explain your own feelings on PDA.\n\n2. Try to understand. Mirror back what they say, says Salmon. Go for the empathic response: 'I understand why this is a big deal to you.' And then disclose why it's a big deal for you. There may be larger issues you may not be aware of. For example, your partner may not have gotten a lot of affection in past relationships, or may feel like physical closeness is equivalent to emotional closeness.\n\n3. Attempt compromise. With PDA, most people only think of the extremes -- but this shouldn't be the case. Negotiate with your partner, says Salmon. 'Can you bend a little here? Can you give me 10 degrees?', she suggests asking. And sometimes the person is able to do that. They just think they're going to have to go from being really stoic to making out on city streets. Assure your partner that it's not about going from one extreme to another; it's all about give and take.

(CNN) Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , the conservative Republican firebrand member of Congress, has drawn revulsion in Washington and among Americans just learning about her history of shocking and violent rhetoric.\n\nA fellow lawmaker, California Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez, has said he would introduce a resolution to expel her from the chamber , and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has slammed Republican leaders for not doing more to punish her. On February 4, House Democrats voted to strip her of her committee assignments\n\nBut don't look for Greene, the QAnon supporter and conspiracy theory pusher, to be run out of Congress any time soon. The system is built to respect the will of the voters in any given congressional district and unless she resigns or a supermajority of the House votes to expel her, Greene is here to stay.\n\nShe also hounded the Parkland shooting survivor turned activist David Hogg across Capitol Hill in 2019 , badgering him about school safety and telling him more guns in schools were the answer.\n\nShe's posted images of herself armed with an AR-15 , warning her political opponents to stay out of northwest Georgia -- a warning that takes on new meaning after the Capitol was stormed and now that law enforcement officials are concerned about lawmakers traveling outside Washington.\n\nAs a member of Congress, she's been among the most outspoken opponents of counting electoral votes , even after the storming of the Capitol, and is already trying to impeach President Joe Biden as a sort of counter to the impeachment effort against former President Donald Trump for inciting the riot.\n\nWhether all of that is free speech, intimidation, bullying or outright threats might be up for debate, but whether it will cost Greene her seat in Congress seems very unlikely. Congress can refuse to seat a member, a process known as exclusion, but it hasn't been utilized since the Reconstruction era.\n\nHow can a member of Congress be expelled? The Constitution gives Congress the ability to impeach federal officials and judges, but not its own members. They can only be removed by expulsion, which requires a 2/3 vote.\n\nDemocrats barely have a House majority and Republicans have not penalized Greene by removing her from committee assignments, which they did to former Iowa Rep. Steve King after his serial racist remarks in recent years.\n\nWho has Congress expelled? More common, but only barely, is expulsion, or when lawmakers kick one of their own out of the chamber. Only 20 federal lawmakers have been expelled in the history of the US (15 in the Senate and only 5 in the House). The vast majority of expulsions had to with the Civil War. There have been only two post-Civil War expulsions -- Rep. Michael Myers, a Pennsylvania Democrat, was kicked out after taking money from undercover FBI agents. The other was More common, but only barely, is expulsion, or when lawmakers kick one of their own out of the chamber. Only 20 federal lawmakers have been expelled in the history of the US (15 in the Senate and only 5 in the House). The vast majority of expulsions had to with the Civil War. There have been only two post-Civil War expulsions -- Rep. Michael Myers, a Pennsylvania Democrat, was kicked out after taking money from undercover FBI agents. The other was James Traficant , the Ohio Democrat, who was convicted of bribery charges.\n\nDoes a lawmaker have to break the law to be expelled? No. And Greene has not been charged with any crime. The Constitution gives Congress the power to set its own rules and punish members as they see fit, including expulsion, as long as 2/3 of members agree.\n\nCan voters send a crook to Congress? Sure! The custom in Congress, Sure! The custom in Congress, according to a Congressional Research Service report on the practice, is that a member should not be expelled for conduct that occurred before they took their seat; the idea being voters should get who they want. That's how David Vitter, a former Republican Louisiana senator survived a prostitution scandal. The scandal occurred while he was a House member, so the Senate Ethics Committee , after a 10-month investigation, argued he should not face serious consequences in the Senate. He was reelected a year later, but lost a subsequent run for governor. Vitter's wife, who stood by him, was appointed by Trump as a federal judge.\n\nWhat if a lawmaker is charged with a crime? Usually, rather than face expulsion, lawmakers facing criminal charges resign when they're convicted. That's what Reps. Chris Collins and Duncan Hunter did during the Trump administration. Trump later pardoned both of them. Other lawmakers stick it out and serve on Capitol Hill while standing trial. New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat, beat federal corruption charges when authorities dropped the case after a mistrial. And then he won reelection.

Bob Menendez, a Democrat, beat federal corruption charges when authorities dropped the case after a mistrial. And then he won reelection. Trump pardoned the doctor who was accused of being Menendez's co-conspriator.\n\nAgain, Greene hasn't been charged with a crime. But even if she was, it's unlikely she'd get thrown out of Congress.\n\nIs there any penalty short of expulsion? There is censure, which has been used more frequently and is less severe, since it is basically a very hard slap on the wrist, but still embarrassing.\n\nIn the Senate, there is talk of an effort to censure Trump instead of backing his conviction on impeachment charges of inciting the Capitol insurrection. Unlike Trump, if a House member is censured, they have to stand in the well of the House floor and hear their misdeeds read aloud, a sort of public shaming in front of the rest of the club. The last House member to face censure was Rep. Charles Rangel , the New York Democrat who chaired the tax writing committee but failed to pay his taxes.\n\nWhy are so few expelled? There may be a number of reasons. One reason is the Constitution, that CRS report points out, that says the people of a district or state should pick their representatives. That is an important right of voters. The people of the 14th congressional district in Georgia choose again whether Greene should represent them in November of 2022.\n\nRelated to this is the fact that, almost without fail, lawmakers who face expulsion, censure, reprimand or even criminal inquiries say it's all about politics, rather than decency of the law. The US is a country committed to free speech and an open political process, so this can be a compelling argument.\n\nAnother reason it's hard to expel a lawmaker is there's not a good ethics process in place in Congress. Both the House and Senate have ethics committees and processes in their rules. But they're notoriously slow and feckless.\n\nWhat will Republican leaders do about Greene's comments? They're going to talk to her.\n\nThese comments are deeply disturbing and Leader McCarthy plans to have a conversation with the Congresswoman about them, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, said in a statement Wednesday\n\nThe side story here is that McCarthy is also trying to get back into good graces with Trump and Trump once called Greene a rising star in the party back when he had a Twitter account.\n\nDoes Greene face any opposition at home? It's entirely up to voters who they send to Congress, and the voters of Georgia's 14th congressional district picked Greene. In fact, she ran essentially unopposed in the 2020 election, after winning a primary and primary runoff. The rural district, tucked along the Tennessee and Alabama borders, is among the most conservative in the US, according to the Cook Political Report.\n\nThe Democrat who challenged her, a political novice named Kevin Van Ausdal, ran a campaign for 31 days before being scared and intimidated out of it by QAnon supporters, and essentially fled the state as his marriage and his life fell apart. Seriously, read this Washington Post profile of his campaign\n\nThis story has been updated with the vote by House Democrats to remove Greene from committee assignments.

The Governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his State of the State address in February. Governor Abbott was joined for the press conference by Senator Paul Bettencourt and Representative Briscoe Cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in Texas\n\n(CNN) —\n\nEditor's Note: This story was originally published on February 8. The headline has been updated to reflect Amazon's February 14 announcement that it is canceling plans for a New York headquarters amid an ongoing political backlash.\n\nLanding Amazon HQ2 was supposed to be a big win for Democrats who run New York, but instead it's turned into a monstrous headache that's exposing deep political fissures inside the party.\n\nOne one side is Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who joked he'd change his name to 'Amazon' to win the company's business, and Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nOn the other is freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who on Friday declared victory amid reports that the company might be having second thoughts – and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who suggested that Amazon doesn't really need any more tax breaks.\n\nThe Amazon deal is the odd issue in US politics that can tie de Blasio and Cuomo together on one side, and Bloomberg and Ocasio-Cortez on the other.\n\nIt turns out that what some Democrats call economic improvement, others see as corporate charity.\n\nTo recap, the Internet behemoth promised billions of dollars in new tax base, tens of thousands of high-paying jobs and the honor of being home to HQ2.\n\nPolicymakers nationwide were eating from the Internet giant's hands and falling over each other to sweeten Amazon's pot with tax breaks and infrastructure improvements, all but begging Jeff Bezos to pick them and move in.\n\nIt was like a nationwide real-life season of The Bachelor, with rounds of courtship and periodic cuts. The rose was ultimately split between Queens, New York, and Crystal City in Arlington, Virginia. A smaller campus is also planned for Nashville.\n\nVirginia consummated things Tuesday when embattled Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam signed into law a $750 million incentive package.\n\nBut at least part of the resulting three-way marriage feels about as sturdy as a match made on TV.\n\nNew York is supposed to grant $1.5 billion in incentives contingent on the company creating 25,000 jobs with an average salary of $150,000.\n\nWe can't find two nickels to rub together to make the subways run on time or to build affordable housing or to build enough schools for our kids – in this very neighborhood, mind you – and yet we're showering Jeff Bezos with all this money that he clearly doesn't need, said Michael Gianaris on CNN. He's the deputy majority leader of the New York State Senate, represents Queens and has emerged as a top critic of the deal.\n\nPHOTO: DON EMMERT/AFP/Getty Images Protesters gather in Long Island City to say No to the Amazon HQ2 decision on November 14, 2018 in Long Island City, New York.\n\nHe was appointed by the Democrats who took control of the state Senate after elections in November to be on the Public Authorities Control Board, and he could ultimately have the power to essentially veto the deal, according to reports.\n\nIt was Democrats de Blasio and Cuomo who cheered the deal when it was announced. It's Democrats like Gianaris who could kill it.\n\nThe Washington Post, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Amazon was considering ditching Queens and putting the 25,000 promised jobs elsewhere.\n\nThe key line, anonymously sourced, in the Post report about Amazon's thinking:\n\nThe question is whether it's worth it if the politicians in New York don't want the project, especially with how people in Virginia have been so welcoming.\n\nOcasio-Cortez hailed the Washington Post report on Friday as a victory of the citizen over the corporation, when she tweeted a link to the Post article and added:\n\nCan everyday people come together and effectively organize against creeping overreach of one of the world's biggest corporations? Yes, they can.\n\nAmazon subsequently denied it might pull out of the deal and has said it would try to win over New Yorkers, as it did with a recent ad campaign.\n\nCriticism from the opponents is based not only on the tax incentives, which many say the company doesn't need, but also on the secretive way the deal was negotiated, outside of public view.\n\nAmazon dares to dictate to us whether our government can even talk to us about what these deals are as they are unfolding. They made the state sign a secrecy agreement. Lo and behold, when the agreement becomes known it's horrible, said Gianaris.\n\nCuomo lashed out at the state Senate on Friday, worried the deal could be in trouble.\n\nIt's a very small group of politicians who are pandering to the local politics, he said, according to the New York Post. I've never heard such an absurd situation where political pandering defeated a bona fide, sound economic development project.\n\nHe didn't acknowledge the very real concerns of local anti-development activists, who don't want to see their neighborhoods taken over and their property values explode out from under them.\n\nOpposition to the deal was clear late last month when New York City Council members had tough questions for Amazon officials at a public hearing, suggesting the company had misled about the economic benefits its new campus would bring. The council issued its own report suggesting the data on the benefits pushed by the governor and mayor was overblown.\n\nIt's not just the local politicians and strong progressives who are questioning the deal.\n\nThe former mayor, the billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who might run for President as a Democrat, had this to say, according to Politico:\n\nBut the reason they came here was not the tax breaks they got, which I didn't think they needed.

His son, Chance, confirmed King's death Saturday morning.\n\nWith profound sadness, Ora Media announces the death of our co-founder, host and friend Larry King, who passed away this morning at age 87 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, the statement said.\n\nFor 63 years and across the platforms of radio, television and digital media, Larry's many thousands of interviews, awards, and global acclaim stand as a testament to his unique and lasting talent as a broadcaster.\n\nThe statement did not give a cause of death.\n\nHe battled a number of health problems\n\nKing had been hospitalized with Covid-19 in late December at Cedars-Sinai, a source close to the family said at the time.\n\nHe battled a number of health problems over the years, suffering several heart attacks. In 1987, he underwent quintuple bypass surgery, inspiring him to establish the Larry King Cardiac Foundation to provide assistance to those without insurance.\n\nMore recently, King revealed in 2017 that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer and successfully underwent surgery to treat it. He also underwent a procedure in 2019 to address angina.\n\nKing also suffered personal loss last year when two of his adult children died within weeks of each other : Andy King, 65, suffered a heart attack and daughter Chaia King, 52, died after being diagnosed with lung cancer. King is survived by three sons, Larry, Jr., Chance and Cannon, who released a statement following their father's death.\n\nThe world knew Larry King as a great broadcaster and interviewer, but to us he was 'Dad.' He was the man who lovingly obsessed over our daily schedules and our well-being, and who took such immense pride in our accomplishments -- large, small, or imagined, their statement said.\n\nThrough it all, we knew without a doubt in the world that he loved us more than life itself. He was an amazing father, and he was fiercely loyal to those lucky enough to call him a friend. We will miss him every single day of our lives.\n\nThe sons asked that, in lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the American Heart Association or the Beverly Hills Fire Department EMS.\n\nHe interviewed every president from Ford to Obama\n\nLarry King with MLB Hall of Famer Hank Aaron\n\nIn an era filled with star newsmen, King was a giant -- among the most prominent questioners on television and a host to presidents, movie stars and world class athletes.\n\nWith an affable, easygoing demeanor that distinguished him from more intense TV interviewers, King perfected a casual approach to the Q&A format, always leaning forward and listening intently to his guests, rarely interrupting.\n\nI've never learned anything, King was fond of saying, while I was talking.\n\nCNN founder Ted Turner, in a statement, said news of King's death felt like a punch to the gut.\n\nLarry was one of my closest and dearest friends and, in my opinion, the world's greatest broadcast journalist of all time, he said. If anyone asked me what are my greatest career achievements in life, one is the creation of CNN, and the other is hiring Larry King. Like so many who worked with and knew Larry, he was a consummate professional, an amazing mentor to many and a good friend to all. The world has lost a true legend.\n\nJeff Zucker, CNN President, on Saturday acknowledged King's role in raising the network's profile around the world.\n\nWe mourn the passing of our colleague Larry King, he said in a statement.\n\nThe scrappy young man from Brooklyn had a history-making career spanning radio and television. His curiosity about the world propelled his award-winning career in broadcasting, but it was his generosity of spirit that drew the world to him. We are so proud of the 25 years he spent with CNN, where his newsmaker interviews truly put the network on the international stage. From our CNN family to Larry's, we send our thoughts and prayers, and a promise to carry on his curiosity for the world in our work.\n\nFor that quarter century, King hosted Larry King Live on CNN, a span that was highlighted by more than 30,000 interviews, including every sitting president from Gerald Ford to Barack Obama, and thousands of phone calls from viewers.\n\nWendy Walker, his longtime executive producer on the show, said King treated all of his interview subjects the same -- from heads of state to ordinary Americans.\n\nThe one thing he loved was being in front of that camera, she said. He was a very interesting man but that one hour a day, when those lights came on, he was just perfect. He treated every guest the same. It didn't matter if it was a president or somebody just off the street.\n\nKing was known for not spending time preparing for interviews, preferring instead to let his natural curiosity guide the conversations, Walker said.\n\nProbably that was the hardest part of our job -- trying to prepare him because he never wanted to be prepared, she recalled. He read all day long and watched news, so he was really informed but he really just wanted to hear his guests talk and then come up with his questions.\n\nThe show made King one of the faces of the network, and one of the most famous television journalists in the country. His column in USA Today, which ran for nearly 20 years until 2001, showcased King's distinct style in print, inviting readers down a trail of non-sequiturs that served as a window into his mind.\n\nThe most underutilized player in the NFL this year was Washington's Desmond Howard...Despite what you think of Lawrence Walsh, we will always have the need for a special prosecutor because a government cannot investigate itself, King wrote in a 1992 column.\n\nThose musings, combined with his unmistakable appearance -- oversized glasses, ever-present suspenders -- made King ripe for caricature. In the 1990s, he was portrayed on Saturday Night Live by Norm MacDonald, who channeled the USA Today column with a spot-on impersonation.\n\nJokes aside, King's influence is evident today in the generation of podcasters who have mimicked -- whether deliberate or not -- his conversational approach to interviews.\n\nA good interview — you know more than you do before you start. You should come away with maybe some of your opinions changed, King told the Los Angeles Times in 2018. You should certainly come away entertained — an interviewer is also an entertainer.\n\nHe started his media career as a disc jockey\n\nLarry King interviews Kermit and Ms. Piggy.\n\nBorn Lawrence Harvey Zeiger on November 19, 1933, in Brooklyn, New York, King was raised by two Jewish immigrants. His mother, Jennie (Gitlitz) Zeiger, was from Lithuania, while his father, Edward Zeiger, hailed from Ukraine. Edward died of a heart attack when King was 10, a memory King said he mostly blocked out.\n\nLeft to raise King and his younger brother Marty alone, Jennie Zeiger was forced to go on welfare to support her children. The death had a profound effect on King, and his mother.\n\nPrior to his death, I'd been a good student but afterwards, I just stopped being interested, King told The Guardian in a 2015 interview. It was a real blow to me. But eventually I channeled that anger because I wanted to make him and my mother proud.\n\nKing said his father had enormous influence on him, instilling in his son a sense of humor and a love of sports. And no sport drew more of King's affection than baseball.\n\nHe grew up a fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and continued to support the team after its move to Los Angeles. He was a fixture at the team's home games in Dodger Stadium, often spotted in the high-priced seats behind home plate. In 2004, King wrote a book aptly titled, Why I Love Baseball.\n\nHe was a voracious Dodgers fan, baseball fan, said longtime friend and Dodgers sportscaster Charley Steiner. And we would fuss and fight about what the Dodgers were doing. He was terribly frustrated year after year when the Dodgers would win the division, fall short in the World Series. But this year he got to see the Dodgers win the World Series. It made him enormously happy.\n\nKing's career in media began in earnest in 1957, when he took a job as a disc jockey at WAHR-AM in Miami. It was then when he made the decision to drop his surname.\n\nYou can't use Larry Zeiger, he recalled his boss at the station saying. It's too ethnic. People won't be able to spell it or remember it. You need a better name.\n\nThere was no time to think about whether this was good or bad or what my mother would say. I was going on the air in five minutes, King wrote in his 2009 autobiography.\n\nThe Miami Herald was spread out on his desk. Face-up was a full-page ad for King's Wholesale Liquors. The general manager looked down and said, 'King! How about Larry King?'\n\nHis CNN show premiered in 1985\n\nThe Dalai Lama discusses Buddism with Larry King.\n\nIt was around this time that King entered what would become a string of failed marriages. His union with Frada Miller was annulled, and the dates of his second marriage with Annette Kaye are publicly unavailable.\n\nFrom 1961-63, King was married to Alene Akins, whom he married again from 1967-71; before they re-married, King tied the knot with Mickey Sutphin in 1964 before they divorced in 1966.\n\nHe had two more divorces -- with Sharon Lepore, with whom he was married from 1976-82, and Julie Alexander, with whom he was married from 1989-92 -- before marrying his seventh wife, Shawn Southwick in 1997 at UCLA Medical Center, as he was about to undergo cardiac surgery. King filed for divorce from Southwick in 2019, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nKing remained in Miami for years, eventually getting hired as a columnist for the Miami Herald in 1965. In 1971, he was arrested in Miami on charges of grand larceny, which led to his suspension from the station and newspaper where he was employed. Although the charges were dismissed the following year, King was not re-hired, prompting him to decamp Florida and head to Louisiana, where he worked as a freelance journalist.\n\nBy 1978, King returned to Miami and to WIOD, the station where he was employed at the time of his arrest. The same year, The Larry King Show launched as a syndicated late-night radio show. It originally aired in 28 cities; within five years, it had spread to 118 cities, serving as the springboard to fame. The show won a Peabody Award in 1982.\n\nIn 1985, Larry King Live premiered on CNN, beginning a long and storied run that included a number of high-profile interviews. Throughout its more than two decades on air, the show was routinely CNN's most-watched program, and King was arguably the network's biggest star.\n\nKing left CNN in 2011, a move he expected would amount to retirement. But he kept working until his death, hosting Larry King Now, a program that aired on Ora TV, Hulu and RT America. King, it seemed, just never wanted the interview to end.\n\nI just love what I do, he said, I love asking questions, I love doing the interviews.
Editor's Note: Angelique Kidjo is a Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter. She has been a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since 2002. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nI was a very lucky girl. I grew up in Benin, West Africa, in the middle of a big family, filled with love.\n\nWe were 10 children: seven boys and three girls. Even though we were not rich – my dad worked at the post office – our life was full of joy.\n\nAs a child, I always felt a deep sense of security: The neighbors were friendly, and they would look out for us when we were out roaming the streets of Cotonou, our economic capital. Around that time, I started singing on stage in my mother's theater troupe. I was 6, and everyone thought it was cute.\n\nThen, everything changed when puberty kicked in. I suddenly felt that my fame as a singer was now a curse. Other kids in the streets would call me a prostitute and spat at me.\n\nOne day, after such an episode, I came back home, running and crying. When my grandmother asked me what was wrong, I said that I wanted to stop singing. She told me, You cannot be loved by everybody, and never let anyone define who you are and who you want to be.\n\nIn junior high school, things were no prettier. The fact that there were so few girls made us feel that we didn't belong there and that our place was in the kitchen. The boys in the school regularly bullied us. They would taunt us and try to look under our skirts.\n\nWhen a girl finishes primary education, she enters the danger zone of early marriage, which I escaped thanks to the support of my dad, who made sure all his girls attended high school.\n\nWe felt powerless because we were outnumbered, and the people running the school didn't care. I couldn't understand what was happening because I'd always been a tomboy (I used to tell my mom, When I grow up, I want to be James Brown!)\n\nThis was the moment that I – along with two of my girlfriends, Yolande and Mathilde – discovered the power of female solidarity. We were inseparable and supported each other. People called us the three musketeers.\n\nAfter another day of harassment from the boys, I asked my dad if I should get into a fight at school to defend my pride. He told me, Physical fighting won't get you anywhere. Use your brain. It is your ultimate weapon. The next day, I went to school armed with a word I had made up: Batonga.\n\nIt meant: Get off my back, I can be whoever I want to be. I told Mathilde and Yolande that the next time the boys came to taunt us, we should shout that word to confuse them. It worked.\n\nMany years later, I was appointed goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Children's Fund, known as UNICEF. I have since traveled all over Africa to promote primary education for girls. I saw its impact but understood that this, in itself, would not be enough.\n\nI truly believe in the empowerment that education brings to girls. And I believe that the strength of female solidarity will change the face of Africa.\n\nWhen a girl finishes primary education, she enters the danger zone of early marriage, which I escaped thanks to the support of my dad, who made sure all his girls attended high school.\n\nMy experience inspired me to create – with the help of Mary Louise Cohen and John Phillips – a foundation to promote secondary education for girls in Africa. The name for the foundation came naturally: Batonga.\n\nHelping adolescent girls go to school in Benin is not an easy task, but over the years, I have seen the impact that education has had on the girls.\n\nTheir confidence has increased dramatically. Traditionally in Benin, young people are not encouraged to express themselves in front of grown-ups. But lately, I've noticed a new level of assertiveness when I meet some of the girls supported by our programs. They meet in Girls Club and benefit, just like I did, from female solidarity.\n\nFemale solidarity has been a constant presence in my life, from the advice of my grandmothers to the mentorship of South African singer Miriam Makeba.\n\nThe highpoint of female solidarity for me took place on January 21, 2017, when I had the privilege of singing A Change Is Gonna Come at the Women's March in Washington in front of hundreds of thousands of people. I felt a lot less powerless on that day.\n\nI truly believe in the empowerment that education brings to girls. And I believe that the strength of female solidarity will change the face of Africa.
The cast of Jersey Shore attends the 2011 MTV Music Video Awards in Los Angeles.\n\nStory highlights Original show was a cultural phenomenon before ending in 2012 One cast member is apparently not returning\n\n(CNN) —\n\nMTV is bringing back one of its most popular reality shows, but this time there's a family feel.\n\nJersey Shore Family Vacation will reunite most of the stars of Jersey Shore, which became a pop culture phenomenon when it ran from 2009 to 2012.\n\nThe revival will feature past cast members Deena Nicole Cortese, Paul Pauly D Delvecchio, Jenni JWOWW Farley, Vinny Guadagnino, Ronnie Ortiz-Magro, Nicole Snooki Polizzi and Mike The Situation Sorrentino.\n\nMost of the old party-hard gang has moved on to bigger life events, including marriage and parenthood, but apparently that has not dampened their excitement for the reunion.\n\nPolizzi, who now has two children, shared a short teaser trailer which aired Monday night heralding the new show.\n\nThat's it, she can be heard saying in the video. It was so short!\n\nOne person who MTV hasn't announced as returning is Sammi Sweetheart Giancola. These days Giancola is a fashionista with her own online boutique, Sweetheart Styles.\n\nIn August she said on the E! series Reunion Road Trip that she had permanently ended her on-again, off-again relationship with former cast member Ortiz-Magro.\n\nThat door is closed and will remain shut for a long time, she said of their relationship.\n\nJersey Shore Family Vacation is set to air sometime in 2018.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe Supreme Court won't hear the major religious liberty case until Tuesday, but already hopeful spectators and line-holders are bearing colder temperatures equipped with sleeping bags, coolers and lawn chairs hoping to secure a rare seat in the majestic chamber for what could be one of the most important cases of the term.\n\nAt issue is a Colorado baker who refused to make a cake to celebrate a same-sex couple's marriage because he believes that God designed marriage to be between a man and a woman.\n\nThe case pits the religious liberty claims of Jack Phillips, who owns Masterpiece Cakeshop, against the couple, David Mullins and Charlie Craig, who say Phillips' actions amount to discrimination.\n\nLGBT rights advocates fear that if the Supreme Court ultimately sides with Phillips, it will diminish its own opinion from two years ago that cleared the way for same-sex marriage nationwide. Both sides agree that a ruling in favor of Masterpiece would also open the door to claims from others who engage in professional services – wedding florists, for example – to claim that their religious liberty exempts them from public accommodation laws applicable to other businesses.\n\nIt was back in 1993 that Phillips opened the bakery, knowing at the outset that there would be certain cakes he would decline to make in order to abide by his religious beliefs. I didn't want to use my artistic talents to create something that went against my Christian faith, he said in an interview, noting that he has declined to make cakes to celebrate Halloween.\n\nFlash-forward to 2012, when same-sex marriage was not yet legal in Colorado, but two men walked into the bakery.\n\nThe conversation was fairly short, Philips remembered. I went over and greeted them. We sat down at the desk where I had my wedding books open.\n\nThe men told Phillips they wanted a cake to celebrate their planned wedding, which would be performed in another state. Phillips said he knew right away that he couldn't create the product they were looking for without violating his faith.\n\nThe Bible says, 'In the beginning there was male and female,'  he said. He offered to make any other baked goods for the men.\n\nAt which point they both stormed out and left, Phillips said.\n\nThe couple filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which ruled in their favor, citing a state anti-discrimination law. Phillips took his case to the Colorado Court of Appeals, arguing that requiring him to provide a wedding cake for the couple violated his constitutional right to freedom of speech and free exercise of religion. The court held that the state anti-discrimination law was neutral and generally applicable and did not compel Masterpiece to support or endorse any particular religious view. It simply prohibited Phillips from discriminating against potential customers on account of their sexual orientation.\n\nPhillips then took his case to the Supreme Court and the justices agreed to take it up after mulling it for several weeks.\n\nIn court papers, Kristen K. Waggoner, a lawyer from the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom who is representing Phillips, argued that the First Amendment guarantees him the right to decline to make wedding cakes that celebrate marriages that are in conflict with his religious beliefs. She argued that Phillips is protected by two parts of the First Amendment: its protections of religious exercise and free speech. While she argued that the free exercise clause forbids the commission from targeting Phillips and like-minded believers for punishment, she reserved the bulk of her brief for the free speech clause, perhaps targeting potential swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has at times shown an expansive view of free speech.\n\nWaggoner argued that a person viewing one of Phillips' custom wedding cakes – his artistic expression – would understand that it celebrates and expresses support for the couple's marriage. She said the Supreme Court's compelled speech doctrine forbids the commission from demanding that artists design custom expression that conveys ideas they deem objectionable.\n\nIn the interview, Phillips said, I feel I'm being compelled to create artwork for an event – an inherently religious event – that goes against my faith, and I'm being compelled to do so under penalty of jail time and fines.\n\nNot surprisingly, Mullins and Craig see the case through an entirely different lens: discrimination.\n\nThis case is about more than us, and it's not about cakes, Mullins said in an interview. It's about the right of gay people to receive equal service.\n\nThis isn't about artistic expression, said Craig. I don't feel like we asked for a piece of art, or for him to make a statement, we simply asked him for a cake, and he denied that to us simply because of who we are.\n\nThe couple is being represented in court by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nIn essence, the bakery seeks a constitutional right to hang a sign in its shop window proclaiming, 'Wedding Cakes for Heterosexuals Only,'  the ACLU's David D. Cole wrote in briefs.\n\nCole said that whether a cake is an artistic expression is not at issue. The question, rather, is whether the Constitution grants businesses open to the public the right to violate laws against discrimination in the commercial marketplace if the business happens to sell an artistic product.\n\nThe answer, Cole contends, is no.\n\nTwenty other states and the District of Columbia likewise expressly prohibit places of public accommodation from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nThe Trump administration sides with Phillips in the case, arguing that it falls within the small set of applications of content-neutral laws that merit heightened scrutiny from the courts. A custom wedding cake is not an ordinary baked good; its function is more communicative and artistic than utilitarian, Solicitor General Noel Francisco argued. Accordingly, the government may not enact content-based laws commanding a speaker to engage in protected expression: An artist cannot be forced to paint, a musician cannot be forced to play, and a poet cannot be forced to write.\n\nBut the government lawyers did draw a line when it comes to race, arguing that laws targeting race-based discrimination may survive heightened First Amendment scrutiny in part because racial bias is a familiar and recurring evil that poses unique historical, constitutional and institutional concerns.
Cannabis is the perfect medicine for athletes, says retired NFL offensive lineman Eben Britton over the phone, stating matter-of-factly what's still, generally, considered taboo. (In the world of modern cannabis advocacy, you're never talking about weed, pot, marijuana, or [insert slang term here]. It's cannabis.)\n\nThis is not some back-alley street drug, he continues. It's a medicinal herb that provides the only potential solution to both concussions/CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and the opiate epidemic.\n\nThat hypothesis is the impetus behind Athletes For Care, a new nonprofit of which Britton—alongside 26 other athletes from the NFL, NBA, NHL and UFC—is a founding member. The organization is dedicated to promoting a holistic, alternative approach to athlete wellness, both for those still playing and retirees. Cannabis is but one part of the wellness package—albeit an important one.\n\nBob Leverone/Associated Press\n\nMany of the athletes involved, including former NFL players Eugene Monroe and Nate Jackson, already have a history of cannabis advocacy. The goal of Athletes For Care is to allow them to come together and create what Britton calls a safe space for athletes interested in alternative medicine, as well as those simply looking for support after leaving the infrastructure of professional sports.\n\nMeeting all these other athletes who are doing the same thing made me realize, 'No, I'm not crazy,' says Riley Cote, a retired NHL player and another founding member.\n\nCote and his partners at Athletes For Care may not be the minority for long or, depending on who you ask, the vocal face of a silent majority. As marijuana decriminalization becomes increasingly common and the dangers of being a professional athlete get more exposure—particularly in the NFL, where opioid abuse, painkiller abuse and concussion risks frequently grab national headlines—athletes and cannabis have entered a marriage of convenience, if nothing else.\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nIf your bread and butter is your body, you need to find a sustainable way to keep performing at a high level—I learned that the hard way, says Cote. The former Philadelphia Flyer says that because he couldn't use cannabis—his preferred form of pain management—while on the road, he started falling off track a little bit with team-supplied painkillers. If I could have done it the way I wanted, he adds, cannabis would have been the way I always managed my pain, sleep and anxiety.\n\nKarl B DeBlaker/Associated Press/Associated Press/Associated Press\n\nPlenty of athletes have apparently come to that same conclusion. Britton estimates that a minimum of 50 percent of NFL players use cannabis and says it's fairly easy not to get caught despite what the omnipresent suspensions for violating the league's substance-abuse policy would suggest.\n\nThere were guys who I'd smoke with after practice or after games, Britton says.\n\nThe league only tests once a year, randomly during the offseason, and a player needs to fail multiple tests to get suspended. If it were any more strict, Britton says, half the league would be suspended for drug use.\n\nYou can smoke as much weed as you want throughout the season—the test is just about 'protecting the shield.'\n\nThe NFL recently reached out to the NFLPA about studying the potential use of marijuana as a pain management tool, per a new report from the Washington Post. (The NFLPA was unavailable to comment on the report but has previously advocated to reform the league's policy in favor of therapeutic cannabis use.)\n\nOverreliance on painkillers isn't just an NFL issue, though, as UFC fighter Bas Rutten—another member of Athletes For Care—knows all too well. They just destroyed my life, he says of the up to eight OxyContin he was ingesting a day. I almost fell asleep behind the wheel. My blood pressure was up, I was sweating at night...finally, I said, 'I gotta stop this stuff.'\n\nRichard Vogel/Associated Press\n\nHe started consuming cannabis, specifically cannabidiols or CBDs—in other words, the non-THC, non-psychoactive part of cannabis. Rutten was an instant convert and estimates that 80 percent of UFC fighters use cannabis to recuperate. There's nothing worse than getting injured and taking a pain pill, he says now. It actually makes things worse.\n\nAnecdotally, cannabis sounds like a miracle drug. The problem is corroborating that with science, given that the plant's Schedule 1 status makes it difficult to research in a lab-controlled setting. Athletes For Care has partnered with The Lambert Center for the Study of Medicinal Cannabis and Hemp at Thomas Jefferson University to advocate for that kind of research.\n\nWe're dedicated to addressing the areas for which cannabis therapy is hyped without a whole lot of evidence to support it, says Dr. Charles Pollack, the center's director. Some of those areas are in recovery from acute injury and in dealing with and perhaps preventing chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\n\nDan Joling/Associated Press\n\nThe task of corroborating the glowing anecdotal reports is daunting: Not only do researchers need to get past the DEA's arduous review process (on that front, international researchers have an advantage), the sheer volume of ways to consume the drug means getting generalizable data will be an ongoing task. There's a tremendous amount of variation among patients and sometimes even within patients, says Dr. Pollack. We don't have enough information to make sweeping statements, other than to say that responses vary by individual and by type and route of exposure.\n\nOne of the more seductive potential uses for cannabis—at least for NFL fans—is in preventing CTE. We do know from animal models that CBD itself is neuroprotective, says Dr. Pollack, but we don't know to what extent that extends to humans.\n\nThe players, though, already believe in its potential. It's anecdotal, but I've been in over 250 fights in my life—taken a lot of head trauma, says Cote. I believe the cannabinoids I consumed while I was playing protected my brain. Adds Britton: The guys who consume cannabis through their football careers are going to be in much better shape coming out of them than the guys that don't.\n\nBrandon Magnus/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images\n\nWhat about performance—could cannabis consumption actually increase physical performance? Anecdotal evidence suggests it's possible; however, science doesn't yet support these claims. Athletes may feel better if they're high when they're playing, says Dr. Pollack, but I don't think there's any evidence whatsoever to suggest it actually improves performance.\n\nThe drug's success as an unobtrusive pain reliever, though, might make players better able to play through injuries. In the sports business, if you get hurt, someone's taking your job, says Cote. While it's not adding inches to players' vertical leaps or shaving seconds off their 40-yard dash times, if cannabis can help an athlete stay on the field pain-free without the dangerous side effects of other drugs, it's possible it has, in effect, made that person a better athlete. As the saying goes—the best ability is availability.\n\nThe theory that cannabis is a supplement that supports both physical and mental wellness hasn't been studied much, but it's something all the athletes at Athletes For Care are passionate about. Where painkillers cloud thinking, cannabis allowed me to play with a clear mind, says Britton.\n\nPreventative medicine is key, the psychoactivity of it all is just a bonus, adds Cote.\n\nThe athletes also agree (somewhat ominously) that cannabis should be used as part of a healthy lifestyle and is not a cure-all. Cannabis is a huge part of my daily regimen, Britton says. Exercise, nutrition, meditation, fasting—I'm approaching my physical and mental health from all sides because of the realities that I'm potentially facing with CTE.\n\nDavid Goldman/Associated Press\n\nIf you're imagining these athletes grabbing a bong to help get through their workouts, you've got the wrong image. Microdosing via high-CBD vaporizer pens, tinctures, topicals and capsules are far more popular options. It's in such small amounts that you hardly get any feeling besides the relief, says Cote. I have a vape that's 85 percent CBD—it makes my body feel well, adds Marvin Washington, retired NFL player and another Athletes For Care founder. When I stand up, I don't have to unwind myself. I can just stand up.\n\nThe trouble, of course, is the law. Washington is one of five plaintiffs in a just-announced lawsuit against the Department of Justice, suing for the legalization of marijuana. For Washington, who'd never consumed cannabis before learning it could be therapeutic years after he retired, the suit is personal. I'm doing it for my culture because I'm an African-American, he says. African-Americans and Caucasians consume cannabis at the same rate, but African-Americans get arrested seven times more.\n\nI'm not a criminal, and I don't want to go to federal prison for this plant, he concludes. All I want to do is help people.\n\nIn states where cannabis is legalized, though, it's a business opportunity—one that investors are all too eager to get athletes involved in. After all, if you're marketing a supplement, who better to sell it than someone who (at least from the outside) looks like the very picture of health?\n\nThere are so many fake things out there—everybody's bought stuff that doesn't work, and it's a shame, says Rutten of the current cannabis industry, still struggling to find credibility in a period with no federal regulation. The issue of less-than-above-board cannabis companies even appears on the new season of HBO's Ballers—one of the athletes on the show receives a duffel of cash to wear a hoodie that says High Powered.\n\nOne of the missions of Athletes For Care, according to Washington, is to help athletes be partners, not just endorsers [and] make sure they're dealing with reputable companies. He had an early endorsement go wrong and is committed to helping younger athletes avoid repeating his mistakes.\n\nMARTIN BERNETTI/Getty Images\n\nMore broadly, the athletes of Athletes For Care are hoping to help recent retirees adjust to life outside the game. Your whole identity was being the name on the back of the jersey, and then suddenly no one knows who you are—you realize you're just a replaceable part, says Cote. I think that's where guys struggle.\n\nWhere faith is tested, it's not unusual to encounter a considerable amount of evangelism, as evidenced by Cote's repeated use of the phrase spread the good word. But for him and the other athletes now publicly fighting to make cannabis a legal, viable alternative to dangerous prescription treatments, the effects are worth shouting about. For the athletes involved, cannabis therapy feels like a way to not just survive a career in the pros, but thrive afterward. Concludes Cote: As soon as you consume it, you become an instant believer.\n\nHe and the rest of these athletes are sure they're just ahead of the curve and are simply waiting for the leagues (and the laws) to catch up. When that happens, according to Rutten, The world's gonna be a better place, let me tell you that.
(CNN) —\n\nThe compact black pistol was tucked into the right side of Marcus Terrell Bryant's waistband when he casually strolled into a street corner MetroPCS in November 2015 in the District of Columbia.\n\nBryant made his way toward the customer service counter, swinging a plastic bag in his left hand. The sales floor was empty, except for the two young women behind the counter. The store manager was so busy counting the previous day's cash that she didn't even bother to look up as Bryant approached her coworker.\n\nWelcome to MetroPCS. How may I help you? asked Rosa Jones-Thompson.\n\nThe 22-year-old Bryant reached into his jeans, pulled out the semiautomatic handgun, and held it over the purple counter – the 9 mm barrel pointing straight at Jones-Thompson's chest. He kept his face turned left toward the manager, Veronica Bermudez.\n\nOpen the drawer and give me the money, Bryant said, waving the gun.\n\nIt was a Taurus PT111 Millennium G2. This pistol was never meant to be in Bryant's hands. Handguns are difficult to obtain legally in the nation's capital. And it's illegal anywhere in the United States for firearms to be in the hands of someone like Bryant – a convicted felon with a history of home burglary and attempted armed robbery.\n\nBut a US Defense Department employee had peddled it to a drug dealer, before it ended up in the hands of Bryant. Now he was pointing it at two young women at 2:44 p.m. on a Monday afternoon. Security camera footage captured the exchange, later verified and supplemented by CNN through interviews with two of the women.\n\nBryant ushered the women into the back office. He stood by the doorway, keeping an eye on the main lobby to make sure no one else walked in. A third coworker was in the bathroom, he was told. Bryant made his way to the bathroom door.\n\nGet out, he said.\n\nWhen Rachel Formoso cracked the door open, Bryant shoved the pistol in her face and dragged her outside, her pants still down by her ankles. Please, no! No! Formoso screamed, as her frightened coworkers stared in disbelief. Bryant let her go, but Formoso kept shrieking uncontrollably. The outside world was a blur to her.\n\nIf you scream one more time, I'm gonna shoot all you bitches down, Bryant growled. Formoso went silent, put her head down, and held her hands up.\n\nBermudez unlocked the safe and gave him a plastic bag of cash, which Bryant stuffed into his waistband.\n\nDon't tell nobody that I was here, Bryant warned them. Don't call the cops. Don't scream. Cause I'll find out if you do.\n\nHe opened the back door and disappeared into an alley with almost $6,000 in cash, according to a police report. Formoso collapsed on the floor. Bermudez ran into the bathroom, desperately hoping that the stress of the last few minutes didn't cause her to miscarry her baby boy.\n\nThe women didn't realize it, but at that moment, the stability in their lives began to unravel. Bermudez would become a recluse, unwilling to work outside her home and sending her young family spiraling into debt. Formoso would go on to develop an unshakable fear of strangers, becoming dependent on prescription drugs to fight back panic attacks.\n\nIt wasn't until three years later, while sitting down for interviews with CNN, that either of these women would give any thought to where this gun came from — or how little punishment would be dealt to the man whose black market dealings put it in Bryant's hands.\n\nA trail of crime\n\nLeonard Joseph Laraway earned a six-figure salary as an aerospace engineer, held a government security clearance, and lived in a half-million-dollar home in a leafy suburb of Richmond, Virginia with his wife and two young daughters.\n\nHe also ran a thriving side business as a black market gun dealer, purchasing and illegally selling more than 400 weapons without conducting the background checks that licensed dealers are required to perform, court documents say. He sold about about half of those guns to a crack dealer named Bobby Perkins, according to an affidavit later signed by the ATF special agent who investigated them both.\n\nAs of March of last year, nearly 130 of the guns sold by Laraway had turned up at crime scenes or in police investigations in Washington, D.C., and in Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, court records show. Guns sold by Perkins have been tied to three homicides, including that of his own cousin, federal prosecutors allege.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is responsible for conducting firearms traces, is prohibited by federal law from releasing the details of such investigations.\n\nBut CNN was able to piece together the path of some of Laraway's guns based on in-person interviews, police reports, court records, and posts on internet gun markets – showing how urban neighborhoods in Washington, D.C., were flooded with crime guns that came from a man in a wealthy suburb 90 miles away. And some of those guns left a trail of misery that spans to this day.\n\n'I was living my life in fear'\n\nIt's been more than three years since Marcus Bryant brandished one of Laraway's guns at the MetroPCS store in DC.\n\nRachel Formoso, the single mom who was dragged out of the store bathroom, still remembers the heart palpitations and uncontrollable shaking she experienced on the taxi ride back home after the robbery. When she arrived, Formoso walked straight into her 14-year-old girl's room. The mother held her daughter and began to sob.\n\nFormoso, who already suffered from anxiety attacks, grew to rely on daily doses of Zoloft and Xanax to remain functional. Her occasional visit to the therapist became a twice-a-week necessity. Overcome by distrust of strangers, she swore off public transportation and began to rely on ride-sharing services like Uber.\n\nI was terrified. I was emotionally distraught. I was living my life in fear, she later told CNN.\n\nIt wasn't until two weeks after the MetroPCS store holdup that D.C. police officers caught up with Bryant, when he flashed his gun in a residential neighborhood. He admitted to the robbery and took a plea deal.\n\nUnbeknownst to the women he had robbed, a related case was just getting started at the US District Courthouse in Richmond—United States of America v. Leonard J. Laraway.\n\nLaraway was quietly indicted on February 16, 2016. The law enforcement action received no media coverage, no press release from the US Department of Justice. Law enforcement had been investigating him for months after he purchased hundreds of weapons, many of which were being recovered by law enforcement.\n\nLaraway agreed to hand off his gun collection and help ATF agents go after Perkins, so prosecutors offered him a reduced sentence. He was allowed to keep his government job and security clearance until his case was resolved, and to continue attending the US Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, where he was obtaining a second master's degree.\n\nIn court filings, Laraway cast himself as a repentant man about to have his life ruined by the criminal case against him. He has moved his family to a less expensive residence in preparation for the impact this case will cause his family, his lawyer wrote in a court pleading.\n\nOn July 1, 2016, the Laraway family bought a second home for $307,500 – yet another two-floor, four-bedroom colonial-style home in an upscale Glen Allen residential neighborhood, according to county property records. The home is surrounded by golf courses belonging to The Dominion country club, in an area once rated most kid-friendly suburban community. This time, they placed it under the name of his wife, Yali Yin. The couple rented out the first home and moved into their second, CNN has independently confirmed.\n\nThat very week, former MetroPCS store manager Veronica Bermudez was caring for her newborn baby boy and packing up boxes at her apartment in Silver Spring, Maryland. Like her ex-coworker, the armed robbery had left her overcome by constant fear and she had become a shut-in. Unwilling to work outside the home – and unable to find an at-home job – Bermudez and her two kids relied on her husband's near-minimum wage income. Mario Armando Velazquez had already borrowed against his 401(k) to afford a few more months of rent. The family was on their way to maxing out seven credit cards that would eventually rack up $36,000 in debt to pay bills. They could no longer afford their apartment and were forced to move in with his sister. The stress nearly tore the family apart, the couple told CNN.\n\nBermudez, who struggled to breastfeed, was forced to buy baby formula with the help of the federal food stamp program Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC. But she remembers the heartbreak of watching her son Eli cry from bouts of constipation from the only brand of formula she could afford at the time.\n\nI wanted Earth's Best, the organic label. But we didn't have that kind of money. We didn't have any more options, she tells CNN.\n\nThat summer, US District Judge Henry E. Hudson convicted Laraway, who pleaded guilty to one felony count of dealing firearms without a license, and sentenced him to 18 months in prison. Laraway served less than half that – just 8 months at the minimum-security Federal Correctional Institution Petersburg just south of Richmond, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nOn May 5, 2017, the day Laraway was released from a halfway house and became a free man once again, Bermudez was celebrating a muted Cinco de Mayo and serving enchiladas and mole sauce at her sister-in-law's home. She appreciated the family bonding, but the 27-year-old mother craved independence.\n\nI felt trapped and like a failure, Bermudez tells CNN. I couldn't afford anything.\n\n'I bet he's got a nice life'\n\nLaraway, now 56, became a manager at a Wawa gas station in Virginia. He still rents out his first home, valued at $458,200. He declined to meet with CNN for this article but allowed his Richmond defense lawyer, Edwin Brooks, to speak on his behalf.\n\nThe collateral consequences have been devastating… the permanence of his conviction, the loss of his security clearance, not being able to use his training and experience, it has a lasting impact on him. He likes guns, and he can only look at pictures of them now, Brooks said of his client, noting the impact of a felony conviction. That's a permanent scarlet letter.\n\nLaraway was entirely driven by finances when he started illegally dealing guns in 2013, his lawyer explained. Laraway and his wife had recently purchased a house and had a 5-year-old girl and a baby, and he had two adult children from a previous marriage.\n\nHe was supporting his current wife's Chinese parents, and he was spending money to bring them to the United States. His Defense Department job didn't pay enough to support his upper middle-class lifestyle.\n\nLaraway now laments it all, according to Brooks: He realized belatedly it wasn't that hard to get a federal firearms license. But because so many of these guns were involved in crimes after his conviction, Laraway doesn't actually know the damage he's caused.\n\nAll of the crimes committed in the District of Columbia with Laraway's guns had extremely short time-to-crime periods, as law enforcement calls it – which is indicative of the heightened dangers of unlicensed dealing.\n\nIn the District of Columbia, the average time between a gun's purchase and its appearance in a crime is 10 years, according to internal ATF statistics. The Laraway guns identified by CNN had a time-to-crime of less than a year and a half.\n\nIn October, CNN met with the Bermudez and Formoso families at their homes in Silver Spring, Maryland. It was the first time either of them had ever heard of Laraway or Perkins. Bermudez, who has since moved her family to their own apartment but remained more than $22,000 in debt at the time of her interview, angrily pointed out the disparity between Laraway's upscale lifestyle and her own, as she struggles to pay rent.\n\nI bet he's got a nice life, she said.\n\nFormoso was shocked that Laraway received so little prison time for illegally selling more than 400 guns.\n\nTo this day, this is a nightmare to me. I feel totally unsafe. I'll live with that for the rest of my life. There's no way 18 months could be enough. He should have served more than a year for each gun he sold. He didn't care about anybody, she said. The penalty doesn't match the crime.

(CNN) -- She was a mother of three living in a small apartment and working four jobs. And then, as if in a fairy tale, she won her state's lottery last year. But the story doesn't have the happy ending you might expect.\n\nShe didn't do anything overly extravagant after the $1.3 million got slashed in taxes. She bought a house, got a new wardrobe at the Salvation Army, cut work down to just one job and invested the rest.\n\nAnd then came the phone calls: promises, marriage proposals, accusations, threats. People who used to volunteer to help her do things wanted money for their trouble. Family members, she says, tried to run her life, and control her money.\n\nSometimes I wish I could change my name and go somewhere and hide, said the woman, who asked not to be identified to prevent further attention.\n\nIt's fun to think about what you would do if you played lottery numbers that brought in millions of dollars. But, disillusioning as it may seem, big winnings can come with big costs, especially because of the greed of others, experts say.\n\nJim McCullar of Washington state, who claimed half of the Mega Millions $380 million prize Thursday, said he was initially afraid to come forward because all we saw were predators and we were afraid to do anything until we got down here with police protection.\n\nMcCullar is not going to know who to trust and whether he can even stay and live in the same hometown, said Steven Danish, professor of psychology and social and behavioral health at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nLottery winners sometimes experience high-profile misfortune. West Virginia businessman Andrew Jack Whittaker Jr. is a well-known example; he won $112 million after taxes in 2002. Among his personal tragedies since then, his granddaughter and daughter have both died, and he has allegedly been robbed several times.\n\nAnother case is Abraham Shakespeare of Florida, who was slain after winning a $31 million lottery prize. A friend was charged with murder in his death last year and has pleaded not guilty. Shakespeare, Whittaker and other unlucky winners have been featured in documentaries such as E!'s Curse of the Lottery.\n\nWinning money in a lottery isn't always a Lost-style curse, of course. Lee McDaniel, 67, of Stone Mountain, Georgia, won $5 million in the Georgia Lottery last year. He says he has seen no downsides at all and doesn't have anyone in his life after his money. He remodeled his house, bought a large RV and a Jeep, and invested a good chunk of it at low risk.\n\nAside from those material upgrades, one of the greatest parts of winning, in his view, was being able to help his sister in California, who needed a leg amputation. She would have had to live in a nursing home, but McDaniel gave her enough money to build a ramp in her own home. He and his wife also gave money to other relatives, just because they wanted to.\n\nI don't feel that I have changed. I am just very secure financially, he said.\n\nIf money could bring happiness\n\nResearch in psychology and economics has found that people do get happier as their income increases, but only up to a certain level where they are comfortable. One of the more recent studies on the subject, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last year, found life satisfaction rises with higher incomes up to a household income of about $75,000, and levels off afterward.\n\nIn general, the research on the happiness of lottery winners is mixed. A 2006 study in the Journal of Health Economics of lottery winners in Britain who won up to $200,000 found an improvement in their mental well-being two years later. But an often-referenced study from 1978, comparing 22 major lottery winners with people who did not win, found no difference in happiness levels between the two groups.\n\nThere's not an extensive amount of study in this area, but experts have a few ideas about how to make that initial thrill of winning last longer and increase overall satisfaction.\n\nHave a plan\n\nYou've probably fancifully imagined what you might do with lottery earnings, but those who do well have serious plans for where they want to be in five years. Lottery winnings can help them get there, said Danish, the psychology professor.\n\nThose who don't have clear life goals are more likely to feel overwhelmed and fumble with the money, even more than before winning, he said.\n\nBe a giver, not a lender\n\nIt's a common experience that giving away money makes people feel good, and science backs that up. A 2008 study in Science found that people were happier spending $20 on others than they were on themselves. In general, research supports the idea that people feel good when they feel they are making an impact with their money in a personal way and a sense of shame when they are stingy.\n\nIndeed, most iReporters said they would use $380 million to help the world, if they won that kind of money in the lottery.\n\nBut if someone asks you for help paying a bill, that's a different story. If a friend owes you money, and you see him or her go have a nice dinner, you feel offended, said Michael Norton, associate professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, who co-authored the Science study.\n\nWhen you become the rich person, who other people look to, it can actually erode the social bond that you have with people, because it changes your relationship from friendship into almost like a transaction, Norton said.\n\nInvest in making memories\n\nIt's a personal decision, of course, but research supports spending money on experiences rather than material possessions. Not only do going places and seeing things lead to more happiness, but experience-oriented people are better liked by others than those who are materialistic, a 2010 study found.\n\nAnd that's partly because once we buy something, we get used to having it around, and it no longer gives us the pleasure it did in the first few days following a purchase. An experience, on the other hand, can be enjoyed again and again when you remember it and tell others about it. Likewise, if you suddenly get a lot of money and spend it all at once, you might not get as much happiness as you would if you spread it out over time.\n\nIf you slowly change your lifestyle so that you keep appreciating that new money, you'll most likely be happier than if you quickly make large adjustments at once, Norton said. For example, you could make a point to take a big trip once a year, rather than putting it all into a house.\n\nAnd that might be why Harvard economist Guido Imbens found that lottery winners who received annual payouts averaging $20,000 (in 1986 dollars) were happier on average -- the recipients got to have the excitement of getting more money each year, rather than adjusting to one lump sum.\n\nDoes money change you?\n\nIt's not clear that winning money changes personality, and it's impossible to know how people's lives would have gone otherwise had they not won, Norton said.\n\nThe woman who used to work four jobs said she doesn't feel that she's changed -- but a lot of people around her have. She's grateful for what she has but feels scared to lose it.\n\nI don't know whether 'happy' is the word, she said. I'm still trying to grasp it.

This story contains images and descriptions of extremist groups and their beliefs.\n\n(CNN) Flags, signs and symbols of racist, white supremacist and extremist groups were displayed along with Trump 2020 banners and American flags at Wednesday's riot at the US Capitol.\n\nThe pictures tell part of the story of the beliefs of some of those who chose to show up on that day -- from passionate and peaceful Trump supporters to extremists who showed their hate with their symbols as well as their actions.\n\nThe mixing of the groups is one issue that experts who track extremism and hate have long been concerned about.\n\nThe certification of the election results proved to be exactly the type of event that brought together various groups and could have led to radical ideas being shared, they say. The initial event, which was heavily promoted and encouraged by President Trump, gave all of these groups something to rally around.\n\nThis was an event designed to oppose the results of a free and fair democratic election and the transition of power that would naturally follow, Mark Pitcavage, a historian and expert in extremism with the Anti-Defamation League said.\n\nCNN spoke with him to identify the symbols and understand the chilling messages of tyranny, white supremacy, anarchy, racism, anti-Semitism and hatred they portray.\n\nNoose and gallows\n\nWhile a noose on its own is often used as a form of racial intimidation, Pitcavage says he believes in this context the gallows were to suggest punishment for committing treason. It is suggesting that representatives and senators who vote to certify the election results, and possibly Vice President Pence, are committing treason and should be tried and hanged, he explains.\n\nThat treason rhetoric was seen on right-wing message boards in days leading up to the event.\n\nThree Percenters flag\n\nThe Three Percenters (also known as III%ers, 3%ers or Threepers) are part of the militia movement in the United States and are anti-government extremists, according to the ADL.\n\nLike others in the militia movement, Three Percenters view themselves as defending the American people against government tyranny.\n\nBecause many adherents to the militia movement strongly support President Trump, in recent years, Three Percenters have not been as active in opposing the federal government, directing their ire at other perceived foes, including leftists/antifa, Muslims and immigrants, according to the ADL.\n\nThe group's name comes from an inaccurate claim that only three percent of the people in the colonies armed themselves and fought against the British during the Revolutionary War.\n\nThe flag seen above is their logo on the traditional Betsy Ross flag. Pitcavage says right-wing groups (mainstream or extreme), which think of themselves as patriotic, sometimes co-opt America's first flag.\n\nRelease the Kraken flag\n\nThe flag references former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell's comments that she was going to release the Kraken. Powell falsely said she had evidence that would destroy the idea that Joe Biden won the presidency.\n\nThe Kraken, a mammoth sea creature from Scandavian folklore, has turned into a meme in circles that believe the election was stolen. The Kraken, they say, is a cache of evidence that there was widespread fraud. On social media, QAnon conspiracy and fringe sites #ReleaseTheKraken has been widely shared along with false theories of fraud.\n\nThe Proud Boys and the OK sign\n\nThe far right has co-opted the OK sign as a trolling gesture and, for some, as a symbol of white power. The ADL added that symbol to its long-standing database of slogans and symbols used by extremists.\n\nA photo from the riot at the US Capitol shows several people making the OK hand gesture.\n\nSome of the people in the photo are also seen in a livestream from the rally, where they identify themselves as members of the Proud Boys, specifically the Arizona chapter.\n\nThe man livestreaming the event moves through the crowd at the Capitol saying support your local Proud Boys.\n\nIn the video, he goes up to a group wearing orange hats and says, They wanna know what the orange hats stand for.\n\nOne man replies that it's a way to keep their group together before another chimes in: It stands for the best f*cking chapter in the best f*cking organization in the world.\n\nAsked what that organization is, the man in an orange hat declares: The Proud Boys.\n\nThe Proud Boys has been supportive of President Trump and present in large numbers at Stop The Steal rallies in Washington, DC. The Proud Boys' leader, Henry Tarrio, who goes by Enrique Tarrio, was released from police custody Tuesday on charges related to allegedly burning a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a Black church last month during protests in the city after a Stop the Steal event. Tarrio has admitted to CNN he did burn the banner. He was ordered by a local judge to stay out of DC as he awaits trial, including during this week's protests.\n\nKekistan flags\n\nThe green, white and black flag was created by some members of the 4chan online community to represent a made-up joke country named for Kek, a fictional god they also created. It has long been present at right-wing and far-right rallies.\n\nThe Kekistan flag is controversial because its design was partially derived from a Nazi-era flag; this was apparently done on purpose as a joke, Pitcavage explained. Younger right-wingers coming from the 4chan subculture (both mainstream right and extreme right) often like to display the Kekistan flag at rallies and events.\n\nAltered historic flags\n\nAltered Confederate and Gadsden flags were seen throughout the crowds at the Capitol. One Confederate battle flag variation included an image of assault rifle and the slogan Come and take it to convey an anti-gun control message. The phrase come and take it paraphrases the come and take them retort uttered by Spartan King Leonidas at the Battle of Thermopylae when the Persian King Xerxes told him and his people to lay down their spears in return for their lives, Pitcavage said.\n\nThe Gadsden flag, which is known to many as the Don't Tread on Me flag, is a traditional and historical patriotic flag dating to the American Revolution. The flag and symbol are also popular among Libertarians. But it also has been co-opted by right wing groups. Pitcavage explains that while some fly it as a symbol for patriotism, others use it as a symbol of resistance to perceived tyranny.\n\nOath Keepers\n\nA man is seen wearing an Oath Keepers hat inside the Capitol after it was breached. The Oath Keepers is a pro-Trump, far-right, anti-government group that considers itself part of the militia movement charged to protect the country and defend the constitution. The group tries to recruit members from among active or retired military, first responders, or police.\n\nTheir leader has spouted vast conspiracy theories on his blog, accused Democrats of stealing the election, previously threatened violence if it was necessary on Election Day during an interview with far-right conspiracist Alex Jones and said his group would be armed to protect the White House if necessary, according to the ADL.\n\nThe Confederate flag\n\nDuring the United States' long Civil War, no Confederate battle flag came within the shadow of the US Capitol, but on Wednesday, an insurrectionist carried one right through its halls.\n\nPhotographers captured a man carrying it past the portraits of abolitionist Charles Sumner and slaveholder John Calhoun.\n\nThe flag was always a symbol of support for slavery. After World War II, it became a prominent symbol of Jim Crow and segregation, Pitcavage says not surprisingly, it is a popular symbol among white supremacists -- even outside the United States.\n\nAmerica First flag\n\nA rioter cloaks himself in an America First flag with the logo of the podcast by far-right commentator Nick Fuentes. Fuentes attended the event at the Capitol, but was photographed remaining outside the Capitol building.\n\nAmerica First was also a slogan President Trump used in describing his foreign policy . Its adoption was criticized by the ADL, which said it had an anti-Semitic use seeking to keep the US out of World War II.\n\nThe ADL says Fuentes is part of the groyper army, which the ADL calls a white supremacist group.\n\nWhile the group and leadership's views align with those held by the white supremacist alt right, groypers attempt to normalize their ideology by aligning themselves with 'Christianity' and 'traditional' values ostensibly championed by the church, including marriage and family, the ADL explains. Like the alt right and other white supremacists, groypers believe they are working to defend against demographic and cultural changes that are destroying the 'true America' -- a white, Christian nation.\n\nCamp Auschwitz\n\nA rioter inside the Capitol wore a Camp Auschwitz sweatshirt. The bottom of the shirt reads Work brings freedom, which is the rough translation of the words Arbeit macht frei on the gates of the Nazi concentration camp. Auschwitz was the largest and most infamous Nazi concentration camp, where about 1.1 million people were killed during World War II.\n\nPitcavage says he believes the shirt came from the now-defunct website Aryanwear. The design, which has been around for about 10 years according to Pitcavage, has been popping up on differing websites in recent weeks, though it is often taken down when a complaint is made.\n\nNationalist Social Club stickers\n\nA social media image shows Nationalist Social Club stickers on what appears to be US Capitol Police equipment It's unclear when the photo was taken, but it was posted Wednesday in a Telegram chat the group uses, which includes a Nazi symbol as part of their name.\n\nNSC, apparently a word play on the National Socialists or Nazi party, is a neo-Nazi group that has regional chapters in both the United States and across the globe, according to the ADL . It is unclear if the sticker on the right refers to a New England chapter, or because the group originally called itself the New England Nationalists Club.\n\nNSC members see themselves as soldiers at war with a hostile, Jewish-controlled system that is deliberately plotting the extinction of the white race, according to the ADL. Their goal is to form an underground network of white men who are willing to fight against their perceived enemies through localized direct actions.\n\nMAGA Civil War January 6, 2021 shirts\n\nThere are still many questions about how exactly the attack on the Capitol happened and who led the charge. But the calls for overthrowing the government and for a civil or race war have long been rallying cries in far-right circles.\n\nThe shirts worn by these men on the Capitol grounds on Wednesday show there was at least an intention to commemorate the day. They wore pre-printed shirts, referencing Trump's signature Make America Great Again slogan, alongside the words Civil war and the date of the event that turned into insurrection.\n\nMany commenters in far-right forums have written since the attack, that this is just the beginning of that civil war that many of them have long desired.\n\nUpdate note: This story has been updated with new CNN reporting on the men pictured in orange hats who say they are affiliated with the Proud boys.
(CNN) The Oscar race is viewed as more wide-open than usual, thanks in part to the absence of a completely dominant frontrunner, as well as hurdles that some key contenders would have to overcome in history-making fashion.\n\nWith the entertainment industry at a crossroads, whichever movie walks away with the Academy Award -- selections are always fraught with a certain level of symbolism -- will say something about the present state of the movie business.\n\nThe suspense surrounding best picture is also heightened, seemingly, by a sense that the acting races are pretty close to sure things. While the Los Angeles Times probably overreached in proclaiming those categories settled -- ask Glenn Close about last year's awards -- based on all the ceremonies leading up to the Oscars, it would be a major surprise not to hear the names Joaquin Phoenix, Renee Zellweger, Brad Pitt and Laura Dern called on Sunday night.\n\nSo what will the lesson be from this year's Oscars? That depends on what wins, which will send a message, intended or not, breaking down what's special, unique or merely notable about each the best-picture contenders.\n\nThe candidates are listed in descending order from those predicted as being most likely to win to the least. And needless to say, it's an honor just to be nominated:\n\n1917\n\n'1917'\n\nThe least surprising choice, based on wins at the Directors Guild Awards, Golden Globes and BAFTAs , would also represent one of the less significant picks, historically speaking.\n\nThat's because director Sam Mendes' tale of World War I heroism is, basically, old wine in a new bottle -- a familiar war story, filmed to look like one continuous shot, an act of supreme technical virtuosity that would be a gimmick if the story didn't hold together so well.\n\nThe filming technique -- putting the viewer over the main character's shoulder in an action vehicle of this scope -- does feel incredibly immersive, in an age of 3-D, Imax and virtual reality. Does that mean we'll see more experiments with perspective if 1917 emerges victorious? Not necessarily, but if they're this executed this well, bring them on.\n\nParasite\n\nSun-kyun Lee and Yeo-jeong Jo in 'Parasite.'\n\nDirector Bong Joon-ho's twisty thriller would be the first foreign-language film to win best picture (it's only the 11th nominated in the Oscars' 92-year history). That would not only recognize the increasingly global nature of the movie business but also acclaimed work out of Asia, which many feel hasn't received the attention it's due.\n\nOnce Upon a Time ... in Hollywood\n\n'Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood'\n\nBeyond giving Quentin Tarantino his first best-picture win (he has two Oscars for screenwriting), recognizing this tale built around the Manson family and a mix of fictional and real characters would send the least surprising messages of all: That Hollywood remains a sucker for stories about itself.\n\nSeparately, it would also reinforce the value in old-fashioned star power -- exemplified here by the Leonardo DiCaprio-Brad Pitt pairing, and also true of Matt Damon and Christian Bale in Ford v. Ferrari.\n\nThe Irishman\n\nRobert De Niro and Joe Pesci in 'The Irishman.'\n\nNetflix keeps grinding away at the movie business in a bid for attention and prestige -- in this case, throwing a pot of money at director Martin Scorsese when no one else would. The result: A 3 ½-hour gangster epic that's beautifully done , but which easily could be confused for a streaming miniseries were it not for all those stars.\n\nIf The Irishman wins, Netflix's gamble has paid off. If not, the service clearly has more work to do -- and money to spend -- to prove its movies, which make a fleeting stop in theaters en route to TV, are deserving of not just an invitation to the Academy Awards party but a seat at the head table.\n\nJoker\n\nJoaquin Phoenix in 'Joker.'\n\nThe comic-book movie curse has been broken thanks to nominations for Marvel's Black Panther and now DC's dark drama in back-to-back years, but there's still resistance to fully welcoming such fare to the awards cavalcade. (Otherwise, Avengers: Endgame might be on this list.)\n\nYet if Joker would technically be the first movie derived from comics to earn best picture, the gritty nature of the R-rated film -- more Taxi Driver than even the darkest Batman movie -- would seem to come with a bit of an asterisk.\n\n'Marriage Story'\n\n'Marriage Story'\n\nBeyond the aforementioned Netflix of it all, well, who knows more about messy divorces and custody battles than the shakers and movers in Hollywood?\n\n'Jojo Rabbit'\n\n'Jojo Rabbit'\n\nBilled as an anti-hate satire, Taika Waititi's tale of a German boy and his imaginary friend Hitler (played by the director) feels like a big long shot, but the nomination alone reveals an openness to the kind of quirky, distinctive film that studios seldom make anymore, from an entity (what was Fox Searchlight) that has since been absorbed and renamed by Disney.\n\n'Little Women'\n\nEmma Watson, Florence Pugh, Saoirse Ronan and Eliza Scanlen in 'Little Women'\n\nGreta Gerwig's novel approach to retelling Louisa May Alcott's classic tale has been both a critical and commercial success. A best picture win would provide further validation of a gifted young female filmmaker overlooked in the director category, with an adapted screenplay Oscar possibly serving as what many will view as a concession prize.\n\n'Ford v. Ferrari'\n\n'Ford v. Ferrari'\n\nMore than any other nominee, this fact-based tale about race-car driving in the 1960s feels like a happy throwback to the character-driven studio dramas of yore, and its success -- along with that of Once Upon a Time and Knives Out -- indicates an audience appetite for such movies that will hopefully inspire the studios to make more. As unlikely as a victory appears, such an upset would underscore the extent to which Oscar voters feel that hunger too.\n\nThe 92nd Academy Awards air Feb. 9 on ABC.

Kamala Harris announced that she will run for president in 2020. Almost immediately, headlines appeared declaring her the female Barack Obama. Like many other prominent women, she is – wrongly and inaccurately to boot – best known as a derivative of a more-famous predecessor.\n\nPHOTO: Holly Thomas Holly Thomas\n\nThere are similarities between Harris and Obama, to be sure. Both are Democrats, both have a background in law, both have a mixed-race background. There is an obvious convenience to the comparison. It neatly captures the public imagination at a time when Harris is yet to be world famous, but is charismatic, on the rise and prepared to challenge President Donald Trump, while Obama's name continues to conjure a nostalgic, anti-Trump emotion.\n\nIt makes superficial sense. But it's also symptomatic of a lazy habit that infantilizes high-profile women in America and abroad, and skims over the personal details and unique circumstances that shaped them.\n\nKamala Harris is the first Indian-American woman to have a seat in the US Senate. She was also the first woman, black, Indian-American or South Asian, to serve as district attorney of San Francisco, and as California's attorney general. The most famous instance of public sexism she faced before announcing her presidential bid occurred in 2013, when none other than Barack Obama called her the best-looking attorney general. Obama later apologized to Harris after the remark was widely criticized (rightly) as sexist.\n\nThe two are very different political beings. Obama, with some liberal moves such as reduced sentences for drug offenses aside, did not make prison reform a priority, and was against mass incarceration. But the prison system is a subject close to Harris' heart.\n\nDespite personal reservations, she promised to defend the death penalty in California as attorney general, and proved herself an often harsh prosecutor, favoring long periods of imprisonment. In other areas, Harris has positioned herself further to the left than the former President. Those only aware of her overlap with Obama might make assumptions about her attitudes elsewhere, which would turn out to be untrue.\n\nHarris is far from the only female politician to receive this media treatment – and that treatment isn't always limited to comparisons to more famous men (though admittedly that's overwhelmingly the case when it comes to world leaders).\n\nTake Theresa May. Coverage of the British Prime Minister is regularly peppered with references to Margaret Thatcher. Throughout her negotiations over the Brexit deal in Brussels, Belgium, in December, newspapers referred to May's handbag-wielding Maggie moments – Thatcher's handbag being the mythical weapon with which she would supposedly clobber her opposition.\n\nConsidering Margaret Thatcher was in favor of Europe, fought for Britain's interests within the EU, and for Britain to strengthen its position as a member of the EU, this likeness is especially ironic.\n\nTheresa May's Brexit strategy has been to make determined noises while championing a cause – leaving the EU – she campaigned and voted against, and she consistently makes zero productive headway with it. Her predecessor David Cameron's negotiation of the ultimately null EU reform deal in 2016 was far more Thatcheresque in its intention and execution (even if the referendum he called subsequently was not). Coverage of his doings, however, didn't call him Maggie – or indeed, refer to other male PMs who went before him. When he acted in his own name, he was treated as such.\n\nThe fudging of political personalities can be derogatory in both directions, depending on individual sympathies. When Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer succeeded Angela Merkel as leader of Germany's Christian Democratic Union last year, she noted the commentary describing her as a mini Merkel, or Merkel 2.0.\n\nI have read a lot about what I am and who I am, she told her party. Mini, a copy, simply 'more of the same.' Dear delegates, I stand before you as I am and as life made me, and I am proud of that.\n\nThe attention paid to Kramp-Karrenbauer's likeness to Merkel distracts from the future implications of her attitudes for the country, and indeed, Europe at large. Kramp-Karrenbauer is extremely conservative on same-sex marriage, and has likened it to incest in the past. Her stance on migration is also vastly stricter than Merkel's, and she has made it clear she is keen to dial down the more liberal attitude exhibited by the party in the last decade.\n\nWhile Merkel's political career was catalyzed by the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification, Kramp-Karrenbauer's has been forged in the wake of Merkel's. That by definition gives her an adapted frame of reference, which merits its own scrutiny.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nEvery politician – every person – is a product of their own time and place. In the coming months, it looks quite possible that Kamala Harris might win Obama's endorsement of her bid for president.\n\nIf she does, the comparisons between the two are likely to reignite. As with May and Kramp-Karrenbauer, those watching would do better to pay attention to the political landscape Harris is working within now, rather than any nostalgic connotations. The president whose footsteps are most pertinent to Harris, the president who she will be measured against should she prevail against her fellow Democratic candidates, is Donald Trump.\n\nIf she finds herself competing with him, the very least Harris deserves, the very least the voting public deserves, is to be judged as an adult in her own right, running under her own name.

But he will not be buried in the plot next to hers, breaking a centuries-old royal tradition.\n\nThe 83-year-old prince, who was hospitalized in January with a lung infection after being diagnosed with dementia last September, had previously said he did not wish to be buried beside his wife over the refusal to name him king.\n\nThe French-born prince has been unhappy with his title since being named prince consort – rather than king consort – upon the couple's marriage in 1967.\n\nPHOTO: AFP/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Prince Henrik and Queen Margrethe pictured celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary in 2007.\n\nIt is no secret that the prince for many years has been unhappy with his role and the title he has been awarded in the Danish monarchy. This discontent has grown more and more in recent years, the palace's communications chief, Lene Balleby, told Danish tabloid BT in August last year.\n\nFor the prince, the decision not to be buried beside the queen is the natural consequence of not having been treated equally to his spouse – by not having the title and role he has desired.\n\nPHOTO: Luca V.

(CNN) Concerns beyond Hollywood took center stage at the 77th annual Golden Globe Awards, with presenters and winners citing the bushfires in Australia and the need to address the climate crisis, possible war with Iran and abortion rights during Sunday's event in Beverly Hills.\n\nAs to the business at hand, the World War I epic 1917 and Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood took best drama and musical or comedy. The latter added to its haul with wins for writer-director Quentin Tarantino and Brad Pitt for screenplay and supporting actor, respectively, its three awards more than any other film.\n\nIn one of the most closely watched contests, 1917 director Sam Mendes won as well, which should give the film a boost both in the Oscar race and as it heads into wide theatrical release on Jan. 10.\n\n'1917'\n\nThe Globes have a reputation for favoring big movie stars and international talent, and that generally held to form, in a night where the selections were eclectic as usual. Netflix, notably, also had a limited impact on the film categories, despite its strong nomination performance with The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix delivered a scattered speech -- peppered with a few bleeped expletives, and a call for action about climate change -- in claiming the drama acting prize for Joker, one of the few blockbusters among the roster of movie winners.

Forced to marry at 15, Hussein ran away from home and sought refuge with her aunt for three years. She was tricked into returning by her father, who handed her over to her husband's family.\n\nOpinion: In the US and Sudan, women face similar hurdle\n\nActivists said Sudanese security forces went to the office of Hussein's lead attorney on Wednesday and prevented him from holding a news conference, in what activists described as an intensifying campaign of intimidation.\n\nUN Women, the United Nations Population Fund and the UN Office of the Special Adviser on Africa have called for clemency, along with thousands of people who signed an online petition calling for Hussein not to be executed.\n\nThe US State Department said it is closely following the case. But it stopped short of opposing the death penalty.\n\nWe echo the statements of many in the international community and within Sudan, condemning early and forced marriage and violence against women and girls.\n\nWe have raised this case with the government of Sudan, and note that it is still going through a judicial process; we look forward to an appropriate resolution of her case, consistent with Sudan's international human rights obligations.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, a spokesman for UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he disagrees with the sentence.\n\nThe secretary-general opposes the death penalty on principle and is against the death penalty ruling that was handed down in this case, spokesman Farhan Haq told CNN.\n\nCNN's Eliza Mackintosh, Richard Roth, Laura Koran, Radina Gigova and Deepa Agarwal contributed reporting.

We have had to ration care and make decisions about who is considered an urgent or emergent case.\n\nBacha explains that nurses have been deployed to care for coronavirus patients, and that safety gear is scarce.\n\nThe lack of Personal Protective Equipment is galling.

(GREG BAKER/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe night they fled, Reem and Rawan didn't dare sleep.\n\nIt was September 6, 2018. The two Saudi sisters were on a family vacation in Colombo, Sri Lanka. For weeks, they had helped their mother organize the trip, feigning excitement at the possibility of two weeks away from Riyadh, but knowing that if all went to plan, they'd never go back.\n\nFailure was not an option. Every step of their escape from Saudi Arabia carried the threat of severe punishment or death.\n\nWe knew the first time, if it's not perfect, it will be the last time, Reem says.\n\nCNN has changed the sisters' names and is not showing their faces, at their request for their safety.\n\nThe sisters say years of strict Islamic teaching and physical abuse at home had convinced them that they had no future in a society that places women under the enforced guardianship of men, and limits their aspirations.\n\nIt's slavery, because whatever the woman will do it's the business of the male, Rawan says.\n\nThat's why they say they renounced Islam.\n\nAnd that's why aged 18 and 20, they stole back their own passports, hid their abayas under the bedcovers, snuck out of their holiday home and boarded a flight from Colombo to Melbourne, via Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong stopover was supposed to take less than two hours.\n\nTwo hours has turned into five months.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN This photo was taken in a restroom in an airport during a trip to Turkey. The sisters wore this type of niqab when they were traveling outside Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhy they fled\n\nGood girls do what they're told, are quiet, don't argue or risk embarrassing their families. Reem and Rawan say they had turned being good girls into a fine art.\n\nIn our house, we (were) always the good girls they wanted us to be. So, if they want us to clean, we will clean. If they want us to cook, then we will cook, 18-year-old Rawan says.\n\nThe last two years it was really bad, because I just forget who I am, I am just pretending (to be) like an Islamic girl, says her 20-year-old sister, Reem.\n\nThey went to school, studied hard and avoided confrontation. Of course, the same rules didn't apply to their brothers. Beat your sisters, the siblings say their brothers were told, it'll make you better men.\n\nReem and Rawan are reluctant to talk about the abuse at the hands of their family. They say it didn't happen all the time, just enough to remind them of the rules. And enough to fill them with terror about what might happen if anyone found out about their plan or, worse still, caught them carrying it out.\n\nThe escape\n\nLeaving Saudi Arabia is not a simple undertaking for women who rebel against the system. Permission is needed from a male guardian for many basic activities, including international travel.\n\nReem and Rawan say they had been planning their escape in secret for two years. They didn't dare discuss it in case they were overheard, so, instead, they swapped WhatsApp messages, even while alone at night in their shared room.\n\nBefore they fled, the Sri Lanka vacation was just like any other. They wore their niqabs to the beach and sat away from the surf while their brothers swam and joked. They cooked the meals and spent most of their days inside. It was humid. Their niqabs stuck to their skin and made it hard to see.\n\nWe travel to move from a box to another box. From home to hotel, nothing will change, Rawan says. They will go out, they will live freely, the men, of course, we will sit away, watching them doing what they want.\n\nTheir five-year-old sister played in the sand, but their 12-year-old sister, like them, didn't. She too was learning that it's OK to be a girl in Saudi Arabia – until you grow up.\n\nDuring the trip, Rawan turned 18. The timing was no accident. The vacation was planned with gentle persuasion to coincide with a birthday that, unbeknown to their mother, allowed Rawan to apply for an Australian tourist visa.\n\nOn the last night of the trip, the sisters launched into action. Reem pre-booked the taxi. It was Rawan's job to retrieve their passports from a bag stored in their parents' bedroom. Around 2 a.m., she tiptoed past them as they slept, took the bag with their passports, then snuck back in again to return the bag so as not to raise suspicion.\n\nIt's a really great memory, exciting, Rawan tells CNN, smiling. Of the two sisters, she's the more talkative, taking the lead and occasionally looking to her sister for advice on the right word in English. Reem is more reserved. She's careful about what she says and who to trust. They both have dark, short, curly hair and being small in stature seem much younger than their years.\n\nWhen the cab driver arrived at 5 a.m., the sisters say they did something they'd never done before. They pulled on jeans they'd bought in secret and walked out of the house without their abayas.\n\nIt was only after they arrived at Colombo Airport that the sisters booked the flight they'd meticulously researched online: SriLankan Airlines flight UL892 departing Colombo at 9 a.m., arriving Hong Kong at 5:10 p.m. local time. From there, they'd take Cathay Pacific flight CX135 departing at 7:10 p.m. for Melbourne, Australia.\n\nThey had no trouble boarding the plane for the roughly six-hour flight to Hong Kong.\n\nIt was after they arrived at Hong Kong International Airport that things started to go wrong.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The younger sister takes a selfie in a hotel room. They say they felt like ghosts under the full-length black robe, as if they were invisible, not there.\n\nArriving in Hong Kong\n\nWhat happened in the transit area was something the sisters might have anticipated had they known their uncle had connections to the Saudi Interior Ministry or had realized the power Saudi officials could have over local airport staff.\n\nAs soon as the women stepped off the plane, they say two men approached them and asked if they were going to Melbourne. The women say the men asked for their passports and boarding passes, first saying they might miss their flight, then suggesting there was something wrong with their Australian visas.\n\nIn a letter to the sisters' lawyer obtained by CNN, SriLankan Airlines has identified the men as Naeem Khan, SriLankan Airlines station manager, and Noman Shah, a staff member for ground handling agent, Jardine Aviation Services.\n\nThe sisters say the men led them to another area of the airport, where their lawyer Michael Vidler says they canceled the women's Cathay Pacific flight to Melbourne and booked them, without their knowledge, on an Emirates flight to Riyadh, via Dubai.\n\nCathay Pacific tells CNN that the sisters' flight was canceled by representatives of SriLankan Airlines.\n\nSriLankan Airlines told CNN its staff members canceled the flight at the explicit request of the Saudi Consulate, which had already booked the sisters on the flight to Riyadh.\n\nThe airline said consular officials told its staff the women's father had phoned and said the sisters needed to go back to Saudi Arabia as soon as possible as their mother was terminally ill.\n\nThe women knew their mother wasn't ill and were quite sure there was nothing wrong with their visas.\n\nWe allege that they were the subject of an attempted kidnapping in an international airport in a restricted area, Vidler tells CNN. The Saudi Consulate was actively trying to deceive them.\n\nCNN has approached the Saudi Consulate in Hong Kong and the Saudi Foreign Ministry for comment on the sisters' claims and has not received a response. Hong Kong Police have confirmed that they're investigating the allegations.\n\nSriLankan Airlines says at no time did the sisters indicate there was a problem. The women disagree.\n\nVidler says that closed-circuit television seen by his team appears to confirm that Saudi Consul General Omar Al Bunayan was at the airport, speaking to the women and airline staff.\n\nThe presence of senior Saudi officials at the airport filled the women with dread. They'd heard about Dina Ali Lasloom, the 24-year-old Saudi woman who was forced onto a plane to Riyadh at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila in April 2017. Her hands, feet and mouth had been bound with duct tape, one witness told Human Rights Watch.\n\nReem and Rawan feared the same could happen to them.\n\nThey excused themselves to go to the bathroom where they made the decision to flee. As they emerged, they said they saw one of their passports on the table. Rawan tried to grab it.\n\nThe teenager says one of the men immediately slapped her hand, prompting the sisters to scream in Arabic, You kidnap us!\n\nThe sisters say they caused such a scene that the Consul General suggested they move to a quieter area where he presented them with their passports and new boarding passes – for Dubai.\n\nThey ran. First to the Cathay desk where counter staff told them their flights had been canceled. Then to the Qantas desk, where they'd hurriedly booked the next flight to Melbourne, QF30, departing at 7:00 p.m.\n\nSoon after they were issued boarding passes, the women say Shah, the ground handling staff member, tried to snatch them.\n\nJardine Aviation Services, whose staff members carry out a number of tasks within the airport, says its employees didn't tell the women their mother was ill or that was there was an issue with their Australia visas. It denies its staff members slapped Hawan's hand or tried to grab the sisters' boarding passes.\n\nHong Kong's Airport Authority has refused to give CNN a closed-circuit recording of the events that unfolded due to privacy concerns.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The women shared selfies they'd taken of their life before they fled. They wore niqabs in public from the age of 11 and at home were told to wear long gowns, so as not to tempt their brothers.\n\nFor the second time in two hours, the sisters say senior Saudi officials stopped them from flying. The sisters say Saudi Vice Consul Al Sharif told staff at the Qantas check-in desk they were running away, had stolen money, and weren't tourists.\n\nAustralian immigration officials were summoned on the phone and after a conversation with the women, Canberra canceled their visas.\n\nThe only issues with the visa occurred when the Vice Consul made what we believe to be false representations to the Australian authorities at the boarding gate of Qantas airlines, Vidler says.\n\nA spokesperson from Australia's Home Affairs department declined to comment on individual cases. Qantas also declined to comment but a spokesman pointed out that the airline does not make visa assessments.\n\nThe sisters say they stayed at the airport for three hours before asking Cathay Pacific counter staff for permission to leave. They wrote their names and a fake Hong Kong contact address then caught a train to the city.\n\nKhashoggi case puts Saudi Arabia under scrutiny\n\nReem and Rawan escaped Saudi Arabia weeks before the world's attention turned to the kingdom and the disappearance of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. They watched from Hong Kong as gruesome details emerged of Khashoggi's murder inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, allegedly by a team of hitmen who cut up his body with a bone saw.\n\nIn November, a source told CNN that the CIA had determined that Khashoggi was killed on the instruction of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, known as MBS, a claim the kingdom denies.\n\nThe Saudi sisters shrug when asked if they are surprised by Khashoggi's murder and the allegation that their country's de facto leader ordered it.\n\nWe know that Saudi Arabia can do stuff like this, Reem says. They are chasing innocent girls, not even important girls, Rawan agrees. We're just normal young women trying to find a life far away from violence.\n\nSoon after the women arrived in Hong Kong, their father and uncle came to the city to find them. Hong Kong police confirmed to CNN that a missing persons report had been filed.\n\nUsing a passport tracking system linked to hotel check-ins, Hong Kong police officers located the sisters on Monday, September 10 and took them into custody for questioning.\n\nThe women say they were held in a room in the imposing Wan Chai police headquarters for six hours, where they repeatedly refused requests from their father and their uncle to see them.\n\nPolice eventually drove them back to their hotel. By that time, it was after midnight and the women hurriedly packed their bags and fled.\n\nIn the five months since, they've moved from shelter to shelter, hotel to hotel, to evade detection and their potential forced return to Riyadh.\n\nThe sisters have not sought asylum in Hong Kong, however. Doing so would have put them at the end of a long queue of claimants caught in Hong Kong's Unified Screening Mechanism (USM), a system used by the government to process asylum claims. The UNHCR doesn't assess claims in Hong Kong.\n\nThrough their lawyer, Reem and Rawan are seeking a visa in a safe country. Vidler says they have few options. Their Saudi passports have been canceled and they don't have formal permission to stay in Hong Kong.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The sisters say being forced to wear the niqab robbed them of their identities. They knew they'd be expected to wear one for the rest of their lives, like their mother.\n\nLife in Saudi Arabia\n\nAt home in Riyadh, the sisters say they were beaten by their father and brothers for a reason and no reason.\n\nOne day when she was 14, Reem says her brother started hitting her for talking and laughing with Rawan. He said that people will hear my voice and it will bring shame, she says.\n\nThe sisters knew it was likely there would be an arranged marriage. There was talk of Rawan marrying her younger cousin, a boy still in high school.\n\nReem was the first to renounce Islam in October 2016, followed by Rawan in May 2017. They didn't dare tell anyone but say they announced it under fake names on Twitter.\n\nI knew If I told my family they will hurt me and I'll be killed. Because that what we studied in schools, that whoever left Islam should be killed. I knew no one will protect me because all my family are so religious and none of them will support me. I was afraid of them finding out, Reem says.\n\nThere are no firm figures on how many Saudi women have escaped the country – or how many have failed in their attempt to leave – but the total number of Saudi asylum seekers is rising.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, 575 Saudi nationals applied for asylum in 2015. Two years later, that figure had more than doubled to over 1,200.\n\nThe period coincides with the rising influence of MBS who in June 2017 was appointed heir to the Saudi throne by his father King Salman.\n\nSince then, MBS has made it clear that dissent won't be tolerated, even as the kingdom has earned international plaudits for new female-focused policies, including lifting the ban on women drivers.\n\nRana Ahmad, a 33-year-old Saudi national who runs the Atheist Refugee Relief agency in Germany, says the jailing and torture of the same women who campaigned for the right to drive had sent a message to some Saudi women that they have no future in the country.\n\nThey look at these women, they're trying to do something and the government puts them in jail. So they see no hope anymore, they want to leave, she said.\n\nAdam Coogle, a Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW), says women whose escape plans are thwarted are at serious risk of abuse.\n\nPunishments range from being locked in their room for months on end or banned from using a mobile phone, to criminal prosecution by the state for disobeying their parents or harming the kingdom's reputation. The women themselves say they fear they'll be killed by their own families.\n\nCoogle says there are few safe corridors for women to leave, because of political pressure the Saudi government applies to some foreign countries to return runaways without giving them the opportunity to claim asylum or put their case forward.\n\nAnywhere you go that doesn't have some sort of respect for refugee law or a strong record of rule of law is a problem because they're the countries where Saudi Arabia can apply its diplomatic pressure to get countries to cooperate, he says.\n\nFew regrets\n\nReem and Rawan say they could see signs of change in Saudi Arabia, but it wasn't moving fast enough for them. They laugh at the suggestion that progress was made by giving Saudi women the right to drive.\n\nDriving cars is not something to celebrate, Reem says. There is a woman abused in the house, and no one hears their voice, and they want us to celebrate a car? Rawan adds.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the sisters watch Netflix to pass the time. Wearing jeans and trainers, they could easily be mistaken for one of the millions of tourists that come through the city each year.\n\nSometimes Reem wears lipstick. She seems relaxed but has a habit of picking at the skin on her fingers when she's nervous. Sometimes, she does it so much that they start to bleed.\n\nThe sisters are anxious about what comes next. But even after five months of uncertainty and fear, they have few regrets.\n\nI regret not waiting, but not leaving, Reem says. From my childhood, I knew this is not my home. I always knew my rights would be taken.\n\nRawan says she too knew there was no life for her in Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhen I was growing up I saw my brothers do whatever they want, have whatever they want. But for me, I should be a good girl, a good woman, to marry someone, my cousin, because I should not even dream to choose my husband, to choose my partner.\n\nI want to study what I want, I want to work what I want, I want to choose the day I marry. To choose the man I marry. Even if I don't want to marry, I want the right to choose.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated with new information from human rights lawyer Michael Vidler who said he originally misspoke about which Saudi consulate official was at the Hong Kong airport speaking to the Saudi sisters and airline staff. Only the Consul General was seen by Vidler's team on closed circuit television.
Her name has become synonymous with fresh-pressed napkins, home-cooked meals and Martha Stewart living.\n\nBut for years, Martha Stewart said she struggled to run her home goods empire and manage a picture-perfect home life at the same time. In a video interview with CNNMoney's Christine Romans, Stewart admitted she could never find a way to perfect that mythical work-life balance.\n\nIt's one of the most difficult things to do, that balance, which is so elusive to most of us, she said. It didn't work for me. I thought, 'Oh, I can do it. I can do all of that.'\n\nWhen her 29-year marriage ended in 1990 (the same year Martha Stewart Living magazine launched), she was just beginning to make a name for herself in the lifestyle world. Stewart said she paid the price for her mistaken confidence -- but one she doesn't regret.\n\nI had to sacrifice a marriage because of the lure of the great job, the fabulous workplace, she said. But, I don't regret it at all, because what I've done is something bigger and better than just one marriage. ... People who are happily married, don't hate me for saying that. But for me, it's true. It's impossible for most of us to get that balance.\n\nFor years women recoiled at the idea of spending even more time in the home, tinkering with recipes or decorating an immaculate dinner table. But Stewart insists that her leadership in homemaking is rooted not in perfectionism but in living better.\n\nShe sees her Millennial viewers prioritize lifestyle goals alongside career goals.\n\nAccording to a 2015 study of female Millennials by PwC, the phrase work-life balance matters to younger women workers more than ever before. Around 97% of those women surveyed said that work-life balance was important to them, and 55% of respondents said the work demands of their current role significantly interfere with their personal life.\n\nMartha sees this focus on work-life balance as part of a counterculture energizing the world of homemaking.\n\nThey want to be good mothers. They want to be well-dressed. They want to have beautiful homes, Stewart said of her younger fans.\n\nA counterculture in more ways than one -- when Romans asked Stewart about her thoughts on the recent national reckoning on sexual harassment, Stewart said she wishes more women had come forward years ago when they first experienced harassment.\n\nI think it would have been better to call [harassment] out originally, instead of 15, 20 years later, she said. That women were meek or timid in the workplace 15 years ago, and waited until now to call out ill behavior and inappropriateness in the workplace, is a problem.\n\nStewart mentioned that in her past jobs, she would often confront male colleagues for inappropriate behavior in the workplace.\n\nI called them out. I remember saying, 'Stay away from me, creep,' she said. But you have to feel good about yourself in order to behave [toward harassers] in the way that you deem appropriate.
(CNN) Ravi Zacharias, the prominent head of a global Christian organization who died in May, engaged in sexual misconduct that included sexting, unwanted touching, spiritual abuse, and rape, according to a statement from the ministry he founded summarizing the results of an investigative report.\n\nAllegations came from four female massage therapists who said Zacharias would either touch his genitals or ask them to touch his genitals.\n\nAdditionally, five massage therapists claimed he touched or rubbed them inappropriately, and one reported many encounters over a period of years that she described as rape, according to a 12-page report from the law firm Miller & Martin , which was hired by the ministry.\n\nThe law firm said it employed a private investigations firm that included former federal law enforcement officers. More than 50 people were interviewed, including more than a dozen massage therapists, according to the report.\n\nA digital forensics firm examined four cell phones and a laptop used by Zacharias. Evidence was uncovered of text- and email-based relationships with women who were not his wife, along with more than 200 photos of women, the report said.\n\nSeveral women accused Zacharias of using ministry funds to give them financial support, eliciting personal information about their lives and employing religious language during encounters, according to the report.\n\nZacharias, who defended Christianity through books and lectures, died last spring at his Atlanta home at the age of 74 after battling sarcoma. He was a leading figure among Christian apologetics, an intellectual form of Christian theology that defends faith against doubters by invoking history and logic.\n\nThe Miller & Martin report detailed new allegations of misconduct against Zacharias. The report said the Christian leader's claims that during his marriage he never engaged in any inappropriate behavior of any kind when confronted with similar allegations in the past were misleading or false.\n\nThe board of Ravi Zacharias International Ministries hired the law firm to investigate the sexual misconduct allegations last fall.\n\nIn September 2020, after Zacharias's death, Christianity Today published an article that cited three women who accused him of sexually harassing them at two spas he co-owned.\n\nWe believe not only the women who made their allegations public but also additional women who had not previously made public allegations against Ravi but whose identities and stories were uncovered during the investigation, the RZIM board said in a statement this week.\n\nTragically, witnesses described encounters including sexting, unwanted touching, spiritual abuse, and rape. We are devastated by what the investigation has shown and are filled with sorrow for the women who were hurt by this terrible abuse.\n\nAccuser says she's 'deeply indebted to every victim and whistleblower'\n\nThe Miller & Martin report describes the case of Lori Anne Thompson, a Canadian woman who accused Zacharias of engaging in sexually explicit online conversations and exploiting her vulnerability to satisfy [his] own sexual desires.\n\nIn April 2017, Thompson and her husband wrote Zacharias to demand $5 million in exchange for a release of claims against him and the ministry. Three months later, Zacharias sued the couple in federal court for extortion. The couple and Zacharias settled the dispute confidentially in the fall of 2017, the report said.\n\nZacharias convinced the RZIM board that he was a victim of extortion and the matter was not investigated, according to the report. Witnesses within RZIM told investigators they were marginalized for raising questions about his explanations.\n\nThe RZIM statement this week said the investigative findings caused us to think very differently about Thompson's 2017 allegations.\n\nWe believe Lori Anne Thompson has told the truth about the nature of her relationship with Ravi Zacharias, the board said. It is with profound grief that we recognize that because we did not believe the Thompsons and both privately and publicly perpetuated a false narrative, they were slandered for years and their suffering was greatly prolonged and intensified. This leaves us heartbroken and ashamed.\n\nIn an email statement to CNN, Thompson said she and her husband are deeply indebted to every victim and whistleblower who spoke for not only themselves, but also for us.\n\nShe called the law firm report and board statement initial steps in what we anticipate will be long and arduous journey for RZIM towards institutional transparency and accountability.\n\nThe board, citing a deep need for corporate repentance, said it has hired lawyer and advocate Rachael Denhollander to educate and advise the organization and serve as a liaison with survivors.\n\nThe board said it also hired Guidepost Solutions, a consulting firm, to evaluate RZIM's structures, culture, policies, processes, finances, and practices.\n\nWe want to help the victims of Ravi's abuse, and we want to thoroughly understand what has taken place in our organization so that we can do everything we can to make sure nothing like this happens again, the board statement said.
Editor's Note: The opinions expressed below are solely those of the authors.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nWhether you know them by heart or have never heard them at all, the 35 words that Donald Trump will speak to become our president will, in some way, impact your next four years. On the occasion of CNN's mini-documentary, The Oath, CNN Opinion asked scholars and writers to weigh in on how history and happenstance have shaped the president's oath of office.\n\nJim Bendat: Thank you, James Madison\n\nPHOTO: Courtey Jim Bendat Jim Bendat\n\nThe presidential oath of office consists of 35 words:\n\nI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States, and will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nWe can probably thank the nation's fourth president, James Madison, as much as any other person, for that wording. Well before he became president, Madison had earned the nickname Father of the Constitution, by virtue of his speeches, effective negotiations and successful compromises at the Constitutional Convention in 1787.\n\nPart of the work at that convention involved the writing of the president's inaugural oath. An early version simply stated, I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States of America. But Madison and fellow Virginia delegate George Mason believed the nation's chief executive should also be required to make a promise to support the words and meaning of the Constitution. So, on August 27, 1787, the two men moved to add to the oath the phrase, and will, to the best of my judgment and power, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nLess than three weeks later, the state representatives finalized the oath's wording. They kept almost all of Madison and Mason's amendment, changing only the words judgment and power to ability. It was clear that Madison had made a major contribution to the very oath he would himself recite many years later, at his 1809 and 1813 inaugurations.\n\nWith his 1809 ceremony also featuring the first official inaugural parade and the first official inaugural ball, it would seem appropriate to call Madison not only the Father of the Constitution, but also the Father of the inauguration.\n\nJim Bendat is the author of Democracy's Big Day: The Inauguration of Our President, 1789-2013.\n\nNicole Hemmer: The President who took the oath, gave the oath, and still got it wrong\n\nNicole Hemmer\n\nWilliam Howard Taft holds the distinction of being the only person to both take and administer the presidential oath of office, first in 1909 as president, then in 1929 as chief justice of the Supreme Court. He also holds the distinction of getting it wrong both times.\n\nThe first time, his only audience was the US Senate, so the mistake went unnoticed. But the second time, when he was administering the oath to Herbert Hoover, the ceremony was broadcast on radio. And in a schoolhouse in the small town of Walden, New York, a 13-year-old named Helen Terwilliger was listening.\n\nIn preparation for the momentous occasion, Terwilliger had memorized the oath of office. She knew the closing words were a pledge to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. So when the chief justice read the oath as preserve, maintain, and defend, Terwilliger dashed off a note to advise him of his mistake.\n\nTaft sent a letter in reply, admitting he had said the wrong words but arguing Terwilliger's correction was also wrong. You are mistaken in your report of what I did say. What I said was 'preserve, maintain, and protect.' Terwilliger was adamant that her version was correct. By that point, the dustup had become a national story, so broadcasters reran tape of the inauguration for the press and then for the chief justice, who finally conceded Terwilliger was correct. Time magazine reported the incident left Taft highly diverted but also dismissive, saying the particular words didn't matter much, and would not prevent Hoover from serving as president.\n\nStill, Taft drew a larger lesson about politics in an era when a person's words could be recorded for posterity. This shows how much more carefully one who is exercising a public duty must now conduct himself. Given that Taft was writing in 1929, his words seem remarkably prescient, and, giving the communications style of the incoming president, remarkably quaint.\n\nNicole Hemmer is an assistant professor at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, co-host of the Past Present podcast and author of Messengers of the Right: Conservative Media and the Transformation of American Politics.\n\nKate Brower: A new role for FLOTUS\n\nPHOTO: katebrower.com Kate Brower\n\nOn January 20, 1965, Lady Bird Johnson was not only by her husband's side at the Capitol for his swearing-in ceremony, she became the first first lady to hold the Bible that President Lyndon B. Johnson placed his hand on as he repeated the oath of office. During an emotional ceremony, a little more than a year after President John F. Kennedy's assassination, Lady Bird stood in a bright red coat and hat clutching the Bible that was given to them as a Christmas gift in 1952 by Lyndon's mother. She looked on lovingly at her husband, fully aware of the weight of the office.I stood facing the throng between the chief justice and Lyndon while he took the oath, Lady Bird recorded in her diary. It was President Johnson's idea that his wife, who had made his political career possible, hold the Bible. I was touched, she wrote. Every president, with the exception of Franklin Pierce, Theodore Roosevelt, and John Quincy Adams, has placed his hand on a Bible at his swearing-in ceremony. At LBJ's swearing-in African-American soprano Leontyne Price sang America the Beautiful as civil rights demonstrations engulfed the country.\n\nLess than six years after the Johnsons left Washington, Gerald Ford was sworn in as the 38th president of the United States in an East Room ceremony on August 9, 1974, after President Richard Nixon's resignation. It was an unprecedented moment in history, most famously because it marked the first time a president had resigned from office but also because of a lesser known detail: Gerald Ford became the first president to reference his wife in an inaugural address when he said, I am indebted to no man and only to one woman, my dear wife, as I begin this very difficult job.\n\nIn the modern era, the partnership between presidents and first ladies has become a very public part of the institution of the presidency and the peaceful transfer of power. Thanks, in no small part, to Lady Bird Johnson's very public role, it is hard to imagine an inauguration when the first lady is not front and center.\n\nKate Brower is the author of the best-sellers First Women: The Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies and The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House.

Others will be harder.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nHere are the easy words for him: I do … swear that I will … to the best of my ability. … Unlike say, seats in the Congress or on the court, the presidency is a strikingly personal office, with the entire power of a branch of government vested in and revolving around a single individual. The words I and my should come easily to Trump's lips because these are strikingly self-centered words and he is unusually self-centered. Interestingly enough, these words in the presidential oath clause are the only first-person-singular words in the entire Constitution, a document that begins, famously, with collective language — We, the people, … do ordain and establish… — and that also elaborates the legislative and judicial branches, which are far less personal than the presidency.\n\nOther oath words may be harder for Trump: … faithfully execute … There have been many times in Trump's life when he has said I do but then has not been entirely faithful. True, private infidelity does not always portend public faithlessness. But Trump's prior private infidelities are not confined to sex and marriage. Deep doubts exist about whether his word truly is his bond in dealing with creditors, investors, subcontractors, workers, business partners, customers — you name it. Thus far in life, he has had huge problems telling the truth and keeping his word.\n\nFinally, here are the oath's most important words: preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. One cannot easily preserve, protect, and defend what one does not even understand, much less revere. Thus far, Trump has spent too little time reading, rereading and pondering this all-important document and its abiding principles. Let's hope it is not too late for him to become a true and faithful constitutionalist.\n\nAkhil Reed Amar is the Sterling Professor of Law and Political Science at Yale University and the author of The Constitution Today: Timeless Truths for the Issues of Our Era.

(Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nRihanna claims her father and his business partner fraudulently used her name to make money and she's suing them over it.\n\nThe singer alleges that her father, Ronald Fenty, and his partner, Moses Perkins, falsely represented their company's affiliation with her.\n\nAlthough Mr. Fenty is Rihanna's father, he does not have, and never has had, authority to act on Rihanna's behalf, nor has he ever been authorized to use her name, intellectual property or publicity rights, the suit obtained by CNN reads. Similarly, neither Mr. Perkins nor the Company has any affiliation whatsoever with Rihanna.\n\nThe pair launched Fenty Entertainment, a production and talent company, in 2017.\n\nRihanna's popular Fenty Beauty line of cosmetics also launched in 2017. She has a lingerie product line as well.\n\nThe suit states that Fenty and Perkins have repeatedly been asked to stop misrepresenting themselves and to cease and desist all activity and efforts to exploit Rihanna's name and the goodwill associated with the Fenty brand.\n\nThe pair unsuccessfully attempted to register the Fenty name for a line of resort hotels, according to the suit.\n\nRihanna also alleges that Fenty and Perkins negotiated an unauthorized deal for her to perform 15 shows in Latin America for $15 million, and two 15-minute sets at Calibash at Staples Center and T-Mobile Arena for $400,000.\n\nThe singer is seeking to stop the pair from using her name or the Fenty brand, as well as damages and attorney's fees.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Rihanna talked about her complicated relationship with her father, who, she said, had a tumultuous marriage with her mother.\n\nHe taught me everything, Rihanna told Winfrey. As awful as he was to my mom at times, it didn't compare to how great he was as a father.\n\nCNN has reached out to Rihanna, Fenty and Perkins for comment.
Beyoncé graced the cover of the coveted September issue of Vogue in August 2018. She oversaw all aspects of the spread which was shot by photographer Tyler Mitchell, the first African American photographer to land the cover in the magazine's 125-year history.\n\nIn June 2018 Bey and Jay surprised fans by dropping the Everything Is Love album which quickly had folks pouring over the lyrics for hidden meanings. The pair had already announced a stadium tour, OTR II, in March.\n\nIn June 2017 the singer and husband rapper Jay-Z welcomed twins Rumi and Sir Carter. She's seen here with the toddlers in July 2018.\n\nJay Z and Beyoncé arrive at the Met Gala in New York in May 2015.\n\nAt the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyonce was awarded with the Michael Jackson Vanguard Award, which is given to exemplary musicians who have made an incredible and long-lasting impact on pop culture. The singer accepted the award on August 24 from her husband, Jay Z, and daughter, Blue Ivy.\n\nAfter Jay Z's infamous scuffle with Beyonce's sister, the power couple faced numerous rumors that their relationship was on the rocks. But when they started their joint On the Run summer tour in Miami on June 25, they held a united front, playing their never-before-seen wedding video and showing footage of daughter Blue.\n\nJay Z and his sister-in-law Solange Knowles, right, reportedly had an altercation at a Met Gala after-party at New York's Standard Hotel in May 2014. Security camera footage that appeared on TMZ doesn't tell the whole story, but there are plenty of pictures of the rapper, Beyonce, and her sister leaving the party.\n\nTime magazine has praised Beyonce as an industry tastemaker. In April 2014, the magazine called Bey one of the 100 most influential people in the world.\n\nIn December 2013, Beyonce stunned fans by releasing a surprise visual album. The project was well-received and shot to No. 1, spawning platinum hits like the single Drunk In Love.\n\nIn May 2013, Beyonce was the subject of pregnancy rumors as observers noted that her dress to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala conveniently covered her midsection. The speculation grew stronger after she had to cancel a concert due to exhaustion and dehydration. She denied that she was pregnant.\n\nIn early April 2013, the singer and her husband were once again the subject of critical headlines when they took a trip to Cuba to celebrate their fifth anniversary.\n\nKelly Rowland, Beyonce and Michelle Williams reunited as Destiny's Child to perform during the Super Bowl XLVII Halftime Show on February 3, 2013, in New Orleans.\n\nAfter the inauguration dust-up, Beyonce had something to prove when she held a news conference for her Pepsi Super Bowl XLVII Halftime Show on January 31, 2013. After belting out The Star-Spangled Banner, the singer paused and turned to the press and asked: Any questions?\n\nBeyonce found herself at the center a firestorm in 2013 after it was revealed she used a backup track to sing the national anthem at the inauguration of President Barack Obama on January 21.\n\nJust months after giving birth, Beyonce was red-carpet ready at the Costume Institute Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York on May 7, 2012.\n\nWhen Beyonce's daughter with Jay Z, Blue Ivy, was born in 2012, the couple shared a photo of their newborn on their website. A hand-written note accompanying the photos reads, We welcome you to share our joy.\n\nIn 2011, Beyonce stole the show at the MTV Video Music Awards when she walked the red carpet and, with the careful placement of her hands, revealed that she was expecting. The star and husband Jay welcomed Blue Ivy in January 2012.\n\nAfter releasing another best-seller with 2006's B'Day and starring in Dreamgirls that same year, Beyonce was readying to release a third solo album, I Am ... Sasha Fierce when she took the stage at the 50th Grammy Awards Show on February 10, 2008. Somehow, she snuck in a secret marriage to Jay Z that April.\n\nAlthough her solo career had taken off by 2005, Beyonce still performed with Destiny's Child that year in Sydney on the heels of their 2004 album, Destiny Fulfilled.\n\nAt the 46th Grammy Awards Show in February 2004, she joined Prince on stage to perform a medley of his hits. She left the ceremony with five Grammys in hand.\n\nBeyonce was right back at the Super Bowl in 2004, performing the national anthem to kick off Super Bowl XXXVIII on February 1.\n\nThe singer is affectionately referred to as Queen Bey, not in the least because of her heralded work ethic, which is often put to good use on stage. Here, she performs during the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards in New York on August 28, 2003.\n\nHaving stepped out on her own, Beyonce presents the humanitarian award to Michael Jackson at the 2003 Radio Music Awards in Las Vegas on October 27, 2003.\n\nA decade before she wowed viewers at the 2013 Super Bowl Halftime Show, Bey jammed with Carlos Santana during the Super Bowl XXXVII Pregame Show in San Diego on January 26, 2003.\n\nIn November 2002, before they tied the knot, Jay Z and Beyonce fueled rumors that they were dating by becoming musical collaborators. Beyoncé appeared on Jay Z's 2002 single 03 Bonnie & Clyde, and he appeared on her single Crazy In Love the following summer.\n\nWhen Beyonce took the stage in Melbourne on April 29, 2002, she was just a year away from releasing her first solo album, Dangerously In Love.\n\nBeyonce performs with Kelly Rowland, left, and Michelle Williams -- the final version of the group that put her on the map -- for President-elect George W. Bush during a pre-inaugural event in Washington on January 19, 2001.\n\nIn 1998, Beyonce, second from right, was known simply as another member of Destiny's Child, a four-member girl group who released a self-titled debut that year and had a breakthrough with the remix of their single No, No, No, No.\n\nStory highlights Rachel Sklar: Beyoncé's pregnancy announcement is just what the world needed It reminds us that, even in the midst of this political chaos, joyous moments are still occurring everyday, she writes\n\nEditor's Note: Rachel Sklar is a writer and former lawyer based in New York.

Also, the revelation that was Formation. And her 2016 Superbowl performance (very popular with conservatives). Lemonade, the album that launched a thousand thinkpieces about her politics and identity (sample headline: Beyonce's 'Lemonade' Is an Anthem for the Retribution of Black Women.)\n\nThen, earlier this week, she added her announcement via Instagram - bedecked in flowers, a veil and her glorious fecundity - that she is pregnant with twins.\n\nPredictably, the Internet went bananas. Her post zoomed to most-liked-ever status inside a day. Twitter was beside itself with bee emojis and YASSS QUEEEN updates. The joy was palpable.\n\nJoy – and relief. Because, man did we ever need some good news.\n\nIt has been a rough few weeks in the news cycle (for people who care about democracy and due process and the welfare of their fellow humans).\n\nA breathless pace of executive orders attacking the environment, women, refugees, lawful visa-holders and US parks employees has led to record-breaking protests, an unrelenting call-your-Senator schedule and Jon Stewart channelling just how exhausted we all are. So we really, really needed something to feel good about.\n\nBeyoncé delivered that to us with her announcement, which was styled with the kind of bravado, exuberance and confidence that even a dude who lives in a solid-gold tower could never get away with. And she doubled down on it with a collection of photographs so resplendently gorgeous and near-otherworldly (I mean, just look at this one and this one, and this one) that it actually succeeded in not just distracting us from the dark craziness swirling around the country, but transporting us completely, if momentarily, into another (happier) world.\n\nThis is classic Beyoncé. Beyoncé, who flagrantly loves her body and demands that you respect it, now reminds us that it's a body that can march like a boss in heels but also swell with life and hope, sexy and powerful in all its forms. (And she does it while sitting on a throne of flowers, lest you forget she is the Queen.)\n\nIt is possible, of course, for Beyoncé's pregnancy to exist without reference to Donald Trump. He doesn't get to be part of every story, even as he barges into our every waking moment with new acts of cruelty or rule-flouting or self-aggrandizement or jaw-dropping ignorance. Even so, it's hard not to see a juxtaposition here. Trump's administration has focused on restricting, undoing, and upending. But Beyoncé is creating.\n\nThat was the theme of her photo collection. Called I Have Three Hearts, it was paired with a poem of the same name by the Somalian poet Warsan Shire, who also wrote the poetry in Lemonade – and who, I guess, would not be allowed to enter the United States.\n\nIt reads: There's life growing inside of me and I'm beside myself with dreams. In a real and visceral way, Beyoncé has reminded us that even in times that feel broken, we are vessels of power and glory and hope.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIs what I am saying over the top here? Maybe, but I found those images coupled with that poem to be profoundly moving as a mother and a feminist and, well, a human. I will leave the smart thinkpieces about the poem to other writers, (I'm looking at you, Melissa Harris-Perry) but one line in particular stands out to me: Flowers grow wherever.\n\nFlowers grow wherever. When the books are written about this period in time, I believe that will be an enduring theme – the hope that sprang up out of the chaos, and the real and visceral good that it created. Beyoncé just named it. Creators gonna create.

London (CNN) UK Prime Minister Theresa May was clinging to power by her political fingertips on Sunday after losing her parliamentary majority in last Thursday's election, as an agreement with the minority Democratic Unionist Party that would keep the Conservatives in power was still not finalized.\n\nMay's co-chiefs of staff, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, handed in their resignations on Saturday following the disastrous election. The vote was called by May to strengthen her position ahead of talks to leave the European Union, in the end it left her weakened.\n\nBoth Downing Street and the DUP issued statements late Saturday saying talks over a deal to prop up the government would resume next week amid concern among more liberal Conservatives about May hitching her wagon to the right-wing Northern Irish party. Earlier, Downing Street had said a preliminary agreement had already been secured.\n\nThe DUP is similar to the religious right in the United States and takes a hardline stance on social issues, such as same-sex marriage and abortion.\n\nMeanwhile the main opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that he stands ready to lead the country and that a new general election could be held within months.\n\nI think its quite possible there'll be an election later this year or early next year, and that might be a good thing, because we cannot go on with a period of great instability, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday .\n\n'Dead woman walking'\n\nMany of those Conservatives now opposing May are those who wanted to remain in the EU.\n\nTheresa May is a dead woman walking, it just remains to be seen how long she remains on death row, George Osborne, the former UK chancellor who was sacked by May last year, told the BBC on Sunday.\n\nThe right-wing British press speculated Sunday that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a former journalist and the former Mayor of London, was plotting a leadership coup.\n\nBut Osborne, who is now the editor of London's Evening Standard newspaper, downplayed the prospect. He's in a permanent leadership campaign so I am not sure it qualifies as news, he said.\n\nThe new arithmetic of the House of Commons will also makes Brexit negotiations more difficult. The DUP, although it wants to leave the EU, will insist on keeping the single market that allows the free flow of goods across the UK's border with Ireland.\n\nOne piece of good news is the whole election has put pay to a hard Brexit, Osborne told CNN. The votes aren't there now in the (House of) Commons for taking Britain out of all the economic arrangements we have with the European Union, he said.\n\nIreland: Alliance could endanger peace\n\nIn Ireland, there is growing concern that by bringing the DUP into government, London will no longer be able to perform its traditional role as an impartial broker in the Northern Ireland peace process.\n\nMay spoke to the Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny over the phone on Sunday.\n\nThe Taoiseach indicated his concern that nothing should happen to put the Good Friday Agreement at risk and the challenge that this agreement will bring, the Irish government said in a statement. He also noted the absence of any nationalist voice in Westminster following the election.\n\nThe Good Friday Agreement was a major development in the peace process of the 1990s that brought peace to the region after decades of conflict.\n\nSeven Republican Sinn Fein members who want a united Ireland were also elected on Thursday, but they do not attend or vote as the party does not recognize Westminster rule.\n\nPressure from all sides\n\nMay called the general election three years earlier than required by law, with the aim of sweeping an even greater majority for her party before Brexit talks in just eight days to take the country out of the EU.\n\nBut a dismal campaign has left the Prime Minister fending off a mutiny within her own party. Conservative MPs are publicly airing their anger, some calling for her ouster and others demanding radical change in her style of leadership.\n\nRuth Davidson, the openly gay leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, told the BBC she had words with May over the DUP's record on LGBT rights.\n\nDefense Secretary Michael Fallon said on the Andrew Marr show he believed the Conservative Party and the DUP will be able to hold together in government. They (the DUP) are going to support us on the big Brexit, economic and security issues facing this country, he said.\n\nOn Sunday, May appointed former BBC journalist Damien Green as First Secretary of State -- effectively May's deputy Prime Minister -- in a reshuffle of her cabinet. Many key positions were unchanged.\n\nMichael Gove has been appointed Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. He was also a backer of Brexit, and lost to May in the 2015 Tory leadership election.\n\nHer new chief of staff will be Gavin Barwell, a former MP who was ousted from his south London constituency as a result of Labour's unexpectedly strong showing in the election. May said that he would bring considerable experience to the post.\n\nMay promises 'stability and certainty'\n\nIn her post-election reshuffle, May said she appointed ministers that reflect the wealth of talent and experience across the Conservative Party.\n\nIn a television interview Sunday with Sky News at Downing Street, May say she would help deliver the stability and certainty the country needs during the reshuffling.\n\nWhen asked if she would continue her term in office May said, I said during the election campaign that if re-elected I would intend to serve a full term. But what I'm doing now is actually getting on with the immediate job.\n\nMay also said she would be meeting with her cabinet on Monday and going to France on Tuesday for meetings with French President Macron.

Powerful state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins called for her fellow Democrat's resignation on Sunday after two more former aides came forward alleging inappropriate conduct by the governor, including one who accused Cuomo of making an unwanted sexual advance in a Los Angeles hotel room more than two decades ago while she worked for him as a paid consultant.\n\nStewart-Cousins' decision to join a growing number of state Democratic lawmakers pushing for Cuomo, who has repeatedly denied inappropriately touching anyone, to step down upped the pressure on the three-term governor as his grip on the state capitol he has ruled for a decade appears to be slipping. Cuomo on Sunday again said he would not resign, but in breaking from the governor, Stewart-Cousins further escalated the stand-off and put renewed focus on Sens. Chuck Schumer, the majority leader in the US Senate, and Kirsten Gillibrand, as the state's Democratic hierarchy considers how to respond to the persistent stream of accusations.\n\nSchumer on Sunday refused to say whether Cuomo should resign, but again expressed his confidence in New York Attorney General Letitia James' probe into the allegations.\n\nI have a lot of faith in her, Schumer said. I believe that she will turn over every stone and I believe she will make sure there is no outside interference.\n\nCuomo said in a news conference shortly before Stewart-Cousins released her statement that he would not step down, suggesting that to do so before the conclusion of the attorney general's investigation -- a process that could take months -- would be un-democratic and a denial of due process.\n\nBut Stewart-Cousins, who had previously said Cuomo should resign if another accuser came forward, had seen enough. In a statement provided to CNN Sunday, she questioned whether the governor could effectively lead the state in the midst of twin scandals -- one surrounding sexual harassment allegations and another focused on his office's handling of Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes, which erupted after James' office found that the state had systemically undercounted deaths among residents in the facilities.\n\nFor the good of the state Governor Cuomo must resign, Stewart-Cousins said.\n\nNew York State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, also a Democrat, echoed Stewart-Cousins' concerns in a tweet, calling the allegations against Cuomo deeply disturbing.\n\nWe have many challenges to address, Heastie continued, and I think it is time for the Governor to seriously consider whether he can effectively meet the needs of the people of New York.\n\nStewart-Cousins called Cuomo Sunday morning less than an hour before his hastily announced press call to inform the governor that she could no longer support him and planned to call for his resignation, according to a source briefed on the conversation.\n\nAccording to the source, Cuomo told the leading lawmaker that she should listen to the press call -- during which he told reporters he wasn't resigning.\n\nThere are some legislators who suggest that I resign because of accusations that made -- are made against me. I was elected by the people of the state. I wasn't elected by politicians. I'm not going to resign because of allegations, Cuomo said on the press call.\n\nOn Monday, James announced that former acting US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Joon Kim and employment discrimination attorney Anne L. Clark will lead the investigation.\n\nCalls growing for resignation\n\nDespite the protests of the governor and his top aides, the chorus of big-name New York Democrats calling for his ouster is growing. State Sens. Rachel May and Liz Krueger echoed Stewart-Cousins. Also on Sunday, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer joined two other mayoral candidates, Maya Wiley and Kathryn Garcia, who had previously said Cuomo should resign. Stringer urged the legislature to begin impeachment proceedings if he did not. Mark Levine, a New York City councilman who chairs its health committee, also said Cuomo should leave office.\n\nOn Monday, state Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes, along with several other Democratic female members of the Assembly, did not call for Cuomo's resignation but instead urged James' investigation be allowed to take its course.\n\nStewart-Cousins' statement came less than 24 hours after former aide and consultant Karen Hinton came forward, in a Washington Post report published Saturday, to accuse the governor of inappropriate conduct.\n\nHinton was working as a consultant to Cuomo when, she told CNN on Sunday, he invited her to his hotel room during a trip to Los Angeles. Inside, Hinton said, Cuomo asked her about her marriage and related personal questions, before embracing her, which made her feel uncomfortable and prompted her to stand up to leave.\n\nI thought it was too close for too long and I felt that it was too intimate, and I could tell he was aroused, and I pulled away, Hinton said, adding that she didn't aggressively pull away.\n\nI just walked away like, 'It's time for me to leave,' and he pulls me back and I said, 'No. I'm really sleepy. I'm going to go back to my room,' and I left, and we never spoke about it again, Hinton alleged.\n\nPeter Ajemian, Cuomo's director of communications, denied Hinton's claims in a statement to CNN, saying, This did not happen.\n\nKaren Hinton is a known antagonist of the Governor's who is attempting to take advantage of this moment to score cheap points with made up allegations from 21 years ago. All women have the right to come forward and tell their story — however, it's also the responsibility of the press to consider self-motivation. This is reckless, Ajemian said.\n\nEvery woman has a right to come forward. That's true. But the truth also matters. What she said is not true, the governor said addressing the allegations.\n\nA friend of Hinton's, who spoke with CNN on the condition of anonymity, said Hinton called her after what the friend called, the hotel incident.\n\nShe called me, and she just said you won't believe what just happened, the friend said, adding that Hinton told her Cuomo had given her a hug and was aroused and it freaked her out.\n\nHinton stood by her claim in a statement to CNN after Cuomo's remarks, comparing him to former President Donald Trump.\n\nTruth is the 'longtime adversary' that Cuomo fears the most, Hinton said. Trump may be gone but Cuomo has stepped right into his shoes by blaming the abused for his own abusive behavior.\n\nFormer staffers describe demanding work environment\n\nSeveral former staffers for the governor who spoke to CNN on the condition they not be named to protect against future reprisals offered different accounts of what it was like to work for Cuomo. None of the former staffers said they directly witnessed sexual harassment by the governor.\n\nA woman who worked for Cuomo described a culture in which having one-on-one time with Cuomo or riding on his plane was seen as a badge of honor.\n\nIt's something that staff would aspire to get to do, she said.\n\nOne former female aide who constantly traveled for events for the governor said staffers would do anything to not be the target of his or any of his top people's, you know, wrath.\n\nYou definitely wanted to fly under the radar enough so that you weren't, but you wanted him to notice you so that you could, you know, get ahead, she said.\n\nA former male staffer in the executive chamber said he was not shocked or surprised by the recent negative headlines coming out about Cuomo. He still keeps in touch with some former colleagues and says there's a level of shock they're experiencing because Cuomo seemed untouchable.\n\nWe're all like 'what the hell' because we never thought that, you know, from what we witnessed last year, at the height of Cuomo's fandom that in a year that we would be here at this point, watching the demise of probably one of the most powerful political figures in New York State.\n\nOne male staffer who worked for Cuomo for several years, however, said he never saw Cuomo act inappropriately around staff and was shocked to hear the allegations.\n\nHe always tried to mentor, individuals that he felt he could, but I don't think that mentorship was anything predatory. I think that he just approached it differently with different people, the staffer said.\n\nRich Azzopardi, a senior adviser to Cuomo, defended the governor's behavior.\n\nThere is no secret these are tough jobs, and the work is demanding, but we have a top tier team with many employees who have been here for years, and many others who have left and returned, Azzopardi said. The Governor is direct with employees if their work is sub-par because the people of New York deserve nothing short of excellence.\n\nMultiple allegations\n\nHinton's account followed those of a series of other women, including one who only met Cuomo at a wedding in 2019, who have accused the governor of inappropriate behavior.\n\nAna Liss , another former staffer, told The Wall Street Journal in a report published on Saturday that the governor asked her if she had a boyfriend, called her sweetheart, touched her on her lower back at a reception and once kissed her hand when she rose from her desk.\n\nDuring Sunday's news conference, Cuomo said his interactions with Liss were comparable to others he's had with dozens of employees over several decades and added, again, I never meant to make anyone feel unwelcome in any way.\n\nIf customs change, then I'll change the customs and the behaviors, the governor said. But I never meant to feel -- make anyone feel any uncomfortable.\n\nThe firestorm, which has consumed New York politics over the past 10 days, began on February 24, when former aide Lindsey Boylan alleged in a Medium post that Cuomo kissed her on the lips against her will in 2018 after a brief, one-on-one meeting in his New York City office. She also wrote that, a year earlier, he suggested they play strip poker during a flight on a small plane from an event in Western New York.\n\nCuomo press secretary Caitlin Girouard denied the account, saying, Ms. Boylan's claims of inappropriate behavior are quite simply false. (Girouard has since confirmed she is leaving Cuomo's office for the private sector but said that decision predated both the release of the nursing homes report and any public allegations of sexual harassment.)\n\nDays later, Charlotte Bennett, a 25-year-old former executive assistant and health policy adviser to Cuomo, first told the New York Times that the governor had asked her a series of personal questions and said he was open to relationships with women in their 20s.\n\nI thought, he's trying to sleep with me. The governor is trying to sleep with me. And I'm deeply uncomfortable and I have to get out of this room as soon as possible, Bennett said in an interview with CBS News.\n\nBennett has also said she reported the incident to Cuomo's chief of staff and was subsequently moved to another position, across the Capitol from the governor's office. Her attorney, Debra Katz, sent a letter Friday to the attorney general calling for all documents and notes of conversations related to her client's complaint to be maintained without alteration.\n\nCuomo denied the allegations in a statement released shortly after the initial Times report, saying he believed he had been acting as a mentor and had never made advances toward Ms. Bennett, nor did I ever intend to act in any way that was inappropriate.\n\nOn March 1, another woman, Anna Ruch, came forward to accuse Cuomo of making an unwanted advance toward her after they met at a wedding in 2019.\n\nRuch told the Times she thanked Cuomo for his toast to the newlyweds before he placed his hands on her lower back, which was exposed by her dress. The governor then, in an account verified by Ruch's friend, whom CNN is not naming due to concerns the friend expressed over their professional life, put both hands on Ruch's face asking if her could kiss her.\n\nCuomo during a news conference last week apologized for making people uncomfortable but denied making any inappropriate physical contact.
Hong Kong (CNN) Hopes for a slowdown in the spread of the novel coronavirus were dashed Friday as the number of new cases rose in China , and outbreaks worsened in Japan and South Korea.\n\nAuthorities in China's Hubei province confirmed an additional 411 cases of the virus Thursday morning, 62 more than the previous day, taking the total number of cases at the epicenter of the outbreak to 62,442.\n\nLater Thursday, provincial authorities upgraded that figure to 631, after changing the criteria to include figures from a prison in the region.\n\nThere are an additional 14,000 or so cases outside Hubei, with the majority in other parts of mainland China.\n\nThe death toll from the outbreak now stands at 2,249, after more deaths in mainland China Thursday, including 115 in Hubei, seven more than the previous day\n\nMore than 42,000 patients remain hospitalized across Hubei, including 2,018 in a critical condition. So far, 11,788 patients have been treated and discharged since the outbreak began.\n\nOn Thursday, the Jiangxia District No. 1 Hospital in Wuhan confirmed that another doctor -- Peng Yinhua -- died of the novel coronavirus after treating patients. Dr. Peng's death prompted grief on social media after local newspapers reported the 29-year-old delayed his marriage because of the epidemic.\n\nChinese officials revealed that six doctors had died and more than 3,000 hospital staff had been infected with the virus, among whom 1,716 had been confirmed by nucleic acid tests as of February 11.\n\nMeanwhile, fears are growing of self-sustaining epidemics elsewhere in Asia.\n\nOutside China , the largest coronavirus outbreaks have been in South Korea and Japan, where hundreds of people were infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which began disembarking passengers this week from Yokohama Bay.\n\nThe number of cases in South Korea has soared, from 28 a week ago to at least 204 as of Friday afternoon. Two patients who have been diagnosed with coronavirus have died in the country, where the outbreak is centered around the southern city of Daegu.\n\nAmong the new cases, most are linked to the Shincheonji group. South Korean authorities Thursday were seeking to question more than 1,000 members of the religious group who attended a service with one of the recently confirmed cases.\n\nDaegu's mayor asked the congregation and their family members to self-quarantine at home.\n\nThree other new cases connected to Daegu involved members of the military.\n\nMedical teams have been dispatched to the city, where they will test people without overseas travel history or relation to other confirmed cases. Until now, tests have only been conducted on cases with recent travel history to China, Hong Kong, and Macao, or on people showing suspicious symptoms of the virus after being in contact with confirmed cases.\n\nOn Friday, the South Korean government designated Daegu and neighboring Cheongdo as special management areas for infectious disease. Meanwhile, South Korea's military administration temporarily suspended drafting soldiers from Daegu and the surrounding North Gyeongsang Province.\n\nJapan outbreak\n\nIn Japan, where attention has been focused for weeks on the Diamond Princess cruise liner docked at Yokohama, fears are growing of a separate outbreak centered around Nagano, northwest of Tokyo.\n\nAt least 87 cases have been confirmed in Japan unrelated to the ship, and one death. Cases have also been reported as far south as Okinawa and on Kyushu, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK.\n\nOn Thursday, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued a new travel advisory for Japan, but only at the mildest level, which recommends people practice usual precautions and avoid contact with sick people.\n\nAt this time, CDC does not recommend canceling or postponing travel to Japan, the agency said. By comparison, it currently lists mainland China as a level 3 warning and advises travelers to avoid nonessential travel. The notice excludes Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.\n\nHundreds of travelers on board the Diamond Princess were due to disembark Friday. Many have already left the ship and begun flying home.\n\nAs they have done so, however, more evidence has emerged about the alleged failure of the quarantine on board. Around a dozen passengers who were deemed not to have the virus were later found to be showing symptoms when they flew to the US, leading them to require isolation from other passengers on the evacuation flight.\n\nAn additional two passengers evacuated from the ship tested positive on arrival in Australia Friday.\n\nBrendan Murphy, chief medical officer for the Australian government, said in a statement that 164 people from the Diamond Princess arrived to the Howard Springs Quarantine Facility in Darwin on Thursday to begin their 14-day quarantine.\n\nUpon arrival, six passengers had minor respiratory symptoms and/or fevers. Of those, two people have since tested positive for the novel coronavirus.\n\nMurphy said both patients remain well and were being housed in an isolation unit at the quarantine facility. Murphy added that the development of positive cases after return to Australia is not unexpected as there was evidence of spread of infection on board the Diamond Princess.\n\nJUST WATCHED Passenger weeps after leaving cruise ship quarantine Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Passenger weeps after leaving cruise ship quarantine 03:08\n\nMurphy reassured other passengers and the crew on the Qantas evacuation flight, saying that all measures were taken to ensure their protection and that the small number of passengers on the plane meant passengers could be spread out. Higher risk passengers were seated in separate sections.\n\nHundreds of the 3,000 or so people on board the Diamond Princess tested positive for the virus during the two-week quarantine. On Thursday, Japanese health officials announced that two passengers with the virus had died in hospital. Both were Japanese citizens in their eighties.\n\nThe outbreak is expected to put the cruise industry under pressure as passengers defer or cancel trips. Airlines are also expected to take a major hit , after dozens of carriers cut flights to China and elsewhere in the affected region.\n\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated the total global lost revenue for airlines due to coronavirus could be $29.3 billion.\n\nIATA expected a potential 13% drop in passengers for the year across the Asia-Pacific region, and the financial impact will be severe for those particularly exposed to the China market, it said in a statement Thursday.

(CNN) What happened to the alt-right after Charlottesville could be a guide for what happens to QAnon and the mob that stormed the US Capitol last week.\n\nThe alt-right was a version of white supremacy that attracted a much younger crowd through the internet, and it aimed to work within mainstream politics to advance racism. And for a moment, it seemed like it was working -- that the movement was moving from the internet to real life.\n\nBut after the Unite the Right rally in 2017, their efforts were slowly crushed. By mid-2018, its leaders told me they could no longer hold public rallies that were announced in advance. Many groups disbanded because of infighting, or because their internal communications were infiltrated by anti-fascists, or because their leader was humiliated in scandal. A longtime troll told me last month that talking about current events in that world was considered cringe, meaning embarrassing.\n\nWhite nationalism still exists. The Department of Homeland Security says it is the greatest terror threat in the United States. But it is not spreading through the movement that called itself the alt-right.\n\nThis happened because the alt-right was hammered on three fronts -- social, financial and legal. It's important to understand how these three elements worked together, because there are early signs the same pattern is happening with the Trump movement and the QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\nPro-Trump rioters swarm the US Capitol on January 6.\n\nIt's hard to remember now, but before Charlottesville, the term alt-right was in flux, claimed by both neo-Nazis and not-explicitly-racist conservatives. To take one prominent example, in 2016, when he was running the Trump campaign, Steve Bannon infamously said his Breitbart News website was  the platform for the alt-right .\n\nAfter Charlottesville, the term alt-right was poison. Only days later, Bannon said,  Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers , and, We gotta help crush it.\n\nThe blowback came in three parts.\n\nThose in the alt-right who weren't doxxed lived in paralyzing fear of it , they've told me. Life became very difficult for the movement's footsoldiers.\n\nAs their faces circulated on social media, they lost their own accounts. White power advocates were kicked of Twitter, Facebook, etc. Alternative social media sites like Gab popped up. But some complained to me that using Gab was pointless. Elliot Kline, then head of the now-defunct group Identity Evropa, told me there were no journalists on Gab. They couldn't use it to spread their message outside the echo chamber.\n\nThis was the aftereffect of Charlottesville that most Americans could see best, but it wasn't the most important.\n\nThe second part was the money. They lost the power to raise it. Fundraising sites such as Patreon and GoFundMe kicked them off. White power programmers tried to make their own versions -- Hatreon, GoyFundMe -- but that didn't work, because then payment processors dropped them.\n\nThe civil rights advocacy group Color of Change had been pressuring financial services companies to stop processing the payments of White nationalists well before Charlottesville. Color of Change president Rashad Robinson told CNN that at the time, he thought it was absurd that it was so easy to give White nationalists money.\n\nWe started going to the credit card companies and processors, and they'd say you have to go to the banks. The banks would say you have to go to the credit card companies, Robinson said.\n\nA lot of enabling happens because people in powerful positions are not seeing this as a threat against them and their families, Robinson said. They could make intellectual arguments about slippery slopes, but what they were doing was creating an out so they didn't have to make hard decisions -- decisions that should not have been hard in the first place.\n\nPayPal was the only company that worked well with Color of Change to cut off White power groups, Robinson said. And then Charlottesville happened.\n\nMagically they could do something they couldn't do before -- and no law had changed.\n\nPhotos: Violence erupts at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia People fly into the air as a vehicle drives into a group of people demonstrating against a white nationalist rally after police cleared Emancipation Park in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday, August 12.

He complained he could still get money through Bitcoin -- but few people used it, and it had no mechanism for recurring payments. At one point, alt-right figurehead Richard Spencer told me he could get money only through paper checks.\n\nMatthew Heimbach, who ran the now-disbanded Traditionalist Worker Party , has quit the White power movement. But this summer he told me that non-profit groups that transition people out of extremism didn't have much to offer him. He said they told him they could pay for his extremist tattoo to be removed, and get him on cable TV. He didn't need that, he said. What he needed was a good job -- to support his family, and to pay for a lawyer. His past limited his options.\n\nThe social and the financial repercussions combined to worsen the effects of the third piece of the backlash: the legal. Those who committed crimes on camera were often prosecuted. James Alex Fields Jr., who drove his car into a crowd in Charlottesville, killing Heather Heyer, was sentenced to life in prison . Cantwell was prosecuted for macing people in a confrontation with anti-fascists at the end of a torch march. He pleaded guilty to two assault charges involving pepper spray and was required to leave the state of Virginia.\n\n(In a sign of how the pressure has caused the White power movement to eat itself, in September, Cantwell was found guilty of extortion. Cantwell had threatened a White supremacist that he'd rape his wife unless the man gave Cantwell the personal information of a third White supremacist whom Cantwell was angry with.)\n\nPerhaps most devastating, many of Charlottesville's major White power figures were named in a federal civil lawsuit, Sines v. Kessler, filed in October 2017. The plaintiffs' legal team is headed by Roberta Kaplan, who successfully argued at the Supreme Court to end the ban on gay marriage\n\nThe alt-right defendants have not been able to find legal representation with a comparable resume.\n\nIn fact, they've struggled to find lawyers at all. Six of the remaining 18 defendants, including Richard Spencer, are now representing themselves in court. In a hearing this spring, Spencer's lawyer asked to withdraw from the case because Spencer hadn't paid him. Spencer told the judge the case had been financially crippling. The judge allowed the lawyer to quit.\n\nThe trial is scheduled for April, but it may be pushed to October because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWill QAnon and the pro-Trump mob face something similar? There are early signs the answer is yes. Activists and law enforcement are working together to find the identities of people pictured inside the Capitol.\n\nAs photos of their faces circulate on social media, rioters are facing consequences at home. A Maryland man seen entering the Capitol wearing his work ID on a lanyard has been fired. Many of his comrades have also lost their jobs\n\nThousands of QAnon accounts have been removed from social media. They've tried migrating to Parler, but Amazon stopped providing services to Parler, effectively kicking it off the public internet. Apple and Google removed it from their app stores. On eBay, sellers are trying to take advantage of less tech-savvy Trump fans, offering mobile phones with Parler already installed for more than $1,000.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been kicked off Twitter and Facebook. Sunday night, the payment processor Stripe booted the Trump campaign. Monday, Signature Bank said it would close Trump's personal accounts. Deutsche Bank , which has been a major source of loans to Trump's businesses, announced it will no longer do business with him.\n\nTrump is certainly in a stronger position, in terms of power and money, than even the most affluent marchers in Charlottesville. But that also means he has more to lose. Especially legally.
The Washington Attorney General sued the owner of Arlene's Flowers in Richland for refusing to provide wedding flowers for a same-sex marriage.\n\nStory highlights Curt Freed and Robert Ingersoll sued Arlene's Flowers in 2013 Florist argued anti-discrimination law violated her first amendment rights\n\n(CNN) —\n\nA Washington florist violated the state's anti-discrimination law when she denied a same-sex couple wedding services on the basis of her faith, the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday.\n\nThe case drew national attention in 2013 when the couple sued Arlene's Flowers for refusing to provide flowers for their wedding. As state bans on same-sex marriage were crumbling and more couples were seeking wedding services, it was one of several high-profile legal challenges to arise from the backlash to marriage equality.\n\nThe unanimous decision upholds a lower court ruling. With marriage equality now the law of the land, the ruling joins a growing body of case law rejecting business owners' claims of first amendment protections as grounds for discrimination, said Elizabeth Gill, the ACLU's senior staff attorney and co-counsel for the couple.\n\nIt sends a really strong message that for the state of Washington inclusion and acceptance is incredibly important, she said. It's an important contribution to the growing body of case law that rejects the idea that people operating in the public space can discriminate.\n\nCurt Freed and Robert Ingersoll got engaged in December 2012, shortly after Washington began recognizing same-sex marriages. Longtime patrons of Arlene's Flowers in Richland, they approached owner Barronelle Stutzman about arrangements for their wedding.\n\nStutzman, an ardent evangelical, denied their request saying she could not support a wedding that her faith forbids.\n\nI was not discriminating at all, she told CNN in 2013. I never told him he couldn't get married. I gave him recommendations for other flower shops.\n\nThe couple sued along with the state attorney general. She was vilified by some and celebrated by others who viewed her as a freedom fighter.\n\nIn addition to first amendment protections, Stutzman argued that no real harm came from her refusal because other florists were available and willing to serve the couple.\n\nThe judges rejected both claims. They sided with Ingersoll and Freed's argument that their case was about more than access to flowers, just as civil rights cases of the 1960s were about more than access to sandwiches.\n\nAs every other court to address the question has concluded, public accommodations laws do not simply guarantee access to goods or services. Instead, they serve a broader societal purpose: eradicating barriers to the equal treatment of all citizens in the commercial marketplace.\n\nStutzman faces fines but her business remains open. The couple said they went forward with the wedding with tempered enthusiasm because of the experience.\n\nWe're thrilled that the Washington Supreme Court has ruled in our favor. The court affirmed that we are on the right side of law and the right side of history, Freed and Ingersoll said in a statement.\n\nWe felt it was so important that we stand up against discrimination because we don't want what happened to us to happen to anyone else. We are so glad that we stood up for our rights.
Hind Albolooki says she fled Dubai after her family threatened her for seeking a divorce.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nAn Emirati woman who fled to the Republic of Macedonia has made a desperate plea for help after her asylum request was rejected by the Balkan state.\n\nIn a video posted online and obtained by CNN, Hind Mohammad Albolooki, 42, says she fled Dubai after her family threatened her when she sought a divorce from her husband.\n\nHer request for asylum in Macedonia was rejected on February 4 by the Macedonia interior ministry. While awaiting a decision, Albolooki is being held in immigration detention, where she has been since December 7, and now fears she will be deported back to the United Arab Emirates.\n\nPHOTO: HAlbolooki / Twitter Hind Mohammed Albolooki's asylum request was rejected in Macedonia.\n\nIn a video recorded in December before her arrest, Albolooki said her family did not approve of her seeking a divorce because it would affect their reputation.\n\nThey don't want their name to be spoiled, she said.\n\nAlbolooki said her family tried to take her passport away.\n\nIf someone is asking for passport or ID, that means that there is something going on and I wasn't that stupid, Albolooki said, adding that in that moment she decided to run away.\n\nI am a mother of four children. No mother would leave her kids just like this, she said. But I had to leave my kids. I had no other choice.\n\nEscaping Dubai via Turkey and Serbia\n\nAlbolooki's friend Nenad Dimitrov, who lives in Kochani, Macedonia, and has been running the 42-year-old's Twitter account since she was detained, said he met her on a cruise ship and has been in contact with her since.\n\nHe said Albolooki escaped her family on October 2 after being allowed to go to the toilet. From there, he said, she ran – without her shoes – and hid in a nearby construction area before finally hailing a taxi that took her to a friend's place in the Emirati city of Sharjah. He said from there she fled overland to Bahrain.\n\nCNN has been unable to contact Albolooki's family.\n\nDimitrov said Albolooki reached out to him asking to help her book flights to Macedonia because she was afraid to book them on her credit card.\n\nWhen she asked for help she was in Bahrain and said 'I don't have anyone to go to, can you help me get tickets?' Dimitrov told CNN.\n\nAlbolooki eventually flew through Turkey to Serbia before entering Macedonia on October 4. She applied for asylum two weeks later.\n\nIn a statement, Macedonia's interior ministry said Albolooki's asylum request was denied in February because there was no evidence of persecution … on the grounds of her race, religion, nationality … or political affiliation.\n\nIt added that there was no reason to believe that, should she return (to Dubai), she would be faced with a real risk of serious injury.\n\nIt said it had since granted Albolooki a 15-day grace period to voluntarily leave the country. Dimitrov said Albolooki is eager to seek asylum elsewhere, but detention has made that difficult.\n\nAlbolooki is 'likely to be severely punished' if she returns\n\nRadha Stirling from the UK-based advocacy group Detained in Dubai said if Albolooki returned to the UAE she would likely be severely punished for her escape.\n\nThe patriarchal system, and informal male guardianship rules she is fleeing are just as pronounced in the UAE as they are in Saudi Arabia, Stirling said.\n\nThere is a misconception that the Emirates is a more liberal, Westernized society; the UAE has worked very hard to manufacture that image, but the reality is drastically different.\n\nWe have seen rape victims arrested and charged with having sex outside marriage, women denied custodial access to their children after divorce, and the laws actually stipulate the necessity of female obedience to a male guardian.\n\nStirling suggested Macedonia rushed to deny Albolooki asylum because of the soft power wielded by the UAE in less wealthy nations through the use of investment.\n\nAccording to the nongovernmental organization Transparency International, Macedonia was ranked 34 out of 100 for its perceived levels of public sector corruption in 2017.\n\nRelations between the UAE and Macedonia are handled in Rome.\n\nIn a statement released by WAM, the official news agency of the UAE, the deputy head of mission at the UAE Embassy in Rome, Ahmed Almulla, said his government was aware of Albolooki's social media posts.\n\nThe embassy will collect any evidence of illegal threats made against her and pass it to police so that it can be fully investigated. Our embassy staff are ready to help Mrs. Albolooki in any way they can, Almulla said.\n\nDomestic abuse is a serious crime, and has no place whatsoever in the UAE; Emirati women are protected and fully empowered under UAE laws. Crimes involving harm against women are severely prosecuted under UAE law, and these allegations should and will be fully investigated.\n\nAlbolooki's story comes after the Dubai ruler's daughter, Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum, made headlines last year for reportedly trying to escape her family after claiming she was tortured and detained for three years.\n\nCNN's Samuel Quashie-Idun contributed to this story.

This includes potentially critical shortages of diagnostics, medical supplies (including PPE and pharmaceuticals), and staffing in some locations, the report outlines in one potential scenario.\n\nThe country is already feeling the strain: Hospitals have sounded the alarm on quickly vanishing supplies as the outbreak in the US shows no signs of slowing -- in just 24 hours, cases soared by more than 40%.\n\nThe US government announced this week it would help make up for potential medical supply shortages and deploy two hospital ships to help increase medical capacity.\n\nNearly 9,000 Americans have tested positive for the virus. At least 149 have died.\n\nRead more here and here.\n\n##Daily Life

Read more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) In the first hours and days of the Biden administration, something precious has been returned to us. That invaluable thing that has been restored to LGBTQ Americans -- and many others -- is hope.\n\nAmong President Joe Biden's first actions in office was to issue an executive order barring workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Another was to end the Trump administration's policies denying the existence of systemic racism and barring diversity and inclusion training . Already, the relaunched White House web site contact form invites users to choose their own pronouns, a seemingly small but deeply significant reflection of the new administration's commitment to inclusion.\n\nThere is hope in the appointment of Dr. Rachel Levine to become the highest-ranking transgender woman nominated to serve as Assistant Secretary of Health at the Department of Health and Human Services in the Biden administration. I am proud of the work we have done as an administration to address health equity, and the work I have done personally to raise awareness about LGBTQ equity issues, said Levine, who is a pediatrician, in a statement when she was nominated for the cabinet position.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has tapped Dr. Rachel Levine to be his assistant secretary of health, leaving her poised to become the first transgender federal official to be confirmed by the US Senate.\n\nThere is hope in the anticipated confirmation of a gay man, Pete Buttigieg, to be transportation secretary and in the appointment of a Black gay woman, Karine Jean-Pierre, as deputy press secretary -- to name only two of the most visible among the many LGBTQ Americans called to serve in an inclusive, diverse administration\n\nLevine's nomination alone is enough to make me want to dance in the streets. To at long last have someone who understands -- intrinsically, deeply and personally -- what LGBTQ Americans and particularly what transgender people face, carries the prospect of more inclusive policies and approaches. What a complete about-face from the previous administration, which actively worked to strip trans Americans, already trapped in a broken system that marginalized them, of health care access.\n\nI'm reminded of what the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called the dissenter's hope: that they are writing not for today, but for tomorrow.\n\nAll the dissenting, measured in petitions signed and virtual doors knocked, in dollars donated and social media rants posted, in clever signs and fists held high at rallies, in first-time confrontations with racist uncles and hard, honest conversations with our children, has not been for naught. That dissent has, in the great words of RBG and in her honor, given way to the one thing that paves the way for endless possibilities to follow: hope for the future.\n\nJUST WATCHED Biden Cabinet pick Pete Buttigieg on his historic nomination Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Biden Cabinet pick Pete Buttigieg on his historic nomination 09:41\n\nI trust that Biden won't just undo Trump's damage and revert back to Obama-era policies. Biden will do better than that. After all, then-Vice President Joe Biden was a major force in moving the Democratic Party out of the closet on supporting the LGBTQ community . In May 2012, Biden declared his support for marriage equality, the highest ranking official to do so at the time. The move helped push President Barack Obama to also endorse same-sex marriage in a national TV interview a few days later, and, well, the rest is history.\n\nBiden isn't perfect. He voted for the Defense of Marriage Act during the Clinton administration and to cut off federal funding to schools teaching acceptance of homosexuality. But he has evolved , and surrounded himself with forward-thinking people who embody and embrace LGBTQ inclusivity and will help push the needle in the right direction towards equality and justice.\n\nWhat could that look like under the Biden administration? With a friendlier Congress now in place, it could mean passage of the Equality Act, which Biden has pledged to sign in his first 100 days and which would provide blanket protections against discrimination for LGBTQ people. If adopted, the measure would mitigate the patchwork of state and local laws that leave roughly two-thirds of LGBTQ Americans, according to the Human Rights Campaign's estimates, vulnerable to getting kicked out of their homes, turned away from school or denied entry to a public space simply because of their sexual or gender identity.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.

And, when this avalanche of emotions has subsided, when the pomp and circumstance settles, I'm hopeful we can start to let go of some of the anxiety and pessimism we've been holding onto. Only then can we allow ourselves to fully exhale into something that looks like the future, a brighter spot where our lives matter -- Black and brown, gay and transgender, immigrant and citizen, rich and poor, young and old. We feel the sun on our skin again.
New York (CNN Business) Shopping in the pandemic often means buying supplies for working, cooking and exercising at home. But consumers are also looking for ways to pass the time, and for some, that means picking up a magazine while they're out and about.\n\nThose who braved a drug store, supermarket or newsstand this past month may have seen in the magazine section copies of Better Homes & Gardens' Secrets of Getting Organized, Delish's Keto Comfort Foods and Time's collector's edition on the Korean pop band, BTS\n\nBut these are not traditional magazines. They are what some in the media industry call bookazines — a blend of books and magazines — and in recent years, they have become more crucial to publishers' success.\n\nThe pandemic has introduced additional stress to the already struggling magazine industry, but it may have boosted the success of bookazines., which publishes People, Food & Wine and dozens of other popular titles, said last week its newsstand revenue grew by $3 million in the past quarter compared to the year prior. Its earnings report specifically cited bookazines, which are usually presented as single-topic, in-depth magazines often marketed to consumers as collectors' items.\n\nWhile many magazines have shrunk or folded in recent years, some publishers see opportunity in bookazines. They are less dependent on advertising — a once reliable source of revenue that continues to be eaten up by tech platforms likeand. The issues are big, sometimes exceeding 100 pages, but publishers can fill pages with stories and photos from their archives, making them less costly to produce. And they can seize on current trends like keto diets or cultural moments such as the passing of beloved celebrities and other public figures.\n\nTo me, [bookazines] represent a really nice pandemic treat, said Aileen Gallagher, associate professor of magazine, news and digital journalism at Syracuse University. We're all still stuck in our houses and the only place we're really going is the grocery store. It's like, 'Oh, here's this thing that will entertain me for a little while that I will invest $10 in.'\n\n'Intentional purchase'\n\nBookazines are not a new concept in the publishing world. Meredith has been in the business for more than 30 years, but the magazine conglomerate has invested more resources and seen greater returns in recent years.\n\nDoug Olson, president and general manager of Meredith Magazines, called bookazines a very profitable business. Last year, Meredith released 331 issues, up from 330 issues in 2019. Sales grew about 2% from year prior, with some data yet to be reported.\n\nMeredith bookazines are tied to its own brands — including People Royals, a quarterly publication debuting in March that covers the British royal family. It has launched new brands as bookazines, including a lifestyle publication called Sweet July with Ayesha Curry and a home design publication called Reveal with Drew and Jonathan Scott.\n\nThe New York Times NYT Meredith has also converted older titles into bookazines, such as Traditional Home and Coastal Living. Meredith also produces bookazines for partners such The Los Angeles Times,and Rolling Stone.\n\nMost bookazines do not include ads and instead are sold at a higher price point than weekly or monthly magazines. The majority of Meredith's bookazines cost $9.99 or more.\n\nIt's an intentional purchase, Olson said. We may catch [readers buying them] as an impulse at retail... but really this is an expensive product that they're very passionate about. There's a lot of talk about digital paywalls, but this is the original content paywall.\n\nA higher price tag and lower production costs contribute to bookazines' profitability. Steven Kotok, CEO and president of Bauer Media Group USA, said bookazines that sell a fraction of the copies of an issue of one of our magazines can be successful.\n\nBauer Media Group USA doubled its production, publishing 60 bookazine titles in 2020. This year, it plans to publish more than 100 titles. That growth will partially rely on a new partnership with Time magazine. In April, Time will switch publishing partners from Meredith to Bauer. A Time spokesperson declined to comment on the reason but shared that Time sold more than 2 million copies of bookazines in 2020.\n\nTime, in partnership with Meredith, produced a bookazine on Korean pop band BTS in July 2020.\n\nHearst, which publishes Delish, Town & Country and other titles, invested more in bookazines after its acquired Rodale a few years back. Jacqueline Deval, vice president and publisher of Hearst Books, told CNN Business that it doubled the profits from 2019 to 2020. Hearst produced 80 bookazines last year, up from 75 in 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, Condé Nast has divested from the product. In a 2016 Business of Fashion story , Leah McLaughlin, Condé Nast's former director of special interest publishing, said the company published 34 special editions that year and planned to produce more the next year. But now it appears that the company has deprioritized bookazines. A Condé Nast spokesperson said the company is looking to make money from its intellectual property through other mediums such as video, podcasts, movies and television.\n\nGallagher, the Syracuse professor, suggested that bookazines might not align well with Condé Nast's brands. The conglomerate owns popular and influential titles such as Vogue, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker.\n\nCondé Nast wants to look forward and not back. I think the idea of here's a bunch of old articles doesn't feel very now for Condé Nast, Gallagher said. Their back catalog isn't as versatile.\n\n'Real time thinking'\n\nThis spring, Hearst is producing a vegan bookazine under its Good Housekeeping brand. It also will relaunch Quick and Simple — a magazine Hearst shut down in 2008 — as a bookazine, first with one-pot meals and then baking for the Fall season.\n\nWe lean heavily on food because it works, Deval said. It's also crowded and so we take a lot of care to make sure we're matching the right topic with the right brand. The dream bookazine is the marriage of the right brand authority with the subject.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean consumers are buying them for the brand name attached, or that bookazines and magazines appeal to the same consumers.\n\nSomeone doesn't make a decision, 'do I want to buy the Better Homes and Gardens' 'Grilling Book' one time or get a subscription to the magazine,' Olson said. It's two different decisions.\n\nOther media businesses are eying bookazines as a new source of revenue. The Los Angeles Times produced two bookazines -— both with Meredith — last year: a tribute to Kobe Bryant on February 7 and Dodgers: 2020 World Series Champions on November 6. The newspaper is planning to publish up to six a year.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times produced a commemorative issue on Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda after he died in January.\n\nLee Fentress, the paper's executive vice president of business development and commerce, said bookazines appeal to consumers who don't regularly read the LA Times... It's an opportunity to showcase collections of original reporting that the LA Times has a certain history with or authority to cover.\n\nA perk of bookazines is the agility of producing them, compared to weekly or monthly magazines. Deval said her team at Hearst produced a bookazine titled T&C Presents Harry & Meghan, The Royal Wedding Album over a single weekend in 2018.\n\nMeredith's Olson agreed that bookazines allow his team be more nimble — a trait more commonly associated with digital media companies than magazine conglomerates.\n\nIf it's working, we do more of it. If it's not working, we just change the publishing schedule, Olson said. It's online real time thinking.

But this year's nine nominees were also very long, with three running more than two and a half hours.\n\nFor comparison, the last three years (2019, 2018, and 2017), the run time for the best picture nominees totaled 17 hours 35 minutes, 17 hours 25 minutes and 17 hours 25 minutes, respectively. (For those wondering, Cleopatra, from director Walter Wanger is the longest best picture nominee ever, running 248 minutes.)\n\nThere were a couple of years in the 1930s where there were 12 best picture nominees. And it's in one of those years — 1935 — that we find a batch of movies that run longer than this year's nominees.\n\n1935 nominees\n\nMutiny on the Bounty — 132 minutes\n\n— 132 minutes Alice Adams (99 minutes)\n\n(99 minutes) Broadway Melody of 1936 — 101 minutes\n\n— 101 minutes Captain Blood  — 119 minutes\n\n — 119 minutes David Copperfield — 130 minutes\n\n— 130 minutes The Informer — 91 minutes\n\n— 91 minutes The Lives of a Bengal Lancer — 109 minutes\n\n— 109 minutes A Midsummer Night's Dream — 133 minutes\n\n— 133 minutes Les Misérables — 109 minutes\n\n— 109 minutes Naughty Marietta — 105 minutes\n\n— 105 minutes Ruggles of Red Gap — 90 minutes\n\n— 90 minutes Top Hat — 101 minutes\n\nTOTAL : 21 hours 59 minutes (1,319 minutes)\n\nThe Oscars voters in 1935 deserve our respect, though, because they couldn't stream them all at home.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThere is nothing like a political upset to energize the party out of power.\n\nAnd Tuesday night's election was a whopper of an upset – a huge energizer for not just the Democratic Party, but also for women who have been victims of sexual assault.\n\nPHOTO: Jeff Mauritzen Jen Psaki\n\nYes, Roy Moore was a deeply flawed candidate long before he was accused of sexual abuse, allegations he denies. But Alabama is a deep red state that has not elected a Democrat since 1992, and that Democrat, Richard Shelby, became a Republican just two years later.\n\nDoug Jones ran a smart, Alabama-focused campaign, and stayed out of the national spotlight. He smartly focused on African-American turnout in the closing weeks and it worked.\n\nAs special elections go, this is an earthquake that will have repercussions far into 2018.\n\nWhat will they be?\n\nFirst, Democrats are going to feel emboldened to run in states and districts next year where traditionally they would have no business running. This carries some danger because Democrats are still behind Republicans in fundraising on the national level. Democrats' time, energy and money should be focused on an expanded list of races where they have the best chance of winning.\n\nThere is no doubt now that both the Senate and the House are in play for 2018. The Jones win will help Democrats with fundraising and candidate recruitment. And even in states, like Alabama, where the turnout wheels have been rusty, it is clear that the energy and the enthusiasm is there to be tapped into.\n\nSecond, this is a win for the establishment Republicans. And a loss for Steve Bannon – and more importantly Donald Trump. Trump put himself out there for Roy Moore – not just with presidential tweets, but with a trip to an adjoining media market. This loss is far worse for Trump's political power and for Steve Bannon's political wisdom than was the Republicans' loss in the Virginia governor's race last month.\n\nBut it is still a mixed bag for Mitch McConnell and Republican leaders. Yes, it weakens the insurgency they faced in the Republican Party, but leaves them down a Senate seat at a time when they can't afford it. It also weakens the wing of the party that was actually energizing Republicans, the Trump-Bannon wing.\n\nThird, this is a win for the victims of sexual assault who bravely spoke out in Alabama. It will no doubt embolden other women to speak out against men in power who they say assaulted them. And on the political front, Democratic Senators like Kirsten Gillibrand, who have in the last week raised the stakes on Donald Trump and made clear that Democrats are going to have a zero tolerance policy for sexual harassment and sexual assault, now have the wind at their backs.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nFinally, it is a win for morality and human decency. The candidate accused of sexual abuse, who opposed gay marriage and consensual homosexual relationships, who questioned whether Muslims could serve in the United State Congress, lost.\n\nAnd the candidate who talked not about Donald Trump, but about the importance of the CHIP program, a program that helps provide health insurance to tens of thousands of children every year that Congress has failed to fund, was the winner.\n\nIn a tough political year for morality, let's hope this is a sign of things to come next year.

The candidates will lay out strategies for the 2018 midterm elections, rebuilding the Democratic Party and the DNC's role under the Trump administration.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nPete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old openly gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who served in the Navy during the war in Afghanistan, announced on Wednesday that he is launching an exploratory committee for a 2020 presidential bid.\n\nButtigieg made the announcement in an email to supporters and in a video posted online where he lays out his message of generational change centered on three values: Freedom, security and democracy. In that video, Buttigieg leans into how he took over South Bend when he was 29 years old and claims he turned around what had been referred to as a dying city.\n\nThere's a new generation of voices emerging in our country, walking away from the politics of the past and ready to deliver on our priorities. There is no 'again' in the real world; that's not a bad thing, Buttigieg says in the video. We are ready for a fresh start.\n\nButtigieg's 2020 argument is that he would like to do the same for the country that he did for South Bend, even if he knows the odds are against him, and that the only way to accomplish change like that is through a generational shift in American politics.\n\nWhat will America look like in 2054, when I reach the age of the current president, he asked in his email to supporters. How will we look back on 2020?\n\nButtigieg, who most recently ran for chair of the Democratic National Committee after the 2016 election, has been exploring a presidential bid for over a year, moving closer with a trip to Iowa in December where he was well received by an audience of progressives in Des Moines.\n\nThe mayor, who has little national name recognition and could struggle to get attention in a crowded field including heavyweights like Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\n\nButtigieg followed up his announcement with a news conference in Washington where he told reporters that there has been a total realignment in the politics of this country and that his age would be a selling point in a crowded Democratic field. But he also acknowledged his long odds.\n\nWe are not going to be the most established, we are not going to be the most well-funded, I am obviously not stepping onto this stage as the most famous person in this conversation, he said. But I belong to a party whose characteristic has always been to look for fresh voices, new leadership and big ideas, and I think that is what 2020 is going to be about.\n\nIn an interview with CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Buttigieg said, if you are planning to be here for decades, you just look at the world a little bit differently than older candidates.\n\nI think when you run at this age, your face is your message in a lot of ways, he said. And part of what we are looking at is the idea that it's time for a new generation in American leadership.\n\nButtigieg was born and raised in South Bend and went on to attend Harvard College and later became a Rhodes scholar. After a three-year stint at the consulting firm McKinsey and Company, Buttigieg came back to Indiana and lost a race for state treasurer in 2010. The race helped him with his name recognition in the state, however, and he successfully won his first term as mayor of South Bend in 2011. Buttigieg was first deployed to Afghanistan two years later in 2013.\n\nAnother issue for the mayor's bid is how to pronounce his last name, something that has become a bit of a running joke between he and his husband, Chasten, who tweeted a list of possible pronunciations in 2018 that included boot-edge-edge, buddha-judge and boot-a-judge.\n\nOptions:\n\n\n\nboot-edge-edge\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n\nBuddha-judge\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n\nBoot-a-judge\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n\nBoo-tuh-judge — Chasten Glezman Buttigieg (@Chasten) December 17, 2018\n\n(Buttigieg's name is Maltese and roughly translates to lord of the poultry. He told reporters that people in South Bend call him Mayor Pete and that is fine with me.)\n\nButtigieg, who came out in 2015, will also be the first openly LGBTQ elected official to run for President, according to the LGBTQ Victory Fund.\n\nIn an interview with CNN in December, Buttigieg wondered if his sexuality would be an issue for more conservative Democrats.\n\nThe only way to know is to get out there, he said. I will say I got re-elected with 80% of the vote after I had come out while Mike Pence was governor of Indiana. I don't think these things decide your fate.\n\nBut the party has shifted dramatically on same-sex marriage over the last decade, with a Gallup poll in 2018 finding that 83% of Democrats support it.\n\nAnnise Parker, the openly gay former mayor of Houston and President of LGBTQ Victory Fund, called Buttigieg's announcement a historic and powerful moment for the LGBTQ community and the entire country.\n\nIn such a wide-open presidential race, Mayor Buttigieg would be a welcome contribution to the marketplace of ideas that will determine where our nation is headed in 2020 and beyond, she said. And while he is not running on his sexual orientation, his presence will undoubtedly elevate LGBTQ issues in the Democratic primary.\n\nAnd after his speech in Iowa in December, a number of attendees commented that they appreciated that he embraced who he was and made it part of his broader story.\n\nI like that Mayor Pete guy, one woman standing near the elevator was overheard by CNN. He's gay and going places.\n\nButtigieg told reporters his sexuality was a fact of life and that the race was not just about profile, but he was mindful of the fact that this just might make it a little easier for the next person who comes along.\n\nOne of the things that every person should think about in the run-up to 2020, especially because there are so many people, is that it is not only the outcome, but it is the conduct of campaigns that will make an impact on political life in our country, he said when asked about some of the response to the historic nature of his candidacy. The world is changing, but it is not changing on its own. So, if by bringing forward good ideas I can be part of chipping away at that, that is one more reason to give this a look.\n\nRepublicans quickly blasted Buttigieg's announcement, suggesting his leadership of South Bend does not merit a presidential run.\n\nBefore Buttigieg wastes time on a presidential campaign, he should focus on his town's sea of potholes and sky-high crime rate, said Michael Ahrens, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. His bid isn't just bad news for residents, it's more proof that Democrats are about to endure the most crowded, divisive, and contentious primary in history.\n\nButtigieg's first book, Shortest Way Home, will come out in March and will serve as an explanation for his longshot 2020 bid. The subtitle of the book is One mayor's challenge and a model for America's future, and the youthful-looking Buttigieg is on the cover rolling up his sleeves.\n\nButtigieg told CNN last year that despite his long odds, he felt like he had to give running for president a shot.\n\nA field that is spread very thin probably works to the advantage of a newcomer if you are very good at it, he said with a smile. The only way to find out is to be tested in the field.\n\nThis story has been updated.
(CNN) — For history buffs, photographers and anyone who's ever said Wow! there's nothing quite like the sight of a medieval walled city approached from a distance.\n\nThen there are the explorations within, tours of castles, walks along the walls and shops and restaurants in medieval squares.\n\nMany cities still have their medieval walls predominantly intact in various parts of the world. Did we mention our obsession? We've visited quite a few.\n\n1. Pingyao, China\n\nConstruction of the wall that surrounds Pingyao started in 1370 CE. China Photos/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images\n\nSituated in Shanxi province, the 14th-century Han Chinese city of Pingyao was once the foremost financial center with half the country's banks located there.\n\nToday it retains its layout from the Ming and Qing dynasties and this, together with its impressive city walls, saw it World Heritage listed in 1997.\n\nConstruction of the city walls began under the Emperor Hongwu in 1370. They stand 12 meters high, have a six-kilometer perimeter, six gates, 72 watchtowers and a moat outside.\n\nToday, the shops and markets in the medieval streets are also worth a visit.\n\n2. Carcassonne, France\n\nCarcassonne is a fortified french town, its walls dating from Gallo-Roman times. Julian Finney/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nAfter the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, Carcassonne no longer guarded the frontier and its beautiful stonework and towers deteriorated till merchants cried, Pull it down.\n\nThankfully an awareness of heritage saw it classified as a protected monument in 1849 and architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc was commissioned to restore it. His work was one reason for the site's World Heritage listing.\n\nVisitors can tour the Chateau Comtal within the walled city, examine the Basilica of Saint-Nazaire and Saint-Celse, or -- when it's time for a breather -- we recommend a meal with local-area wine at La Bonne Demeure (11 Rue Saint-Sernin, 11000 Carcassonne; +33 4 68 47 45 84) on the medieval square.\n\nDriving away, we stop to look back. Instead of roofless, ruined towers the slate roofs glint in the sun atop a 13th-century fortress city that dominates the horizon. We stand in awe.\n\n3. York, England\n\nEnglish Heritage re-enactors outside Clifford's Tower in York. Ian Forsyth/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nThe historic Northern English city of York has plenty of history -- and plenty of ghosts. Find out more on The Original Ghost Walk of York, which calls itself the first exclusive ghost walk in the world.\n\nYork has a significant proportion of its walls intact, more than any other city in England. The visitor can walk along them, stopping at small museums at some of the gates. Beneath the medieval city walls lies remains of earlier Roman brickwork.\n\n4. Dubrovnik, Croatia\n\nWalking the circumference of Dubrovnick's famous city walls takes about two hours. STRINGER/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMost of the existing walls and fortifications surrounding the old center of the Adriatic port city of Dubrovnik were constructed during the 14th and 15th centuries, but parts were extended and strengthened even up to the 17th century.\n\nNo hostile army ever breached them during the Middle Ages and while the earthquake of 1667 destroyed many buildings, it left the walls largely unscathed.\n\nWalk the two-kilometer circuit of the walls for fantastic views of the sea. You can also admire the old city that lies within the walls. Take water and wear a hat and sunscreen -- there's precious little shade.\n\n5. Xi'an, China\n\nThe Xian City Wall is one of the best-preserved ancient city walls in China. China Photos/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images\n\nLooking out from the fortified wall in Xi'an, there's a striking contrast. In the foreground stands a watchtower, cannon and red Chinese lantern; in the distance a modern apartment building looms.\n\nThe earlier wall was rebuilt in 1378 by Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang. It's one of the best-preserved fortified city walls in the world, standing 12 meters high, 12 to 18 meters thick and 14 kilometers long.\n\nWalking along the top is a good way to gain a city perspective, though tourists will more often be seen on bicycles -- there's plenty of room here, the breadth of the wall having been designed to facilitate troop movements.\n\n6. Obidos, Portugal\n\nObidos is occasionally called the Town of Queens -- kings used to offer the town up to their wives as a marriage gift. Courtesy Paul Dunleavy/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nRinged by medieval walls, the hill-top town of Obidos with its Moorish castle was recaptured by the first king of Portugal, D. Afonso Henriques, in 1148 and from then until 1883 it became the property of the queens of Portugal.\n\nVisitors who truly want to relive the medieval should visit in July for the Mercado Medieval -- for two weeks the castle hosts a medieval market complete with heraldic flags, jugglers, minstrels and spit-roast feasting.\n\nYou can even drink from a pewter tankard to get into the spirit of things.\n\n7. Quebec City, Canada\n\nQuebec City's ramparts are the only remaining city walls in North America north of Mexico. DAVID BOILY/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOK -- this one isn't technically medieval. But it's still old, and walking along the ramparts of the city's 4.6 kilometers of walls and through the gates in old Quebec is an historic experience, this being one of the few cities in North America to have preserved its fortified line of defense.\n\nWe're lucky this World Heritage feature survived at all, for in the 19th century people tore down gates and parts of the wall. But a new Governor-General, Lord Dufferin, turned public opinion and saved the fortifications for posterity.\n\nThe new St Louis Gate, rebuilt in 1878, is a testament to his efforts and provides a sense of old world charm -- horse and carriage often pass through it on a beautiful clear morning.\n\n8. Taroudant, Morocco\n\nTaroudant is the quintessential Moroccan market town. Camping Aourir/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nFrom 1509 Taroudant was the capital city of the Saadi dynasty of Morocco, until they moved on to Marrakech. Mohammed ash-Sheikh constructed the city walls and built the great mosque and its minaret in 1528.\n\nThe red earth walls encircle virtually the whole town and are six kilometers long, with bastions and gates.\n\nSituated in the Sous valley in the south of the country, Taroudant's Arab souk sells a variety of crafts including pottery, copper work, carpets and jewelry.\n\n9. Mystras, Greece\n\nThe Byzantine archeological site of Mystras -- the city was abandoned in 1832. Sean Gallup/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nNot every walled city is still inhabited. On Mount Taygetos near Sparta in the Peloponnese lies the archaeological treasure that is the abandoned city of Mystras, where the last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI Palaiologos, was crowned in 1449.\n\nMystras was founded in 1249 by a Frankish crusader, William II of Villehardouin, but it soon came under Byzantine control and later fell to the Turks in 1460. Eventually, the inhabitants of Mystras gave up and moved away.\n\nAmong several religious sites at Mystras, the church of Our Lady Peribleptos is decorated with rare frescoes which are perfect examples of Byzantine art dating from the 14th century.\n\n10. Avila, Spain\n\nThe fairy-tale city of Avila. JAVIER SORIANO/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhen ruled by Arabs, the city of Avila suffered repeated attacks by Iberian Christian kingdoms until it lay abandoned. It was repopulated under the rule of the Christian Raymond of Burgundy in the 11th century and he began building the defensive walls.\n\nWith 88 semi-circular towers punctuating its 2.5-kilometer perimeter, the wall makes for an impressive sight. One of its six gates leads straight up to the Gothic cathedral which is a virtual fortress fixed to the wall.\n\nThe city was the birthplace of Saint Teresa of Avila, a prominent Carmelite nun and mystic. Also prior to the 18th century there were more than 100 mansions in the city, which is why its full name is Avila de los Caballeros, or Avila of the Noblemen.
(CNN) —\n\nWhat's the first thing you noticed about this picture of political spouses and partners, other than Melania Trump's continued mastery of the color black?\n\nIt's probably the man in the back row, standing out against the nine women pictured. That's Gauthier Destenay, the First Gentleman of Luxembourg and the husband of the world's only acting openly gay prime minister.\n\nDestenay and Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel wed in 2015, right after Luxembourg legalized gay marriage. When Bettel won the Prime Ministership in 2013, he was already in a civil partnership with Destenay and their sexualities were not a secret.\n\nTo be clear, Bettel isn't the only gay prime minister ever, just the only one in office right now. Former Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo and former Icelandic Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurõardóttir were both public about their sexualities.\n\nCan you name the rest of the people in this photograph?

London (CNN) Same-sex marriage is now legal in Northern Ireland, bringing the province in line with the rest of the United Kingdom, where it has been legal since 2014.\n\nFollowing the Westminster vote, Stormont held five votes before a slim majority returned a vote in favor of legalization in 2015.\n\nHowever, this was immediately contested by the Democratic Unionist Party, which tabled a petition of concern -- a mechanism that can be used by lawmakers in Stormont to flag up motions before the assembly that could fall across sectarian lines, and so must have both cross-party and cross-community support.\n\nBecause of Northern Ireland's unique status and history, Stormont operates on a power-sharing agreement, requiring parties representing both republicans and unionists communities to govern together.

(GREG BAKER/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe night they fled, Reem and Rawan didn't dare sleep.\n\nIt was September 6, 2018. The two Saudi sisters were on a family vacation in Colombo, Sri Lanka. For weeks, they had helped their mother organize the trip, feigning excitement at the possibility of two weeks away from Riyadh, but knowing that if all went to plan, they'd never go back.\n\nFailure was not an option. Every step of their escape from Saudi Arabia carried the threat of severe punishment or death.\n\nWe knew the first time, if it's not perfect, it will be the last time, Reem says.\n\nCNN has changed the sisters' names and is not showing their faces, at their request for their safety.\n\nThe sisters say years of strict Islamic teaching and physical abuse at home had convinced them that they had no future in a society that places women under the enforced guardianship of men, and limits their aspirations.\n\nIt's slavery, because whatever the woman will do it's the business of the male, Rawan says.\n\nThat's why they say they renounced Islam.\n\nAnd that's why aged 18 and 20, they stole back their own passports, hid their abayas under the bedcovers, snuck out of their holiday home and boarded a flight from Colombo to Melbourne, via Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong stopover was supposed to take less than two hours.\n\nTwo hours has turned into five months.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN This photo was taken in a restroom in an airport during a trip to Turkey. The sisters wore this type of niqab when they were traveling outside Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhy they fled\n\nGood girls do what they're told, are quiet, don't argue or risk embarrassing their families. Reem and Rawan say they had turned being good girls into a fine art.\n\nIn our house, we (were) always the good girls they wanted us to be. So, if they want us to clean, we will clean. If they want us to cook, then we will cook, 18-year-old Rawan says.\n\nThe last two years it was really bad, because I just forget who I am, I am just pretending (to be) like an Islamic girl, says her 20-year-old sister, Reem.\n\nThey went to school, studied hard and avoided confrontation. Of course, the same rules didn't apply to their brothers. Beat your sisters, the siblings say their brothers were told, it'll make you better men.\n\nReem and Rawan are reluctant to talk about the abuse at the hands of their family. They say it didn't happen all the time, just enough to remind them of the rules. And enough to fill them with terror about what might happen if anyone found out about their plan or, worse still, caught them carrying it out.\n\nThe escape\n\nLeaving Saudi Arabia is not a simple undertaking for women who rebel against the system. Permission is needed from a male guardian for many basic activities, including international travel.\n\nReem and Rawan say they had been planning their escape in secret for two years. They didn't dare discuss it in case they were overheard, so, instead, they swapped WhatsApp messages, even while alone at night in their shared room.\n\nBefore they fled, the Sri Lanka vacation was just like any other. They wore their niqabs to the beach and sat away from the surf while their brothers swam and joked. They cooked the meals and spent most of their days inside. It was humid. Their niqabs stuck to their skin and made it hard to see.\n\nWe travel to move from a box to another box. From home to hotel, nothing will change, Rawan says. They will go out, they will live freely, the men, of course, we will sit away, watching them doing what they want.\n\nTheir five-year-old sister played in the sand, but their 12-year-old sister, like them, didn't. She too was learning that it's OK to be a girl in Saudi Arabia – until you grow up.\n\nDuring the trip, Rawan turned 18. The timing was no accident. The vacation was planned with gentle persuasion to coincide with a birthday that, unbeknown to their mother, allowed Rawan to apply for an Australian tourist visa.\n\nOn the last night of the trip, the sisters launched into action. Reem pre-booked the taxi. It was Rawan's job to retrieve their passports from a bag stored in their parents' bedroom. Around 2 a.m., she tiptoed past them as they slept, took the bag with their passports, then snuck back in again to return the bag so as not to raise suspicion.\n\nIt's a really great memory, exciting, Rawan tells CNN, smiling. Of the two sisters, she's the more talkative, taking the lead and occasionally looking to her sister for advice on the right word in English. Reem is more reserved. She's careful about what she says and who to trust. They both have dark, short, curly hair and being small in stature seem much younger than their years.\n\nWhen the cab driver arrived at 5 a.m., the sisters say they did something they'd never done before. They pulled on jeans they'd bought in secret and walked out of the house without their abayas.\n\nIt was only after they arrived at Colombo Airport that the sisters booked the flight they'd meticulously researched online: SriLankan Airlines flight UL892 departing Colombo at 9 a.m., arriving Hong Kong at 5:10 p.m. local time. From there, they'd take Cathay Pacific flight CX135 departing at 7:10 p.m. for Melbourne, Australia.\n\nThey had no trouble boarding the plane for the roughly six-hour flight to Hong Kong.\n\nIt was after they arrived at Hong Kong International Airport that things started to go wrong.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The younger sister takes a selfie in a hotel room. They say they felt like ghosts under the full-length black robe, as if they were invisible, not there.\n\nArriving in Hong Kong\n\nWhat happened in the transit area was something the sisters might have anticipated had they known their uncle had connections to the Saudi Interior Ministry or had realized the power Saudi officials could have over local airport staff.\n\nAs soon as the women stepped off the plane, they say two men approached them and asked if they were going to Melbourne. The women say the men asked for their passports and boarding passes, first saying they might miss their flight, then suggesting there was something wrong with their Australian visas.\n\nIn a letter to the sisters' lawyer obtained by CNN, SriLankan Airlines has identified the men as Naeem Khan, SriLankan Airlines station manager, and Noman Shah, a staff member for ground handling agent, Jardine Aviation Services.\n\nThe sisters say the men led them to another area of the airport, where their lawyer Michael Vidler says they canceled the women's Cathay Pacific flight to Melbourne and booked them, without their knowledge, on an Emirates flight to Riyadh, via Dubai.\n\nCathay Pacific tells CNN that the sisters' flight was canceled by representatives of SriLankan Airlines.\n\nSriLankan Airlines told CNN its staff members canceled the flight at the explicit request of the Saudi Consulate, which had already booked the sisters on the flight to Riyadh.\n\nThe airline said consular officials told its staff the women's father had phoned and said the sisters needed to go back to Saudi Arabia as soon as possible as their mother was terminally ill.\n\nThe women knew their mother wasn't ill and were quite sure there was nothing wrong with their visas.\n\nWe allege that they were the subject of an attempted kidnapping in an international airport in a restricted area, Vidler tells CNN. The Saudi Consulate was actively trying to deceive them.\n\nCNN has approached the Saudi Consulate in Hong Kong and the Saudi Foreign Ministry for comment on the sisters' claims and has not received a response. Hong Kong Police have confirmed that they're investigating the allegations.\n\nSriLankan Airlines says at no time did the sisters indicate there was a problem. The women disagree.\n\nVidler says that closed-circuit television seen by his team appears to confirm that Saudi Consul General Omar Al Bunayan was at the airport, speaking to the women and airline staff.\n\nThe presence of senior Saudi officials at the airport filled the women with dread. They'd heard about Dina Ali Lasloom, the 24-year-old Saudi woman who was forced onto a plane to Riyadh at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila in April 2017. Her hands, feet and mouth had been bound with duct tape, one witness told Human Rights Watch.\n\nReem and Rawan feared the same could happen to them.\n\nThey excused themselves to go to the bathroom where they made the decision to flee. As they emerged, they said they saw one of their passports on the table. Rawan tried to grab it.\n\nThe teenager says one of the men immediately slapped her hand, prompting the sisters to scream in Arabic, You kidnap us!\n\nThe sisters say they caused such a scene that the Consul General suggested they move to a quieter area where he presented them with their passports and new boarding passes – for Dubai.\n\nThey ran. First to the Cathay desk where counter staff told them their flights had been canceled. Then to the Qantas desk, where they'd hurriedly booked the next flight to Melbourne, QF30, departing at 7:00 p.m.\n\nSoon after they were issued boarding passes, the women say Shah, the ground handling staff member, tried to snatch them.\n\nJardine Aviation Services, whose staff members carry out a number of tasks within the airport, says its employees didn't tell the women their mother was ill or that was there was an issue with their Australia visas. It denies its staff members slapped Hawan's hand or tried to grab the sisters' boarding passes.\n\nHong Kong's Airport Authority has refused to give CNN a closed-circuit recording of the events that unfolded due to privacy concerns.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The women shared selfies they'd taken of their life before they fled. They wore niqabs in public from the age of 11 and at home were told to wear long gowns, so as not to tempt their brothers.\n\nFor the second time in two hours, the sisters say senior Saudi officials stopped them from flying. The sisters say Saudi Vice Consul Al Sharif told staff at the Qantas check-in desk they were running away, had stolen money, and weren't tourists.\n\nAustralian immigration officials were summoned on the phone and after a conversation with the women, Canberra canceled their visas.\n\nThe only issues with the visa occurred when the Vice Consul made what we believe to be false representations to the Australian authorities at the boarding gate of Qantas airlines, Vidler says.\n\nA spokesperson from Australia's Home Affairs department declined to comment on individual cases. Qantas also declined to comment but a spokesman pointed out that the airline does not make visa assessments.\n\nThe sisters say they stayed at the airport for three hours before asking Cathay Pacific counter staff for permission to leave. They wrote their names and a fake Hong Kong contact address then caught a train to the city.\n\nKhashoggi case puts Saudi Arabia under scrutiny\n\nReem and Rawan escaped Saudi Arabia weeks before the world's attention turned to the kingdom and the disappearance of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. They watched from Hong Kong as gruesome details emerged of Khashoggi's murder inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, allegedly by a team of hitmen who cut up his body with a bone saw.\n\nIn November, a source told CNN that the CIA had determined that Khashoggi was killed on the instruction of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, known as MBS, a claim the kingdom denies.\n\nThe Saudi sisters shrug when asked if they are surprised by Khashoggi's murder and the allegation that their country's de facto leader ordered it.\n\nWe know that Saudi Arabia can do stuff like this, Reem says. They are chasing innocent girls, not even important girls, Rawan agrees. We're just normal young women trying to find a life far away from violence.\n\nSoon after the women arrived in Hong Kong, their father and uncle came to the city to find them. Hong Kong police confirmed to CNN that a missing persons report had been filed.\n\nUsing a passport tracking system linked to hotel check-ins, Hong Kong police officers located the sisters on Monday, September 10 and took them into custody for questioning.\n\nThe women say they were held in a room in the imposing Wan Chai police headquarters for six hours, where they repeatedly refused requests from their father and their uncle to see them.\n\nPolice eventually drove them back to their hotel. By that time, it was after midnight and the women hurriedly packed their bags and fled.\n\nIn the five months since, they've moved from shelter to shelter, hotel to hotel, to evade detection and their potential forced return to Riyadh.\n\nThe sisters have not sought asylum in Hong Kong, however. Doing so would have put them at the end of a long queue of claimants caught in Hong Kong's Unified Screening Mechanism (USM), a system used by the government to process asylum claims. The UNHCR doesn't assess claims in Hong Kong.\n\nThrough their lawyer, Reem and Rawan are seeking a visa in a safe country. Vidler says they have few options. Their Saudi passports have been canceled and they don't have formal permission to stay in Hong Kong.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The sisters say being forced to wear the niqab robbed them of their identities. They knew they'd be expected to wear one for the rest of their lives, like their mother.\n\nLife in Saudi Arabia\n\nAt home in Riyadh, the sisters say they were beaten by their father and brothers for a reason and no reason.\n\nOne day when she was 14, Reem says her brother started hitting her for talking and laughing with Rawan. He said that people will hear my voice and it will bring shame, she says.\n\nThe sisters knew it was likely there would be an arranged marriage. There was talk of Rawan marrying her younger cousin, a boy still in high school.\n\nReem was the first to renounce Islam in October 2016, followed by Rawan in May 2017. They didn't dare tell anyone but say they announced it under fake names on Twitter.\n\nI knew If I told my family they will hurt me and I'll be killed. Because that what we studied in schools, that whoever left Islam should be killed. I knew no one will protect me because all my family are so religious and none of them will support me. I was afraid of them finding out, Reem says.\n\nThere are no firm figures on how many Saudi women have escaped the country – or how many have failed in their attempt to leave – but the total number of Saudi asylum seekers is rising.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, 575 Saudi nationals applied for asylum in 2015. Two years later, that figure had more than doubled to over 1,200.\n\nThe period coincides with the rising influence of MBS who in June 2017 was appointed heir to the Saudi throne by his father King Salman.\n\nSince then, MBS has made it clear that dissent won't be tolerated, even as the kingdom has earned international plaudits for new female-focused policies, including lifting the ban on women drivers.\n\nRana Ahmad, a 33-year-old Saudi national who runs the Atheist Refugee Relief agency in Germany, says the jailing and torture of the same women who campaigned for the right to drive had sent a message to some Saudi women that they have no future in the country.\n\nThey look at these women, they're trying to do something and the government puts them in jail. So they see no hope anymore, they want to leave, she said.\n\nAdam Coogle, a Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW), says women whose escape plans are thwarted are at serious risk of abuse.\n\nPunishments range from being locked in their room for months on end or banned from using a mobile phone, to criminal prosecution by the state for disobeying their parents or harming the kingdom's reputation. The women themselves say they fear they'll be killed by their own families.\n\nCoogle says there are few safe corridors for women to leave, because of political pressure the Saudi government applies to some foreign countries to return runaways without giving them the opportunity to claim asylum or put their case forward.\n\nAnywhere you go that doesn't have some sort of respect for refugee law or a strong record of rule of law is a problem because they're the countries where Saudi Arabia can apply its diplomatic pressure to get countries to cooperate, he says.\n\nFew regrets\n\nReem and Rawan say they could see signs of change in Saudi Arabia, but it wasn't moving fast enough for them. They laugh at the suggestion that progress was made by giving Saudi women the right to drive.\n\nDriving cars is not something to celebrate, Reem says. There is a woman abused in the house, and no one hears their voice, and they want us to celebrate a car? Rawan adds.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the sisters watch Netflix to pass the time. Wearing jeans and trainers, they could easily be mistaken for one of the millions of tourists that come through the city each year.\n\nSometimes Reem wears lipstick. She seems relaxed but has a habit of picking at the skin on her fingers when she's nervous. Sometimes, she does it so much that they start to bleed.\n\nThe sisters are anxious about what comes next. But even after five months of uncertainty and fear, they have few regrets.\n\nI regret not waiting, but not leaving, Reem says. From my childhood, I knew this is not my home. I always knew my rights would be taken.\n\nRawan says she too knew there was no life for her in Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhen I was growing up I saw my brothers do whatever they want, have whatever they want. But for me, I should be a good girl, a good woman, to marry someone, my cousin, because I should not even dream to choose my husband, to choose my partner.\n\nI want to study what I want, I want to work what I want, I want to choose the day I marry. To choose the man I marry. Even if I don't want to marry, I want the right to choose.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated with new information from human rights lawyer Michael Vidler who said he originally misspoke about which Saudi consulate official was at the Hong Kong airport speaking to the Saudi sisters and airline staff.

(CNN) Nikki Buskirk was watching vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff wave to supporters at an Election Night celebration in November when the future second gentleman did something that made Buskirk glow with admiration.\n\nThe couple had just taken the stage in downtown Wilmington, Delaware, when red, white, and blue fireworks suddenly exploded in the evening sky. Buskirk says she watched as Emhoff instinctively stepped toward Harris to protect her.\n\nThat gesture touched Buskirk because her marriage had set off some fireworks of its own. She's a proud Black woman and Black Lives Matter activist who had violated an unwritten rule in the Black community -- thou shalt not date or marry White men.\n\nThe Ohio woman had been told all her life she was supposed to marry a strong Black man and build a strong Black family. But then she met Tyler Buskirk, a self-assured White man who shared her love of The Phantom of the Opera and Dungeons & Dragons. Their marriage shocked some members of both of their families, and Buskirk says she's gotten plenty of icy, how-could-you? stares from Black women and men in public.\n\nSeeing Emhoff rush to protect Harris, though, reminded her not of what she's endured but what she's gained -- a man who is ready to defend her, no matter what comes their way.\n\nNikki and Tyler Buskirk of Columbus, Ohio, with their three sons: Sawyer, 10; Oliver, 7; and Silas, 3.\n\nHe's my rock to come home to after fighting the world, my shield when it becomes too much, and my crusader when I can't get through, says Buskirk, 37. The pair live in Columbus, Ohio, where she works in a ministry at a local United Methodist Church.\n\nWhen I see Vice President Harris and her husband, I see us.\n\nWill more Black women begin to see the same potential for romantic love with White men? Harris' next four years in the White House could help provide an answer.\n\nThe power of Harris' example\n\nHarris is the first female, Black and South Asian vice president of the United States, but she could also become another type of pioneer. She could inspire some Black women to reexamine a racial taboo that has shaped many of their private lives.\n\nHarris has so far shared few private details about her marriage to Emhoff, a lawyer . They were set up on a blind date in 2013, when Harris was California's attorney general, and married a year later.\n\nHarris did briefly respond to criticism of her marriage to a White man in a 2019 radio interview\n\nLook, I love my husband, and he happened to be the one that I chose to marry, because I love him -- and that was that moment in time, and that's it, Harris said. And he loves me.\n\nAs President Barack Obama's mere presence in the White House provoked discussions on biracial identity and Black marriage, Harris' marriage could lead more Black women to talk openly about this taboo, one scholar says.\n\nThen-Sen. Kamala Harris and husband Douglas Emhoff wave during the SF Pride Parade on June 30, 2019, in San Francisco.\n\nI think there is potential, but it depends on how public or private she is about her marriage, says Dianne M. Stewart, author of Black Women, Black Love: America's War on African American Marriage.\n\nIf she decides to talk about this aspect of her life and enters conversations about it or allows the broader public to have information about her own journey, it could influence Black women's thinking, says Stewart, an associate professor of religion and African American studies at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\nShe could even change long-held views in the Black community. One White House predecessor might even serve as a role model. Obama helped shift support for same-sex marriage among African Americans when he became the first President to say same-sex couples should be allowed to get married.\n\nWhy some Black women won't marry White men\n\nMany Black women have traditionally shunned White men for a variety of reasons. Some say they can't be with a White man because he wouldn't understand what it's like to experience racism. Others say they owe it to their race to marry Black men and build healthy Black families.\n\nYet other Black women cite more personal reasons for staying away from White men. They say being with a White man evokes memories of how White plantation owners and others sexually abused Black women during slavery and colonization. They're afraid of being treated as hypersexualized caricatures . (Some Asian women are wary of being with White men for some of the same reasons as Black women.)\n\nSerena Williams and her husband Alexis Ohanian arrive for the wedding ceremony of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on May 19, 2018, in Windsor, England.\n\nI haven't completely reached the point where I can confidently order an Oreo ice cream swirl without some White guy telling me it 'looks like us,' but regardless of the number of 'I love the color of your skin' and 'cream to your coffee' messages that flood my DMs, determining whether a man is fetishizing me or not is not up to the discretion of White people, Kendall Tiarra wrote in a recent essay titled,  Am I a Fetish or Just the Prettiest Girl in the Room?\n\nSome Black women reduce their reluctance to dating White men to one thought -- it's too much work. For example, they don't want to expend energy teaching White men about racism or dealing with derogatory comments from friends, family and others.\n\nShamontiel L. Vaughn, a writer and editor, says she's open to dating White men, but 90% of the men she has dated are Black. She published an essay last year,  Dating Black women: interracial dating gone right and wrong , in which she explained why so many Black women shun dating White men.\n\nVaughn described what she and other Black women experienced on interracial dates: non-Black men who fetishized their bodies, raised the topic of race when it wasn't necessary, or tried too hard to copy every single element of Black men because they watched too much BET.\n\nWhen Vaughn dates White men, she chooses those who have dated Black women before. She cites one White man she dated who was just cool.\n\nPrince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, have faced intense scrutiny over their marriage.\n\nBy the time he met me, he had dated a bunch of Black women. It wasn't new to him -- like me putting a hair wrap on my head was no big deal, she says. He didn't ask what it was. He didn't ask why I oiled my hair. He had already been broken in.\n\nNikki Buskirk is familiar with many of these arguments. She once believed some of them. She says some in her family raised her with the expectation that she would marry a Black man because such unions helped build strong Black families and strengthened their race.\n\nSome of them objected to her dating Tyler and thought she was going through a phase. She experienced some nagging guilt at the time but overcame it.\n\nThey've now been married for 17 years and have three sons, ages 10, 7 and 3.\n\nHe treats me like a queen, she says. I can't let guilt ruin the love we have and the love we built.\n\nSome argue Black women should 'lower their standards'\n\nReservations about dating or marrying across races may seem like a relic from the past. Interracial marriage has steadily become more common in the US since the Supreme Court ruled in the 1967 Loving v. Virginia decision that laws banning such unions were unconstitutional.\n\nIn 2015, one in 10 married people in the US had a spouse of a different race or ethnicity, according to a Pew Research Center study . Popular culture is filled with images of couples such as Prince Harry and his bride Meghan Markle or tennis star Serena Williams with husband Alexis Ohanian.\n\nBut look closer at the lives of some Black women and the picture looks different. Many Black women seem trapped in a time warp where dating or marrying a White man is still rare. The same Pew report said Black men are twice as likely as Black women to have a spouse of a different race or ethnicity. Some people try to nudge Black women into the interracial dating pool by citing a 2010 census statistic that found an estimated 71% of Black women between the ages of 25 to 29 had never been married.\n\nMildred and Richard Loving answer questions at a press conference the day after the Supreme Court ruled in their favor in the Loving v. Virginia case in June 1967. The ruling held that laws banning interracial marriage were unconstitutional.\n\nYet there are some Black women who don't want to compromise. As Stewart notes in her book, they are inspired by examples such as Michelle Obama's marriage and they want what she seems to have -- a Black man they can respect and love.\n\nThe wait for such a man, though, can be excruciating.\n\nStewart cites a single Black woman who confessed she was emotionally exhausted from living without Black male company.\n\nShe just wanted Black male energy and presence in her life in some way, Stewart wrote. She told me that she could go an entire week, even several weeks, without having a substantive conversation with a Black man who was not her brother.\n\nReinforcing racist assumptions?\n\nIt's easy to cite Harris' marriage as an inspirational model for all people who say color doesn't matter. But color does matter to some.\n\nConsider colorism -- the notion that a person's value and beauty is determined by the lightness of their skin.\n\nHarris is a fair-complexioned woman, Stewart notes. She cites a 2009 study that showed that young Black women who are fair complexioned were twice as likely to have married by age 29 than darker-skinned Black women. Colorism is a complex issue that spills into many areas of Black life, not just interracial marriage.\n\nStill, some darker-skinned Black women could look at Harris' marriage and take a different message about their own self-worth by concluding, that could never be me.\n\nStewart takes this issue head-on in her book. She writes that as more Black women pay attention to women like Harris, more will likely transgress cultural prohibitions and try to date a wider pool of racially and ethnically diverse men.\n\nHarris' marriage could unwittingly reinforce another racist assumption: White men are the best potential marriage partners, while Black men are among the worst.\n\nKamala Harris, flanked by husband Doug Emhoff, is sworn in as the 49th US Vice President on January 20 at the US Capitol in Washington.\n\nThere is a conversation out there in social media now that goes something like this: Black women should just open themselves up to men outside their race, Stewart says. And the default men that a number of these social media influencers have in mind are White men.\n\nThe attention paid to Harris' marriage could also distract people from addressing another huge issue: the precarious state of Black marriage, Stewart says.\n\nStewart contends in her book that White supremacy has waged a systematic assault against Black marriage for 400 years. This attack has taken different forms: slavery, White standards of beauty, and mass incarceration, which removes Black men from the pool of potential partners.\n\nMany Black women are single today not because something is wrong with them, Stewart says. Instead, she says, their status is the result of a web of policies, customs and raw racism that make Black marriage difficult, delayed or impossible.\n\nStewart says she's not opposed to interracial unions. But she's concerned that encouraging Black women to marry non-Black men distracts people from addressing what many see as a crisis of Black marriage and romantic relationships.\n\nI don't want to solve this problem by ignoring it and asking Black women to marry outside their race, she says.\n\nHarris' marriage could inspire change\n\nNikki Buskirk has heard the arguments that White men can't understand what it's like for Black women to experience racism. She reframes the argument: Can any guy understand?\n\nI can say that about any guy, she says. A Black guy might not understand what it means to be a Black woman. Black women are the lowest of the lows when it comes to the hierarchy in America.\n\nBuskirk says she hopes Black women who are leery of dating White men pay attention to how Emhoff treats Harris.\n\nThey could be missing out on something great if they let skin color stop them, she says.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and husband Doug Emhoff attend a televised ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial on January 20, 2021 in Washington.\n\nThis country's history, though, is filled with examples of how people have allowed skin color to blind them to other people's humanity. And interracial relationships can provoke all sorts of strong and conflicting emotions. When some people see a Black and White couple, they don't see two individuals -- they see a projection of their own racial myths, insecurities and fantasies.\n\nBuskirk's reaction to Emhoff's chivalrous Election Night gesture evoked the symbolic power of Barack Obama's presidency, when seemingly throwaway moments -- the President breaking into Amazing Grace at a funeral, Michelle Obama dancing with schoolchildren -- elicited deep affection in Black Americans.\n\nHarris could do the same. Her marriage to Emhoff could inspire Black women to think anew about their dating and marital choices.\n\nThat may depend, though, on whether Harris is willing to talk more about the delicate issues that swirl around her marriage.\n\nAnd whether a nation that is still so divided by race and skin color is ready to listen.

Disney bid for most of 21st Century Fox to beef up its movie and TV business and threaten Netflix as the content king.\n\nComcast is ready to throw a wrench in that plan. It is talking to investment banks about usurping the Disney-Fox deal, three sources with knowledge of the matter told CNN's Dylan Byers. Comcast (CMCSA) would make an offer worth about $60 billion for the same assets Fox agreed to sell to Disney. That's about $8 billion more than Disney offered.\n\nNews of Comcast's anticipated bid was first reported late Monday by Reuters.\n\nRelated: The Disney-Comcast War Gets Hot\n\nThe jockeying between Disney and Comcast for more media assets makes sense. American consumers are cutting their cable subscriptions and spending more time online with services like Netflix (NFLX), so legacy companies are looking for ways to scale their business and build influence.\n\nIt's not the first time Comcast has shown interest in Fox. The company considered a bid for most of Fox's assets late last year, but dropped out in mid-December.\n\nAn added factor: Comcast has also bid for Sky in a challenge to Fox's own attempt to purchase the European broadcaster.\n\nRelated: Comcast offers $31 billion for Sky, setting up showdown with Fox\n\nEach marriage would bring something different to the table.\n\nFor Disney, the deal would be all about expanding its content library. A union would add big-name Fox franchises like the X-Men and Avatar to a lineup that already includes the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Star Wars, giving Disney unprecedented dominance over the domestic box office.\n\nThe company would also add all of Fox's regional sports networks to its arsenal, a move that it hopes would counter sliding viewership on its flagship sports channel, ESPN. Sports still reach live viewers, and local fans watching regional networks are particularly loyal.\n\nThat could give Disney more clout as it wades into streaming, too. Its newly launched ESPN+ service is still adding programming — it just reached a deal for exclusive UFC content Tuesday — and a Disney-branded streaming service is on the way next year.\n\nDisney would also take Fox's share of Hulu, giving the company a majority stake in a streamer with 20 million subscribers.\n\nRelated: Hulu passes 20 million subscribers and announces offline viewing\n\nComcast's angle is a bit different, because, unlike Disney, Comcast is also a distributor, according to BTIG media analyst Rich Greenfield.\n\nBut Comcast's move is also similar. Like Disney, it's about diversification. Greenfield added that the company's US cable business is slowing because of competitors like AT&T's DirecTV Now and Google's (GOOGL) YouTube TV, which offer streaming bundles that are cheaper than a traditional cable package.\n\nFox would add to what Comcast already has on offer within NBCUniversal, which includes channels like Bravo and E!, as well as the Universal Pictures film library.\n\nAnd like Disney, Comcast would gain a foothold in streaming. It also owns a sizable chunk in Hulu, and a deal with Fox would give it a majority stake.\n\nIt could still be some time before Comcast decides whether to jump in. According to Reuters, CEO Brian Roberts will only bid if AT&T (T) wins its case against the Justice Department.\n\nThe trial, which hinges on the US government's opposition to AT&T's purchase of Time Warner (TWX), wrapped up last week. A decision is expected by June 12. (CNN is owned by Time Warner.)\n\nThe prospect of a gatecrash came just before Disney reported quarterly profit that beat Wall Street expectations, driven in part by success at its theme parks and the smash hit Black Panther. The movie has grossed $1.3 billion worldwide.\n\nDisney CEO Bob Iger refused to speculate about the Comcast bid on the call. He told CNBC earlier in the day that Disney is confident in its own bid.\n\n-—CNN's Dylan Byers contributed to this report.
(CNN) —\n\nA certain subset of Oscar nominees already have reason to celebrate.\n\nIt's been a remarkable year for foreign language cinema. Led by Mexican drama Roma, a bumper crop of foreign language films have picked up Oscar nods in feature, documentary, short and craft categories. Not that world cinema needs the validation of Tinseltown, but its cup runneth over.\n\nRoma could become the first foreign language film to win the Oscar for best picture, with director Alfonso Cuarón widely tipped for best director. Poland's Pawel Pawlikowski is also in contention for best director for Cold War.\n\nThree of the five cinematography nominees – Lukasz Zal for Cold War, Caleb Deschanel for German entry Never Look Away and Cuarón for Roma – are non-English titles. Meanwhile, Swedish film Border picked up a nod for best makeup and hairstyling and German-made, Arabic-language Of Fathers and Sons is nominated for documentary feature.\n\nBut back to the race for best foreign language film. To bring you up to speed, here's what you need to know about the nominees, and where to watch them.\n\nCold War (Poland)\n\nPHOTO: Curzon Artificial Eye Joanna Kulig and Tomasz Kot as lovers in Pawel Pawlikowski's Cold War.\n\nCold War arrives at the Oscars having swept the European Film Awards last December with its hopelessly romantic take on two lovers on both sides of the Iron Curtain.\n\nPawel Pawlikowski, competing for his second Oscar after winning with 2014's Ida, drew on his parents' story in creating fractious couple Zula (Joanna Kulig) and Wiktor (Tomasz Kot), a singer and music director who fall hard for each other in 1950s communist Poland. From there to Paris, Berlin and Yugoslavia, its fleet-footed approach captures 15 years of tempestuous love in indelible sequences that rarely pause for breath. All the while music provides an additional emotional barometer, from the evolving refrain of folk song Dwa Serduszka (Two Hearts) to jazz and rock and roll.\n\nThe director and co-writer had said his parents history was too long and messy, and yet what he's made is an elegant 88-minute chasse, locked in motion by two mesmerizing lead performances. Delivered in delicious, inky black and white and presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio, it's classical and classy filmmaking with flair to burn.\n\nWhere to watch: Playing in US theaters; available March 22 on Amazon Prime.\n\nShoplifters (Japan)\n\nPHOTO: Thunderbird Releasing Shoplifters by Hirokazu Kore-eda examines the lives of small-time crooks in Japan.\n\nThe film that gave Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda the Palme d'Or at Cannes, Shoplifters was one of the least contentious winners in recent memory.\n\nCentering on a rag-tag family of petty thieves scraping out an existence in down-and-out Tokyo, the father takes in a young girl Rin (Miyu Sasaki), left out in the cold. Living hand to mouth in squalor despite both husband Osamu (Lily Franky) and wife Nobuyo (Sakura Ando) working full time, they, along with elderly grandma (the late Kirin Kiki), older daughter Aki (Mayu Matsuoka) and younger son Shota (Jyo Kairi) live together under one tottering roof and gently annoy each other. Rin injects new life into the household, but when a five-finger discount goes awry, the family, and the lies it has built itself on, come crashing down around them.\n\nKore-eda's social drama continues career-long themes, that, like British directors Mike Leigh and Ken Loach, levels pointed criticisms at the systems that have failed his characters. All the adults play their parts with a jaded world-weariness that yields to small, joyous moments that scatter the narrative. But it's the quietly devastating Ando that rises above fellow cast members with one of the most moving performances this awards season.\n\nWhere to watch: Available on Amazon Prime, iTunes and Blu-ray/DVD in the US.\n\nNever Look Away (Germany)\n\nPHOTO: Beta Cinema Tom Schilling as artist Kurt in Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's Never Look Away.\n\nDirector Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, already a winner in this category for 2006 Stasi drama The Lives of Others, dives further back into German history with Never Look Away.\n\nInspired by the life of German artist Gerhard Richter (which the artist is none too pleased about), Never Look Away follows painter Kurt (Tom Schilling) from harrowing childhood under the Third Reich to his rise in the 1960s across three hours.\n\nKurt, whose aunt was murdered by the Nazis because of her mental illness, lives in the long shadow of the war. From his start as a sign maker and socialist-realism muralist in East Germany to his struggle for success in the West, the artist represents a generation attempting to spring loose from the guilt and shame that has buried a nation. But try as he might, the darkness claws into every aspect of his personal life.\n\nNever Look Away offers a stark history lesson refracted through its story of romance and artistry. In that sense there's more than a few comparisons to be made with Cold War. But while Pawlikowski opts for dreamlike snapshots, von Donnersmarck lays out his plot with cold calculation for optimal emotional response. An image of resilience and abstraction, painted in traditional brushstrokes.\n\nWhere to watch: Playing in US theaters; pre-order available via Amazon and iTunes.\n\nCapernaum (Lebanon)\n\nPHOTO: courtesy BFI London Film Festival Boluwatife Treasure Bankole (left) and Zain al Rafeea in Nadine Labaki's Capernaum.\n\nLanding at Cannes last year with an attention-grabbing premise, Capernaum, by Lebanese actress-director Nadine Labaki, tells the story of a pre-teen who sues his parents for bringing him into the world.\n\nFirst-timer Zain al Rafeea hold the lens in a way that would make some of his older peers green with envy as we follow him around Beirut, often with toddler Jonas (Boluwatife Treasure Bankole) in tow. The courtroom serves as a framing device for scenes of neglect, child marriage, illegal work and extreme poverty. It's all evidence of the precariousness of the social contract, tonally flitting between satire and moral outrage. But there's humor to be had too with strong interplay between its young leads.\n\nDespite the hardship, at Capernaum's heart is a kernel of hope, held tight by Zain, but which he shares with the viewer. Winner of the Jury Prize at Cannes last May and a host of festival audience awards since, Labaki's fourth film as director has maintained considerable traction.\n\nWhere to watch: Pre-order available on Amazon and iTunes.\n\nRoma (Mexico)\n\nPHOTO: Carlos Somonte/Netflix The cast of Alfonso Cuarón's Neflix film Roma.\n\nCan Cuarón go five for five? Nominated for best picture, foreign language film, direction, cinematography and original screenplay, Roma has already taken the Golden Globe and BAFTA in this particular category.\n\nThe Mexican director has reimagined his own childhood, telling it from the perspective of his nanny – Libo in real life, Cleo in the film – played by best actress nominee Yalitza Aparicio. Set in Mexico City in the early 1970s, the family Cleo cares for is falling apart while she has her own fledgling romance to negotiate. All the while wider social upheaval threatens to bring chaos to everyone's doorstep.\n\nA study of class, family and politics, Cuarón's excoriating look at his own upbringing and the nation that catalysed it manages to be both understated and grandiose; naturalistic and finely orchestrated. Overall, Roma demonstrates a maestro at the top of his game. It has beguiled audiences ever since it won the Golden Lion at Venice last September. Don't expect the accolades to stop with Oscars night.\n\nWhere to watch: Available on Netflix.
Japan's Princess Mako and her commoner fiancé Kei Komuro have postponed their highly anticipated engagement and wedding until at least 2020, saying they were not yet ready for marriage.
Time to think about family planning. You, your body, and ... your employer?\n\nFacebook made headlines when it first began comping employees for freezing their eggs, but now more companies are taking an active role in helping their workers plan and research their fertility.\n\nEmployers like Google and Apple offer full financial assistance for egg freezing. Spotify funds unlimited in-vitro fertilization. Patagonia offers childcare and family support services, opening the door for companies to take an active role in their employees' children's lives — from the (literal) very beginnings all the way through Pre-K and beyond.\n\nFor younger employees, the issue is only going to become more important. In one survey from Carrot, 62% of Millennial women said they would choose a job that offered a fertility benefit over a job that did not, all else being equal.\n\nRelated: What it's like to freeze your eggs — and have your company pay for it\n\nNew data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that fertility dropped for women in multiple age groups in 2017. More Millennial women are postponing marriage, but according to research from Demographic Intelligence, their desire for a family still increases — even as their ability to produce a child declines.\n\nIn the course of a single year, the fertility landscape can change dramatically, says Tammy Sun, co-founder and CEO of Carrot. When she froze her own eggs, she says most thought of the fertility space as egg freezing and IVF only. Now, Carrot connects companies to coverage for embryo preservation, sperm freezing, adoption, surrogacy, and other fertility services.\n\nI think what companies have come to really realize through the voice of their own employees is that this is a really important area of life that is deeper and more varied than people stereotypically thought, Sun says.\n\nBecause fertility costs can exceed thousands of dollars, companies previously asked employees to provide proof of necessity, says Jake Anderson, co-founder of Fertility IQ, a company helping employees connect with care providers.\n\nWhat's been traditionally done is most companies say, 'You have to prove to us you're infertile. You have to prove to us that you've been trying heterosexual intercourse and it hasn't worked, and then you have to go through a handful of low-level treatments that are unlikely to work and that are going to cost time before we give you access to IVF,' he says. The more broad-minded new approach is, 'We don't care if you're gay, straight, heterosexual, partnered — it's really none of our business. If you're going to go to a fertility clinic to build your family, we're going to cover it.'\n\nRelated: How to research company culture -- before you take the job\n\nNow, with an eye to retaining female talent, some companies have lifted all price caps entirely. When Pinterest first began reimbursing egg freezing in total last year, employees even sent letters of gratitude, says Kurt Serrano, senior vice president of people at Pinterest. One woman told him she would reconfirm her commitment with Pinterest long-term because we're in the game, Serrano says.\n\nIn addition to helping employees cover the cost of egg freezing, adoption and more, Pinterest also recently helped a gay male employee and his husband to explore how they could start a family.\n\nWe made a decision to actually research surrogacy benefits with a $20,000 net benefit that directly enabled this employee and his husband to start a family, Serrano says. They've gone through that process now ... and they're expecting their first child.\n\nThe benefit is about allowing employees to bring their authentic selves to work — including their identity as parents, Serrano says. And in the future, he predicts, more companies may follow suit.\n\nAs Sun puts it, it's a life cycle.
Hong Kong (CNN) The number of newborns registered with the government in China dropped almost 15% last year, amid widespread concern over falling birthrates in the world's most populous country .\n\nAccording to figures published by the Ministry of Public Security this week, there were 10.03 million new babies registered in 2020, compared to 11.79 million the year before -- a decrease of 14.9%. The news comes as last year, China recorded the lowest birthrate since the People's Republic was founded in 1949\n\nChina's demographic issues could pose serious issues for the world's second-largest economy when the current working-age population reaches retirement. Experts worry if the trend continues, or the population begins shrinking, China may get old before it gets rich.\n\nAccording to the most recent data from the National Bureau of Statistics, there were 250 million people over 60 years old in China last year, around 18% of the population.\n\nThe impact of Covid has probably exaggerated it, and in coming years the drops probably won't be so bad, but that downward structural trend is likely to continue, he said. The number of new babies born is never going to be that high in future, because the number of childbearing women is declining, and will be declining rapidly (in years to come).\n\nWhile China's demographic shift is still nothing compared to some of its hyper-aged neighbors -- such as Japan and South Korea , both of whose populations are now shrinking -- it still poses potential problems in future, particularly as the one child generation ages.\n\nIn force from 1979 to 2015 , the one child policy limited most couples in China to a single baby, as part of an attempt at controlling a rapidly growing population while the country was still developing. Draconian enforcement of the rule saw couples hit with heavy fines or penalties, while millions women were forced to have abortions if they were found to be carrying a second child.\n\nAs a result of the policy, China's fertility rate fell dramatically , from a peak of almost six births per woman between 1960 and 1965 to 1.5 between 1995 and 2014. At the same time, the number of people over the age of 65 increased from 3.36% in 1965 to almost 10% in 2015, when the one child policy was switched to allowing two children. In 2019, people over the age of 65 accounted for 12.6% of the total population\n\nSince 2016, couples have been allowed to have two children, but it appears to have been too late to turn around the decline, with parents settling into the trend common in most developed countries of having fewer children. The next national census, counting of which began in November , is expected to show a decline for the first time in decades, and could mean India overtakes China as the most populous country.\n\nBy 2050, a third of the population, around 480 million people, are expected to be over 60, with many younger workers from one-child families supporting their parents and two sets of grandparents, in a country where social services for the elderly are still lacking. Uncertainty over the official figures put out by the government could also mean the situation is worse than it currently appears.\n\nChina's leaders are very aware of the potential toll an aging population could take, hamstringing the country's economy just as it is on the verge of becoming the world's largest, and have been attempting to encourage people to have children -- after decades of punishing those who did.\n\nIt's not just marrying someone, it's to marry the in-laws, take care of children -- there are a lot of responsibilities that come with marriage. Wei-Jun Jean Yeung, a sociologist\n\nIn 2018, the People's Daily, official mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, ran a full page editorial saying Giving birth is a family matter and a national issue too, which warned that the impact of low birth rates on the economy and society has begun to show.\n\nWomen, who bore the brunt of the one child policy, are also coming under fire in the new push to have more children. After decades of encouraging women to join the workforce, pressure to marry and give birth is increasing, even as many millennial women are turning away from the idea of matrimony altogether\n\nBetween 2013 and 2019, the number of people getting married for the first time in China fell by 41%, from 23.8 million to 13.9 million. While the decline is driven in part by demographics -- the one-child policy means there are simply less people to marry -- there has also been a shift in attitudes towards marriage, especially among young women, some of whom are growing disillusioned with the institution for its role in entrenching gender inequality, experts say.\n\nWith increased education, women gained economic independence, so marriage is no longer a necessity for women as it was in the past, Wei-Jun Jean Yeung, a sociologist at the National University of Singapore who has studied marriage and family across Asian societies, told CNN last year. Women now want to pursue self-development and a career for themselves before they get married.\n\nBut gender norms and patriarchal traditions have not caught up with these changes. In China, many men and parents-in-law still expect women to carry out most of the childcare and housework after marriage, even if they have full-time jobs.\n\nJust putting a poster up to say having two children is a great thing is not enough, it's nowhere near enough, said Gietel-Basten, the HKUST demographer, pointing to the economic hit that women still suffer as a result of having children. There's just not the social policy support to offset that negative impact.\n\nAs the trend has become apparent , along with falling birth rates, China's government has increased pressure on young people, especially young women, to marry and settle down. In 2007, the state-backed All-China Women's Federation coined leftover women to describe those unmarried over 27, a term which has since been adopted by the Ministry of Education and is widely used in state media to shame women who marry late or avoid matrimony altogether.\n\nThe government has also made it more difficult to end existing marriages, with China's national legislature last year introducing a 30-day cooling-off period for people filing for divorce. This was met with widespread criticism, particularly amid growing outcry over domestic violence in China.\n\nGietel-Basten said pressuring a shrinking population of women to have more children was unlikely to have much effect, however, especially as childlessness, currently rare in China, can be expected to increase to levels seen elsewhere in the region. Instead, the government should be preparing, as some of its neighbors have started doing, for an aging society, to offset potential repercussions.\n\nYes the population is aging, and in the future the population will decline, what you need to do is say how can we make the most of the people we have, he added. You can do that through increasing productivity, through changes in education, reforms to the pension system, the healthcare system, by investing now to mitigate against bigger issues in the future.
There is nothing cliche about their story, which began when a 15-year-old Macron took part in a school play directed by Trogneux, 24 years his senior.\n\nTrogneux went from being Macron's teacher to his partner, and eventually his wife. But through each phase, she has been his mentor and inspiration.\n\nWithout her, I wouldn't be me, Macron, 39, declared after winning the first round of voting in April.\n\nMacron kisses his wife after winning the first round in April.\n\nTrogneux -- now 64 with seven grandchildren -- will become France's next first lady. Unlike in the United States, the spouses of French leaders have traditionally held more negligible roles in public affairs.\n\nBut there is nothing traditional about Trogneux, nor her presidential muse. Macron has said that if he is elected, he will likely give his wife an official role in his administration.\n\n'Love took everything in its path'\n\nTrogneux was born to a bourgeoisie family of chocolatiers, the youngest of six children. Like Macron, her hometown is Amiens in northern France.\n\nBefore she met Macron, she was on the path to living a relatively conventional life. She had a stable career teaching French literature, Latin and drama, and married a banker, Andre Louis Auziere, with whom she had three children.\n\nLove took everything in its path and led me to divorce. It was impossible to resist him, Trogneux told Paris Match magazine in 2016.\n\nShe divorced Auziere in 2006 and married Macron a year later, moving to Paris to work as a teacher.\n\nBefore she met Macron, Trogneux was on the path to a relatively conventional life.\n\nIn 2015 she gave up her career to focus on her husband, who was at the time the country's economy minister.\n\nIn a documentary by France3 TV , Trogneux is depicted as Macron's coach. In one scene, she guides him through a practice run of a speech, cutting in to tell him to lift his voice.\n\nEvery night we debrief together and we repeat what we have heard about each other, she told Paris Match.\n\nI have to pay attention to everything, do the maximum to protect him.\n\nHer adult children, Sebastien, Laurence and Tiphaine, are reported to have a good relationship with their stepfather and have been seen campaigning for Macron in T-shirts bearing En Marche!, the name of Macron's party.\n\nTrogneux (C) with her daughters Tiphaine Auziere (R) and Laurence Auziere-Jourdan at a campaign meeting in Paris.\n\nIn fact, Macron made sure to get the blessing of Trogneux's children before proposing.\n\nIt was a powerful act because not everyone would have taken that precaution, to come and ask us for her hand in marriage. I mean, it wasn't quite like that, but he did want to know if this was something we could accept, Tiphaine Auziere told BFMTV.\n\nCelebrating an atypical family\n\nIt's not clear when a serious romance began between the two, but Macron appeared to be a young man who knew what he wanted -- at 17, he professed his love for Trogneux.\n\nWhatever you do, I will marry you, he told her as he left Amiens to study elsewhere.\n\nBut Macron's parents didn't approve of their son's romance with Trogneux. His father told Trogneux to back off until his son was at least 18, Reuters reported , citing the book Emmanuel Macron: A perfect young man, by Anne Fulda.\n\nNobody will ever know at what moment our story became a love story. That belongs to us. That is our secret, Trogneux was quoted as saying.\n\nPhilippe Besson, a friend of the couple, acknowledged that not everyone was so accepting of their relationship.\n\nJUST WATCHED How Emmanuel Macron won the French presidency Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How Emmanuel Macron won the French presidency 01:50\n\nThey both had to face hostile looks, even the reluctance of their respective families and also the view of our society about the age difference, Besson told BFMTV.\n\nEspecially when the woman is older, (people are) always suspicious.\n\nTo put things in perspective, US President Donald Trump is 24 years older than Melania Trump, but few people are making a fuss about their age gap.\n\nMacron and Trogneux have been determined to ensure that their relationship is not painted as some sort of scandal.\n\nThey have made a point of making their relationship public, posing in glossy French magazines and describing their marriage as a celebration of an atypical but loving modern family.\n\nWe do not have a classic family, it's undeniable, Macron said at a recent En Marche! event.\n\nBut do we have less love in this family? I do not think so. Maybe there's even more than conventional families.

(CNN) An Idaho mother failed to produce her missing children to authorities by a court-imposed deadline Thursday, according to one of the children's grandmother .\n\nJoshua JJ Vallow, 7, and his sister, Tylee Ryan, 17, have not been seen or heard from since September. Their mother, Lori Vallow, and her husband Chad Daybell fled their home in Rexburg, Idaho, in November when authorities began searching f or the missing children.\n\nThey were found in Hawaii this month. The children were not with them. Vallow had until Thursday to turn them over to authorities, according to a court order served by police on Saturday.\n\nI'd love to know where those kids are, JJ's grandmother, Kay Woodcock told CNN affiliate KIFI. I think all of America wants to know where they are.\n\nVallow and Daybell have not been charged and no arrest warrants have been issued for them in Hawaii.\n\nIt's unclear what happens now.\n\nThe Kaua'I Police Department in Hawaii told CNN Thursday they are assisting the Rexburg Police. In email, Niki Forbing-Orr, a spokeswoman for Idaho Department of Health & Welfare, referred questions to Rexburg police.\n\nChild protection cases in Idaho are confidential, and authorities can't discuss the specifics of case, she said in an email.\n\nThe Madison County Office of the Prosecuting Attorney declined to comment further citing the sealed, confidential court files.\n\nRexburg police couldn't be reached Thursday.\n\nKay and Larry Woodcock are offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of their grandson, Joshua JJ Vallow, and his sister, Tylee Ryan.\n\nAs the court deadline approached, JJ's grandparents pleaded for his safe return.\n\nI'll get on my knees and beg, Larry Woodcock said Wednesday . Just give me JJ.\n\nThe couple said they were not optimistic Vallow will appear.\n\nShe's got all the attention on her -- good, bad or indifferent -- and it's going to be bad if she doesn't show up, Kay Woodcock said Wednesday.\n\nBut whether she cooperates or not, the family will continue fighting, Larry Woodcock said.\n\nWe're in this for the long haul. This is not going to end tomorrow. I'm not going to let it end. Kay is not going to let it end. Our family is not going to let this end, he said.\n\nCouple flees the home\n\nPolice determined the children were missing in late November -- four months after Vallow's estranged husband was killed in their former home state, Arizona, and shortly after she moved with the children to Idaho and married Daybell.\n\nPolice conducted a welfare check for JJ -- Vallow's adopted son with her late husband -- on November 26 at their home in Rexburg after relatives raised concern about not hearing from him since September.\n\nDuring the welfare check, both Vallow and Daybell told investigators the boy was staying with a family friend in Arizona, police said.\n\nBut police determined that he wasn't staying with a family friend. When police returned November 27 to execute a search warrant, investigators determined Daybell and Vallow had fled the home. And according to authorities, they didn't appear to have taken JJ with them.\n\nInvestigators also learned that Tylee hadn't been seen since September, though she'd most recently lived with Vallow and JJ in Rexburg.\n\nLori Vallow and Chad Daybell.\n\nInvestigations into death of Daybell's wife\n\nThe children's disappearance is part of a complex past 12 months for the family. Police have investigated two deaths in the couple's family in that time frame.\n\nOne of those deaths is that of Vallow's estranged husband, who was shot and killed in July during a fight with Vallow's brother in their former home state, Arizona.\n\nDetails about the motive in the killing weren't immediately available. Vallow's brother was not charged in the case and died in December, according to CNN affiliate KIFI/KIDK. His cause of death has not been released, and an investigation is pending the results of an autopsy, CNN affiliate KNXV reported earlier this month.\n\nShortly after, Vallow moved with the children to Idaho and married Daybell, who had links to a religious content website.\n\nVallow's former husband said she had recently become infatuated and at times obsessive about near death experiences and spiritual visions, according to a petition for dissolution of marriage filed last February.\n\nThe second death authorities are investigating is that of Daybell's previous wife, Tammy Daybell, in Idaho in October. Though she was originally believed to have died of natural causes, Rexburg police announced in December that it was suspicious, and her remains were exhumed.\n\nA few weeks after she died, Vallow and Daybell were married, police said.

(Colman, in an emotional speech, practically apologized to Close for winning.)\n\nPHOTO: Kevin Winter/Getty Images North America/Getty Images Olivia Colman\n\nAs for politics, a recurring theme involved the Trump administration's immigration polices, including an early joke from Maya Rudolph that among the things that wouldn't be happening during the telecast, Mexico is not paying for the wall. For his part, Malek referenced being a first-generation American, the son of Egyptian immigrants.\n\nStill, the most overt and rousing rejoinder belonged to Spike Lee – a winner for adapted screenplay for his movie BlacKkKlansman – who pointed to the 2020 election, urging people to be on the right side of history. Let's do the right thing! Congressman and civil-rights icon John Lewis also received a prolonged ovation, introducing Green Book.\n\nPHOTO: VALERIE MACON/AFP/Getty Images Spike Lee jumps in the arms of Actor Samuel L. Jackson as he accepts the award for best adapted screenplay\n\nMarvel's Black Panther looked like a contender by claiming a pair of early awards, and made history in the process: Ruth E. Carter and Hannah Beachler became the first African-American women to win for costume design and production design, respectively. The film was also honored for its musical score.\n\nRoma didn't walk away empty handed, earing best foreign-language film. Its director, Alfonso Cuaron, was honored for directing and cinematography for the black-and-white period drama, a deeply personal look back at the women who raised him.\n\nCuaron's marks the fifth time a Mexican director has won that award in the past six years, a stretch that includes his previous win for Gravity in 2014.\n\nGuillermo Del Toro – who presented the statuette to Cuaron – was the victor last year for The Shape of Water. The third member of the Three Amigos, as they are affectionately known, is Alejandro G. Iñárritu, a winner for Birdman and The Revenant.\n\nPHOTO: Mike Blake/Reuters Mahershala Ali\n\nMahershala Ali received his second Oscar in three years for Green Book, and the film also won for original screenplay, despite separate controversies related to its director and writer. With his prior award for Moonlight, Ali becomes only the second African-American actor with multiple Oscars, joining Denzel Washington. A tearful Regina King took the first award of the night, winning supporting actress for If Beale Street Could Talk, director Barry Jenkins' adaptation of the James Baldwin novel.\n\nPHOTO: VALERIE MACON/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Regina King\n\nBeyond Black Panther, Marvel's highlights included Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse swinging off with best animated movie, as the Sony release topped a pair of Disney sequels, Ralph Breaks the Internet and Incredibles 2. Free Solo, a hit documentary about daredevil climber Alex Honnold, topped the documentary feature category, which also included the Ruth Bader Ginsburg biography RBG. In their enthusiasm, one of the filmmakers blurted out an expletive that was promptly bleeped.\n\nBohemian Rhapsody's other wins came in both sound categories as well editing. Notably, none of the Rhapsody winners thanked credited director, Bryan Singer, who was accused of sexual abuse in January, allegations that the filmmaker has denied.\n\nIn one of the more expected victories, the team that transformed Christian Bale into former Vice President Dick Cheney won in makeup/hairstyling for Vice. Visual effects, however, were something of a surprise, going to First Man, the moon-landing drama about Neil Armstrong.\n\nLacking a host, the producers relied on music and comedy bits to enliven the evening, including a duet from A Star is Born by Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga – later the winner for best song – which drew a standing ovation from the Hollywood crowd.\n\nPHOTO: Kevin Winter/Getty Images Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper performed 'Shallow' from 'A Star Is Born'\n\nRudolph, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler introduced Sunday's telecast, following Queen and Adam Lambert's opening performance of We Will Rock You and We Are the Champions. The Saturday Night Live alums riffed off the messy build-up to this year's awards.\n\nPHOTO: VALERIE MACON/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Maya Rudolf, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler\n\nAn abundance of drama surrounded the build-up to this year's Oscars, even before getting around to the nailbiting best-picture finish.\n\nThe contenders reflected the gamut of an evolving movie industry, with Roma representing Netflix's arrival in movies, after the streaming service's model-bending impact on the TV business.\n\nOn the flip side, Black Panther embodied the blockbusters upon which the studios have come to rely, and the third-highest-grossing US release of all time at $700 million, nearly doubling that total worldwide.\n\nA number of individual nominees registered breakthroughs for women and people of color, only a few years after lack of diversity among the acting categories birthed the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag.\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences endured a series of missteps leading up to the telecast, beginning with the proposal to introduce a popular film category. That idea was quickly scuttled, as was a subsequent plan to move four awards into the commercial breaks to help streamline the ceremony, which prompted a rebellion from Academy members.\n\nIn between, Kevin Hart was chosen to host the awards, before the resurfacing of homophobic social-media posts prompted the comic to withdraw. After a period of confusion, it was finally confirmed the awards would be mounted without a host, the first time that's happened in 30 years.\n\nMuch of the tumult surrounding the 91st annual Oscars can be traced back to last year's awards – and more specifically, a precipitous ratings decline, falling to an all-time low. Shortening the ceremony to three hours, or close to it, has been among the solutions that host network ABC has advocated as a means of stopping the bleeding from a Nielsen standpoint.
(CNN) The Supreme Court has increasingly exempted religious believers from government regulations, and it is clear by their statements that individual justices on the right think religion is under siege in America.\n\nEarlier this month, the justices spared churches from California's Covid-19 restrictions on large indoor gatherings. In late November, the justices ruled for New York churches and synagogues challenging coronavirus occupancy limits.\n\nWhen a State so obviously targets religion for differential treatment, our job becomes that much clearer, wrote Justice Neil Gorsuch in a statement in the latest California church case. Joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, the statement reinforced conservatives' warnings in recent months of religious liberty under attack.\n\nAt the Supreme Court, a counteroffensive of sorts has been underway, most recently in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, building on a series of religion cases last year.\n\nCritics of the broader trend have pointed out potential harm to non-adherents and other third parties, whether by easing pandemic rules, lifting anti-discrimination laws or forcing states to use taxpayer funds for religious education.\n\nThe Supreme Court majority in 2020 invalidated a Montana tax-credit program for private schools that had excluded religious institutions; shielded Catholic schools in Los Angeles from teachers' job-discrimination claims; and sided with the Trump administration as it enhanced the ability of private employers to opt out of requisite birth control coverage in employee insurance plans based on religious or moral objections.\n\nIn that last dispute, one of the final cases of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's tenure, she argued that the court had abandoned a balanced approach that forbade the religious beliefs of some from overwhelming the rights others.\n\nToday, for the first time, Ginsburg wrote in a dissent , the Court casts totally aside countervailing rights and interests in its zeal to secure religious rights to the nth degree.\n\nAlthough there have been shifting majorities in some of these fractious cases, they generally break down along ideological lines, as this month's 6-3 California dispute did.\n\nWriting for the three remaining liberals, Justice Elena Kagan declared, Under the Court's injunction, the State must treat worship services like secular activities that pose a much lesser danger. That mandate defies our caselaw, exceeds our judicial role, and risks worsening the pandemic.\n\nDiscord at the high court reflects America's ongoing conflicts over church and state. Yet in a country that has grown more religiously diverse, the majority is deepening a pattern that favors religious conservatives.\n\nThe succession of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, appointed by former President Donald Trump in October, for Ginsburg, makes that all the more likely.\n\nTest case about Philly social agency\n\nThe rightward trend will be tested in a pending a case, Fulton v. City of Philadelphia , brought by Catholic Social Services and a foster parent who works with the agency. Catholic Social Services, which has contracted with Philadelphia for decades, objected to a new city anti-bias mandate that would force it to include same-sex couples in its foster-parent screening process.\n\nThe Supreme Court in 2015 declared a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, but that ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges left open some questions that could arise from religious objectors. Now, Catholic Social Services asserts that Philadelphia's anti-bias rule impinges its free exercise of religion and private speech.\n\nOral arguments last November revealed some justices' fears about government intruding on religion.\n\nLook, if we are honest about what's really going on here, Alito insisted, it's not about ensuring that same-sex couples in Philadelphia have the opportunity to be foster parents. It's the fact that the City can't stand the message that Catholic Social Services and the Archdiocese are sending by continuing to adhere to the old-fashioned view about marriage.\n\nLawyer Neal Katyal, representing Philadelphia, responded: Absolutely not.\n\nKatyal argued that Catholic Social Services merits no exemption from the non-discrimination dictate that agencies must follow and said governments have greater leeway to set such rules when dealing with employees and contractors than when regulating private individuals.\n\nLawyer Lori Windham, on behalf of the CSS challengers, told the justices, Philadelphia is refusing to place children with loving mothers, like Sharonell Fulton ... just because they chose to partner with an agency who shares their faith.\n\nWindham also argued that other foster-child agencies in Philadelphia work with same-sex couples so the CSS' practices do not prevent same-sex couples from becoming foster parents.\n\nLower court judges sided with Philadelphia, saying the city was enforcing a neutral policy. They grounded their decision in a 1990 Supreme Court case that makes it difficult to raise free exercise claims against valid, neutral laws.\n\nBut the Philadelphia case gives the court a chance to reconsider that precedent.\n\nThe 1990 ruling in Employment Division v. Smith requires religious believers to abide by generally applicable regulations. The case began when two Oregon men who engaged in the sacramental use of peyote were fired from their job and denied state unemployment benefits because of illegal drug use.\n\nIn oral arguments in the foster parent dispute, new Justice Barrett suggested she was not ready to outright reverse that 1990 precedent. Yet she also expressed skepticism for the principle that judges should consider the harm that a religious exemption would cause a third party.\n\nShe referred to friend of the court advocates pressing the principle and questioned whether it would cover action that injures a third party even slightly.\n\nChurch-state scholars who submitted an amicus curiae brief that emphasized the costs of a possible CSS exemption to same-sex couples say the third-party principle has its own limits.\n\nConservative justices, however, have demonstrated that the harms distinctly in their sights these days are those that would fall on religious believers and their worship practices.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden is not the right Democratic candidate for 2020. And yet, he may soon enter the Democratic race.\n\nThus far, what has been most remarkable is how diverse the field is shaping up to be. This is not your traditional slate of Democratic candidates. Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Peter Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang and several others are already up and running. And more are likely to follow.\n\nThe composition of the Democratic field represents the diversity of the country. With so many serious frontrunners who are not, for a change, older white men, the Democrats are showing that they are a party representing the future of the country. In contrast to the kind of rhetoric that has come from President Donald Trump, an ode to the whiteness and masculinity of a limited American political tradition, the Democrats are making a strong statement about what their party is all about.\n\nAnd their opening speeches reflect that reality as well. They have revolved around issues such as racial justice, gender equity, immigration rights and more. Even a candidate like Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is being tagged as the moderate with bipartisan appeal, proclaimed: Stop the fear-mongering and stop the hate. We may come from different places. We may pray in different ways. We may look different. And love different. But all live in the same country of shared dreams.\n\nThen comes Biden. The former vice president has every right to run and certainly has a great deal to offer. During his career in the Senate and in the White House, Biden was a strong champion of the middle class. He pushed for the kinds of policies that Trump, despite all his promises to the forgotten Americans, never pursued. As vice president, he headed the Middle Class Task Force, which championed policies such as capping student loan payments and improving retirement security. He was even ahead of President Barack Obama on the issue of same-sex marriage.\n\nAlso, as an older white male (who would be 78 years old in January 2021), there are a number of Democrats who see him as the safe choice, the only person who will be able to withstand the President's testosterone-filled campaign. And CNN polling shows that right now most believe he would do best in a matchup against the President.\n\nBut is Biden really the best answer for the party? There is good reason for Democrats to be skeptical and to consider supporting other candidates.\n\nMost problematic is the fact that Biden has run for the presidency several times, and each time he has struggled under the intense spotlight. When it comes time to hit the campaign trail, Biden has never been able to generate the level of support that is necessary to win. His tendency to make gaffes has also hurt him. And, in our frenzied news cycle with endless outlets and few filters on information, Biden's style will cause problems again.\n\nOf course, these issues didn't stop Trump in 2016. But unlike Trump, it is unclear that without a comparable partisan media outlet (Fox News) and unyielding partisan loyalty, that Biden would survive. While MSNBC could offer a boost to Biden, social scientists have shown that the conservative media has a much stronger hold on conservative viewers than liberal outlets. Conservatives also tend to be more ideologically homogenous and loyal than their counterparts on the left. In other words, Democrats have seen the challenges that the inevitable frontrunner faces, as the election actually takes shape.\n\nMore important, though, is the moment in which we are living. Trump has run a political operation from the White House that has revolved around a vision of white nationalism that challenges the values of pluralism, diversity and inclusion. His statement after Charlottesville forever marked his term in office. And the President's perpetual struggle to build a wall perfectly captures what he hopes to achieve – with his central goal being about keeping people out rather than bringing them in.\n\nWith so many strong candidates already lined up to run in the Democratic primaries, many of whom who have launched their runs with the kind of gravitas and excitement that bodes well for a presidential campaign, there is a risk of someone like Biden being in the race – someone with the potential to suck up all the oxygen in the room. Uncle Joe could quickly take away media attention and campaign funds from Democrats who would perform better in the general election. If Biden was the nominee, he would also throw cold water on the excitement and energy that exists among younger Democrats about the direction of their party.\n\nThe Democrats should not assume that an older, moderate white man is inevitably the strongest candidate. Even Bernie Sanders offers a fresh perspective with his left of center, Democratic Socialist positions (he would also be notable as a Jewish-American nominee). It is possible to see the virtue of a ticket that embodies diversity from the top down. All of the candidates who are currently running would enable the Democrats to showcase the difference in what the party represents compared to the GOP. As a new article in The New York Times shows, the GOP is bleeding young voters with each passing day of the Trump presidency.\n\nWith Biden at the top of the ticket, it would be much more difficult to generate enthusiasm among African-Americans, Latinos or younger voters, for instance, who will be looking to Democrats to prove that they will offer something fundamentally different. While there are early polls showing substantial numbers of African-Americans backing Biden and Sanders, these don't measure the excitement that might be generated on the campaign trail once the other candidates are better known and once their political skills have been proven.\n\nAnd Biden's pivotal role on the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act, which was foundational to the expansion of the mass incarceration system, will come back to haunt him. Like Hillary Clinton, he will have to reckon with his vote authorizing President George W. Bush to use military force in Iraq, baggage that the younger generation of Democrats won't be carrying onto the campaign trail.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nMeanwhile, many educated, suburban women are looking for a candidate who will take seriously the message of the #metoo movement. This is a social movement that has rocked American society, bringing attention to the horrendous ways in which sexism and sexual assault continue to play out in many of our major industries and in our private lives. They won't be happy to hear about his role in the 1991 Clarence Thomas hearings, where he was one of the many senators who did not take seriously the sexual harassment complaints of Anita Hill. He was part of the reason that 1992 saw a surge in female candidates.\n\nThe most successful Democrat in recent decades was Barack Obama, who mobilized a powerful electoral coalition because of the change he represented for the Democratic Party – not because he was the party's safe choice.\n\nOf course, Biden has a right to run – should he so choose. But before Democrats go overboard in shifting their financial and organizational resources, as well as endorsements, to the former vice president, they should think long and hard about whether they want the face of their party to be someone who represents the past – or the future.
Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nPete Buttigieg excoriated Donald Trump and one of his most high-profile supporters for questioning his marriage to his husband, Chasten, on Tuesday, telling an audience in Las Vegas that his marriage never involved me having to send hush money to a porn star.\n\nButtigieg is referring to $130,000 in payments arranged by Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to Stephanie Clifford, a porn star known as Stormy Daniels who says she and Trump had an affair in 2006 after Trump married his wife Melania. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels, but admitted in 2018 that he knew of the payments later on.\n\nThe comments also come days after radio host Rush Limbaugh told his listeners that American voters are still not ready to elect a gay guy kissing his husband on the debate stage president. Limbaugh said on Tuesday that Trump, who initially responded to the host's comments by saying he would not be uncomfortable with a gay president, told him to never apologize for his comments about Buttigieg.\n\nThe idea of the likes of Rush Limbaugh or Donald Trump lecturing anybody on family values, Buttigieg said, before pausing for cheers and applause.\n\nI'm sorry but one thing about my marriage is it's never involved me having to send hush money to a porn star after cheating on my spouse, with him or her, Buttigieg said. So, if they want to debate family values, let's debate family values, I'm ready.\n\nButtigieg also said he did not take Trump at his word because he's sending out his supporters to talk in that way.\n\nWatch:

But on the other hand, there's a lot of people out there who think that maybe lower fertility might prove problematic, particularly as the labor force starts to shrink as a result.\n\nBirthrates were down for women of all ages – except those in their early 40s. Experts say that women choosing to have children later in life is lowering birthrates, and this change might be temporary.\n\nClearly, there is postponement, Livingston said. Now, will all the women who've been postponing birth … ultimately catch up on their fertility? I'm not sure.\n\nThe teen birthrate, defined as those between the ages of 15 and 19, also continued to decline: It was 7% less than the year prior, down to 194,284 total births. This number is less than half of the 444,899 babies born to teens in 2007.\n\nExperts have described this decline as phenomenal, as did Dr. Elise Berlan, a physician in the section of adolescent medicine at Nationwide Children's Hospital, who was not involved in this research.\n\nWe know that the vast majority of teen births are unintended, Berland previously told CNN, adding that access to contraceptives and use of contraceptives … has really led to these kind of changes.\n\nSeparate data have also showed a decrease in teens' reported sexual activity in recent years.\n\nA number of short-term influences may be contributing to the decline, including the late-2000s economic recession, experts say.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nOur own survey data shows that people stated they were postponing birth until the economy picked up again, Livingston said. Whenever there's an economic downturn, it's pretty normal for there to also be a downturn in fertility.\n\nBut in the long term, there is a broader set of drivers behind the numbers, including more women in the work force, higher levels of education and postponement of marriage, she said.\n\nEven though there's so much discussion about birth outside of marriage, the fact is that someone who is married is still a lot more likely to have a baby than someone who's not married.\n\nCNN's Susan Scutti contributed to this report.

(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)\n\nWeinstein has repeatedly denied any allegations of non-consensual sex.\n\nThat's what makes this so incredibly painful: I had what I thought was a very happy marriage. I loved my life. Chapman said. Absolutely not [did she suspect him cheating]. Never. For one thing, he traveled constantly. And I've never been one of those people who obsesses about where someone is.\n\nEven Vogue editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, stated in her June editor's letter that she is convinced Chapman was unaware of Weinstein's alleged misconduct.\n\nI am firmly convinced that Georgina had no idea about her husband's behavior; blaming her for any of it, as too many have in our gladiatorial digital age, is wrong, Wintour wrote. I believe that one should not hold a person responsible for the actions of his or her partner. What Georgina should be receiving is our compassion and understanding.\n\nWeinstein is currently under investigation for alleged sex crimes in New York, Los Angeles and London.\n\nRelated: Harvey Weinstein's wife announces she is leaving him\n\nAfter the news first broke in The New York Times and The New Yorker last fall, Chapman said her head was spinning.\n\nI lost ten pounds in five days. I couldn't keep food down, she said. About two days [to process the news]. My head was spinning. And it was difficult because the first article was about a time long before I'd ever met him, so there was a minute where I couldn't make an informed decision. And then the stories expanded and I realized that this wasn't an isolated incident. And I knew that I needed to step away and take the kids out of here.\n\nChapman married Weinstein in 2007 and together they have two young children. She announced in October that she was leaving Weinstein.\n\nI have moments of rage, I have moments of confusion, I have moments of disbelief! Chapman said. And I have moments when I just cry for my children. What are their lives going to be? What are people going to say to them? It's like, they love their dad. They love him. I just can't bear it for them!\n\nChapman, the co-founder of high-end fashion house, Marchesa, said she's made it a point not to attend public events or even be spotted out since October.\n\nI was so humiliated and so broken,she said. I didn't think it was respectful to go out. I thought, who am I to be parading around with all of this going on? It's still so very, very raw. I was walking up the stairs the other day and I stopped; it was like all the air had been punched out of my lungs.\n\nThe scandal also led to her decision to cancel the Marchesa runway show in January.\n\nWe didn't feel it was appropriate given the situation, Chapman added. All the women who have been hurt deserve dignity and respect, so I want to give it the time it deserves. It's a time for mourning, really.\n\nAlthough she's coming to terms on the end of her marriage and planning a Weinstein-free future with her children, she wants the world to know that she's not looking for anyone to pity her.\n\nI don't want to be viewed as a victim, she said. Because I don't think I am. I am a woman in a sh*t situation.
Written by Nick Glass, CNN\n\nJust when we thought the Turner Prize was getting a bit repetitive, a trifle boring, we get a result to shake things up. Perhaps seismically. For the first time in a long time (aside from the relentlessly predictable cycle of auction records) contemporary art has elbowed its way back onto the front pages -- and thrillingly.\n\nThis year's winner is Lubaina Himid. Remember the name.\n\nHimid was born on the island of Zanzibar, off the coast of Tanzania, in 1954. At 63, she is not only the oldest ever winner by almost decade, as well the oldest ever nominee, but also the first woman of color to take the prize. (For the men, Chris Ofili won in 1998, quickly followed in 1999 by Steve McQueen. Both are now in their late 40s.)\n\nAnd what's more, unlike the other three artists on this year's shortlist, Himid doesn't work and live in London, or any other European capital. No, she lives and works in Preston, Lancashire, where she's a professor of contemporary art at the local university. (The local paper, the Lancashire Evening Post, will surely make a big splash of it.)\n\nClose-up view of A Fashionable Marriage (1986) by Lubaina Himid Credit: Courtesy Hollybush Gardens\n\nAll of this -- and much else besides -- makes her newsworthy. And then, of course, there is her art, which celebrates black creativity. In another startling break from tradition, the major piece she's exhibiting at the Turner Prize Show at the Ferens Art Gallery in Hull is over 30 years old. Some art critics are likely to tut-tut a bit and question how much the rules appear to have been relaxed: not just older artists now, but old work too. (As I remember it, the Turner Prize used to be expressly about new and contemporary work.)\n\nHimid's big piece is an exuberant installation, A Fashionable Marriage (1986), inspired by the paintings of the English satirist William Hogarth's Marriage A-la-Mode (1743-45). Himid, a former set designer, created a series of theatrical, life-size plywood figures, satirizing the politics and art of the 1980s. The figures preen, gawp and guffaw across a raised stage. Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan are the feted (not to say fated) lovers as the countess and the lawyer Silvertongue.\n\nIn a more recent piece, Swallow Hard: The Lancaster Dinner Service (2007), a dinner set has been repainted to tell the story of slavery. This time, Himid drew inspiration from the late 18th-century English caricaturists James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson, decorating glazed crockery -- plates, jugs, tureens -- with a procession of fat country squires, their complaining wives and a retinue of black servants and slaves.\n\nSwallow Hard: The Lancaster Dinner Service (2007) by Lubaina Himid Credit: Courtesy Hollybush Gardens\n\nIn another series, Negative Positives: The Guardian Archive (2007-17), she has continued to rework old covers of the Guardian newspaper to show that, in her view, they are guilty of black stereotyping. In all probability, she herself will now make the front page of the paper.\n\nAt the opening of the Turner Prize show in September, the director of Tate Britain, Alex Farquharson, spoke of the increased interest in the British black art movement of the 1980s. He felt those artists' contributions had not been recognized as a key aspect of the story of art at the time. Yet increasingly, there is a widespread acceptance that the '80s black art movement ushered in a lot of what we see today. By awarding this year's prize to Himid, the jury seems to be retroactively recognizing its importance.\n\nLe Rodeur: The Exchange (2016) by Lubaina Himid Credit: Courtesy Hollybush Gardens\n\nAccording to a statement, the jury praised Himid for her uncompromising tackling of issues including colonial history and how racism persists today. They admired her expansive and exuberant approach to painting, which combines satire and a sense of theater. The jury also acknowledged her role as an influential curator and educator who continues to speak urgently to the moment.

New York (CNN Business) This story started when Jeff Bezos tweeted, something the richest man on the planet doesn't do very often.\n\nJanuary 9\n\nBezos — the founder, CEO and largest single shareholder of Amazon — tweets a joint statement from him and his wife, author MacKenzie Bezos. The two say they are getting a divorce after 25 years of marriage\n\nAfter a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends, the couple write. It was the 184th time Bezos had tweeted since he started his account in 2008.\n\nThe couple, who have four children, say they look forward to continuing working together as parents, friends, partners in ventures and projects, and as individuals pursuing ventures and adventures.\n\nLater that day\n\nThe supermarket tabloid says it had been investigating Bezos for four months, tracking the Amazon CEO across five states and 40,000 miles. The tabloid says it has evidence that Bezos has been whisking his mistress off to exotic destinations on his $65 million private jet.\n\nThe Enquirer and other outlets identify the woman as Lauren Sanchez, a former anchor for Fox's local station in Los Angeles. The Enquirer says a lawyer for Bezos told the publication that it was widely known that Bezos and his wife had been long separated.\n\nIn a statement, the magazine's parent company, American Media Inc., suggests that its investigation had prompted Bezos to go public with his divorce plans.\n\nThe National Enquirer has been doggedly investigating this story for four months and the extraordinary details and evidence uncovered by our team, and presented to Mr. Bezos' representatives for comment early this week, underscores the kind of investigative reporting that the publication has long been known for, a spokesman says.\n\nThe Enquirer's cover promises to show the cheating photos that ended his marriage with 11 pages of exclusive photos. It also releases text messages it says were sent to Bezos by Lauren Sanchez.\n\nJanuary 10\n\nBezos, who owns the Washington Post, is a frequent target for President Donald Trump, who has criticized the newspaper for its coverage. When asked about the Bezos divorce, during a Q&A with reporters, Trump says, I wish him luck. It's going to be a beauty.\n\nJanuary 13\n\nPresident Trump tweets a shot at the Amazon CEO.\n\nSo sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better & more responsible hands!\n\nJanuary 30\n\nThe Daily Beast reports that Bezos is investigating how his text messages ended up in The National Enquirer. The Beast says the inquiry is increasingly convinced that political motives are behind the disclosure.\n\nJanuary 31\n\nThe Beast follows up . It reports that Gavin de Becker, a private security consultant Bezos says he retained to investigate the facts in this matter, had scrutinized Michael Sanchez, Lauren Sanchez's brother, who is connected to a number of associates of President Donald Trump. (Michael Sanchez did not respond to requests for comment. He told the Washington Post that he did not play a role in the revelation of the affair.)\n\nBezos retained Gavin de Becker to investigate the revelation of his affair.\n\nFebruary 5\n\nThe Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos, publishes an article headlined Was tabloid exposé of Bezos affair just juicy gossip or a political hit job?\n\nThe story reports that de Becker says he believes the Enquirer's reporting about Bezos was sparked by a politically motivated leak. The Post further reports that Michael Sanchez firmly denies playing any role in the revelation of his sister's affair.\n\nFebruary 7\n\nJeff Bezos, in another rare tweet , tells the world he has blogged. I've written a post about developments with the National Enquirer and its parent company, AMI, he writes.\n\nemails his representatives got from executives at AMI threatening extortion and blackmail. In a 2,000-word post on Medium , Bezos accuses AMI of trying to extort him . He reveals what he says are the full text of some of theemails his representatives got from executives at AMI threatening extortion and blackmail.\n\nSomething unusual happened to me yesterday. Actually, for me it wasn't just unusual — it was a first. I was made an offer I couldn't refuse. Or at least that's what the top people at the National Enquirer thought. I'm glad they thought that, because it emboldened them to put it all in writing, Bezos writes. Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I've decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten.\n\nFebruary 8\n\nAmerican Media, in a statement, says it believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos but adds that it will investigate: Further, at the time of the recent allegations made by Mr. Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him. Nonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary.\n\nSeparately, two sources familiar with the matter tell CNN that federal prosecutors in New York are reviewing the Enquirer's handling of its Bezos reporting to determine if the company may have violated a cooperation deal reached with prosecutors last year. The government announced in December that it had struck a non-prosecution agreement with American Media.\n\n-- CNN's Evan Perez and Kara Scannell contributed to this report.

As CNN reported on Thursday morning:\n\nTrump has been blaming his longtime personal attorney and many others for the predicament he now finds himself in, though he has not accepted any responsibility in public or in private, people familiar with his reaction told CNN.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden is not the right Democratic candidate for 2020. And yet, he may soon enter the Democratic race.\n\nThus far, what has been most remarkable is how diverse the field is shaping up to be. This is not your traditional slate of Democratic candidates. Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Peter Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang and several others are already up and running. And more are likely to follow.\n\nThe composition of the Democratic field represents the diversity of the country. With so many serious frontrunners who are not, for a change, older white men, the Democrats are showing that they are a party representing the future of the country. In contrast to the kind of rhetoric that has come from President Donald Trump, an ode to the whiteness and masculinity of a limited American political tradition, the Democrats are making a strong statement about what their party is all about.\n\nAnd their opening speeches reflect that reality as well. They have revolved around issues such as racial justice, gender equity, immigration rights and more. Even a candidate like Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is being tagged as the moderate with bipartisan appeal, proclaimed: Stop the fear-mongering and stop the hate. We may come from different places. We may pray in different ways. We may look different. And love different. But all live in the same country of shared dreams.\n\nThen comes Biden. The former vice president has every right to run and certainly has a great deal to offer. During his career in the Senate and in the White House, Biden was a strong champion of the middle class. He pushed for the kinds of policies that Trump, despite all his promises to the forgotten Americans, never pursued. As vice president, he headed the Middle Class Task Force, which championed policies such as capping student loan payments and improving retirement security. He was even ahead of President Barack Obama on the issue of same-sex marriage.\n\nAlso, as an older white male (who would be 78 years old in January 2021), there are a number of Democrats who see him as the safe choice, the only person who will be able to withstand the President's testosterone-filled campaign. And CNN polling shows that right now most believe he would do best in a matchup against the President.\n\nBut is Biden really the best answer for the party? There is good reason for Democrats to be skeptical and to consider supporting other candidates.\n\nMost problematic is the fact that Biden has run for the presidency several times, and each time he has struggled under the intense spotlight. When it comes time to hit the campaign trail, Biden has never been able to generate the level of support that is necessary to win. His tendency to make gaffes has also hurt him. And, in our frenzied news cycle with endless outlets and few filters on information, Biden's style will cause problems again.\n\nOf course, these issues didn't stop Trump in 2016. But unlike Trump, it is unclear that without a comparable partisan media outlet (Fox News) and unyielding partisan loyalty, that Biden would survive. While MSNBC could offer a boost to Biden, social scientists have shown that the conservative media has a much stronger hold on conservative viewers than liberal outlets. Conservatives also tend to be more ideologically homogenous and loyal than their counterparts on the left. In other words, Democrats have seen the challenges that the inevitable frontrunner faces, as the election actually takes shape.\n\nMore important, though, is the moment in which we are living. Trump has run a political operation from the White House that has revolved around a vision of white nationalism that challenges the values of pluralism, diversity and inclusion. His statement after Charlottesville forever marked his term in office. And the President's perpetual struggle to build a wall perfectly captures what he hopes to achieve – with his central goal being about keeping people out rather than bringing them in.\n\nWith so many strong candidates already lined up to run in the Democratic primaries, many of whom who have launched their runs with the kind of gravitas and excitement that bodes well for a presidential campaign, there is a risk of someone like Biden being in the race – someone with the potential to suck up all the oxygen in the room. Uncle Joe could quickly take away media attention and campaign funds from Democrats who would perform better in the general election. If Biden was the nominee, he would also throw cold water on the excitement and energy that exists among younger Democrats about the direction of their party.\n\nThe Democrats should not assume that an older, moderate white man is inevitably the strongest candidate. Even Bernie Sanders offers a fresh perspective with his left of center, Democratic Socialist positions (he would also be notable as a Jewish-American nominee). It is possible to see the virtue of a ticket that embodies diversity from the top down. All of the candidates who are currently running would enable the Democrats to showcase the difference in what the party represents compared to the GOP. As a new article in The New York Times shows, the GOP is bleeding young voters with each passing day of the Trump presidency.\n\nWith Biden at the top of the ticket, it would be much more difficult to generate enthusiasm among African-Americans, Latinos or younger voters, for instance, who will be looking to Democrats to prove that they will offer something fundamentally different. While there are early polls showing substantial numbers of African-Americans backing Biden and Sanders, these don't measure the excitement that might be generated on the campaign trail once the other candidates are better known and once their political skills have been proven.\n\nAnd Biden's pivotal role on the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act, which was foundational to the expansion of the mass incarceration system, will come back to haunt him. Like Hillary Clinton, he will have to reckon with his vote authorizing President George W. Bush to use military force in Iraq, baggage that the younger generation of Democrats won't be carrying onto the campaign trail.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nMeanwhile, many educated, suburban women are looking for a candidate who will take seriously the message of the #metoo movement. This is a social movement that has rocked American society, bringing attention to the horrendous ways in which sexism and sexual assault continue to play out in many of our major industries and in our private lives. They won't be happy to hear about his role in the 1991 Clarence Thomas hearings, where he was one of the many senators who did not take seriously the sexual harassment complaints of Anita Hill. He was part of the reason that 1992 saw a surge in female candidates.\n\nThe most successful Democrat in recent decades was Barack Obama, who mobilized a powerful electoral coalition because of the change he represented for the Democratic Party – not because he was the party's safe choice.\n\nOf course, Biden has a right to run – should he so choose. But before Democrats go overboard in shifting their financial and organizational resources, as well as endorsements, to the former vice president, they should think long and hard about whether they want the face of their party to be someone who represents the past – or the future.
Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN\n\nIn many parts of the world, cleansing one's body has become an individual, daily ritual -- a quick, steamy shower in the morning or a longer bath to unwind at night. But historically, our bathing habits have been imbued with deeper meanings.\n\nIn Ancient Greece, bathhouses were a place for men to wash after sport or swap philosophical discussions (some even contained libraries), while in the Middle Ages, men and women in Europe gave up bathing altogether, for fear it would spread disease. Perfumes and cleansing ointments replaced steam and water, with elaborately adorned bottles and containers linking affluence to health. Fast-forward to the 1960s and '70s, where bathhouses in New York City became safe havens for gay men to relax, socialize and seek pleasure.\n\nRembrandt's intimate and sensual take on the Old Testament subject Bathsheba at Her Bath, painted in 1654.

Power: A Cultural History of the Bath charts the evolution of bathtubs and bathing accoutrements across cultures and eras, reflecting each period in their design and purpose.\n\nThe bath can seem like a frivolous or amusing topic, but in fact it turns out to be a very particular place and time for socialization, where one exposes oneself -- we literally get naked -- where we interact with ourselves, our bodies and our intimacy, but, in the context of public baths, also with others, writes curator Camille Faucourt in the book. This space-time has no equivalent in our daily social interactions.\n\nA place for purity and gender roles\n\nThe phrase cleanliness is next to godliness originates from an 18th-century sermon, but the connection between good hygiene and religious purity is ancient.\n\nIn Body. Gaze. Power, curator Florence Hudowicz refers to ancient Greek playwrights who implied a person's virtuosity or debauchery was based on the temperature of water they preferred to bathe in. In a Greek pottery work from around 425 BC, the god Eros flies above a female bather. She signals that washing oneself was also practiced before marriage in order to purify the body of the bride and ensure her future fertility, write Hudowicz and Faucourt.\n\nThough in Ancient Egypt, architectural remains show men and women may have bathed together, Ancient Greeks and Romans were separated by gender. Depictions of their routines in art show athletic, nude men scraping the dirt away after vigorous exercise. Women's routines were shown as more private -- sometimes clothed or nude, surrounding a cauldron of water.\n\nA detail of a pottery work attributed to Athenian vase painter Onesimos circa 500 BC. It shows the routines of Ancient Greek athletes, who applied oils before training in the sun, followed by bathing and vigorous scraping with a strigil tool.

By the Middle Ages, the church was staunchly against the loose morals of bathhouses, which no longer kept men and women separate and often facilitated prostitution.\n\nThe plague that surged and waned across Europe beginning in the 14th century, eventually became the death knell of bathing for hundreds of years. In the 16th century, the belief took hold that steaming or submerging skin in water opened up pores to disease. Public steam baths closed and people took up waterless cleansing routines, applying ointments to the feet, hands, mouth and genitals. Smells were hidden with perfumes and elaborate bottles became status symbols for the wealthy.\n\nThe delicate materials from which they were made and the exceptional quality of their ornamentation are indicative of the constant care devoted to maintaining one's appearance and bodily hygiene, writes Faucourt.\n\nThe wealthy commissioned artworks around bathing as well, tapping Rococo artists including Jean-Antoine Watteau and François Boucher to paint teasing nude female figures extensively washing themselves.\n\nThe Roman goddess Diana became a popular figure to paint in Rococo art because of myths that include her bathing rituals. Boucher painted Diana Resting after her Bath in 1742.

It also took generations to shake the idea that submerging oneself in water could enable disease.\n\nHowever, European attitudes toward bathing were far from universal. In the Middle East, Faucourt notes there have been fewer fluctuations in attitudes surrounding bathing. From the Ottoman Empire until today, the hammam -- the Turkish bath -- has remained popular, though its practical use has declined with the rise of home bathrooms.\n\nA place for power and vulnerability\n\nBathhouses have long held political implications, too. In Ancient Rome, they were sprawling complexes for socializing, but also sites of expensive architectural splendor (that) served to establish and affirm an emperor's power, writes curator Hendrik Bündge in Body. Gaze. Power.\n\nIn a person's home, however, the bathtub is one of the most vulnerable places. When you are naked, you are vulnerable; that's why the shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' is so shocking, writes Bündge.\n\nIn the eyes of the revolutionaries, Marat immediately became a martyr of freedom after his assassination, writes Alain Chevalier in Body. Gaze. Power. Rather than hide the circumstances of his death, they chose to glorify them. Credit: bpk/RMN-Grand Palais/Franck Raux/Hatje Cantz\n\nOne of the most famous artworks from the French Revolution shows the aftermath of a scandalous political crime, set in the bathroom. In Jacques-Louis David's 1793 painting The Death of Marat, French revolutionary and journalist Jean-Paul Marat lies murdered in his tub, his hand still holding an inked quill, the bathwater filled with his blood. His assassin, the royalist aristocrat Marie-Anne Charlotte Corday, intended to murder him publicly but instead came into his home and stabbed him while he washed. David, who shared a friendship and political ideologies with Marat, painted the scene just four months later, martyrizing his subject.\n\nA century and a half later, during World War II, photojournalists Lee Miller and David E. Scherman recognized the bathtub as a site where power could be subverted and monopolized through photography. On April 30, 1945, the day Munich was liberated from Nazi rule, Miller and Scherman entered Hitler's empty apartment and photographed Miller in his bathtub. In one photo, she sits, nude and defiant, gazing past the camera, with a framed photo of Hitler propped on the ledge behind her. Her boots, muddied with the dirt of the newly freed Dachau concentration camp, have tracked all over his bath mat. (The Nazi leader, hiding out in his Berlin bunker, would kill himself that day.)\n\nThe images' message is clear: the relations of power had changed, writes curatorial assistant Carolin Potthast in the book. The US-Americans had advanced into the enemy's most intimate sphere. They had seized it occupying it with their bodies. Here, the bathtub becomes a stage for a shift in political power.
In an emotional interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, actress Ellen Page told the host that she takes Vice President Mike Pence's views on gay marriage personally, and says she's fed up.

In case you didn't know it, sex can also make a baby. And that can be good for you. Studies show that people with kids living at home tend to have more money and are more highly educated and in better health.\n\nGood sex improves sleep, too. After orgasm, the hormones prolactin and serotonin are released, helping you feel relaxed and sleepy. Women (and some studies) argue that men receive the greater benefit.\n\nSex lowers stress and anxiety by releasing all sorts of good-for-you hormones, and that can help ward off depression, too. Studies show that men and women who have intercourse with their partners have greater satisfaction with their mental health. Unfortunately, the benefits didn't extend to masturbation.\n\nSex may help your memory, too. Men over 50 who had more sex were better at word recall and number sequencing, while older women improved only in word recall, according to a study published by Oxford University. Both did better than those who had less sex.\n\nSex can lessen pain. Studies have found that even stimulation without orgasm can reduce menstrual cramps, chronic back and leg pain, even migraines. Something to think about the next time you consider saying Not now, honey, I have a headache!\n\nYou won't look like this without hitting the gym, of course, but sex is a form of exercise, burning about 150 calories an hour. Add it to the end of your workout as a reward with benefits.\n\nRegular, frequent sex may lower the risk of prostate cancer, according to research presented to the American Urological Association. A study of 32,000 men over 18 years found that men who ejaculate at least monthly may be less likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer later in life.\n\nSex seems to be especially good for a woman's heart -- the physical one, that is. A recent study found that women who said they had frequent, extremely satisfying sex had a lower risk of hypertension, a common precursor to heart disease.\n\nSex, especially orgasm, releases the bonding hormone oxytocin, which promotes a feeling of well-being and happiness. And you don't have to act like bunnies to get the benefit; a study of 30,000 Americans over four decades found that sex at least once a week was enough to make people happy.\n\nThe health benefits of sex go way beyond the pleasures of orgasm. You get a health boost in all sorts of ways from fooling around, from lowering blood pressure to stress reduction. Read on for all the excuses you need to schedule sex tonight.\n\nStory highlights Sexual avoidance influences multiple aspects of well-being Medical problems are the main reasons for avoiding sex Many could be helped by simple conversations with their doctors\n\nSex has a strong influence on many aspects of well-being: it is one of our most basic physiological needs. Sex feeds our identity and is a core element of our social life.\n\nBut millions of people spend at least some of their adulthood not having sex. This sexual avoidance can result in emotional distress, shame and low self-esteem – both for the individual who avoids sex and for the partner who is rejected.\n\nYet while our society focuses a lot on having sex, we do not know as much about not having it.\n\nAs a researcher of human behavior who is fascinated by how sex and gender interact, I have found that sexual avoidance influences multiple aspects of our well-being. I also have found that people avoid sex for many different reasons, some of which can be easily addressed.\n\nThe more sex the merrier?\n\nPeople who have more sex report higher self-esteem, life satisfaction and quality of life. In contrast, lower frequency of sex and avoiding sex are linked to psychological distress, anxiety, depression and relationship problems.\n\nIn his landmark work, Alfred Kinsey found that up to 19 percent of adults do not engage in sex. This varies by gender and marriage status, with nearly no married males going without sex for a long duration.\n\nWhy men and women lie about sex and how this complicates STD control\n\nOther research also confirms that women more commonly avoid sex than men. In fact, up to 40 percent of women avoid sex some time in their lives. Pain during sex and low libido are big issues.\n\nThe gender differences start early. More teenage females than teenage males abstain from sex.\n\nWomen also are more likely to avoid sex because of childhood sexual abuse. Pregnant women fear miscarriage or harming the fetus – and can also refuse sex because of lack of interest and fatigue.\n\nThe most common reasons for men avoiding sex are erectile dysfunction, chronic medical conditions and lack of opportunity.\n\nMedical problems top the list\n\nFor both men and women, however, our research and the work of others have shown that medical problems are the main reasons for sex avoidance.\n\nFor example, heart disease patients often avoid sex because they are afraid of a heart attack. Other research has shown the same for individuals with cerebrovascular conditions, such as a stroke.\n\nChronic pain diminishes the pleasure of the sexual act and directly interferes by limiting positions. The depression and stress it causes can get in the way, as can certain medications for chronic pain.\n\nThink you're not having enough sex? Try being a senior in assisted living\n\nMetabolic conditions such as diabetes and obesity reduce sexual activity. In fact, diabetes hastens sexual decline in men by as much as 15 years. Large body mass and poor body image ruin intimacy, which is core to the opportunity for having sex.\n\nPersonality disorders, addiction and substance abuse and poor sleep quality all play major roles in sexual interest and abilities.\n\nMany medications, such as antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs, reduce libido and sexual activity, and, as a result, increase the risk of sexual avoidance.\n\nFinally, low levels of testosterone for men and low levels of dopamine and serotonin in men and women can play a role.\n\nSocial and emotional factors – and consequences\n\nFor both genders, loneliness reduces the amount of time spent with other people and the opportunity for interactions with others and intimacy. Individuals who are lonely sometimes replace actual sexual relations with the use of pornography. This becomes important as pornography may negatively affect sexual performance over time.\n\nDoctors don't talk to their patients about sexual health; here's why they should\n\nMany older adults do not engage in sex because of shame and feelings of guilt or simply because they think they are too old for sex. However, it would be wrong to assume that older adults are not interested in engaging in sex.\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nFew people talk with their doctors about their sexual problems. Indeed, at least half of all medical visits do not address sexual issues.\n\nEmbarrassment, cultural and religious factors, and lack of time may hold some doctors back from asking about the sex lives of their patients. Some doctors feel that addressing sexual issues creates too much closeness to the patient. Others think talking about sexuality will take too much time.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nYet while some doctors may be afraid to ask about sex with patients, research has shown that patients appear to be willing to provide a response if asked. This means that their sexual problems are not being addressed unless the doctor brings it up.\n\nPatients could benefit from a little help. To take just one example, patients with arthritis and low back pain need information and advice from their health care provider about recommended intercourse positions so as to avoid pain.\n\nThe Don't ask, don't tell culture should become Do ask, do tell.\n\nShervin Assari is research investigator of psychiatry, public health and poverty solutions at the University of Michigan.
Story highlights Barre workouts include stretches and strength-training exercises performed at a ballet barre Decades ago, barre's creator wanted to advance what she called the state of sex\n\n(CNN) —\n\nHere's what I remember about my first barre class: The workout was so grueling it made my muscles twitch as I lay on my back, rhythmically thrusting my pelvis to a sensual cover of Rihanna's Umbrella. Beyond the thrusting itself, I was struck by the expressions of the spandex-clad women beside me, who seemed entirely unamused by the synchronized schwing we performed. All around me, everyone was taking their air-humping very, very seriously.\n\nBarre, a fitness phenomenon based on stretches and strength-training exercises performed at a ballet barre, has exploded in recent years. The workout is as challenging as it is effective at sculpting women's bodies — its enthusiasts are known for being physical overachievers who are already fit but nevertheless driven to chisel themselves to perfection.\n\nIt's the pretty girl workout, a friend recently told me, with nearly every woman in class covered in Lululemon, no sweatpants in sight. But the moves of the workout itself belie this prim ethos. From the pelvic tucking, in which you roll your groin forward, to the seated ab work, where you sit with legs spread and bent, to the knee dancing, which is what it sounds like, the class can feel like an hour-long rehearsal for sex.\n\nWhat today has become a mass commercial fitness trend – a straitlaced subculture in which butts are called seats – was once a radical, decidedly erotic practice.\n\nBut barre classes rarely draw attention to the workout's sexual undertones – or to the fact that its tucks and thrusts can, as many instructors will privately admit, bring very real improvements to women's sex lives. Sex is altogether absent from the experience. It's kind of like this weird elephant in the room, my friend M., a 20-something barre obsessive who lives in San Francisco, told me. No one talks about it. But after you've done barre for like four days in a row, you're not going to lie there like a dead fish during sex. You feel like a strong woman who's like, rawwwr, you know? Still, barre studios sell strength – or long, lean muscles and a ballet body – not stronger orgasms.\n\nExercising in nature may hold unique benefits for the depressed\n\nThis lack of acknowledgment isn't an oversight. When Burr Leonard, who founded the popular national barre studio Bar Method in 2001, trained to become a barre instructor in 1990, she says she was explicitly told not to call attention to the workout's sexiness or sexual benefits. It was kind of a finger to the lips about sex, she told me in a phone interview. It was yes, but you just don't mention it. And when I reached out to Pure Barre, the country's largest barre franchise, for this article, its founder declined to speak with me after learning I wanted to talk about the connection between barre and sex. But why the reticence? Why not call a Kegel a Kegel?\n\nIt wasn't always this way. The secret most barre studios don't promote – and one many instructors don't even know themselves – is that barre's origins are deeply sexual. Barre's creator, Lotte Berk, a free-love revolutionary who began teaching the regimen in 1959, specifically wanted to advance what she called the state of sex by encouraging women to pursue sex for their own pleasure. And in the post–sexual revolution 1970s, women's magazines pitched the workout as a way for women to do just that – or as Cosmopolitan put it, to build sexual confidence and competence. What today has become a mass commercial fitness trend – a straitlaced subculture in which butts are called seats – was once a radical, decidedly erotic practice.\n\nBad news if you want to lose weight without exercise\n\nBerk, a German-Jewish dancer who fled the Nazis for London after they forbade her from performing, originally invented the workout that would become barre to recover from a back injury. Over time, she found that her special combination of ballet moves, yoga, and rehabilitative exercises helped her not only to heal and hold onto her dancer's figure, but also to get more pleasure from sex. And sex was important to her. As her daughter, Esther Fairfax, told me in a phone interview: Sex came into everything she did. You know, you felt sex from her. (In her 2010 memoir My Improper Mother and Me, Fairfax writes about Berk's passionate, tumultuous, decades-long open marriage to her father and her many lovers. She had such a natural instinct to flirt, to play the coquette … How quick she was to bed them. How quick she was to throw them out. She was a natural predator with a killer streak.) After refining her workout, Berk opened a small basement studio on Manchester Street and soon attracted a celebrity clientele, from legendary Irish writer Edna O'Brien to Bond girl Britt Ekland.\n\nHow exercise could make you more resilient to mental fatigue\n\nFrom the start, Berk's classes and her sex life were intertwined. She talked about her love affairs while she taught. She named her exercises The Prostitute and Naughty Bottoms. One move was simply called The Sex. Perhaps most famously, she is rumored to have told clients, If you can't tuck, you can't f***. And her clients loved her for it.\n\nThis was nothing short of radical. In the 1960s, the modern fitness industry was still in its infancy and the few regimens that existed prioritized finding and pleasing a husband, explains historian Shelly McKenzie, author of the book Getting Physical: The Rise of Fitness Culture in America. Berk encouraged women to please themselves — an attitude that complemented and contributed to the brewing sexual revolution. This was very, very different, Fairfax, now 83 and living in Berkshire, England, told me of her mom's studio, It liberated women to show them, 'I can be sexy as well. It's not just the men that want sex.'\n\nThen, about a decade after the studio first opened, a plucky Midwestern globetrotter named Lydia Bach found her way to Berk's studio. Bach became hooked and saw the potential in bringing the workout to America. She bought the rights to franchise, and in 1971, opened the Lotte Berk Method studio on 67th Street and Madison Avenue in New York City. Her client list included a slate of the era's stars – Love Story actress Ali MacGraw, Candice Bergen, and famed book editor Nan Talese.\n\n12 people on running as therapy\n\nIn New York, Bach carried on Lotte's legacy of sexual frankness into the workout. In a 1972 New York Times article about the studio, Bach described the method as a combination of modern ballet, yoga, orthopedic exercise and sex. In her 1973 exercise book Awake! Aware! Alive! – Bach devotes the entire last chapter to sex. All of the exercises in this book are important for sex, she advises. The press was all over this angle. In a feature on Bach's book, Cosmopolitan gushed in the headline, Exercise Your Way to a Better Sex Life!\n\nSo what changed? Eventually, as the wider culture shifted, so did barre. From the mid-1970s into the '80s, with the rise of women's liberation, the idea that women enjoyed sex became less revelatory. For entrepreneurs, selling visible muscles and physical perfection became lucrative. Jane Fonda brought aerobics to the masses, and co-ed gyms became more popular. Americans started to view their bodies more like machines. [The Lotte Berk Method] did make women strong, very fast, says Burr Leonard, who began taking classes at the studio in the early 1980s. And so the studio doubled down on that. In a blog post about barre's history, Leonard explains, By the '80s the innocent idea that sex could be a path to freedom and enlightenment had run its course. Women had tasted strength and realized there was more to exercise than sex.\n\nBach says that throughout the '80s, the workout lost some of its sensual flavor and became more sleekly standardized. It's a business to a lot of people – it wasn't a business to me, she told me. In the decades that followed, she would help train nearly all of the women who'd go on to open today's biggest barre franchises, from Exhale and Physique 57 to Pure Barre and Bar Method. By the time Burr Leonard became a certified instructor in 1990, barre had gone from subversive to staid.\n\nHow to get a dancer's body\n\nToday's barre enthusiasts, who range from college-aged to grandmothers and are willing to pay $20 to $40 per class, say they don't always want to feel sexual while working out. I know if, during training, I had been told to behave like a prostitute at any point, I would probably have never become an instructor, one New York City barre teacher who has taught at two different studios told me. I bristle at the idea that sex would be the end goal simply because I want to think of myself as more than a sexual being. Burr Leonard agreed. To make too much of the sexual aspect – frankly, it becomes boring, she told me. People want to go into class and they want to focus on form. I don't think they want to really be told again and again how good it is for your sexual health.\n\nAnd of course, even without being an explicit sex-workout, you can still reap the sexual benefits of barre – from increased pelvic floor strength to increased stamina – even if no one's talking about sex during class. I think if we were all pelvic thrusting, holding onto the barre, and the instructor was like, 'This will be so great when you're having sex later!' everyone would immediately get uncomfortable, my friend M. told me. When Lotte Berk first introduced women to her workout in the '60s, the class's sexual openness felt thrilling, and empowering, because it was taboo. Now, more than 50 years after the sexual revolution, women seem to feel that turning a rigorous strength-training workout into something overtly sexual is gratuitous. I want that hour to myself for my peace and my well-being and my mental health, Leonard told me, echoing the feelings of other women I spoke with. I think that's what it does most powerfully.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nStill, at least one franchise owner is actively working to bring the sex back. Pop Physique founder Jennifer Williams told me she laments that barre studios today feel beige. She wants her studios, based mostly in Los Angeles and New York, to feel more electric. Unlike other franchise owners, she makes a point of teaching her instructors about barre's sexed-up history. Indeed, Pop Physique's first ad campaign was inspired by the photos in Awake! Aware! Alive!, and the brand's website is the only one to directly promote barre's sexual benefits. A hotter sex life … the site coyly promises. Well, that's what we've heard.

The child started crying and hugged Francis and whispered his question into the pope's ears, saying he was afraid that his father, who was an atheist, could not go to heaven. Francis comforted Emanuele and said that it is God who decides who goes to heaven and that, since God has a 'dad's heart', he will not abandon the boy's dad, even if he was not a believer.

It has since gained 22 more signatures and was released to the public on Saturday. In a press release, the organizers say they speak for a large number of clergy and lay Catholics who lack freedom of speech.\n\nThe letter does not accuse the Pope himself of being a heretic, but of supporting heretical positions on marriage, the moral life and the Eucharist.\n\nFrancis has not responded to the letter publicly and the Vatican declined to comment.\n\n01:48 - Source: CNN Pope may be open to married men as priests\n\nThe letter's organizers call their challenge a filial correction of the Pope by his spiritual sons and daughters.\n\nChurch law itself requires that competent persons not remain silent when the pastors of the Church are misleading the flock, the conservative Catholic clergy and scholars said.\n\nSpecifically, the letter charges Francis with promoting seven heresies, most notably through his openness to allowing some divorced and remarried Catholics to receive Holy Communion.\n\nScandal concerning faith and morals has been given to the Church and to the world, the letter states. It accuses the Pope of imposing strange doctrines on the faithful, and asks him to publicly correct his teachings.\n\nThe lightning rod for complaints is the Pope's 2016 document, Amoris Laetitia – which has opened the possibility for some divorced and remarried Catholics to receive communion – and the differing interpretations of the document, which conservatives say have sown confusion among Catholics.\n\nA press release accompanying the letter calls it an epoch-making act, with no precedent since 1333. That may be true, Catholic historians say, but likely overstates the letter's actual significance. A number of the signees are members of a traditionalist group that has already broken away from the Catholic Church.\n\nStill, the heresy charge crystallizes some conservatives' deep anxieties about Pope Francis, especially his teachings and impromptu statements about how to apply centuries-old Catholic doctrine to the complexities of modern life.\n\nLast year, four cardinals, in a letter known as a Dubia, asked the Pope to clarify some of the same points raised by the Catholic scholars and priests.\n\nPope Francis has not responded to that letter, either.\n\n01:16 - Source: CNN Catholic church: Santa Muerte is a 'satanic cult'\n\nWho's behind the heresy charge?\n\nNone of the heresy letter's signees are cardinals or bishops in good standing within the Catholic church. The most prominent is Bishop Bernard Fellay, the head of the Society of St. Pius X, a traditionalist group which broke away from the Vatican under Pope John Paul II over doctrinal issues.\n\nIn some ways, Fellay's participation is curious. As the letter's organizers note, Francis has sought to welcome the conservative Society of St. Pius X, provided they agree to certain church teachings.\n\nEttore Gotti Tedeschi, former president of the Vatican bank, is also a signee.\n\nJoseph Shaw, one of the organizers of the letter and a professor of philosophy at Oxford University, said that he hopes the Pope will answer the letter, but that it wasn't written for his eyes only.\n\nPope Francis may be determined not to answer this, but it's not to say that bishops and cardinals aren't able to absorb it, he said. We have to press this problem on to people who can ultimately address them.\n\nIf people become convinced that what he is doing is a grave mistake, the machine will seize up, he continued. There will be a reluctance to implement what he is doing.\n\nPublic spats and division followed the 2016 publication of the Amoris Laetitia, which resulted in different bishops around the world offering different interpretations of the teaching.\n\nFor example, Cardinal Kevin Farrell, an American newly appointed to a top Vatican office by Francis last year, has publicly disagreed with Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput, about whether divorced and remarried Catholics can receive Communion.\n\nBishops conferences from Malta, Argentina, Poland, Germany and elsewhere have also weighed in with different interpretations of the Pope's ruling.\n\nConservatives contest that the Pope is tinkering with what is written in the Bible and has been affirmed throughout centuries in the Catholic Church on marriage: that a divorced person who is remarried without an annulment may not receive communion, because the second marriage is considered adulterous.\n\nYou can have a diversion of pastoral practice on some things, says Shaw. But you can't have variation on whether marriage is indissoluble; you can't have variation on whether you can receive communion.\n\nFrancis' supporters say the Pope is not changing doctrine, but updating the practice of how the Catholic Church can meet the realities of today's families.\n\nWe need to not just criticize, we need to say what our teaching is – and that's not just a yes and no answer, Farrell told Catholic News Agency.\n\n01:17 - Source: CNN Is Peter the most important apostle?\n\nWhat's next?\n\nIt is no surprise that there is resistance to change within the Catholic Church, which claims a tradition of uninterrupted teachings since the time of Christ. The question is whether Francis can hold together the church's left and right flanks while implementing reforms in how the church applies those teachings.\n\nMonsignor Robert Wister, a professor of church history at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, said he can't recall anything similar to the heresy letter in recent times. Pope John XXII was rebuked in the 1330s for teaching that the souls of the dead do not see the face of God until the Last Judgment.\n\nBut it's really hard to make a comparison, he said. Nine hundred years ago, most Catholics were illiterate. Now everybody is on Twitter.\n\nSo what effect will the heresy letter have on Francis' papacy?\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, it will fuel some of the more extreme anti-Francis websites, Wister said. And I think it will encourage various priests and bishops who do not like his pastoral direction.\n\nBut, if you look in the pews or even at polls, most people like Francis, he said. They see in him a compassion they have not seen in the church, an understanding of the very difficult reality of living in this very complicated world.
2 of 68\n\nSue Ogrocki/Associated Press\n\nStrengths: Size, athleticism, tenacity.\n\nWeaknesses: Height, fit 'n' finish.\n\nThe Giants allowed 34 sacks last season; not a bad total until you realize that Eli Manning was so worried about his protection that he took every snap and got rid of the football like it was fresh out of a glassblower's kiln. The Giants overhauled their line by adding Nate Solder (can't argue with that move), letting Bobby Hart, Weston Richburg and Justin Pugh walk (wait: Those last two guys were pretty good!) and trying to trade Ereck Flow … (giggle, snort) … trying to trade Ereck Flow … (uncontrollable paroxysms of laughter) … trying to trade that beer vendor they lined up at left tackle last year.\n\nWill Hernandez ran his combine 40-yard dash at 327 pounds in 5.15 seconds. That's every bit as uncanny a size-speed combination as Saquon Barkley's, but it didn't get much attention because a) it's hard to process just how different running at 327 pounds is from running at 227 or 187 pounds; and b) no one cares about lineman 40 times anyway.\n\nThe typical 327-pound guard prospect—and Hernandez probably played at closer to 340 pounds—is a hulking mass of meat capable of flattening anything in a direct path in front of him but not much else. Hernandez is indeed capable of smushing anyone lined up helmet-to-helmet against him. But what stands out on tape is Hernandez's ability to switch defenders when they stunt in front of him and to quickly establish position and pin defenders to the outside. Hernandez has quick eyes and shockingly quick feet for a man his size, making him a safe selection and a good fit in a variety of schemes.\n\nHernandez lacks the height to move to tackle and could use some technical refinement. But he would be the top guard in a typical draft class. This one just happens to be loaded with excellent guards.\n\nThe Giants got the best player on the board at a need position. Their offense will have a new look this year, and it is shaping up to be pretty sweet.\n\nGrade: A

(CNN) Robert De Niro reserves his right to speak up, so that's exactly what he did in his SAG Awards speech on Sunday night.\n\nWhile accepting his lifetime achievement award, the legendary actor voiced his support for his union and called on voters to look for candidates who support unions themselves.\n\nPolitical leaders who support unions are more likely to support affordable care act, equitable taxes, humane immigration regulations, a safe environment, a diverse citizenry, reproductive rights, sensible gun control and fair wages and benefits, he said. We owe them our support and we owe them our vote.\n\nDe Niro stopped short of announcing his own endorsement on stage.\n\nI can imagine some of you are saying, 'All right, all right, let's not get into the politics,' but we're, we're in such a dire situation, so deeply concerning to me and to so many others, I have to say something, he added.\n\nRead More

Washington (CNN) Ivanka Trump on Wednesday commemorated the first anniversary of her signature policy, the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, with the unveiling of upcoming bipartisan legislation to support her efforts. However, the initiative drew criticism from advocates who see it as dissonant from the Trump administration's broader global women's policies.\n\nSpeaking at a State Department event -- which featured a lengthy roster of Trump administration officials and lawmakers -- the presidential adviser and first daughter announced the forthcoming introduction of the W-GDP Act into the House and Senate.\n\nIt will be written and introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, in the Senate. A companion bill will be introduced in the House by Reps. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, and Rep. Lois Frankel, a Florida Democrat, Ms. Trump said.\n\nShaheen, who appeared at Wednesday's event at the State Department and is co-authoring the W-GDP legislation, has worked to try to repeal the Mexico City Policy , also known as the Global Gag Rule, which the Trump administration has expanded.\n\nThe move curtailed US funding to overseas aid groups and health organizations that provide or promote abortion services or to those organizations that give funding to such groups.\n\nRead More
Written by CNN Staff\n\nIt was only mid-afternoon in LA when stars arrived for Sunday's Screen Actors Guild Awards, but the glamorous evening wear was already out in force.\n\nVoted for by the 160,000 members of the SAG-AFTRA union, the awards ceremony brought some of the biggest stars of film and TV onto its signature silver carpet. And they, in turn, wore statement gowns and chic accessories for the occasion.\n\nAmong the most eye-catching fashions were Harriet nominee Cynthia Erivo in fuchsia and Big Little Lies star Kathryn Newton, who stunned in an orange gown by Valentino, her ruffled shoulders offsetting a deep neckline. Scarlett Johansson meanwhile impressed in a teal custom design by Armani Privé, which showed off her back tattoos beneath embellished straps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 26 Marriage Story and Jojo Rabbit star Scarlett Johansson wears a plunging teal gown to the SAG Awards.

Lupita Nyong'o impressed in a custom Louis Vuitton dress embellished with over 30,000 sequins and crystals, while Jennifer Lopez was a picture of elegance in a strapless gown by Lebanese designer Georges Hobeika. Nicole Kidman went for more classic Hollywood glamour in a sparkling midnight blue creation by Michael Kors.\n\nThere were plenty of accessories on display too -- from Jenna Lyng Adams' butterfly-inspired earrings to Margaret Qualley's statement broach.

Among the Thrones actors, Gwendoline Christie stood out in a voluminous black number, as did Nathalie Emmanuel in a patterned Miu Miu gown with an outsized bow.\n\nThe young stars of Stranger Things also impressed with their fashion choices, with 17-year-old Gaten Matarazzo looking especially dapper in dark blue.

Return to Transcripts main page\n\nNEW DAY\n\nTrump in Growing Legal & Political Peril from Court Filings; John Kelly Leaving as White House Chief of Staff; British PM Theresa May Pull Brexit Vote Tomorrow; Can a Sitting President Be Indicted? Aired 7-7:30a ET\n\nAired December 10, 2018 - 07:00 ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\nANNOUNCER: This is NEW DAY with Alisyn Camerota and John Berman.\n\n\n\n[07:00:04] JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning, and welcome to your NEW DAY. It isn't clear that the president, any president, has been in a situation like this before.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump's own Justice Department says the president directed someone to break the law and gives every indication he would be charged with a federal crime, were he not president. The incoming chair of the House Judiciary Committee calls these impeachable offenses. So the stakes this morning, they're flat-out different and bigger than the president has yet seen.\n\n\n\nSo this is what we know. Federal prosecutors allege the president instructed Cohen to pay hush money during the campaign to two women who claim they had affairs with then-candidate Trump. Michael Cohen also spoke to a Russian offering political synergy -- political synergy -- in November of 2015, but he did not take the meeting, because he already had another connection to the Kremlin.\n\n\n\nWe now know that Michael Cohen is one of at least 14 associates to Donald Trump who interacted with the Russians during the campaign and presidential transition. That's according to analysis done by The Washington Post.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: OK. And prosecutors say that Cohen also lied about those negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow and discussed the project with then-candidate Trump well into the 2016 election.\n\n\n\nBut wait. There's more. Paul Manafort also lied about his contacts with the White House. Prosecutors say they have messages showing that Paul Manafort was talking to people in the administration earlier this year, even after his 2017 indictment. And he lied about his contacts with a Russian operative who has ties to the military intelligence agency that is suspected of hacking the DNC.\n\n\n\nBERMAN: While all this is going on, there's a shake-up at the highest levels of the White House, maybe not coincidentally. The president announced the chief of staff, John Kelly, is out by the end of the month. And the person who was the frontrunner to replace him, the one that the president had his eye on, was Vice President Pence's chief of staff, Nick Ayers, who now says he doesn't want the job. So much to discuss this morning. Joining us now, CNN political\n\n\n\nanalyst David Gregory; former federal prosecutor and CNN legal analyst Laura Coates; and author of The Threat Matrix: Inside Robert Mueller's FBI and the Global War on Terror, Garrett Graff.\n\n\n\nGarrett, I want to start with you. People who were not here last hour did not see you lay this out, but you call this the worst-case scenario for America, approaching that. Explain why.\n\n\n\nGARRETT GRAFF, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, what we now know from Friday is not just that Russian intelligence targeted the Trump campaign, which has been coming clear for some time now. It's that that contact was both started earlier, extended longer, and was more extensive than we realized.\n\n\n\nAs you said, at least 14 different Trump associates were involved in contacts with Russians over the course of the 2016 campaign and transition.\n\n\n\nAnd the only question we are now in -- this is where I believe we're sort of already in the worst-case scenario -- and the question is how bad is it? The only question left is how extensive was that contact? How much coordination was there? And just how many Trump people were actually involved?\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: David, when you look at the little threads that we've all been following for the past two years, you know, take in individually, each of them are sort of head scratchers.\n\n\n\nAnd then when you take them in totality, which is what happened over the weekend, where you see there where we have the graphic of the 14 Trump associates -- close Trump associates, top campaign people, top transition people, I mean, we're talking Jared; we're talking Ivanka; we're talking Don Junior. We're talking the campaign chairman.\n\n\n\nI mean, in totality, the Russians reached out to at least 14 close associates of Donald Trump. It starts to not look coincidental. It starts to look as if maybe people on the Trump team didn't know what Russia was trying to do, but they were being manipulated because Russia was clearly doing something intentional.\n\n\n\nGREGORY: Right. And what do we know at the time is -- about all of this? We know the Obama administration was worried about this, understood what was starting to happen, had their own internal debates about how and whether to speak out about it, but certainly, began pushing back on the Russians.\n\n\n\nNow that's a separate debate about whether the Obama administration should have done more, and that's a very intense debate.\n\n\n\nWhat about the culture within the Trump campaign? We know from the very top Trump thought a reset with Russia and a warmer relationship was a good idea, not a bad idea. He obviously underplayed business dealings that he'd in the past and was having in the course of the campaign over the summer. He talked about loving WikiLeaks; encouraged the Russian government to\n\n\n\nhack Hillary Clinton's e-mails and find e-mails that were missing, and that the press would reward him for such. And by the way, that opposition research on a candidate, no matter where it comes from, is great stuff, and who wouldn't want to go after that?\n\n\n\n[07:05:14] So they were open for business in the Trump campaign for those Russians who came calling. And Garrett made this point last hour. It is shocking and really inappropriate, at least that nobody in Trump's orbit said, We don't do this. You don't allow a foreign power to start to try to influence the campaign. You don't have inappropriate contacts. It's just not what's done, because it's dangerous as well as being totally inappropriate.\n\n\n\nSo that culture is what's under examination here, at least at this point.\n\n\n\nBERMAN: And what really is astounding this morning after the last three days, you take everything Garrett and David just said there, and on top of that, the Southern District of New York, which is a part of the government of the United States, the Justice Department, put in writing that the person who is now president was involved in a federal crime.\n\n\n\nLet me just put it on the screen. P1-13 here. With respect to both payments -- we're talking about the payments made to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal -- Michael Cohen acted with the intent to influence the 2016 presidential election. In particular, and as Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual 1. That's legal speak, Laura, for the president knew and directed Michael Cohen to commit a federal crime.\n\n\n\nThey're saying that of the president of the United States. That is crucial.\n\n\n\nLAURA COATES, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: It certainly is. Where have you seen before somebody who is an unindicted co-conspirator? I mean, the idea that history repeats itself in rhyme seems to be here again, from the Nixon years to now, the notion that because of that Office of Legal Counsel opinion, which remember, says that they do not want to actually indict a sitting president because of the effect on executive branch of government and the American people, perhaps, they want to delay it.\n\n\n\nWhat you have there was the Southern District of New York essentially saying, OK, we understand there's a legal opinion going on right now, but you're two years out from having, perhaps, this person not be a sitting president.\n\n\n\nAnd if you have your own Justice Department, not just the Special Counsel Robert Mueller team, which remember that filing that was given to the court by the SDNY was based on a case that had been farmed out from Mueller to them. So it was in direct connection, although Michael Cohen, generally, is the theme there. Mueller had to file a separate report to show people that he is not\n\n\n\nactually a part of the SDNY. So you have somebody who's not part of this alleged witch hunt that the president keeps talking about who separately and comprehensively has now called him a felon. And you have the effect that's going to mean. And of course, that's not stopping.\n\n\n\nAnd one thing that was important in that filing, as well, to talk about this issue, John, is the idea they said that, look, Cohen is not going to get any good favors from them, because he did not talk about things they had not been charged, things that had not yet been charged or had not been charged at all. So you see the writing is on the wall, and it says felon in the Oval Office.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: Garrett, sometimes the biggest clue is just right there, you know, in front of our -- in front of our eyes, and you don't see it until the whole puzzle comes together.\n\n\n\nAnd so I want to -- because you have followed every one of these threads so meticulously that would make the rest of our heads explode, what about Felix Sater? OK, Felix Sater, as we learned last week with this, Trump associate. He's a real-estate developer. He worked with the Trump Organization for a decade or so.\n\n\n\nAnd here is his letter on October 13, 2015, to Michael Cohen. OK? And I think that it just spells out the whole mission statement. Let's make this happen and build a Trump Moscow and possibly fix relations between the countries by showing everyone that commerce and business are much better and more practical than politics. That should be Putin's message, as well, and we will help him agree on that message. Help world peace and make a lot of money, I would say that's a great lifetime goal for us to go after.\n\n\n\nI mean, this is the mission statement of why whenever, I think, whenever people would say, Why is Donald Trump so interested in courting Vladimir Putin and Russia? And it was so confusing to people. The marriage of Let's make a lot of money, and maybe we'll solve world peace in the process.\n\n\n\nGRAFF: Yes, Felix Sater is one of the fascinating characters in this whole saga, longtime U.S. intelligence asset, actually has some previous ties from previous cases to some of the prosecutors with those working on Mueller's team right now, and by all accounts has been cooperating with this investigation for quite some time now. Which, when you add him him to Michael Cohen, which we believe we know, 70 hours in talking with Mueller's team, they sort of have this great road map of what was taking place.\n\n\n\n[07:10:10] One of the lines involving Felix Sater and this Trump Tower Moscow deal in the Friday court filings really is worth emphasizing, which is that it talks about how the Trump Tower deal would have been worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the Trump Organization.\n\n\n\nNow, that is an order of magnitude or two more than a normal Trump Tower licensing deal historically would have been worth. And so there are a lot of questions coming up over the weekend about why the special counsel chose to phrase it that way, how they know this deal would have been so abnormally lucrative to do business between Trump and Moscow and what documentary evidence the special counsel possesses, perhaps from Michael Cohen or Felix Sater, perhaps from others, about just past what the business relationship would have been on the back end.\n\n\n\nBERMAN: So it's interesting, David, because you take this is the totality, and specifically, with the idea that the SDNY thinks that the president was involved in a crime, you now have the incoming chair of the Judiciary Committee talking about all of this in just a much different way. I want to play what Jerry Nadler had to say to Jake yesterday.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nREP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY), RANKING MEMBER, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Well, they would be impeachable offenses. Whether they are important enough to justify an impeachment is a different question, but certainly, they'd be impeachable offenses, because even though they were committed before the president became president, they were committed in -- in the service of fraudulently obtaining the office. That would be the -- that would be an impeachable offense.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBERMAN: So he's not saying that he is going to open impeachment hearings. But he is saying he could, David. So take that at face value, and then add to that. That's facing this administration right now. This administration doesn't have a chief of staff.\n\n\n\nDAVID GREGORY, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Right.\n\n\n\nBERMAN: John Kelly is leaving. The guy that President Trump wanted to hire to handle this won't take the job, and he's dealing with the specter of a House judiciary chair who could, if he wanted to, start impeachment proceedings.\n\n\n\nGREGORY: Well, and I think what Nadler is saying there is I don't think we're going to jump up and down and try to impeach the president over campaign finance violations, as bald as the activity may have been, but if you start to put it together with other things that are known about the potential business relationships between the Trump Organization and Russia in an effort to undermine the election, to interfere in the election on the part of Russia, that perhaps the president and those around him knew about and actually coordinated with Russia about, I mean, that becomes a much more devastating picture.\n\n\n\nAnd you still sense the caution among Democrats. Why? Because you know there's going to be a huge response from the president and his team on all of this. The question about what the president actually knew that other people may have been up to about these contacts, which is why, for instance, among other things, that -- the Trump Tower meeting with his son becomes pretty important when they came forward and said that they had opposition against Hillary Clinton. And the chief of staff piece is so important because we know it's an\n\n\n\nimpossible job under this president. And we also know how consumed President Trump has been and certainly will be once charges -- more charges are brought and a report actually comes out. That's going to be an unstable time.\n\n\n\nBERMAN: David Gregory, Garrett Graff, Laura Coates, thank you all very much.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: Thank you.\n\n\n\nBERMAN: So we are following breaking news. There are multiple reports that British Prime Minister Theresa May is pulling the vote to exit the European Union that was scheduled for tomorrow. The European Union's top court has also ruled that Britain can unilaterally revoke its notice to leave the E.U.\n\n\n\nCNN's Nina de Santos is live outside the Parliament in London with more. Explain what exactly is going on here?\n\n\n\nNINA DE SANTOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you, John.\n\n\n\nConfusion reigns here in Westminster at the moment, because social media is awash with speculation citing cabinet ministers that Theresa May may well decide to delay that key vote, one she looks set to lose.\n\n\n\nNumber 10 Downing Street, though, fiercely pushing back on this, telling CNN about half an hour or so ago that vote still is planned to go ahead tomorrow evening.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, the Labour WICS (ph), remember the opposition party has also been briefed on these Brexit documents, largely because Theresa May needs as much support as she can from all sides of the House. They have been tweeting that they're expecting an oral statement from the prime minister on this subject later on this afternoon. So we'll have to see.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, if Theresa May does press ahead with this vote, which as I said, it looks very likely she's going to lose, the question is not so much will she win or lose but by what margin she loses.\n\n\n\nIf she manages to squeak through by losing by a very narrow margin, perhaps she can just hold onto power long enough to go back to Brussels. There's a key summit that's set to take place there later on this week and say, let's soften the language on some of the more contentious items on this sheet, in particular, that agreement over a backstop between the border of Ireland, which is in the E.U., and Northern Ireland that is still part of the U.K.\n\n\n\n[07:15:08] That's the main sticking point for M.P.'s in this house when they vote tomorrow.\n\n\n\nBut in the meantime, the European court of justice, as you pointed out, a key adjudicator on E.U. affairs, has also emboldened those who want to stop Brexit in their tracks, largely because it's decided that the U.K. can unilaterally pull itself out of the Brexit procedure and keep its current membership terms altogether. That, of course, will focus people's minds.\n\n\n\nBut the immediate question, John, is what happens in the next 24 hours, vis-a-vis whether that vote will go ahead. Back to you, Alisyn.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: Oh, my gosh, Nina. I just don't know if voters knew that they would be confronting all of these thorny issues when they voted for Brexit. Nina, thank you very much.\n\n\n\nOK, back here, can the president of the United States be indicted while in office? That's an open question. There is legal debate about it, and we get into it, next.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: For the first time, federal prosecutors are directly implicating President Trump in campaign finance law violations. This came to light in these court documents connected to the sentencing of his long-time personal attorney, Michael Cohen.\n\n\n\n[07:20:09] The president has an interesting take on the damning documents. On Twitter he writes, quote, Totally clears the President. Thank you! exclamation point.\n\n\n\nJoining us now is Neal Katyal. He's the former acting solicitor general for the United States. He's a law professor at Georgetown University.\n\n\n\nProfessor Katyal, thank you for being here. So case closed. President Trump says, totally clears the president. Is that how you see these documents?\n\n\n\nNEAL KATYAL, LAW PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: No, not exactly. I don't know if someone told President Trump last Friday it was, like, opposite day or something like that, but there's no -- that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. That is an incredibly damning document that his own Justice Department filed, essentially, against him on Friday, saying that President Trump ordered the commission of various felonies, I mean, and serious felonies.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: OK. So listen, for two years, we've been having a debate here on NEW DAY, as elsewhere on the airwaves, about whether or not a sitting president can be indicted, and as you know, there are different interpretations of the rule. What is your answer?\n\n\n\nKATYAL: So I think it's exactly the right question, and we've been debating it in kind of theoretical, like, law professor ways for a couple of years, and now we're actually getting to the point where that's the question that has to be asked. That's the question that is being asked by the Southern District of New York prosecutors right now, evidently.\n\n\n\nSo my view on this is that the Justice Department has had a strong policy that you can't indict a sitting president, but it has two ambiguities in it which are important. No. 1, what if the reason why the president won the election was the\n\n\n\nexact felonies that -- that he's under consideration for having committed? So you know, it's one thing if you commit some crime unrelated to the presidency and you might not want to give prosecutors the power to indict.\n\n\n\nBut here, the crimes go to the very essence of how he became president in the first place. So that's one problem with the, Oh, you can't indict President Trump defense.\n\n\n\nThe other is there's a difference between indictment and trial. Indictment is just the formal act of bringing charges against someone, and even if the Constitution prevents the trial, because it's distracting, because the president, you know, has so many important duties he has to attend to, which is not always true with this presidency, but normal presidents who aren't golfing all the time, you know, for those types of reasons, they may not apply to a circumstance in which just the formal act of naming the president a criminal is -- is being considered.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: OK. So just to be clear, you believe that a sitting president can be indicted but not tried while in office?\n\n\n\nKATYAL: Well, I think that the weight of constitutional authority suggests that that's exactly right. Walter Dellinger has written about this extensively, and I think we'll be, you know, hearing about that.\n\n\n\nThere's one other really important point, though, here which is that the prosecutors, according to The New York Times, have concluded that they can charge President Trump even in 2021, after he were to leave office, if he were to serve out his four-year-term. So Donald Trump knows right now --\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: But wait a second. Hold on. Sorry -- I'm sorry to interrupt you.\n\n\n\nKATYAL: -- the prosecutors have him in the crosshairs.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: But isn't the statute -- but the statute of limitations, if he were to win a second term, then the statute of limitations has passed?\n\n\n\nKATYAL: Yes, so he'd have to win a second term. Now, you know, look, I don't think that he can actually say the statute of limitations can expire anyway, because Oh, and you can't indict me during the time I'm president, because that would put him totally above the law. Ao you can't combine these two arguments.\n\n\n\nEither the statute of limitations works like it does for any other person and -- and would be told, or you can be indicted while you're in office, but you can't kind of combine these to say, Ha-ha, I'm now above the law entirely and I could, you know, shoot someone or something like that and serve out my two terms and therefore, let the statute of limitations expire. That seems like a bad argument.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: Well --\n\n\n\nKATYAL: I think the more important point here is Trump knows that he's facing some pretty strong criminal liability when he leaves office, one way or another. And, you know, even if the sitting president can't be indicted, he's got to know his future looks like its behind bars unless he cuts some sort of deal with the prosecutors.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: All right. That's a really striking statement. It's completely antithetical to what his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, believes. Rudy Giuliani believes that he has not committed any campaign finance law and, as evidence, he presents the John Edwards case.\n\n\n\nHere's what he says: The president is not implicated in campaign finance violations because, based on the John Edwards case and others, the payments are not campaign contributions. No responsible prosecutor would premise a criminal case on a questionable interpretation of the law.\n\n\n\nJohn Edwards was found not guilty of those -- you know, trying to make payments, hush-money payments, or payments to a woman with whom he'd fathered a child.\n\n\n\n[07:25:08] KATYAL: Yes, I think in my sleep, you know, I could, you now, deal with that, were I were a lawyer for the prosecutor, and Mueller has certainly got lawyers far better than me on his team.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: But why? Where does it fall apart?\n\n\n\nKATYAL: So there are lots of problems with that defense.\n\n\n\nYes, so one is the difference with Edwards. Edwards' whole defense was, Look, I didn't know anything about the payments. I had nothing to do with the payments, alike.\n\n\n\nHere you've got Michael Cohen and other evidence the prosecutors haven't brought forth yet, saying Trump directed the commission of these payments. So that's No. 1.\n\n\n\nNo. 2, the timing of the payments is totally different. Here, Trump had these two affairs in 2006, paid off these women in 2016 moments before the election, making these really -- this isn't just some ordinary campaign contribution or something like that. These are, potentially, the most significant campaign contributions ever in the history of the United States. These payoffs very well may have swung the entire election.\n\n\n\nThat's very different than payments made over a period of years, as it was in Edwards, to an individual. And that allowed Edwards to say, Well, I was doing it to protect my wife, and things like that.\n\n\n\nHere, the timing really smells and makes it look like much more it's about the campaign than it does about the president's personal life. And that's particularly so because one of the women, Stormy Daniels, had come forth back in 2011 and said some of this stuff; and Trump didn't pay anything then to protect his family or his wife or anything like that. You know, that -- the payments occurred right before the campaign -- or before the election, excuse me.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: Neal Katyal, we always appreciate getting your perspective and expertise on this. Thank you very much.\n\n\n\nKATYAL: Thank you.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: John.\n\n\n\nBERMAN: So the new Heisman Trophy winner apologizing for tweets he posted years ago. This is the second time in a week that homophobic tweets are in the national spotlight, so what's going on here? We'll discuss, next.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(CNN) Though it started as a way to provide relief to middle class families, the child tax credit has also evolved into a bipartisan tool for lifting kids out of poverty.\n\nNow, President Joe Biden and congressional Democratic leaders want to overhaul the credit, turning it into a guaranteed income stream worth hundreds of dollars a month and broadening it to help millions of low-income families who are currently excluded.\n\nThe US has one of the highest child poverty rates of any wealthy country and one of the lowest shares of national spending on children and families. Roughly 1 in 7 kids live in poverty, according to the most recent Census Bureau data. More than one-quarter of Black children and one-fifth of Hispanic children live below the poverty line.\n\nWhen the child tax credit was established in 1997 by a Republican-led Congress under former President Bill Clinton, very few low-income parents could claim it. That's because the $500 credit was non-refundable, and these families' federal income tax liability was too low.\n\nDuring the Bush and Obama administrations , the tax credit's size was doubled and it was made partially refundable so more low-income families could benefit.\n\n, with help from former President Donald Trump's daughter and adviser Then, as part of the Republican tax cut legislation in 2017 , it was doubled again and the thresholds were widened so more households closer to the bottom and to the top of the income ladder qualified. The changes were pushed by Sen. Marco Rubio, Republican of Floridawith help from former President Donald Trump's daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump\n\nAs a result, the child tax credit currently provides up to $2,000 per child under the age of 17. Single parents who earn up to $200,000 and married couples who make up to $400,000 qualify for the full credit, which phases out after those thresholds.\n\nSome 90% of families with children will receive an average credit of $2,380 in 2020, according to a non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimate.\n\nAnd the credit, along with the earned income tax credit for low- and moderate-income working families, helps nearly 12 million children escape poverty or raise them closer to the poverty line, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nLow-income families have been left out\n\nStill, 27 million children live in low-income families that receive a partial or no credit because they earn too little, according to the center. Parents must have annual income of at least $2,500 to start claiming the benefit, but the amount they receive depends on their earnings.\n\nRight now, low-income kids get the least, when they really should get the most, said Chuck Marr, the center's senior director of federal tax policy. It would help them the most.\n\nDemocrats want to make three temporary but major changes, which also were part of Biden's $1.9 trillion relief package\n\nThe credit would increase to $3,600 per child under the age of 6 and $3,000 per child age 6 through 17 for a single year, under legislation introduced in the House Monday. The full boost would be available to single parents making up to $75,000 annually and couples with incomes up to $150,000, before phasing out for higher earners.\n\nIt would become fully refundable so even the lowest-income families would qualify. And it could be paid on a monthly basis, $300 a month for each young child and $250 for each older one -- giving parents a steady stream of income to pay rent, buy groceries and handle other expenses -- instead of as a lump sum once a year, the typical way households receive tax credits.\n\nThis would lift more than 4 million children out of poverty and millions more closer to the poverty line in one fell swoop, Marr said. It gives millions of kids a better chance to live up to their potential.\n\nReps. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, Suzan DelBene of Washington and Ritchie Torres of New York also introduced standalone legislation on Monday that would continue the expanded benefit permanently.\n\nRepublicans favor the child tax credit\n\nThese provisions likely won't garner any Republican support because they are included in the larger relief package that Democratic leaders are fast-tracking through a procedure called reconciliation, which will allow them to pass it without GOP votes.\n\nBut some Republicans also support revising the child tax credit. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney last week unveiled a proposal to provide a monthly cash benefit of $350 for each young child ($4,200 annually) and $250 for each school-aged child ($3,000 annually).\n\nHe says that his plan establishes a firm national commitment to all of America's families, while promoting marriage, providing equal treatment for working and stay-at-home families and cutting child poverty by up to one-third.\n\nTo pay for his $66 billion measure, which also include changes to the earned income tax credit, Romney would eliminate several existing government assistance programs -- including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families -- and tax provisions, including the deduction for state and local taxes.\n\nSam Hammond, who helped Romney craft his proposal, recently co-authored a report titled The conservative case for a child allowance for the Niskanen Center, a centrist think tank where he serves as director of poverty and welfare policy.\n\nThe current child tax credit hasn't really been effective as an anti-poverty tool because it excludes the lowest-income households by design, he said.\n\nA universal allowance for kids would address both child poverty and family instability, said Hammond, who noted that marriage rates have fallen over the past four decades and the birth rate in 2019 hit its lowest rate in 35 years. Part of the reason is the increasing cost of housing and child care.\n\nSince parents aren't paid more than childless workers, they are at a disadvantage since they must support dependents, Hammond said. Monthly payments for kids would level the playing field.\n\nRomney's proposal would be run through the Social Security Administration, rather than the Internal Revenue Service to shift the benefit toward a monthly allowance instead of a tax credit.\n\nIt's basically Social Security for kids, Hammond said.\n\nBut other Republicans, including Rubio and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, oppose the idea of sending checks to parents, regardless of whether they have jobs and earn income.\n\nWe do not support turning the child tax credit into what has been called a 'child allowance,' paid out as a universal basic income to all parents. That is not tax relief for working parents; it is welfare assistance, the senators said in a joint statement last week.\n\nAn essential part of being pro-family is being pro-work. Congress should expand the child tax credit without undercutting the responsibility of parents to work to provide for their families, they said.

Dolapo Badmos, a Chief Superintendent and spokeswoman for the Lagos State Police Command, made the comments on her personal Instagram account, which is set to private and has 125,000 followers. PHOTO: Courtesy Dolapo Badmos' Instagram page Police official Dolapo Badmos warns on gay people to leave Nigeria or face prosecution If you're homosexually inclined, Nigeria is not a place for you, Badmos wrote last week. There is a law (Same-sex Prohibition Act) here that criminalizes homosexual clubs, associations, and organizations with penalties of up to 14yeats (sic) in jail. So if you are homosexual in nature, leave the country or face prosecution, wrote Badmos, who has attained celebrity status in the country due to her frequent social media posts. Former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan signed the controversial Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act (SSMPA) into law, despite widespread international objection. Related Article Nigeria bans same-sex marriage\n\nThose found guilty of being in a same-sex relationship face up to 14 years in jail.\n\nThe law was widely condemned by human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch at the time, as well as the then United States Secretary of State, John Kerry.\n\nBadmos' comments are the latest reminder of the challenges facing members of the LGBT community in a country where the anti-gay law enjoys broad support among its citizens.\n\nAccording to a survey of 2,000 individuals conducted by The Initiative for Equal Rights (TIERs), a Nigeria-based human rights organization, about 90% of Nigerians support the continued enforcement of the SSMPA.\n\nFollowing her post, Badmos received scores of comments, with most of them expressing support for the proposed prosecution of gay people living in Nigeria.\n\nIt is illegal and ungodly, one user wrote.\n\nAnother user said, we must say no to lesbianism and homosexuality it's evil.\n\nBadmos did not respond to CNN's requests for clarification on her comments.\n\nA spokesman for Lagos State police declined to comment and referred the inquiry back to Badmos.\n\nOlumide Makanjuola, executive director at TIERs, told CNN the Instagram post is tantamount to inciting violence against LGBTQ people in Nigeria, calling her comments unacceptable.\n\nPolice should be wary with their statement and if they incite violence. What she said is out of line, Makanjuola said.\n\nHomophobia is widespread in many African countries.\n\nMore than half of the countries on the continent have enacted laws that make it illegal to be gay and in several, including Somalia and South Sudan, homosexuality is punishable by death.\n\nA 2013 Pew Research survey found that 98% of people in Nigeria believe LGBTQ people should not be accepted by society.\n\nHowever, a 2017 survey by NOI Polls commissioned by TIERs showed a seven percent increase in the acceptance rates of LGBTQ people in Nigeria when compared to a similar survey from two years earlier.\n\nMany of the people who commented under Badmos' post also singled out an openly transgender individual, who is prominent on social media, and called for their arrest.
News reports that Kobe Bryant is dead.\n\nI didn't believe it.\n\nI. Still. Don't. Believe. It.\n\nFor the past two years, I've been researching and writing a book about the 1996-04 Lakers -- aka the Shaq-Kobe-Phil years. When a writer digs deep into a project and devotes the majority of his days and hours to understanding a group of people, the idea that one of the individuals might suddenly cease to exist ... well, it makes no sense. It just doesn't compute, in the way JFK's death didn't compute for my parents; in the way Len Bias' death didn't compute for me at age 14.\n\nSo, again, I still don't believe it.\n\nThe Kobe Bryant of my book is a complex figure -- perhaps the most multifaceted athlete I've chronicled since my Walter Payton biography of a decade ago. He's far more than the NBA's fourth all-time leading scorer. Far more than the five NBA titles and 18 All-Star nods. Coming out of Pennsylvania's Lower Merion High in 1996, he entered the NBA Draft with a cockiness that was equal parts offputting (Kobe Bryant has decided to skip college and take his talents to the NBA, he said at a press conference inside the school gym) and remarkable. A prep teammate told me the story of a young Kobe doing sprints on a 95-degree Fahrenheit day, then sitting inside a car with the heat blasting -- just to build his endurance.\n\nUpon joining the Lakers, he arrived in Los Angeles knowing (not just believing -- but knowing) he was the best player on the team. Really, the league. Which was simply untrue. These were the Lakers of Shaquille O'Neal and Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. Bryant, meanwhile, was raw and untested. His defensive skills were poor. His shot selection was maddening. He liked to pass as much as he liked to eat cardboard (he did not like eating cardboard).\n\nYet he possessed something few had witnessed before. Namely, a complete, total lack of self-doubt. Bryant would shoot. He would miss. He would shoot again. In Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Western Conference Finals at Utah, Bryant infamously uncorked four air balls in the late stages of a 98-93 loss. It was the type of performance that has ruined many a young athlete. Yet that night, shortly after the Lakers' plane landed in Los Angeles, Bryant headed to nearby Palisades High to launch jumper after jumper until the sun rose.\n\nUnlike Laker teammate O'Neal, his equally famous -- but much more gregarious teammate -- Bryant didn't concern himself with comradery, or clubbing or bowling with pals. Once, O'Neal treated the entire roster to a fancy meal at a seafood restaurant on the road. Bryant arrived 30 minutes late, armed with headphones and a book, and found his own table. Another time, he ran into one of his teammates, veteran Robert Horry, at an eatery, and was shocked to see him nursing a beer. Bob, he said, how can you drink the night before we play? Horry was dumbfounded. The game was 24 hours away -- and it was the preseason. That, said Rick Fox, the longtime Laker, was just Kobe. He didn't always get it.\n\nO'Neal dreamed of serving as Bryant's big brother. Bryant didn't want a big brother. Or big uncle. Or someone to confide in. His favorite movie -- watched repeatedly on flights -- was The Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston. His favorite pastime was jotting hip-hop lyrics into a pad. Unlike far too many athletes, he was constantly considering what would come after the game ended. He had plans -- big plans. To be a mogul. To be a forward thinker. To be a leader.\n\nHe was famously accused of raping a Colorado hotel clerk in 2003, and the ensuing legal drama often felt O.J. Simpson-esque in scale and magnitude. For many, it seemed to signify the end of Kobe Bryant as a spokesperson, as a hero, as a star. Even after the case was settled out of court. How would anyone ever cheer for Kobe Bryant again? How would anyone believe in him?\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nYet -- they did. As Bryant's career wound toward its conclusion several years ago, the star who seemed to only crave victory and self-glory started to lighten up. He would laugh, joke, engage, poke, prod. He goofed around with teammates; made fun of his old legs and declining skills. Marriage, clearly, had been great for him, as had the births of his four daughters. He was, despite reports to the contrary, human. And increasingly self-aware.\n\nAnd now, at age 41, he is gone, alongside Gigi, the 13-year-old daughter he coached.\n\nJust when life was getting good.
(CNN) — Most people don't document vacations with an $8,000 souped-up drone.\n\nTim Browning is not most people.\n\nHis day job involves working as a concept artist and art director on blockbuster movie sets, including Spectre, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Skyfall.\n\nHis work as a drone operator for National Geographic and BBC means he specializes in getting the best possible equipment to some of the world's most remote destinations\n\nIt comes as no surprise that his side gig is equally cool. As a drone cameraman for Black Tomato , an adventure tour operator that creates tailor-made vacations, Browning tags along on people's holidays five or six times a year.\n\nFirst, he films trips to places such as Myanmar, New Zealand and Argentina with his super fancy drone, which tilts and pans independently, holds a DSLR camera and has a slew of high-tech flight modes to get just the right shot.\n\nNext, he edits the broadcast-quality footage. When travelers return home, he sends them a slick, cinematic mini-movie.\n\nThe sky's the limit\n\nA Black Tomato drone over Langjökull Glacier, Iceland Courtesy Tim Browning/Black Tomato\n\nFor some, it's the ultimate vacation souvenir and the perfect way to continue reliving vacation memories over and over again.\n\nFor others, it's about having incredible footage to share on social media. Half the fun of going on holiday, after all, is sharing stories after the fact.\n\nEither way, besides getting blockbuster-quality footage, the other major benefit of having a professional along is that you get sit back and enjoy it all without digging out your phone every 10 minutes.\n\nThe pricey version\n\nBlack Tomato's shot in Mergui Archipelago, Myanmar Courtesy Tim Browning/Black Tomato\n\nBlack Tomato's Drone the World service allows guests to capture the highlights of a trip via a drone photographer, filming guests spending time in exotic locales doing exotic things like snowmobiling across Iceland's Langjökull Glacier, driving 4x4s through Mongolia's Gobi Desert and mastering the art of kung fu in Luoyang, China.\n\nHave your own idea in mind?\n\nThere's a good chance Black Tomato can figure out how to make it happen, whether it's a marriage proposal on top of a mountain or a 60th birthday shindig spent on a private yacht in Myanmar, as long as it's a destination that allows drones to operate.\n\nSounds pricey, right? It is.\n\nBlack Tomato trips start from about $2,800 per person, and an average 10-day trip starts at approximately $6,000 per person. Tack on the drone option for an additional $5,500, which includes Browning as a tag-along guest. But more moderately priced options can be arranged, too, if you don't want to shell out that much money.\n\nStealth-mode photo shoots\n\nSilvia Falcomer with Flytographer snapped pictures of this family in Amsterdam. Courtesy Silvia Falcomer/Flytographer\n\nIf you'd prefer to focus on photos rather than video, companies like Flytographer are the way to go.\n\nFlytographer connects travelers with local photographers in more than 200 cities around the world and will arrange planned or stealth-mode photo shoots (in the event that you want to surprise someone special) starting at $250 for a 30-minute session.\n\nTravelers meet up with a local photographer, and the camera starts clicking. Five days after the shoot, an online gallery of edited photos appears in your inbox.\n\nMost customers are celebrating an occasion such as a surprise proposal, honeymoon, anniversary or multi-generation family trip, says Nicole Smith, Flytographer founder and CEO. We are also seeing an increase in solo travelers.\n\nSo far they've racked up more than 10,000 shoots and planned more than 1,200 proposals globally. Like Black Tomato, it's all customizable.\n\nFor instance, when a couple asked if they could incorporate penguins in their Cape Town photoshoot, Flytographer managed to get the beloved flightless birds in the background.\n\nAnd when an opera singer wanted to propose in Milan by pretending to be a street performer in front of the Duomo, they captured all of that, too.\n\nWhile people are becoming more comfortable taking their own still photography and footage on their phones and cameras, we have seen a desire from clients to professionally capture their adventures, says Tom Marchant, Black Tomato co-founder.\n\nDIY droning\n\nDrone operator Dirk Dallas captures this shot in Imperial County, California Courtesy Dirk Dallas/From Where I Drone\n\nFor those who'd still prefer to do it themselves, the good news is: Drones are more affordable these days and easy to travel with.\n\nSome are so small, in fact, they can fit easily in a jacket pocket.\n\nThat said, it comes as no surprise then that the high-flying gadgets are more popular than ever.\n\nBefore drones, the only way you could get an aerial view of something was to rent a helicopter at a rate of $200 every 15 minutes, says Dirk Dallas, a professional photographer who owns 12 drones and posts to Instagram via @fromwhereidrone.\n\nHaving the ability to fly over a rocky beach cliff or fly 300 feet up over a landscape to see what it looks like from above is still so fresh and untapped that even familiar spots feel new again.\n\nIt's easy to see why loads of people are taking up the hobby from millennials looking for epic Instagram posts to baby boomers who want to explore their surrounding from the comfort of a chair.\n\nIn 2017, US dollar sales in the drone category increased 32 percent compared to 2016, according to The NPD Group Retail Tracking Service.\n\nJust another camera?\n\nLots of professional photographers and videographers are buying them to add to their toolkit just as if it were another lens for their DSLR camera, says Dallas.\n\nKeeping a drone in the air is relatively easy. Anyone can do it. The tricky part is getting pro-style footage.\n\nA good pilot needs to practice flying a lot, so that flying is second nature, says Dallas. From there it's important to understand basic photography principles like ISO, aperture, shutter and composition.
(CNN) Poetry and football. Two words you don't often hear in the same sentence.\n\nOne is a lyrical, niche art form. The other is a violent, mass-consumed sport. There's something discordant about putting them together, like a mash-up gone wrong or two mismatched people on a bad date.\n\nAnd yet Amanda Gorman, fresh off her stunning appearance at President Biden's inauguration, will recite an original poem today at Super Bowl LV in Tampa. It'll mark the first time poetry has been an official part of America's biggest unofficial holiday.\n\nPoetry has no business at a football game, you might say. Football games are for stirring renditions of the national anthem, neck-twisting military flyovers, the unfurling of vast American flags at stadiums packed with cheering fans. Pageantry, not poetry.\n\nPoetry, on the other hand, is for Elizabethans, swooning lovers, starving writers and dreamy prep school boys under the spell of Robin Williams. It is traditionally consumed quietly, in a personal pact between poet and reader, without marching bands or Bud Light commercials.\n\nThe two seem SO different. After all, football is measured in yards, poetry in meters.\n\nThe perception is wrong.\n\nAt their best, football and poetry both reach sort of a state of grace, says Quentin Ring, executive director of Beyond Baroque , a literary arts center in Venice, California, where Gorman took poetry workshops as a teenager. When you see somebody like Tom Brady when he's in the zone, it's sublime. And poetry is also something that large numbers of people can be enraptured by.\n\nConsider:\n\nFootball and poetry have a history\n\nFootball combines two of the worst things in American life, George Will once said . It is violence punctuated by committee meetings.\n\nPoetry, on the other hand, has been called nothing less than  the history of the human soul .\n\nBut yes, there is poetry in football. There's the graceful arc of a perfectly thrown spiral, the slow-motion ballet of a halfback weaving through tacklers, ESPN's Chris Berman rhapsodizing about  the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field .\n\nThere's also history.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens are named for The Raven, the famous poem by Edgar Allan Poe, who spent the later part of his life in the city.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens are named for an Edgar Allen Poe poem.\n\nThe climax of the Marx Brothers' 1934 movie Horse Feathers is a college football game in which Chico calls out plays with rhyming verse. Hi diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle, he says, This time I think we go through the middle.\n\nAnd the battle hymn of the Raiders franchise, dating back to their early days in Oakland, is  The Autumn Wind , a poem adapted by Steve Sabol and narrated by NFL Films' John Facenda, whose thunderous baritone earned him a nickname, The Voice of God.\n\nIts last verse goes like this:\n\nThe Autumn Wind is a raider,\n\nPillaging just for fun.\n\nHe'll knock you 'round and upside down,\n\nAnd laugh when he's conquered and won.\n\nIt's not Shakespeare, but Raiders fans still blast the poem from their trucks at tailgates.\n\nAnd speaking of the Bard of Avon ... did you know that William Shakespeare played football? No, not that one. The other one, William V. Shakespeare , who was an All-American halfback at Notre Dame in the 1930s. Among his many colorful nicknames: The Merchant of Menace.\n\nNFL players write poetry\n\nCleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett, the first overall pick in the 2017 NFL draft, is 6-foot-4, 272 pounds and hell on opposing quarterbacks.\n\nHe also loves the poetry of Maya Angelou, and writes poems in his spare time.\n\nIf I'm feeling stress or anxiety, I'll escape into another world. With books, you're going on an adventure, imagining and wondering. Poetry is different, he told ESPN . When you're a poet, or reading poems, you feel every single word.\n\nDefensive end Myles Garrett of the Cleveland Browns.\n\nGarrett is just one of numerous NFL players who have dabbled in writing verse.\n\nAnother, Seattle Seahawks receiver Tyler Lockett, wrote a poem,  Reality vs. Perception , about social injustice and the prejudices Black men face in America.\n\nIt goes, in part:\n\nWhen I look in the mirror, I see more than a Black man\n\nBut what do you see, America?\n\nAn entertainer? An athlete?\n\nWhat else do you see?\n\nA gangbanger? A drug dealer? A criminal? A lowlife?\n\nWhy not a lawyer? Why not a doctor? Why not a son? Why not a father?\n\nA video of Lockett and other star NFL players reciting the poem is on the NFL's website.\n\nEven Tom Brady has been known to share poetry as a way of getting fired up for a game -- as he did on Instagram before his last Super Bowl appearance two years ago. It must have worked. He won.\n\nPoets have written poems about football\n\nFootball, not so much.\n\n After all, Alfred Lord Tennyson didn't write, 'Tis better to have played and lost to the Jacksonville Jaguars than never to have played at all.\n\nTom Brady of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He likes poetry, too.\n\nBut there is a vibrant subgenre of football poems by professional poets. Their verses describe graceful young bodies in their prime, touch football games in the street and fans huddled on rickety school bleachers on Friday nights.\n\nNo one was faster\n\nthan my father on the football field.\n\nNo one could keep him\n\nfrom crossing the line. Then\n\ntouching down again.\n\nCoaches were watching the way he moved,\n\nhis easy stride, his long arms reaching\n\nup, snatching the ball from its soft pockets\n\nof air.\n\nPoetry spoken aloud has a 'physicality'\n\nThis evening in Tampa, Amanda Gorman will not be reading a poem about football.\n\nInstead she will recite an original poem recognizing three honorary captains at the Super Bowl -- a nurse, a teacher and a veteran -- who served as leaders in their respective communities during the global pandemic.\n\nIt's just the latest in a flurry of recent triumphs for Gorman, the nation's first-ever youth poet laureate.\n\nJUST WATCHED Youth poet laureate recites her stunning poem at Biden inauguration Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Youth poet laureate recites her stunning poem at Biden inauguration 05:32\n\nRing remembers Gorman from her years in the poetry program at Beyond Baroque and was immediately struck by her precocious talent.\n\nIt was pretty clear that she was destined for great things, he says.\n\nRing couldn't have imagined those great things would include bringing the ancient art of poetry to America's biggest sports spectacle.\n\nBut he says the pairing of poetry and football is not the shotgun marriage it may seem. Like football, spoken-word poetry is a communal activity. And like football, its carefully chosen words can land with impact.\n\nThere's a physicality to it, he says. People can actually feel it when Amanda is reading her poetry.\n\nSome, watching Gorman tonight, will feel it. Some will shrug and turn back to their chicken wings. But the Super Bowl will never be quite the same.
(CNN) In early 2016, the first time a friend told Gayle Tzemach Lemmon the story of Kurdish Women's Projection Units in northeastern Syria -- also known as the YPJ -- she had two reactions. The first was fascination: How had no one else told the tale of these women, aligned with US forces (and later provided with support by the Trump administration) who were fighting the Islamic State -- a group which routinely kidnapped, raped and murdered women?\n\nThe second reaction, when an American friend of Lemmon's who had been working with the women's units, urged her, Come on, you have to see it, was: No.\n\nBut she couldn't shake the questions she had about the women fighting in Syria. Three years of research and interviews and seven reporting trips to northeastern Syria later, Lemmon's book chronicles some of the YPJ's fiercest battles with the Islamic State.\n\nLemmon details how the force that would become the People's Protection Units (YPG) arose in response to a crackdown against Syrian Kurds after an uprising at Qamishli in 2004. They offered coed training in ideology and tactics and became known as the YPG in 2011 at the outset of the Syrian civil war. A number of the women who became Lemmon's central characters joined the YPG during those first years of that conflict, which ISIS exploited to sow violence and grow its ranks. In 2013, the organization's women members formed their own group, the Women's Protection Units (YPJ).\n\nAs Lemmon takes the reader along with the intrepid fighters she meets, they rescue trapped colleagues while ISIS fighters taunt them over the radio for being women. They know that those taunts, coming from ISIS, mean death, even beheading, if they are captured. They are wounded. They sustain losses, sometimes heavy ones, sometimes close friends. They kill to liberate their homeland, even though, as Syrian Kurds, they are not permitted by the Assad regime to publish in their own language or celebrate their own holidays. They do not surrender.\n\nWomen and girls in the cities they set free come out to hug them, or simply to look, marveling that they exist. In one riveting scene, American soldiers visit a school in Kobani where some of the YPJ had been pinned down. In the basement, they see graffiti scrawled on the wall. It reads: We will fight to the last person.\n\nDaughters of Kobani is a war story for the 21st century, unflinching in its depictions of the violence and kinship that shape the lives of soldiers like Nowruz, Rojda, Azeema and Znarin, who serve and lead on the front lines to liberate the cities of Kobani, Manbij and Raqqa between 2015 and 2017.\n\nFreedom to risk their lives to fight ISIS was a radical change from the lack of freedom many of these women faced in their younger years. Azeema, seeing what things were like for most women around her, had vowed at 13 never to marry; she becomes a sniper and commander in Kobani. Znarin had been denied both a university education and a love marriage she desperately desired before her political awakening sent her off to war; she is later one of a half dozen or so field commanders of hundreds of fighters in Manbij. Of the latter, Lemmon writes, While the world considered ISIS a movement, Znarin saw it as far less grand than that: for her, ISIS was a group of men who brutalized women and wanted to destroy her and her friends.\n\nWomen of YPJ gather to mark the end of the fight against ISIS in Raqqa.\n\nThese women and their comrades are instrumental to the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces that ultimately defeat the Islamic State, but since that liberation, they have been thrust into danger again, facing military incursion from Turkey without US support.\n\nWhile not aligned with the Turkish Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK), which Turkey, the US and the EU consider a terrorist organization, the YPJ and other Syrian Kurds follow the teachings of the PKK's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, about grassroots democracy and gender equality.\n\nTheir Kurdish identities and association with Ocalan place the women of the YPJ, their families and their comrades in an uncertain position militarily and diplomatically against Turkey and in their relations with the US. As Lemmon puts it in her book, The future of northeastern Syria remains a question written in invisible ink in a language no one can yet decipher.\n\nWhen we spoke, Lemmon told me that for now, the women she came to know while reporting her book are living with a fragile stability that's holding. She reports that fortunately amid their other precarities, they have also been relatively unscathed by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nNear the end of our interview, Lemmon described a conversation she had with Nowruz, in which she asked what she wants a girl born in Syria 20 years from now to understand about the war she and her sisters in arms fought against ISIS -- especially now that things have again become volatile in northeastern Syria.\n\nMember of Women's Protection Units during the fight against ISIS\n\nShe told me that Nowruz said: I'm doing this for my nieces and nephews, so they can speak their language, they can publish in their language, they can name their children what they wish. So that they can live in peace. Nowruz wants the yet-unborn-girls to know their own power, to understand that we did this for them. For the next generation, so they wouldn't face this.\n\nThe following interview has been lightly edited for clarity and flow.\n\nCNN: I was really struck from the beginning by the way that you described what it is to report on and tell a war story. What makes telling a war story different from other kinds of storytelling? And what made you want to tell this one in particular?\n\nGayle Tzemach Lemmon: Every great story starts with a question you can't answer. And this story struck me immediately. How in the world did the world's most far-reaching experiment in women's equality come to be built on the ashes of the ISIS fight, brought to you by women who fought the Islamic State, house by house, room by room, and town by town, for a half-decade? How was it that the Islamic State, which put the buying and selling of women right at the center of its ideology, was defeated by women who had women's emancipation and the quest for equality right at the center of their ideology? It was almost Shakespearean.\n\nTo me, there is no difference between this story, among the stories I've had the privilege of telling. Because to me, they are all stories of communities of women underestimated from the outside, at the outset, who rise to the moment in service to something greater than themselves. And I think that we all want to see more stories of women's lives in all their glorious complexity.\n\nCNN: You do lay out in the early part of the book the multiple questions this story raised for you. What questions did writing it answer for you and which remain unanswered?\n\nLemmon: I wanted to know what it meant for women to win a war. And I will say that I have never seen women anywhere in the world more comfortable in power, and less apologetic about exercising it. And it stays with you because it looks different. And I wanted to show that. I think the thing that struck me is we all have mothers and sisters and daughters and friends in our lives who are just resilient and full of courage, and full of bravery. And it's wonderful to be able to see on the page, the story of women, maybe far away geographically, maybe in a very different context. But bringing all that courage, and all bravery to the fore every single day to stop the men who devalued women.\n\nRoadside sign outside Qamishli in Syria.\n\nCNN: How did you connect with the women who became your main characters?\n\nLemmon: This whole story started because one of the women from Ashley's War (Lemmon's last book, about a special team of women soldiers working and fighting in Afghanistan) called me in 2016 when I was actually in the middle of school pick up. I was hiding in the bushes at preschool to take the call on WhatsApp.\n\nShe was calling from Syria and she said, You have to come see this. This looks completely different from anything we've ever seen. Not only are women leading in battle alongside US Special Operations, but they are leading men in battle. And they have the full respect of the men they fight with and the men they serve alongside and lead. And of the US forces, with whom they work. And she also said That's not all of it, you know. They're really focused on women's rights and equality and emancipation.\n\nAnd I thought: How in the world did this come to be?\n\nCNN: It's striking how these women remain aware of and deploy their gender, even on the battlefield. There's Rojda, who goads ISIS fighters she's up against into giving up their location by going after their masculinity. And when an American commander meets one of the young YPJ fighters and she trash-talks him, saying, I bet I killed more ISIS than you did --\n\nLemmon: Oh, I know. The guy on the US side told me that story himself. Multiple times.\n\nCNN: That's amazing. Did you get a sense when you were working on this story that these women were developing strategies to weaponize misogyny against itself?\n\nLemmon: They were fighting inhumanity with humanity. And they're really funny. They truly thought it was obvious that women were equal. And they didn't care what other people would say to the contrary (laughing) because they had this very strong self-possession. They just knew that they possessed the right to choose the path of their lives. And weren't actually interested in what other people thought about that. On the other hand, you know, I think they deeply cared about other people, I think they were ferocious in trying to take care of their people. Their forces, their fighters. You know, every loss they took very personally. Even if it wasn't somebody they knew personally or well, if they were commanding and their forces took losses, of course they took it to heart.\n\nYoung women training to join the YPJ in northeastern Syria, 2018.\n\nI think what they focused on most was ending the notion that this kind of mentality could exist -- the mentality that said women had no value, women could be enslaved, women could be bought and sold. They wanted to end that. And they truly believed that they were doing this for women around the world.\n\nCNN: That comes through in the book, especially when you describe the Social Contract of the Democratic Federal System of Northern Syria. I love how you put it: women's rights would form the spine of the document. What has been the impact of this document and the fight to implement it?\n\nLemmon: I was sitting with two of the political leaders, Fauzia Yusuf and Ilham Ahmed. And of the contract (a constitutional document outlining the political future for the territory won back from ISI), Fauzia said to me, We're building a lake in the desert. It doesn't change things overnight, but having a document that says no child marriage, no dowry, and that women have economic rights, women have the right to political participation. The paper, the document doesn't change everything, but it starts to change some things.\n\nCNN: What was the role of the American military men who provided support to these women? And what do you want readers to take away about that collaborative relationship?\n\nLemmon: The American men who worked with these women were forever changed and their biggest champions. They spoke with me at length. Folks talked to me at length and in-depth, to help me really understand the extent of the YPJ's contribution, and also why it mattered to America.\n\nFor example, there's this moment where a US Special Operations soldier who's watching these young women, 30 of them in a flatbed truck, some with flowers in their hair. And they have their AKs and they're wearing their fatigues and their Timex watches and their braids, and they're smiling and hugging each other as they're at a rallying point getting ready to go fight the men of the Islamic State.\n\nMember of Women's Protection Units during the ISIS fight\n\nAnd he feels this mix of awe and real grief that he can't go with them because of US policy. And a feeling of responsibility that he should be there with them, because he is a warrior who's come of age in the post-9/11 wars and could help maybe some of their lives. And then he just stops and says, You know -- and he really said this to me -- he's like, I just had this notion of the MacArthur speech at West Point , of duty, honor, country.\n\nCNN: Another thing that struck me: Some of the details about your main characters -- Azeema is great at volleyball, Rojda loved soccer, both talk about their refusal ever to marry -- those aspects mirror, to some extent, the life experiences and discussion topics among women and young girls around the world who care about gender equality --\n\nLemmon: Right. So the most universal moment was early on in the reporting process. I'm sitting there with Rojda. And I asked her, Why did you have to form the Women's Projection Protection Units in 2013? You already had equality according to your ideology, you were already fighting alongside men in battle. And she's sitting there chewing sunflower seeds, and she looked at men and said, We just didn't want men taking credit for our work.\n\nCNN: I was especially fascinated by the evolution of Znarin's character, going from a woman without hope to being a driver for the Women's Protection Units to becoming the leader of the forces that liberate her hometown of Manbij from ISIS. What stands out to you most about her story?\n\nLemmon: What stood out most to me about her story is that she changed the rules governing her life. And she did it herself. And she's one of the kindest, gentlest people -- if you meet her for tea, it's hard for you to imagine how much horror she has seen. And yet, even all the horror she has seen, her heart, her kindness is the thing that strikes you first. And her determination -- she ends up putting herself right in the center of her people's future. Her moment in the book is so important, because it shows women challenging the status quo realizing they're not alone.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nCNN: It's exciting to hear that the book is set to become a TV series. Even though it's early in the process, what do you hope for an American viewing audience to take away from, or bring to, watching this story on screen?\n\nLemmon: That this is a story of David and Goliath, only David also happens to be a woman. And it is a story about women who persevere and who push forward against all the boundaries that previously shaped what they could do and who they could be. And I hope viewers see this as a universal story of going up against the odds -- so that people determined to bring inhumanity and barbarity to the world would be stopped.\n\nCNN: I keep coming back to one question that you raised in the introduction that I think went unanswered. You asked, Would real equality be possible only when women took up arms?\n\nLemmon: It really is a central question, isn't it?\n\nCNN: Do you think the answer is yes?\n\nLemmon: I don't know the answer to that question. And I don't want to answer that question. I want readers to contend with what it means when women fully protect and defend themselves.
Story highlights Peter Bergen: President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia could not come at a more opportune time As the Saudi economy struggles to sustain itself on oil revenue alone, Trump is offering an opportunity to diversify the country's economic prospects, writes Bergen\n\nEditor's Note: Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nImagine Houston run by an efficient version of the Taliban, and you get an approximation of what it is like to live in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.\n\nBut to understand the significance of President Donald Trump's visit to Riyadh and his much-anticipated speech on Islam, you must also understand a bit more about the center of Saudi power.\n\nPHOTO: CNN Peter Bergen\n\nRiyadh is a sprawling city of more than 6 million built by massive oil revenues, punctuated by soaring skyscrapers, stitched together by smooth freeways and surrounded by endless sand-colored suburbs that march ever outward to the empty deserts.\n\nBut Riyadh, despite its seemingly shiny veneer, is in trouble. For the first time in decades the Saudi monarchy can no longer rely on the revenues from oil to maintain its position as the leading Arab state and to buy off any aspirations that the Saudi population might have to play a real role in politics.\n\nThat's because the days of $100-a-barrel oil are long gone and are unlikely to return anytime soon. And it is this reality that made President Trump's trip to Riyadh and his speech on Sunday so important to the Saudi monarchy.\n\nIt's not just that they share a common interest in checking what they both regard as excessive Iranian influence in the Middle East. Both sides also see great value in the almost $110 billion arms deal signed during Trump's visit, which aims, in part, to bulk up domestic Saudi arms production and create new jobs in Saudi Arabia. And that's in addition to $55 billion in deals with US companies that were also announced during Trump's visit.\n\nThe rationale for these deals is simple – to jump-start the Saudi economy and bring new jobs to the private sector, as Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir explained at a press conference on Saturday. We expect that these investments over the next 10 years or so will provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in both the United States and in Saudi Arabia, he said. They will lead to a transfer of technology from the US to Saudi Arabia, enhance our economy and also enhance the American investments in Saudi Arabia, which already are the largest investments of anyone.\n\nWhen oil wealth seemed an endless spigot of gold, the absolute Saudi monarchy created, somewhat paradoxically, a quasi-socialist state: an astonishing 90% of Saudis work for the government and have long enjoyed subsidies for water, electricity and gas. Health care and education are free.\n\nBut, in late 2015, the IMF warned that, given falling oil prices, the Saudi government could run out of financial reserves in five years if it kept up its present rate of spending.\n\nWith oil prices holding steady at around $50 a barrel, the Saudi government is now cutting government salaries and reducing subsidies. Trump's visit – and deals – therefore create a critical opportunity in the private sector for Saudis who can no longer exclusively depend on the government.\n\nKing Salman – who became King in 2015 and for almost five decades was the governor of Riyadh, overseeing its explosive growth from a city of a few hundred thousand in the mid-1960s to the massive city it is today – has empowered his 31-year-old son, the Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to also play a role in addressing Saudi's immediate demands. He is charged with modernizing Saudi society slowly and diversifying the Saudi economy quickly.\n\nThe Saudi government calls it Vision 2030. The aim is to privatize the education, health care, agriculture, mining and defense sectors and to sell off Saudi Aramco, perhaps the wealthiest company in the world, which is estimated to be worth around a trillion dollars. The Saudis expect the United States to be a key player in all this, particularly given Trump's expertise in corporate America.\n\nAnd the time is ripe for the Saudi monarchy to begin to transform its economic base. Its country is both young and incredibly connected – 70% of the population is under 30, and 93% of Saudis use the Internet, far more than in the United States.\n\nThe declining role of the religious police\n\nRiyadh sits in the Nejd heartland of Saudi Arabia, where in the mid-18th century the first Saudi King allied with Muhammad bin Abdul-Wahhab, a cleric who promoted a harsh interpretation of Sunni Islam.\n\nThis alliance is a marriage of convenience that has survived for more than two and half centuries and is the key to the political economy of Saudi Arabia in which the Saudis have retained absolute authority – so much so that their family name is embedded in the name of the country – while the Wahhabi religious establishment sanctions the rule of the absolute monarchy and has largely held sway over the social mores of Saudi society.\n\nUntil a year ago, compliance with the dictates of Saudi-style Wahhabi Islam were rigorously enforced by members of the feared religious police, known as the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (the same name that was used by the Taliban's religious police when the Taliban were in power in Afghanistan).\n\nThe religious police patrolled the streets looking for purported malefactors and were given a more or less free hand to do so. In one notorious episode in 2002, in the holy city of Mecca, the religious police prevented girls from fleeing a school that was on fire because they were not properly dressed. Fifteen of them perished in the flames.\n\nBut, last April, the wings of the religious police were clipped by King Salman and his son MBS, as he is universally known here. They no longer have the power to arrest suspects and now can only report them to regular police units.\n\nIn addition to getting the religious police to back off, the Saudi monarchy has allowed some music concerts to happen, but their biggest ambition, as described above, is to wean Saudi Arabia from its almost total dependence on oil revenues.\n\nThe Saudis see the Trump administration as a key to this, and that's why they rolled out the reddest of red carpets for the President's visit.\n\nIn return, Trump received the perfect platform to give his speech on Islam. After all, where better to make that speech than in the holy land of Saudi Arabia, home to the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina? And who better to convene the leaders of every Muslim country to hear Trump speak than the Saudi royal family?\n\nThe speech\n\nIn Riyadh, the city where Osama bin Laden was born six decades ago, President Trump delivered his much-anticipated speech Sunday to leaders from around the Islamic world.\n\nThe stakes needless to say were high. Candidate Trump had previously opined that Islam hates us and had called for the total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States, an argument he has since modified and moderated.\n\nNonetheless, such rhetoric on the campaign trail made Trump an unpopular figure across the Muslim world. A poll released in early November ahead of the US presidential election found that only 9% of those polled in the Middle East and North Africa would have voted for Trump versus 44% for Hillary Clinton.\n\nAfter he was elected, Trump had also attempted to ban temporarily travel from a half dozen Muslim countries to the United States, an order that was midwifed by a top policy adviser, Stephen Miller, who now had the unenviable task of also being the lead pen for the President's keynote speech on Islam.\n\nTrump's speech was billed as a reset with the Muslim world, just as President Obama's was eight years ago when he went to Cairo and declared I have come here to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world; one based upon mutual interest and respect…\n\nDuring the presidential campaign in August, Trump panned Obama's Cairo speech, castigating Obama for a misguided speech that didn't condemn the oppression of women and gays in many Muslim nations, and the systematic violations of human rights, or the financing of global terrorism…\n\nOf course, it's all a lot more complicated when you are President, and Trump raised none of these issues in his Riyadh speech, instead emphasizing the scourge of terrorism, which is something that pretty much anyone in the Islamic world and the West can agree upon.\n\nTrump did use the term Islamic terrorism, which critics assert conflates Islam with terrorism, but his speech, which was received with polite attention from the leaders of the Muslim world, was a largely anodyne account of the need for civilized countries to work together to defeat terrorist groups in the name of our common humanity and – minus some swipes at Iran – could have been delivered by President Obama.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nSpeeches, of course, are not policies, and Obama's initial popularity in much of the Muslim world waned after he ordered a large surge of troops into Afghanistan, greatly ramped up drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen and failed to intervene in any meaningful way to end the Syrian civil war.\n\nThe same surely will hold true for Trump. If his administration continues to pursue its travel ban from six Muslim-majority countries in the courts and does little to bring peace to the Middle East, whether in Syria or between the Israelis and the Palestinians, any bump he might get from his Riyadh speech will prove as ephemeral as the sandstorms that occasionally blast through the Saudi capital.\n\nBut even if Trump's speech does not herald any real changes in US national security policies, the business deals that the Trump administration is helping to broker with the Saudis will help move the Saudi economy away from its total dependence on oil.
(CNN) —\n\nA thoughtful yet playful biography about an unsung comedy genius, A Futile and Stupid Gesture derives its title from a line in Animal House, one of the signature properties attributable to the late National Lampoon co-founder Doug Kenney. For those who can still remember chanting Toga! or yelling Food fight!, it's a nostalgic trip, albeit one with cautionary A Star is Born-esque overtones.\n\nKenney (Will Forte) is introduced as a Harvard student, cutting up at its satiric magazine with his buddy Henry Beard (Domhnall Gleeson). Essentially desperate not to grow up, the two seize on the idea of securing financing to launch their own humor magazine, which, after some trial and considerable error, blossoms into National Lampoon – an irreverent breeding ground for much of the comedy world of the 1970s and '80s, including many of Saturday Night Live's original Not-Ready-for-Primetime Players.\n\nDirected by David Wain (Wet Hot American Summer), and adapted from a book by Josh Karp, this Stupid Gesture cleverly plays around with the conventions of the form. For starters, although its protagonist died under somewhat mysterious circumstances in his 30s, the whole movie is narrated by an elder version of Kenney (Martin Mull), essentially positing what a cranky old coot he'd be had he lived.\n\nSimilarly, a crawl races by in the middle of the film listing some of the creative liberties taken, beginning with the fact that Forte is, clearly, too old to be playing Kenney when the movie begins, in his early 20s.\n\nA self-described working-class, Midwestern dork, Kenney's tale has a lot of familiar boy-makes-good-in-showbiz wrinkles to it. Toiling away like a fiend, and philandering when he isn't high on something, he makes a mess of his marriage, along with most of the key relationships in his life that follow.\n\nKenney chafes at the success of SNL, which mined Lampoon discoveries like Chevy Chase (played by Joel McHale), John Belushi and Gilda Radner, prompting him to grumble This should have been ours as he watches the premiere.\n\nAfter Animal House becomes a massive hit, Kenney relocated to Los Angeles, yielding the familiar litany of cocaine-dusted parties – with an abundance of powder flowing around the making of Caddyshack – and clashes with studio types.\n\nAs the movie makes clear, Kenney was a tortured soul, and the magazine he founded was a product of its time: overwhelmingly white, male and gleefully boorish.\n\nThe full title of Karp's book, notably, is A Futile and Stupid Gesture: How Doug Kenney and National Lampoon Changed Comedy Forever, which might be a trifle hyperbolic. Then again, what would you expect from a movie about a guy who published a cover saying that if you didn't buy the magazine, they'd shoot this dog?\n\nA Stupid and Futile Gesture premieres Jan. 26 on Netflix.
Washington (CNN) Millennials may just have the opportunity to rebrand what it means to be American, as did many of their predecessors, including the Greatest Generation, dubbed so for their sacrifices during World War II.\n\nSure, there's plenty of blame to go around for the scary state of affairs regarding the novel coronavirus , especially when it comes to the American government: Why weren't we prepared? Why has President Donald Trump\n\nStill, the question to ask is: What do we owe one another?\n\nAs the virus rapidly worsens in America, images at odds with the reality of a pandemic -- one whose power derives from proximity -- are circulating around social media: People crowded into bars , drinking their green beer at St. Patrick's Day parties. People packed onto beaches , taking advantage of the warming weather.\n\nThese revelers tend to be young: many of them members of the expansive millennial cohort bookended by mid-twentysomethings and those right under the age of 40 -- that is, the people whom the virus is, on balance, least likely to be fatal to.\n\nIt's this apparent forever-young callousness -- or obliviousness -- that's touched a raw nerve.\n\nTo all you young millennial a**holes who keep going out and partying, go home, the actress and singer Hilary Duff said in an Instagram Story on Sunday.\n\nDr. Deborah Birx, a top US health official, explained during Wednesday's White House briefing that there's worry about reports indicating that more young people are becoming seriously ill from the virus. This suggests that they may have continued to be exposed to it because they weren't concerned about being at risk, she said.\n\nThere are concerning reports coming out of France and Italy about some young people getting seriously ill and very seriously ill in the ICUs, Birx said. We think part of this may be that people heeded the early data coming out of China and coming out of South Korea of the elderly or those with preexisting medical conditions were a particular risk.\n\nThe sharp attention many are directing at millennials in the face of the pandemic is revealing: of, for one thing, deeper expectations of social responsibility -- our obligation to one another on account of our profound interdependence.\n\nWhat makes Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, uniquely difficult to contain is its stealthiness. It can be transmitted to the vulnerable -- the elderly, those with autoimmune conditions -- by people who might believe themselves invincible.\n\nMillennials and other young people , then, arguably play an outsized part in stemming the virus. Instead of gathering and posing dangers not necessarily to themselves but to others, they ought to stay home. And while they're there, think a bit creatively about how to distribute help -- the concept of mutual aid , say -- to neighbors who could very well be in dire need of it.\n\nOf course, it's not just millennials who are disregarding social-distancing guidelines. Baby boomers are doing it, too, and at times despite the protests of their millennial relatives . In this light, the intense scrutiny of millennials is perhaps indicative of something else, too: dusty generational fault lines.\n\nThe old alchemical dream was changing base metals into gold. The new alchemical dream is: changing one's personality -- remaking, remodeling, elevating, and polishing one's very self ... and observing, studying, and doting on it, he wrote of the generation's navel-gazing.\n\nMillennials aren't beyond the reach of such sweeping characterization. Recall the 2013 Time magazine cover story in which the writer Joel Stein labeled millennials the Me Me Me Generation. There's also the laundry list of things they've been accused of killing : marriage, department stores, running, napkins, wine corks. It isn't difficult to see how a cohort whose perceived self-centeredness has allegedly ruined so much might also spring to mind amid the current crisis.
Memory is a 22-year-old activist, advocating for girl's education and against child marriage. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\n\nGrowing up in Malawi, one of the world's least-developed countries, exposes young girls to a number of risks -- some of which are life-threatening.\n\nDespite the fact that there are so many people advocating for gender equality, women and girls still do not have much choice when it comes to taking control of their own lives. This often comes down to cultural traditions that seem at times impossible to overcome.\n\nI have witnessed many injustices against women and girls in my country. It is so sad to see girls in life-threatening situations when they are so young, preventing them from exploring opportunities that would give them a completely different life.\n\nWhen I was a little girl, I used to see my relatives, friends and schoolmates going through a rite of passage to adulthood. We all grew up knowing we would have to go through this at some point ourselves -- whether we understood what was happening to us or not. After all, we did not have a choice. It was something that the community expected of us.\n\nRead More

The views expressed in this commentary belong solely to the author. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman approved an operation that led to journalist Jamal Khashoggi's brutal assassination in 2018, according to a declassified US intelligence report the Biden administration released on Friday.\n\nWhile the four-page report supports a conclusion already reached in 2018 by the CIA -- that the man known as MBS was responsible for Khashoggi's murder -- it sends a new signal: that President Joe Biden is willing to publicly challenge what he once called a pariah state.\n\nThe US State Department also announced on Friday a new Khashoggi Ban that restricts the visas of 76 Saudis as part of a wider effort to retaliate against anyone who is involved in state-sponsored efforts to crack down on dissidents around the world.\n\nThis, however, falls far short of taking direct action against MBS.\n\nThe administration's decision reflects the reality of the longtime marriage of convenience between the world's longest-standing democracy and the world's most absolute monarchy established by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Saudi King Adul Aziz in 1945. This relationship has always been based on mutual interests around oil and, in recent years, counterterrorism against al-Qaeda and ISIS.\n\nBiden is now trying to walk a tightrope. By releasing the damning intelligence report late on Friday and announcing the new Khashoggi ban, the new administration is hoping a mere rebuke and a slap on the wrist will be enough to signal the changing tides of US foreign policy after the Trump administration. At the same time, the Biden administration wants to maintain an alliance that has served both countries' interests reasonably well for the better half of the last century.\n\nIndeed, the story of Khashoggi's murder says a great deal about bin Salman, and the Trump administration's desire to ally with him, seemingly at any cost, including brushing Khashoggi's assassination under the carpet.\n\nMBS and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, both the scions of enormously wealthy, powerful families and only a few years apart in age, bonded early on during the Trump administration over a belief that together they could transform the Middle East.\n\nThe Saudis understood the power of family relationships and an alliance between the House of Saud and the House of Trump made sense to them, particularly after their tense relationship with President Barack Obama, who seemed intent on upending the traditional power dynamics of the Middle East with his nuclear agreement with their archrivals, the Iranians.\n\nFor his part, Kushner believed that MBS could help deliver a US-brokered solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and that their personal relationship could achieve what decades of professional diplomacy hadn't.\n\nThis was part of the geopolitical backdrop against which the murder of Khashoggi -- a 59-year-old contributor to the Washington Post who was critical of the Saudi regime -- played out.\n\nIn September 2018, Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey to obtain paperwork verifying his divorce so he could marry his Turkish fiancée, Hatice Cengiz.\n\nOfficials told him to come back to pick up the paperwork, and a 15-man team of Saudi intelligence agents, military officers and members of the Saudi Royal Guard traveled from Riyadh to Istanbul on October 2 -- the day Khashoggi returned to the consulate.\n\nThe US intelligence report released Friday states some of the members were associated with the Saudi Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Royal Court -- led by a close adviser of MBS who once publicly claimed he did not make decisions without the crown prince's approval.\n\nOthers were identified by the report as members of the Rapid Intervention Force, a subset of the Royal Guard that answers only to MBS. It had taken part in other earlier dissident suppression operations and it was unlikely to have participated in the operation against Khashoggi without MBS's approval, according to the report.\n\nAudio recordings from the Saudi consulate revealed Khashoggi struggling and saying, I can't breathe, before his body was dismembered with a saw as the perpetrators were advised to listen to music to block out the sound. Khashoggi's remains were never found, which is particularly grave in Islam, a religion that puts a great premium on the swift burial of the body.\n\nThe then-Saudi ambassador to the United States, Prince Khalid bin Salman, who is MBS's brother, quickly said claims that Saudi Arabia killed or detained Khashoggi were absolutely false, and baseless.\n\nThis was the beginning of a series of lies, cover stories and rationalizations that the Saudi government told about Khashoggi's murder. The Saudis floated a story that the murder was the result of rogue killers during an interrogation gone wrong.\n\nThis story was undercut by the fact that the hit team included a forensic pathologist and that Khashoggi's body was dismembered with a saw, which suggested a high degree of premeditation.\n\nDespite the fact that Khashoggi was both a legal resident of the United States and a journalist who was contributing regularly to a major American media institution, President Trump stood with the Saudis and issued a statement that conflicted with the CIA's own assessment that MBS authorized the killing. It could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event -- maybe he did and maybe he didn't, the statement read . We may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nAccording to journalist Bob Woodward's book Rage, Trump doubled down on protecting MBS and said, I saved his ass. I was able to get Congress to leave him alone.\n\nTrump rationalized his inaction when he told CBS 60 Minutes that we'd be punishing ourselves by canceling American arms sales to Saudi Arabia, deals that he frequently trumpeted as amounting to more than $110 billion, even though that figure was wildly inflated.\n\nTrump's defense of MBS was of a piece with his repeated defenses of other tyrants, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin in his efforts to swing the 2016 American presidential election against Hillary Clinton and the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, who Trump has praised lavishly\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nHaving enjoyed a very close relationship with the Trump administration, the Saudis are now getting just a taste of what could be a recalibrated relationship with the Biden administration. Biden will almost certainly not be looking to cause permanent damage to the US-Saudi relationship, but MBS will no longer have a free pass to murder his opponents outside of the kingdom, which is saying something.\n\nThe release of Friday's report should leave no doubt that the US government, from President Biden to the intelligence community, holds him personally responsible for Khashoggi's death.
New UK government measures announced Monday will see secondary school children taught about the dangers of FGM.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nAll secondary school children in England will be taught about the dangers of female genital mutilation (FGM) by 2020, in a bid to eradicate the abusive practice in the UK.\n\nThe measures, set to be announced by the British government Monday, will outline the physical and emotional harm of FGM, as well as increasing awareness surrounding the practice and the availability of support networks.\n\nIt will form part of a wider overhaul of the Department of Education's sex education policy, the first time it has been updated in two decades.\n\nDamian Hinds, the education secretary, wrote on Twitter that the government must do all it can to protect women and girls from the barbaric practice of FGM.\n\nWe know that FGM can have a catastrophic effect on the lives of those affected, causing lifelong physical and psychological damage, he added in a statement.\n\nOur reforms to relationships and sex education will ensure young people are taught in an age-appropriate way about different forms of abuse and their rights under the law, to equip them with the knowledge they need to keep themselves and others safe.\n\nPHOTO: TOLGA AKMEN/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Damian Hinds, Britain's education secretary, will announce plans to overhaul the UK's sexual education policy.\n\nThe department's further proposals include teaching pupils aged 11 and above about other forms of so-called honor-based violence, forced marriage, domestic abuse and grooming.\n\nPrimary school pupils from the age of four will also receive relationship education, and pupils across all age groups will be taught about physical and mental wellbeing, including advice on online safety and the links between physical and mental health.\n\nFGM refers to all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for cultural or other nonmedical reasons, according to the United Nations Population Fund.\n\nIt is performed for myriad sociological, cultural, religious, hygienic and socioeconomic reasons, but it is banned by law in at least 44 countries.\n\nThe announcement was welcomed by anti-FGM campaigners in the UK. Nimco Ali, the co-founder of Daughters of Eve – a charity dedicated to the eradication of FGM – said in a statement: As a child I had no idea FGM was illegal, I just knew it was painful.\n\nHad I been given the education now being introduced, I would have been able to support those in my family to understand, and prevent other girls from being cut, Ali said.\n\nLeethen Bartholomew, head of the national FGM center at the children's charity Barnardo's, also welcomed the proposals, but added in a statement: It must be acknowledged that most girls are cut at an age when they will be attending primary school. Therefore conversations about FGM should take place at a younger age.\n\nFGM has been outlawed in the UK since 1985 under the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden is not the right Democratic candidate for 2020. And yet, he may soon enter the Democratic race.\n\nThus far, what has been most remarkable is how diverse the field is shaping up to be. This is not your traditional slate of Democratic candidates. Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Peter Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang and several others are already up and running. And more are likely to follow.\n\nThe composition of the Democratic field represents the diversity of the country. With so many serious frontrunners who are not, for a change, older white men, the Democrats are showing that they are a party representing the future of the country. In contrast to the kind of rhetoric that has come from President Donald Trump, an ode to the whiteness and masculinity of a limited American political tradition, the Democrats are making a strong statement about what their party is all about.\n\nAnd their opening speeches reflect that reality as well. They have revolved around issues such as racial justice, gender equity, immigration rights and more. Even a candidate like Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is being tagged as the moderate with bipartisan appeal, proclaimed: Stop the fear-mongering and stop the hate. We may come from different places. We may pray in different ways. We may look different. And love different. But all live in the same country of shared dreams.\n\nThen comes Biden. The former vice president has every right to run and certainly has a great deal to offer. During his career in the Senate and in the White House, Biden was a strong champion of the middle class. He pushed for the kinds of policies that Trump, despite all his promises to the forgotten Americans, never pursued. As vice president, he headed the Middle Class Task Force, which championed policies such as capping student loan payments and improving retirement security. He was even ahead of President Barack Obama on the issue of same-sex marriage.\n\nAlso, as an older white male (who would be 78 years old in January 2021), there are a number of Democrats who see him as the safe choice, the only person who will be able to withstand the President's testosterone-filled campaign. And CNN polling shows that right now most believe he would do best in a matchup against the President.\n\nBut is Biden really the best answer for the party? There is good reason for Democrats to be skeptical and to consider supporting other candidates.\n\nMost problematic is the fact that Biden has run for the presidency several times, and each time he has struggled under the intense spotlight. When it comes time to hit the campaign trail, Biden has never been able to generate the level of support that is necessary to win. His tendency to make gaffes has also hurt him. And, in our frenzied news cycle with endless outlets and few filters on information, Biden's style will cause problems again.\n\nOf course, these issues didn't stop Trump in 2016. But unlike Trump, it is unclear that without a comparable partisan media outlet (Fox News) and unyielding partisan loyalty, that Biden would survive. While MSNBC could offer a boost to Biden, social scientists have shown that the conservative media has a much stronger hold on conservative viewers than liberal outlets. Conservatives also tend to be more ideologically homogenous and loyal than their counterparts on the left. In other words, Democrats have seen the challenges that the inevitable frontrunner faces, as the election actually takes shape.\n\nMore important, though, is the moment in which we are living. Trump has run a political operation from the White House that has revolved around a vision of white nationalism that challenges the values of pluralism, diversity and inclusion. His statement after Charlottesville forever marked his term in office. And the President's perpetual struggle to build a wall perfectly captures what he hopes to achieve – with his central goal being about keeping people out rather than bringing them in.\n\nWith so many strong candidates already lined up to run in the Democratic primaries, many of whom who have launched their runs with the kind of gravitas and excitement that bodes well for a presidential campaign, there is a risk of someone like Biden being in the race – someone with the potential to suck up all the oxygen in the room. Uncle Joe could quickly take away media attention and campaign funds from Democrats who would perform better in the general election. If Biden was the nominee, he would also throw cold water on the excitement and energy that exists among younger Democrats about the direction of their party.\n\nThe Democrats should not assume that an older, moderate white man is inevitably the strongest candidate. Even Bernie Sanders offers a fresh perspective with his left of center, Democratic Socialist positions (he would also be notable as a Jewish-American nominee). It is possible to see the virtue of a ticket that embodies diversity from the top down. All of the candidates who are currently running would enable the Democrats to showcase the difference in what the party represents compared to the GOP. As a new article in The New York Times shows, the GOP is bleeding young voters with each passing day of the Trump presidency.\n\nWith Biden at the top of the ticket, it would be much more difficult to generate enthusiasm among African-Americans, Latinos or younger voters, for instance, who will be looking to Democrats to prove that they will offer something fundamentally different. While there are early polls showing substantial numbers of African-Americans backing Biden and Sanders, these don't measure the excitement that might be generated on the campaign trail once the other candidates are better known and once their political skills have been proven.\n\nAnd Biden's pivotal role on the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act, which was foundational to the expansion of the mass incarceration system, will come back to haunt him. Like Hillary Clinton, he will have to reckon with his vote authorizing President George W. Bush to use military force in Iraq, baggage that the younger generation of Democrats won't be carrying onto the campaign trail.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nMeanwhile, many educated, suburban women are looking for a candidate who will take seriously the message of the #metoo movement. This is a social movement that has rocked American society, bringing attention to the horrendous ways in which sexism and sexual assault continue to play out in many of our major industries and in our private lives. They won't be happy to hear about his role in the 1991 Clarence Thomas hearings, where he was one of the many senators who did not take seriously the sexual harassment complaints of Anita Hill. He was part of the reason that 1992 saw a surge in female candidates.\n\nThe most successful Democrat in recent decades was Barack Obama, who mobilized a powerful electoral coalition because of the change he represented for the Democratic Party – not because he was the party's safe choice.\n\nOf course, Biden has a right to run – should he so choose. But before Democrats go overboard in shifting their financial and organizational resources, as well as endorsements, to the former vice president, they should think long and hard about whether they want the face of their party to be someone who represents the past – or the future.

France says it is victim of smear campaign\n\nBush administration disputes charge\n\nFrom Andrea Koppel and John King\n\nCNN Washington Bureau\n\n\n\nFrench Ambassador Jean-David Levitte said the United States is spreading misinformation about the French government.\n\nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- France says it is the victim of a smear campaign by the Bush administration, charging some U.S. officials are leaking false stories about alleged French complicity with the Iraqi regime.\n\nThe Bush administration dismissed the charge.\n\nThe French government lays out its claim in a letter written by the French ambassador to the United States, according to a French diplomat familiar with its contents.\n\nThe letter was to have been delivered to the White House and members of Congress Thursday.\n\nThis is not acceptable, said one French diplomat. France does not consider it a policy, but considers that some people have done some damage to the relationship.\n\nOne U.S. official involved in national security matters said the French claim was baseless.\n\nThere are a lot of things we don't like, and we have not been shy about that, said the U.S. official. But there is no campaign against the French.\n\nThe Bush administration has made no secret of its anger following an intense campaign by France earlier this year to block a U.S.-led attempt to win the support of the U.N. Security Council for a second resolution authorizing military action in Iraq.\n\nThe French campaign succeeded and the United States, Great Britain and Spain instead went ahead with a coalition of the willing to invade Iraq without the backing of the United Nations.\n\nIn his letter, French Ambassador Jean-David Levitte cited eight examples of what he describes as proof of a deliberate U.S. campaign to spread misinformation about the French government. CNN has obtained a copy of the list, which accompanies the letter.\n\nWe cannot accept to be accused repeatedly for stories sourced in the administration for things we have not done, said the French diplomat familiar with the letter. Who did this? Why? For what agenda? the diplomat wondered aloud.\n\nAmong the stories cited by the French:\n\n• News reports, quoting administration officials, suggesting France might have sold weapons to Iraq in defiance of U.N. sanctions.\n\n• A Washington Times story reporting U.S. intelligence sources had received information suggesting French officials in Syria were helping members of the Iraqi leadership escape the U.S. military by issuing French passports to them. (Excerpts from the list)\n\nThe passport story had them really hot, said a senior U.S. official. They delivered passionate, heated and repeated denials that any such thing was occurring.\n\nThe official said there was no evidence of the French issuing such passports, and noted the White House never said there was any such evidence.\n\nOn the day of the Washington Times story, however, White House press secretary Ari Fleischer suggested reporters would be better served asking the French whether they provided passports to Iraqi officials.\n\nAt the time Fleischer made that statement at the daily White House briefing, other senior officials privately suggested the story was based on one uncorroborated tip received by U.S. intelligence agencies, and that the information was being investigated but not being treated as true or even necessarily credible.\n\nThat one put them over the top, this official said. Nevertheless, this official and the others denied any coordinated effort to smear the French. Do we have reason to be mad? We think we do, the senior official said.\n\nThis official said the French letter had not been received at the White House, but that there had been official communications suggesting it would be delivered as early as Thursday.\n\nThis official suggested any assertion of an organized campaign is ridiculous and attributed the letter to a sense of resentment by some French officials that U.S. officials have talked of negative ramifications for U.S.-French relations because of the disagreements over Iraq.\n\nDeputy White House press secretary Scott McClellan, when asked about the French complaint, recalled a recent quote from Secretary of State Colin Powell that the United States and France have been in marriage counseling for 200 years.\n\nMcClellan also said the United States and France are allies and that, while differences persist, We are looking to the future.
(CNN) —\n\nA school district in Oregon is accused of a disturbing pattern of intimidation and harassment against LGBTQ students. Among the allegations: Students were forced to read the Bible as punishment, and a teacher compared gay marriage to marrying a dog.\n\nIn a letter this year, the state Department of Education found that the school district in North Bend, a coastal community in southern Oregon, discriminated against students on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\nThere is substantial evidence to support the allegation that the district subjected LGBTQ students to separate or different rules of behavior, sanctions, or other treatment, the letter said.\n\nThe school disputes the findings and will make its case at a hearing May 24. At the time, state officials will determine whether the district violated state and federal anti-discrimination laws.\n\nThe allegations were detailed in a letter from the education department to North Bend School District Superintendent Bill Yester. Among them:\n\nA student said she was hit in the hand with a skateboard by another student who made homophobic comments. When the victim complained to the school resource officer, the officer was dismissive and said homosexuality was a choice and not in line with their personal religious beliefs, the student said.\n\nA student was required by the superintendent to read a passage from the Bible as punishment on at least two occasions. The building administrator acknowledged in an interview with state education officials that he required Bible reading as a form of discipline.\n\nDuring a class discussion, a teacher said If same sex marriage is okay, what about marrying your dog? It's about the same thing.\n\nYester told CNN in a statement that only two of the allegations were ever brought to the district's attention. The statement also said the district tried to mediate the matter with the students during a nine-hour session this month, but it was unsuccessful.

After a series of crushing defeats in the two Super Tuesday contests, Sanders has fallen far behind Biden in the critical race for delegates. But the champion of the party's progressive wing sought to draw out the ideological contrasts with Biden as the former vice president argued that Americans are looking for results, not a revolution.\n\nAs the two candidates tangled over policy throughout the night, Biden repeatedly called for unity among Democrats and made major news by stating he would pick a woman as his running mate.\n\nIf I'm elected president, my Cabinet, my administration will look like the country and I commit that I will, in fact, appoint -- pick a woman to be vice president, Biden said. There are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow. I would pick a woman to be my vice president.\n\nBoth Biden and Sanders said half their Cabinet advisers would be women to match the makeup of the nation, and when pressed Sanders said he would probably also pick a female vice presidential running mate.\n\nIn all likelihood, I will, Sanders said. For me, it's not just nominating a woman. It is making sure that we have a progressive woman and there are progressive women out there. So my very strong tendency is to move in that direction.\n\nA debate in surreal times\n\nThe two men met for their first one-on-one debate Sunday night at a time when many Americans are staying at home in an unprecedented national effort to slow the spread of novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 3,400 people in 49 states and led to at least 65 deaths.\n\nUnderscoring the extraordinary moment in this nation's history, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance moments before the two men took the stage in CNN's Washington bureau -- urging Americans to cancel or postpone in-person gatherings that consist of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks.\n\nBiden, with a grin, offered his elbow as a greeting to Sanders before the two men took their place behind the podiums, which were spaced more than six feet apart in keeping with government's guidelines for social distancing.\n\nAs they both outlined their respective plans to take on the coronavirus, they agreed that government should cover not only the health care costs of those who get sick, but also any lost wages, missed rent or mortgage payments and childcare costs incurred as a result of the illness.\n\nBeyond that, however, the debate illustrated the stark disagreements between the Vermont senator and the former vice president on how far they would go in attempting to restructure government to address income inequality in America.\n\nCasting himself as a champion of working people, Sanders argued that the pandemic has exposed the fragility of the US economy by illuminating the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nWe've got people who are struggling, working two or three jobs to put food on the table. What's going to happen to them? Sanders said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Biden, Sanders debate whether 'Medicare for All' would save lives Replay More Videos ...

It's not going to be solved by how we deal with health care, and then pivoted to his plans for emergency hospitals, enhanced coordination with other nations and his agenda for expanding the nation's testing capacity.\n\nThe former vice president said he would make sure every state in the union had 10 places where Americans could access drive-through testing, while also engaging the Defense Department and Federal Emergency Management Agency to set up emergency 500-bed hospital sites to triage patients.\n\nJUST WATCHED Sanders: Trump is undermining the good work of scientists Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sanders: Trump is undermining the good work of scientists 01:52\n\nHe added that he would try to swiftly deal with the economic fallout from the crisis by helping Americans cover their mortgages and allowing small businesses to borrow interest-free loans.\n\nIf he had the power to act immediately, Sanders said he would move aggressively to make sure that every person in the country who becomes infected would know that they would not lose income, and assure them that all payments will be made. He also touted his plan for Medicare for All as a critical part of the safety net in the midst of this crisis.\n\nI want every person in this country to understand what when you get sick, you go to the doctor. When you get sick, if you have the virus, that will be paid for, Sanders said, explaining what he would want to occur under his administration.\n\nSanders challenged Biden's record\n\nComing at a moment of national uncertainty, the debate underscored the very different positions the two candidates find themselves in right now as Biden has surged ahead of Sanders in delegates. Sanders was the aggressor throughout the night, repeatedly challenging Biden's lengthy Senate record and suggesting the former Delaware senator had acted for political expediency instead of taking more controversial positions that Sanders did.\n\nAn hour into the debate, Sanders reeled off a list of difficult votes that both candidates took in Congress, noting that he and Biden voted differently on the Defense of Marriage Act, the bankruptcy bill and the war in Iraq, which he has said raised questions about Biden's judgment.\n\nI voted against the war in Iraq, which was also a tough vote. You voted for it, Sanders said. I voted against the disastrous trade agreements like (North American Free Trade Agreement), which cost this country over 4 million good-paying jobs. You voted for it. I voted against the Hyde Amendment, which denies low-income women the right to get an abortion. You have consistently voted for it. I don't know what your position is today. ... We can argue about the merits of the bill. It takes courage sometimes to vote and do the right thing.\n\nBiden, with a lighter touch, faulted Sanders for voting against the Brady Bill, which contained measures to try to prevent gun violence like enhanced background checks and noted that Sanders voted against legislation that prevented gun manufacturers from being sued. Still, Sanders pointed to his consistency, which is what has endeared him most to his supporters.\n\nWe can argue this or that bill, but what I'm suggesting is that in this time of crisis when we are living in a really, really unsettling world -- economically, from a health care perspective with the coronavirus -- the people of America know my record, the Vermont senator said.\n\nBiden's priority at this time, however, is to try and persuade Sanders supporters to back him if he becomes the Democratic nominee, and he often noted areas where they agreed on Sunday -- including his new support for the bankruptcy plan of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and a new announcement that he'll support free college tuition for students in households making less than $125,000.\n\nCharacter of the nation is on the ballot, Biden said. Sen. Sanders and I both agree we need -- health care should be a right, not a privilege. We both agree we have to deal with student debt. We both agree we have to deal with education and access to education. We both agree that we have a New Green Deal to deal with the existential threat that faces humanity. We disagree on the detail of how we do it. But we don't disagree on the principle. We fundamentally disagree with this president on everything.\n\nA race transformed\n\nSome of their sharpest exchanges were over electability. Noting the youth and energy of his supporters, the Vermont senator argued that Biden would not be able to muster the kind of excitement that would be need among his backers to take on Trump.\n\nSanders framed his coalition as a multiracial, multi-generational grassroots movement, acknowledging Biden's advantage in the delegate count but pointing to the energy of his supporters.\n\nJoe has won more states than I have. But here's what we are winning, Sanders said. We are winning the ideological struggle. Even in Mississippi where Joe won a major victory, it turns out that a pretty good majority of the folks there believe in Medicare for All. That's true in almost every state in this country.\n\nWe are winning the generational struggle. Depending on the state, we're winning people 50 years of age or younger. Big time -- people 30 years of age and younger, Sanders said. Look if I lose this thing -- Joe wins -- Joe, I will be there for you. But I have my doubts about how you win a general election against Trump -- who will be a very, very tough opponent -- unless you have energy, excitement, the largest voter turnout in history.\n\nIn one of his more cutting retorts, Biden pointed to his victories and the rise in turnout in many of the states where he has done well, arguing that his message is resonating across the board.\n\nLet's get this straight. The energy and excitement that's taken place so far has been for me, Biden said. Seventy percent turnout increase in Virginia. I can go down the list. ... And I didn't even have the money to compete with this man in those states.\n\nIn one of the more human moments, both candidates were asked how they were confronting the unique risks facing Americans of advanced age with the coronavirus.\n\nBiden and Sanders have both suspended their rallies, directed their aides to work from home and have avoided shaking hands.\n\nSanders, who is 78 and had a heart attack last year, said he's very careful about the people I am interacting with.\n\nI'm using a lot of soap and hand sanitizers to make sure that I do not get the infection, the Vermont senator said. And I have to say, thank God right now I do not have any symptoms and I feel very grateful for that.\n\nBiden, who is 77, pointedly noted that he does not have underlying conditions and said he was in good health.\n\nI wash my hands God knows how many times a day, Biden said. I carry with me, in my bag outside here, hand sanitizer. I don't know how many times a day I use that. I make sure I don't touch my face and so on. I'm taking all the precautions we're telling everybody else to take.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments throughout the debate.
She worked for a foreign trade company in China's southern metropolis of Guangzhou, earned a decent income and spent her weekends hanging out with friends. But to Su and her parents, there was one problem -- she was single.\n\nBack then, I felt like 30 years old was such an important threshold. When it loomed closer, I came under tremendous pressure to find the right person to marry -- both from my parents and myself, she said.\n\nNow 31, Su is still single, but says she is no longer worried. What's the point of making do with someone you don't like, and then divorcing in a couple of years? It's only a waste of time, she said.\n\nSu is among a growing number of Chinese millennials who are postponing or eschewing marriage entirely. In just six years, the number of Chinese people getting married for the first time has fallen by a crushing 41%, from 23.8 million in 2013 to 13.9 million in 2019, according to data released by China's National Bureau of Statistics\n\nThe decline is partly due to decades of policies designed to limit China's population growth, which mean there are fewer young people in China available to be married, according to Chinese officials and sociologists. But it's also a result of changing attitudes to marriage, especially among young women, some of whom are growing disillusioned with the institution for its role in entrenching gender inequality, experts say.\n\nIn extreme cases, some even took to social media to insult wives as being a married donkey, a derogatory term used to describe submissive women who conform to patriarchal rules within marriage, said Xiao Meili, a leading voice in China's feminist movement.\n\nXiao Meili is a leading voice in China's feminist movement.\n\nThis kind of personal attack is wrong, but it shows the strong fear towards marriage felt by many. They hope all women can realize that marriage is an unfair institution to both the individual, and to female as a whole, and thus turn away from it, said Xiao, who once walked 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) to call for reform of China's child sexual abuse laws.\n\nThe declining marriage rate is a problem for Beijing\n\nefforts to avert a Getting young people to have children is central to itsefforts to avert a looming population crisis that could severely distress its economic and social stability -- and potentially pose a risk to Chinese Communist Party rule.\n\nMarriage and reproduction are closely related. The decline in the marriage rate will affect the birth rate, which in turn affects economic and social developments, Yang Zongtao, an official with the Ministry of Civil Affairs, said at a news conference last year.\n\nThis (issue) should be brought to the forefront, he said, adding that the ministry will improve relevant social policies and enhance propaganda efforts to guide the public to establish positive values on love, marriage and family.\n\nAlarming statistics\n\nIn 2019, China's marriage rate plunged for the sixth year in a row to 6.6 per 1,000 people -- a 33% drop from 2013 and the lowest level in 14 years, according to data from the Ministry of Civil Affairs.\n\nChinese officials have attributed the decline to a drop in the number of people of marriageable age, due to the one-child policy, a deliberate strategy introduced in 1979 to control China's population.\n\nBut demographers have been warning for years of a looming population crisis. In 2014, the country's working-age population started to shrink for the first time in more than three decades, alarming Chinese leaders.\n\nThe next year, the Chinese government announced an end to the one-child policy, allowing couples to have two children. It went into force on January 1, 2016, but both marriage and birth rates have dropped anyway. Between 2016 and 2019, birth declined from 13 per 1,000 people to 10 -- a trend not helped by the fact women are emancipating and millennials have different values.\n\nThe decline of marriage is not unique to China. Across the globe , marriage rates have fallen over the past few decades, especially in richer Western countries. Compared with other East Asian societies like Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan, China still has the highest marriage rate, said Wei-Jun Jean Yeung, a sociologist at the National University of Singapore who has studied marriage and family across Asian societies.\n\nBut no other country has tried to social engineer its population in the way China did with its one-child policy.\n\nThat policy has also affected marriages in other ways, Yeung said. Chinese families' traditional preference for sons has led to a skewed sex ratio at birth, especially in rural areas. Currently, China has a surplus of more than 30 million men, who will face a hard time looking for brides.\n\nA man looks at a painting named 'Better To Have Only One Child' at the China National Art Museum in Beijing in 2012.\n\nSocial economic changes\n\nDemographic changes alone don't explain the drastic drop in China's marriage rate. Women are becoming more educated, and economically more independent.\n\nboost university enrollments. By 2016, women started In the 1990s, the Chinese government accelerated the rollout of nine-year compulsory education, bringing girls in poverty-stricken areas into the classroom. In 1999, the government expanded higher education toboost university enrollments. By 2016, women started outnumbering men in higher education programs, accounting for 52.5% of college students and 50.6% of postgraduate students.\n\nWith increased education, women gained economic independence, so marriage is no longer a necessity for women as it was in the past, Yeung said. Women now want to pursue self-development and a career for themselves before they get married.\n\nIt's not just marrying someone, it's to marry the in-laws, take care of children -- there are a lot of responsibilities that come with marriage. Wei-Jun Jean Yeung, a sociologist\n\nBut gender norms and patriarchal traditions have not caught up with these changes. In China, many men and parents-in-law still expect women to carry out most of the childcare and housework after marriage, even if they have full-time jobs.\n\nThe whole package of marriage is too hard. It's not just marrying someone, it's to marry the in-laws, take care of children -- there are a lot of responsibilities that come with marriage, Yeung said.\n\nMeanwhile, job discrimination against women is commonplace, making it difficult for women to have both a career and children.\n\nMore and more young women are thinking: Why am I doing this? What's in there for me? said Li Xuan, an assistant professor of psychology at New York University Shanghai who researches families. (The gender inequality) is really making young Chinese female hesitate before getting into the institution of marriage.\n\nTo make matter worse, the grueling long hours and high pressure at work have left young people little time and energy to build relationships and maintain a family life, Li said.\n\nA couple marks fingerprints on ceremonial calligraphy during a traditional group wedding in Changsha, China.\n\nStatistics show both genders are delaying marriage. From 1990 to 2016, the average age for first marriages rose from 22 to 25 for Chinese women, and from 24 to 27 for Chinese men, according to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences\n\nThe figures in big cities are even higher. For example, in Shanghai in 2015, the average age for first marriages was 30 for men and 28 for women.\n\nSu, the 31-year-old from Guangzhou, has often heard from married friends about the burden that comes with married life.\n\nNowadays, women's economic capability has improved, so it's actually quite nice to live alone. If you find a man to marry and form a family, there will be much more stress and your life quality will decrease accordingly, she said.\n\nThe increased social and economic status of women has also made it more difficult to find a suitable partner for two groups at the opposite ends of the marriage market: highly educated, high-earning women and low-educated, low-income men.\n\nTraditionally, Chinese women want to 'marry up' -- that means marrying someone with higher education and income than themselves -- and men want to 'marry down,' Yeung said. That preference has largely remained in place, despite the rising education and income levels status of women.\n\nShifting values\n\nThere has also been a shift in values towards love and marriage -- changes that have come a long way since the founding of modern China.\n\nDuring Mao's era, marriage wasn't a personal choice, said Pan Wang, an expert on marriage in China at the University of New South Wales. During the Great Leap Forward, the ruling Communist Party encouraged people to have as many children as possible, as the country needed labor to build a socialist economy. Marriage, therefore, played a key role in socialism and nation building, she said.\n\nIn 1950, China passed the New Marriage Law, which outlawed arranged marriages and concubines, and enabled women to divorce their husbands. But in practice, arranged marriages remained commonplace, and the language of freedom of marriage and divorce was not translated into the freedom of love, Pan said.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution period, when you talked about love, that was (seen as) something capitalist, something people needed to struggle against, she said.\n\nStudents waving copies of Chairman Mao Zedong's Little Red Book parade in the streets of Beijing in June 1966 at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nMuch has changed since then. Having grown up with more freedoms than their parents and grandparents after China's reform and opening up, some Chinese millennials no longer see the institution of marriage as an obligation, but a personal choice.\n\nIncreasing social acceptance of cohabitation and premarital sex, as well as the wide availability of contraception and abortion, has enabled young people to enjoy romantic relationships outside the legal institution of marriage. They see marriage as an expression of their emotional connection, not just a means of reproduction.\n\nStar Tong, 32, used to believe that romance, marriage and childbirth are things that should happen once a girl hits her mid-20s. Worried about being single, she attended about 10 blind dates -- mostly set up by her parents -- after she turned 25.\n\nBut none of them worked out -- Tong insists on finding a partner who shares her values and interests, and refuses to settle for someone just for the sake of tying the knot.\n\nNow I've realized getting married is not the only option, she said,And it's totally fine to just be by myself -- I'm perfectly happy, have plenty of friends, and can focus my attention on advancing my career and taking care of myself and my parents.\n\nTong said she felt encouraged by what she saw as a shift in society's attitudes towards single women.\n\nIn 2007, the state-backed All-China Women's Federation used leftover women to describe unmarried women over 27 years old. Later in the year, the Ministry of Education even added the term to the official lexicon, further popularizing its use.\n\nSince then, the term has frequently made headlines and dominated online discussions, often as a criticism of highly educated women deemed too picky in the search of a partner. In recent years, the term has drawn criticism from feminists and scholars, and in 2017, the flagship newspaper of the Women's Federation said it would no longer use the discriminatory term in its coverage.\n\nDuring festive family gatherings, Tong was often lectured by relatives not to be too picky when looking for a partner. I used to think 'picky' is a derogatory term, she said. But now, I think it's about me choosing what I want. And there's nothing wrong in that.\n\nRising costs\n\nThen there is the problem of the cost.\n\nFor many Chinese families, buying a home is a prerequisite for marriage. But many young couples simply don't have the money to pay for an expensive property -- and not every parent has enough savings to help out.\n\nLi Xuan, the psychologist at NYU Shanghai, said even if buying an apartment is not necessarily wanted by everyone, the social and welfare system in China is built in such a way that home ownership has become almost crucial for couples looking for a better future for their children.\n\nA couple poses during a wedding photo shoot next to Yangtze River in Wuhan, China.\n\nFor example, owning a home near a good school grants access to high-quality education for their children, and wealthy couples are often willing to pay a high price for these coveted properties.\n\nEverything about getting married costs money, but I can't make money faster than these expenses. Joanna Wang, a 24-year-old student\n\nJoanna Wang, a 24-year-old student from the southwestern city of Chengdu, has been with her boyfriend for three years. The university sweethearts plan to live together in Shanghai when she graduates from her Master's program in Hong Kong, but have no immediate plans to marry.\n\nEverything about getting married costs money, but I can't make money faster than these expenses, she said.\n\nAnd the financial pressure is not only being felt in cities. In rural areas, the families of grooms must pay a bride price to her family -- usually in the form of a large sum of cash, or a house. The practice has existed in China for centuries, but the costs have soared in recent decades due to the worsening gender imbalance -- namely a surplus of rural bachelors, due to the one-child policy and rapid urbanization, which has encouraged many women to move to cities for work.\n\nThe Chinese government is worried\n\nThe government wants to keep new kids coming, said Li, the psychologist from NYU Shanghai.\n\nA one-child policy billboard saying, Have less children, have a better life greets residents on the main street of Shuangwang in southern China in 2007.\n\nFollowing the two-child policy, provincial governments extended maternity leave beyond the 98 days mandated by national standards, with the highest reaching 190 days. Some cities also started giving cash subsidies to couples with a second child.\n\nIn 2019, several delegates to the National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp legislature, proposed lowering the minimum marriage age to 18 for both sexes from 22 for men and 20 for women, to encourage young couples to marry earlier and have more babies. But the proposal drew criticism and ridicule online, with many pointing out that it is the social and financial pressure, instead of legal age limits, that has led young people to put off marriage.\n\nMeanwhile, the Communist Youth League -- the CCP's youth branch -- has picked up the task of matchmaking, holding mass blind dating events to help singletons find life partners.\n\nAuthorities are not only encouraging young people to get married, they are also trying to keep married couples together.\n\nLast year, China's national legislature introduced a 30-day cooling-off period for people filing for divorce, which went into force this year. The new law provoked criticism online, especially from women, who fear it will make it harder to leave a broken marriage -- especially for victims of domestic violence.\n\nBut so far, none of these policies appear to have reversed the fall in marriage rates.\n\nA big part of the problem, according to experts, is none of the policies address the entrenched gender inequality that has deterred young women from entering the institution of marriage and family life -- such as traditional gender roles and job market discrimination against women.\n\nLi said she has observed a revival of more traditional gender roles in government propaganda in recent years. It has a lot to do with governmental plans, and how the government sees young men and women as social resources, she said.\n\nNowadays, there's a very strong need for care work given the culture of intensive parenting and the growing number of elderly. With the retreat of state welfare, we need more and more people to shoulder childcare and elderly care, and women are the 'default' pool of labor for such work. So I think that is part of the reason for them to be pushing women back into the family life.\n\n(The government) shouldn't treat women's uterus as a water tap, one that they can turn off and on as they wish. Xiao Meili, a feminist activist\n\nDiscrimination against women at work has also worsened since the relaxation of the one-child policy, as employers worry that women will now have a second child and take more maternity leave, said Xiao, the activist.\n\nWith these problems unresolved, the pressure from the state for young women to get married, stay married and have children will only further estrange them from it, she said.\n\n(The government) needs to change its way of thinking and encourage women to give birth from the aspects of protecting women's rights. They shouldn't treat women's uterus as a water tap, one that they can turn off and on as they wish, Xiao added.
(CNN) —\n\nThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel certainly sounds better than the more descriptive title for Amazon's latest period drama, inasmuch as The Marginal Mrs. Maisel doesn't have quite the same ring to it.\n\nGilmore Girls creator Amy Sherman-Palladino (working with her husband, Daniel Palladino) assembles an interesting concept and stellar cast, but this late-1950s dramedy – which uses a fictional point of entry into the real-life stand-up scene of the era – is too stagey and precious in the telling to merit consistent applause.\n\nMrs. Maisel's flaws are in spite of its title character, not because of her. Rachel Brosnahan (House of Cards) is delightful as Midge, a housewife whose seemingly idyllic world is suddenly turned upside down when her husband (Michael Zegen), a wannabe comic, is exposed as an adulterer.\n\nIt's what happens next, and much of what ensues after, which feels a trifle forced, as Midge in short order discovers her own knack for comedy, meeting an enthusiastic backer (Alex Borstein) who wants to manage her and legendary bad-boy comic Lenny Bruce (Luke Kirby), who also encourages her to pursue it.\n\nThe flurry of events, beginning with Midge's crumbling marriage, comes as a rather enormous shock to her parents and in-laws, as she begins to lead what amounts to a double life. Yet while the idea of a woman trying to break through in the male-dominated comedy field during the Eisenhower years has promise, the seat-of-the-pants way she stumbles along somewhat undermines it.\n\nSimilarly, Sherman-Palladino's trademark rat-a-tat banter feels extra-stilted funneled through this nice Jewish girl and her extended circle, until everyone sounds the same – as if they're participating in a Catskills comedy skit. That doesn't mean there aren't funny lines and solid sequences, like one involving Shalhoub and Pollak in a later episode, only that the nature of the dialogue yields diminishing, bordering-on-monotonous returns.\n\nIt's too bad, since as noted there's a lot to like here, from Brosnahan to the period trappings and music. But frankly, Amazon had and canceled a more fully realized drama about women and the sexism they faced — both systemic and casual — with its fact-based series Good Girls Revolt, about female journalists in the 1960s.\n\nMrs. Maisel premieres at an odd moment for the streaming service, after separate sexual-harassment allegations triggered a management change and have threatened to derail Amazon's signature series Transparent, amid a re-evaluation of its larger strategy. Nevertheless, the show received an early vote of confidence with a two-season order prior to its premiere.\n\nWhile this newcomer might eventually reward that faith, having previewed four episodes, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel simply doesn't feel like another genuine headliner, at a time when Amazon needs to deliver one.\n\nThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel premieres Nov. 29 on Amazon.

In addition to entrepreneur and Def Jam Recordings co-founder Russell Simmons, who helped organize the event, attendees were scheduled to hear from rabbis, imams, a Sikh, a Buddhist, Episcopalian and Presbyterian reverends, a Mennonite, a Seventh Day Adventist minister, a Hindu, a Baptist pastor, local politicians and civil rights advocates.\n\nActor Susan Sarandon and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio also spoke, and former first daughter Chelsea Clinton tweeted that the rally marked her 2-year-old's first protest.\n\nSimmons, no stranger to activism, told those at the rally to focus on how Trump, his onetime friend, had unified the people in attendance.\n\nRegardless of your background, your faith or where you were born, this is your city. - @NYCMayor #IAmAMuslimToo pic.twitter.com/XU6vnBmlt5 — Coexist Peace (@coexistpeace) February 19, 2017\n\nThank you to all who organized #IAmAMuslimToo today - Charlotte's 1st protest rally. #NoBanNoWallNoRaids pic.twitter.com/5mSXGQtPJU — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) February 19, 2017\n\nWe won't speak too harshly of him today. We want to thank him for bringing us together, he said.\n\nHe decried those who would demonize Muslims as terrorists when, in fact, Muslims have been the victims of terrorism and stand as allies in the fight against extremism.\n\nSo we are here today to show middle America our beautiful signs and, through our beautiful actions and intention, that they have been misled – that the seeds of hate that were small and maybe just ignorance cannot be watered, and that hate cannot grow because we are here to assist them in promoting love, Simmons told the crowd.\n\nBrooklyn-born Palestinian-American activist and commentator Linda Sarsour noted that Sunday marked the 75th anniversary of President Franklin Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066, which paved the way for the internment of Japanese-, German- and Italian-Americans.\n\nJapanese-Americans mark anniversary of incarceration\n\nShe asked those in attendance to commit to being part of the true never-again generation.\n\n.@lsarsour is unapologetically Muslim.

I am not afraid because fear is a choice; it is not a fact. So today I ask you, in the true grit and spirit of a New Yorker, that you choose courage in the face of fear.\n\nHip-hop icon enters 'All-American Muslim' fray\n\nThis isn't the first time Simmons has urged New Yorkers to identify as Muslims as a form of protest. Rabbi Marc Schneier and Imam Shamsi Ali, who helped organize Sunday's event, joined Simmons before a much smaller Times Square crowd in 2011 to protest congressional hearings on Islamic terrorism.\n\nSimmons also took part in Occupy Wall Street protests and has been an outspoken supporter of marriage equality, animal rights and overturning what he's criticized as harsh drug laws.\n\nIn December 2015, Simmons wrote his old friend Trump, urging him to stop the bullsh** in regard to the soon-to-be US President's call to ban Muslims from entering the United States.\n\nHow Trump's tweets affected travel ban\n\nDon't feed into the rhetoric created by small-minded people. You're smarter and certainly more loving than you let on, Simmons wrote. I know the cheap seats are easy to play to, but you can get them just by being the man I have known for nearly 30 years.
(CNN) A new poll shows that an unprecedented number of US adults identify as LGBTQ -- and that young people, especially Generation Z, are driving the increase.\n\nGallup reported a jump from 4.5% to 5.6% of Americans who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer since its last poll in 2017\n\nThe finding provesa steady rise in LGBTQ identification since the analytics company began tracking in 2012, and constitutes, based on the US Census Bureau 's most recent population count, nearly 18 million Americans.\n\nBut LGBTQ advocacy groups aren't surprised.\n\nAlphonso David, president of the Human Rights Campaign, told CNN that the data confirms what advocates have long suspected: There are more LGBTQ people in the US than statistics reflect.\n\nWe've always had LGBTQ people in this country, he said. The question is whether they identify as LGBTQ -- meaning the label itself -- and whether they're comfortable publicly identifying.\n\nAre people newly LGBTQ, or is it just safer to say so?\n\nThe rising numbers raise the question of whether more identification reflects more LGBTQ people -- or just more people willing to self-identify.\n\nDavid said he leans toward the latter, citing pro-equality legislation as a driver of the increase.\n\nSeveral decades ago, LGBTQ identity and conduct were illegal in several states, he said. As we remove the vestiges of bias and discrimination from our laws, we see more LGBTQ people come out of the shadows.\n\nLeading the migration from the shadows is Gen Z -- young adults aged 18 to 23 -- which, in the poll, accounted for 15.9% of LGBTQ American adults.\n\nYoung people, David said, weren't around during the years when being LGBTQ was criminal. And they're able to view issues of identity in a different, less fearful way.\n\nThey're not looking at sexuality and gender identity through a lens of fear and stigma, he said. Many of them are looking at gender identity and sexual orientation as just a factor in what makes them who they are.\n\nThe majority of LGBTQ Americans identify as bisexual\n\nAs fear and stigma unravel, so do myths surrounding specific identities.\n\nGallup's report reveals that the majority of LGBTQ-identifying Americans -- 54.6% -- say they are bisexual.\n\nDavid said he attributes this to both a marked increase in bisexual visibility and the social establishment of bisexuality as a valid sexual orientation.\n\nThere is more educational material debunking the myth that being bisexual is akin to not picking a side, he said. That's a myth ... the reality is that bisexuality is an orientation.\n\nFollowing the majority which identify as bisexual, the poll shows that nearly a quarter of LGBTQ adults -- 24.5% -- identify as gay, followed by 11.7% as lesbian and 11.3% as transgender.\n\nBut will legislation rise to meet them?\n\nThe unprecedented number of LGBTQ Americans confronts the reality that half of US states lack basic protections -- such as nondiscrimination policies in employment and housing.\n\nThe first month of 2021 alone saw lawmakers in at least 14 states propose anti-LGBTQ bills.\n\nAnd while Americans are increasingly supportive of LGBTQ rights such as same-sex marriage , comprehensive federal protection against discrimination is lacking.\n\nDavid said passing the Equality Act -- a bill that would protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in commercial and public life -- is a key step toward effective protection.\n\nLast year, the Equality Act passed in the US House of Representatives but was not taken up by the Senate. It was reintroduced in the House last week.\n\nLooking forward, David said he expects that more LGBTQ people will continue to identify publicly in ways they were previously unwilling to.
Buenos Aires (CNN) Former Argentine President Carlos Menem died on Sunday, his daughter, Zulema Menem, has confirmed to CNN. He was 90 years old.\n\nMenem took office in July 1989 and promoted laws to reform the government and the economy after his predecessor, Raúl Alfonsín, resigned in the middle of a deep financial crisis caused by hyperinflation. Menem privatized some companies that had until that point been under state authority and was able to get inflation under control.\n\nMenem left office in 1999 after unsuccessfully trying to modify the constitution to run for a third term. He ran again for the presidency in 2003, obtaining the highest percentage of votes during the first round of elections, but ultimately decided against advancing to the second round.\n\nHe remained active in politics by becoming a senator with the Justicialist Party representing La Rioja province from 2005 until 2019. He then joined forces with the Peronist coalition called Front of All and was re-elected to another term that would have run until 2023.\n\nMenem had three children with his wife Zulema Yoma, before the couple divorced in 1991. He later married Chilean TV host and actress Cecilia Bolocco, with whom he had one child. Their marriage ended 10 years later.\n\nRead More
Story highlights Cuckolding has become fetishized into a powerful sexual fantasy for some Sometimes just sharing a sexy thought can be arousing enough -- you don't have to follow through\n\n(CNN) —\n\nIn our current political climate, the term cuck – short for cuckservative – has become an insult of the so-called alt-right, aimed at men they view as spineless and emasculated. The slur has its roots in the concept of cuckolding, or having an adulterous partner.\n\nBut, according to a recent study by David Ley, Justin Lehmiller and the writer Dan Savage, acting on cuckolding fantasies can be a largely positive experience for many couples, and hardly a sign of weakness.\n\nReferences to cuckolding appear in literature as early as the 13th century, usually in the form of male characters who fear that their child has been sired by another man during an act of infidelity. Today, however, cuckolding has become fetishized into a powerful sexual fantasy for some men, who get aroused by the idea of their romantic partner engaging in sexual activity with someone else. Women also share this fantasy, but less so than men.\n\nThis fantasy has been around as long as marriage and sexuality, said Ley, whose book Insatiable Wives addresses cuckolding in heterosexual couples. But we're hearing more and more about it these days, and more people are rejecting the social stigma against this fantasy.\n\nIndeed, the numbers suggest that cuckolding, or at least thinking about it, is more common than you might imagine. For his forthcoming book, Tell Me What You Want: The Science of Sexual Desire and How It Can Help Improve Your Sex Life, Lehmiller surveyed thousands of Americans and found that 58% of men and about a third of women had fantasized about cuckolding.\n\nMen are more likely to fantasize about cuckolding, and they do it more often – but there are a number of women who have these fantasies as well, which points to the need for more research focused on women's cuckolding desires, Lehmiller said.\n\nInitially viewed as a heterosexual phenomenon, it's increasingly prevalent among gay men, too. I'd long gotten letters from straight couples into cuckolding (usually initiated by the husband), but none from gay couples until after marriage equality began to gather steam, explained writer and activist Savage. To learn more, Savage joined with Lehmiller and Ley for a study of cuckolding fantasies and experiences in 580 gay men.\n\nTheir findings suggest that there are similarities between the way gay and straight men view cuckolding, but clear differences, too. Most notably, interracial and BDSM themes don't appear to be as common in gay men's cuckolding fantasies as they are among heterosexual men. The motivations behind these fantasies may also be different.\n\nPart of what makes cuckolding arousing for heterosexual men is that they tend to view it as a taboo act. In a society or culture that idealizes monogamy, the cuckold fantasy is a current narrative that is available to people to conceptualize their sexual fantasies, said Ley.\n\nBut that may not be an influence for everyone. For gay men, cuckolding isn't quite as taboo because the norm of lifelong monogamy isn't so strong in the LGBT community; however, it can still be arousing for a number of other reasons, said Lehmiller. For instance, fantasies about voyeurism and group sex seem to overlap with those about cuckolding in these men. It's a sexual desire that can be easily customized to meet a wide range of sexual needs and desires, whether it's taboo sex, novelty, voyeurism or something else, he told me.\n\nAnd the emotions surrounding seeing your partner with someone else can add to the turn-on, explained Savage. It's not cuckolding if there isn't an element of humiliation, degradation or denial, he said. Our erotic imaginations have the ability to turn shame lemons into delicious kink lemonade.\n\nAs a sex therapist, one of the more intriguing findings from this study involves the impact of cuckolding on relationships.\n\nOverall, our research found that for the most part, cuckolding tends to be a positive fantasy and behavior, said Ley. It doesn't appear to be evidence of disturbance, of an unhealthy relationship, or of disregard for one's partner. But there's an important caveat, added Lehmiller. We found several personality factors that predict more positive experiences acting on cuckolding fantasies. For those who have a lot of relationship anxiety or abandonment issues, who lack intimacy and communication, and who aren't careful, detail-oriented planners, acting on a consensual non-monogamy fantasy could very well be a negative experience, he said. In other words, not everyone who has a cuckolding fantasy should think about acting on it.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nRemember that sometimes just sharing a sexy thought can be arousing enough – you don't have to follow through. If you are thinking about acting on a cuckolding fantasy, it's worth stepping back first and making sure your relationship is in a good place and that you have strong sexual communication skills.\n\nFor men and couples considering the issue of cuckolding, it's important there be honesty, integrity, communication, mutuality and shared values, advised Ley. I've seen men who try to trick their wives into cuckolding them, and this never, ever ends up well.\n\nFor couples who do decide to move forward, it's important to take things slow. The reality of watching your spouse have sex with someone else – or knowing they're doing it, if you're not there – is often very different than the fantasy. It can dredge up powerful emotions, so take baby steps and keep talking and communicating, said Savage. That said, the rewards can be amazing, according to couples who have successfully folded cuckold play into their relationships.\n\nIan Kerner is a licensed psychotherapist and sexuality counselor in New York City.

Aired 10:30-11a ET\n\nAired March 11, 2016 - 10:30 ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\n[10:30:57] CAROL COSTELLO, CNN ANCHOR: And good morning. I'm Carol Costello. Thank you so much for joining me.\n\n\n\nNo consequences this morning for Donald Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. He's accused of throwing a Breitbart reporter to the ground and bruising her arm.\n\n\n\nBut that's not the only controversy surrounding violence at Trump rallies. Take a look at what happened this week at a rally in North Carolina.\n\n\n\nOK. I'm sure you caught it. Here you see it. You're going to see it from other angles. There you have it. This is 78-year-old John McGraw, the one throwing the punch. He's charged with assault and disorderly conduct for sucker punching a man named Rakeem Jones. What's more surprising is how McGraw reacted after his alleged punch.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Did you like the event?\n\n\n\nJOHN MCGRAW, CHARGED WITH ASSAULTING TRUMP PROTESTER: You bet I liked it.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Yes? What did you like about it?\n\n\n\nMCGRAW: Knocking the hell out of that big mouth. We don't know who he is, but we know he's not acting like an American.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: So he deserved it?\n\n\n\nMCGRAW: Every bit of it.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: What was that?\n\n\n\nMCGRAW: Yes, he deserved it. The next time we see him, we might have to kill him.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: Mr. Trump did not totally denounce that attack, but did say it's got to stop.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have some protesters who are bad dudes. They have done bad things. They are swinging. They are really dangerous, and they get in there and they start hitting people, and we had a couple of big, strong, powerful guys doing damage to people not only the loudness. The loudness, I don't mind, but doing serious damage, and if they have to be taken out, to be honest, I mean, we have to run something. And it's not me. It's usually the municipal government, the police because I don't have guards all over these stadiums.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: All right. As I said, this isn't the first time a protester has been roughed up at a Trump rally. There have actually been a series of incidents.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTRUMP: Notice, in case you see, the security guys, we have wonderful security guys. They said, Mr. Trump, there may be somebody with tomatoes in the audience. So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. I will pay for the legal fees, I promise.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (EXPLETIVE DELETED)\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Leave.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (EXPLETIVE DELETED)\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let him get up. Let him get up.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let him get up.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Light the (EXPLETIVE DELETED) on fire.\n\n\n\nTRUMP: He can't. They send their product -- bye, bye. Do you know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? They'd be carried out in a stretcher, folks. He's walking out like big high fives, smile, laughing, I'd like to punch him in the face, I'll tell you.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: OK. It's not just the protesters. It's members of the media, too. Trump's campaign manager now accused of grabbing a Breitbart reporter's arm and throwing her to the ground. There was a witness to this alleged attack, and Politico obtained audio of two reporters talking about the incident.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Trump, you went after the late Scalia for affirmative action. Do you still -- are you still against affirmative action?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You OK?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (EXPLETIVE DELETED)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, he just like threw you down.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I can't believe he just did that. Was that Corey?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Like, what threat were you?\n\n\n\n[10:35:03] UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That was insane.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You should have felt how hard he grabbed me. That's insane. My gosh. I've never had anyone do that to me from a campaign.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski denies the accusation. He did that in a tweet from this morning, quote, Michelle Fields, you are totally delusional. I never touched, end quote. And it seems like his boss has his back.\n\n\n\nHere's what Trump told CNN about the incident in the spin room post- debate.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTRUMP: We're surrounded by Secret Service. We had many Secret Service. You see some of them here. When we left, I spoke to them. Nothing happened. This was, in my opinion, made up.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: But Fields tweeted a picture of the bruise on her arm saying, quote, I guess these just magically appeared on my arm. So weird.\n\n\n\nSo let's talk about all of this. Joining me now to discuss, Katrina Pierson, national spokeswoman for the Trump campaign. I'm also joined by Sabrina Schaffer, the executive director of the Independent Women's Forum.\n\n\n\nSabrina Schaeffer, welcome. And Jamie Weinstein, a senior editor of the Daily Caller. Welcome to\n\n\n\nall of you.\n\n\n\nKATRINA PIERSON, NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON, TRUMP CAMPAIGN: Thank you, Carol.\n\n\n\nSABRINA SCHAEFFER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: Thank you, Carol.\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: Thanks for being here. Jamie, I want to start with you because Michelle Fields is your girlfriend. What did she say happened at that rally with Corey Lewandowski?\n\n\n\nJAMIE WEINSTEIN, SENIOR EDITOR, DAILY CALLER: Well, let's be very clear here. What the Trump campaign is saying, to believe what they're saying in denying these allegations, you have to believe an elaborate conspiracy theory. You have to believe that there was a coordination between The Washington Post and Breitbart which is a generally pro-Trump publication to come up with a conspiracy to impugn Donald Trump and his campaign, and then you have to think that they came up with audio in order to support this.\n\n\n\nThis is the type of thing that one believes if they believe 9/11 is an inside job. And the Trump campaign should be ashamed for impugning the character and integrity of my girlfriend who was assaulted at that event. And I think Katrina Pearson knows the truth of this. And for her to stand by and allow these attacks to go on is shameful, utterly, totally shameful.\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: Katrina?\n\n\n\nPIERSON: You know, it's interesting that we have two journalists who have decided to take the word of an alleged attack. There were hundreds of reporters in that room, cameras, microphones, Secret Service. No one saw anyone get thrown to the ground. OK. So that's number one.\n\n\n\nNumber two, Corey Lewandowski did not do this. Even the audio shows, allegedly, Corey saying thank you, and the incident happened after the fact. So it did not happen, and yes, that is your girlfriend, and there is a record of similar statements for other people, particularly the Daily Caller.\n\n\n\nWEINSTEIN: That's disgusting, Katrina.\n\n\n\nPIERSON: Particularly even in the past.\n\n\n\nSCHAEFFER: Maybe I can --\n\n\n\nWEINSTEIN: That is disgusting.\n\n\n\nPIERSON: No, it's not disgusting.\n\n\n\nWEINSTEIN: You should be ashamed.\n\n\n\nPIERSON: This did not happen. WEINSTEIN: You should be ashamed.\n\n\n\nSCHAEFFER: Carol --\n\n\n\nWEINSTEIN: You know her, Katrina. You know my girlfriend, and you know what you're saying is a lie.\n\n\n\nPIERSON: Which is exactly why -- which is exactly -- I do know Michelle and I like Michelle.\n\n\n\nSCHAEFFER: I think we need to take a step back.\n\n\n\nPIERSON: And I do believe someone grabbed her. Someone did grab her, but it was not Corey Lewandowski. Everyone knows when the media --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: So, Katrina --\n\n\n\nSCHAEFFER: Carol, Carol.\n\n\n\nWEINSTEIN: Well, Donald Trump just said no one grabbed here. What's the story, Katrina? What's the story from the Trump line right now? Donald Trump said no one ground her and she made it up. Now you're saying that some did grab her.\n\n\n\nPIERSON: No. He's saying, Corey Lewandowski.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSCHAEFFER: Can I -- can I -- I'm going to jump in here for a second and remind -- Carol. OK. I want to remind people.\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: Wait, wait. Everybody, stop for just a second.\n\n\n\nKatrina, you say someone grabbed Miss Fields. Who was it if it wasn't Corey Lewandowski?\n\n\n\nPIERSON: Look, what I'm saying is --\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: Who was it?\n\n\n\nPIERSON: No, what I'm saying is Michelle Fields said she was grabbed. Then she was probably grabbed. What I'm saying is it was not Corey Lewandowski. It was a campaign manager. That's what I'm saying.\n\n\n\nSCHAEFFER: So the bottom line is it doesn't matter. Michelle was mistreated clearly at a Trump rally. What's concerning is that we've never had some golden era of political civility in America, but I think what people like myself and Jamie and others are recognizing is that there are simply no boundaries left anymore, right?\n\n\n\nThe fact that we saw -- Carol showed us a slew of really disgusting events or incidents at Trump rallies, and I think that's the bigger issue here. Right? I run a women's organization. The idea that we wouldn't swiftly condemn any kind of violence against a woman, especially someone who is simply trying to do her job as a reporter, is disgusting to me.\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: And, Jamie, it's not like --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: Wait, wait. I want --\n\n\n\nPIERSON: If this incident occurred, why not go to the authorities? Why not go to the campaign? This was taken to Twitter, for crying out loud.\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: I believe Miss Fields should go to the campaign.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSCHAEFFER: You sound like a -- what the left always charges the right with, saying, well, I guess it didn't happen because she didn't go to the police? I mean, my gosh, everyone now should be hugging --\n\n\n\nPIERSON: It's a fact. It's a fact.\n\n\n\nSCHAEFFER: Hugging me and Michelle and Jamie. They should be saying of course she should speak up.\n\n\n\nWEINSTEIN: Carol, can I point out --\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: Wait. Let Jamie talk. Jamie, go on.\n\n\n\nWEINSTEIN: We're seeing several different iterations from the Trump campaign to defend themselves from this. They're trying first to impugn her character. Donald Trump said last night nothing happened. Now Katrina Pierson said well, maybe something happened, oh, but by the way, Michelle's character is very bad.\n\n\n\n[10:40:10] This is a sleazy and disgusting campaign by the Trump campaign to impugn the integrity of my girlfriend. Ben Terris who witnessed this is a highly respected reporter for the Washington Post. And you know, I -- I honestly don't know how someone like Katrina Pierson who I really do believe knows the truth and believes Michelle is honest here, is coming on here and flaking for this type of disgusting character assassination.\n\n\n\nAnd, as I said, you should be ashamed and so should everybody on the Trump campaign trail who knows what they're doing right now.\n\n\n\nPIERSON: Michelle Fields says she did not see -- Michelle Fields herself says she did not see who did that to her.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nPIERSON: If it happened, it was not Corey Lewandowski. And that's the key here. You guys are accusing a man, a husband who has small children, of committing assault that no else saw.\n\n\n\nSCHAEFFER: Here's the much bigger point.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSCHAEFFER: The much bigger point is that we have a lot of serious issues in this country.\n\n\n\nPIERSON: Even she says he's not sure.\n\n\n\nSCHAEFFER: That require political discourse. They require disagreement. That is a wonderful thing. What we don't want to see is these rallies turning into sort of violent -- you know, violent incidences here. What we want to have is sort of cordial public discourse. That's a wonderful thing, but grabbing reporters, muffling recorders, keeping them sort of intense the way Hillary Clinton has, that's a bad thing. And every journalist out there ought to be speaking out about this.\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: OK, so, Donald --\n\n\n\nWEINSTEIN: Can I make two points here?\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: Yes, please.\n\n\n\nWEINSTEIN: One is that this fits into a larger pattern of deception from the Trump campaign. You played the clip of Donald Trump saying that there have been violent protesters at his rallies. Maybe so, but according to people who cover every rally of Donald Trump who go there, they have not seen protesters coming out and swinging at the crowd, and how crazy, by the way, would it be for protesters to come out and starts swing against 9,000 other people who would be opposed to them. That would be insane.\n\n\n\nPIERSON: Media attention.\n\n\n\nWEINSTEIN: So that seems to be another deception by the Trump campaign.\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: All right.\n\n\n\nPIERSON: No, this is exactly what happens. We have liberal protesters who do these kinds of things, and no, you're right.\n\n\n\nWEINSTEIN: Who go punch people at the rallies?\n\n\n\nPIERSON: The people that go to these rallies and start -- yes, absolutely. It has happened. And there is video.\n\n\n\nWEINSTEIN: When is he going to lay out --\n\n\n\nPIERSON: Go look on YouTube. There are people who show up to these rallies, they throw themselves on the floor. They start thrashing and trying to start fights.\n\n\n\nSCHAEFFER: I don't understand. If you -- if you are a Trump supporter, that's a fine thing. But you don't want these to devolve into sort of comical ridiculous rodeos. You want this to be a serious place where you can have real conversation about serious issues from immigration to Social Security to economic growth and job creation. You don't want this to be a distraction.\n\n\n\nIf you work on the Trump campaign, I would think you would want to swiftly condemn this and move on to substantive conversations.\n\n\n\nPIERSON: Which is exactly what Mr. Trump continues to do.\n\n\n\nWEINSTEIN: And, Carol -- I would like to ask Katrina --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nWEINSTEIN: I would like to ask Katrina.\n\n\n\nPIERSON: Would like to respond to that question. I would like to respond to that --\n\n\n\nWEINSTEIN: But one second.\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: OK. Wait. Wait.\n\n\n\nWEINSTEIN: Can you let us know when --\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: Wait, one at a time.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nWEINSTEIN: Protesters knocking people --\n\n\n\nPIERSON: He tells them from the beginning --\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: OK.\n\n\n\nPIERSON: And he tells them from the beginning to handle them nicely. Do not be mean to them. You cannot control what people do. The liberals have paid protesters that have done this in the past. And if you think whoever comes out of the general election that the liberal protesters are going to be nice and they're going to follow the rules, then you're dead wrong. Mr. Trump has condemned these types of attacks. He does not promote them.\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: OK. All right.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: I got to -- I got to end it there, guys. I got to end it there.\n\n\n\nThank you all for joining me. I'll be right back.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[10:47:51] COSTELLO: A few hours from now the former first lady, Nancy Reagan, will be laid to rest right next to her husband, Ronald Reagan. Mrs. Reagan also -- always a stickler for details planned every aspect of today's ceremony, including the exact spot where her casket will go into the ground. Secret Service agents who protected the Reagans through the years will serve as pallbearers. CNN's live coverage of the ceremony begins just -- in just about three\n\n\n\nhours at 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\n\n\nThroughout the years we've always heard about how fiercely loyal and protective Nancy Reagan was of her beloved Ronnie . One person who knows this better than most is presidential historian Douglas Brinkley who edited Ronald Reagan's personal diaries. He joins us now live from Simi Valley.\n\n\n\nHi, Doug.\n\n\n\nDOUGLAS BRINKLEY, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Hello. Good morning.\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: First of all, describe the vast number of people coming to pay their respects to Nancy Reagan.\n\n\n\nBRINKLEY: Well, for starters, this will be a very traditional funeral. Nancy Reagan was very traditional on things so it will be Ave Maria and God Bless America, Battle Hymn of the Republic. Her friends, acquaintances will speak. People like James Baker, Tom Brokaw, but I think most importantly, the reflections of her two children that she had with -- with Ronald Reagan, you know, her daughter and her son, will be really the two that people will be most interested in hearing.\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: Absolutely. So Nancy Reagan orchestrated all of this down to the final detail. Surprising?\n\n\n\nBRINKLEY: No. And, you know, we watched when Ronald Reagan died how Mrs. Reagan choreographed the funeral which became an international event. It kind of seized the imagine of the people how well she did it.\n\n\n\nRemember, Nancy Reagan's whole life became of protecting her husband. And I was reflecting, Carol, coming over here about when Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981 and people don't realize Ronald Reagan lost 50 percent of his blood, his lung punctured, a bullet almost in his heart, and she had to spend daily helping him recover while carrying on as president of the United States.\n\n\n\n[10:50:06] And then when she got to come back to California, it was supposed to be the golden years out here and then Alzheimer's hit her husband, and the patience she had. I mean, you know, nurses and things could come and go, but she had to have the patience to care take of her husband 24/7 through Alzheimer's, and she then became an organizer of her husband's life, and hence, this was the last act of this great marriage, her funeral and making sure that she was laying next to her husband and that they would meet up in heaven.\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: So -- I have heard this and I don't know if it's true but maybe you do that Nancy Reagan wanted her casket placed very, very closely to her husband Ronnie's as if they were holding hands almost.\n\n\n\nBRINKLEY: Yes. Exactly. Inches from each other. You know, some people were predicting rain here today, but it's beautiful right now in Simi Valley. The valley is aglow and there are moving clouds around, and so it's a kind of a spiritual vibration going on here right now. But when we watched today, remember the military. Both Ronald Reagan and Nancy, both felt that our U.S. armed forces were the real heroes of America, and they always remember the crisp salute that Ronald Reagan would give and the fact that as commander-in-chief, you know, he wouldn't take his suit coat off even in the Oval Office because he wanted to wear his suit uniform in the way that our military wore theirs.\n\n\n\nI think that's part of what this planning of hers was today, to do it the traditional, old style American way, yet like Eleanor Roosevelt who was the first one to really open up the viewing of the casket in 1962 because Eleanor Roosevelt thought of herself as a populist of the people, Nancy Reagan was a conservative populist, and this whole last few days people have been coming here to pay last respects. And she wanted it that way. That it wasn't just elites at her funeral and friends but the public could share in the final good-bye.\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: All right. Douglas Brinkley, thanks so much.\n\n\n\nAnd another reminder that CNN's special coverage of Nancy Reagan's funeral starts at 1: 30 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\n\n\nComing up in the NEWSROOM, two top executives at the Wounded Warrior Project fired.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[10:55:25] COSTELLO: Checking some top stories for you at 55 minutes past.\n\n\n\nThe top two executives at the Wounded Warrior Project are out of jobs today. Founded to help veterans wounded in combat, the charity fired the two men for throwing lavish events that promoted the group but did little to help veterans. Org chairman Anthony Odierno, a wounded Iraq war vet and the son of the former Army chief of staff, will temporarily take over the charity.\n\n\n\nA $20,000 reward has been offered for the capture of two gunmen who opened fire on a family cookout in the town of Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania. Six people were killed including a pregnant woman. The county prosecutor says one gunman ambushed the family from the alley while another -- another person shot from near the back of the house.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSTEPHEN ZAPPALA, ALIGHENY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY: We do not have anybody identified as of yet. We do have some physical evidence that we think we're hopeful will lead back to identifying at least one of the persons.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCOSTELLO: No motive is known. But officials say drugs were a factor.\n\n\n\nIn Los Angeles, a violent car wreck sends six to the hospital. The car appears to go speeding through a red light and it slammed into an SUV waiting to turn. It happened early Tuesday morning in Van Nuys, California. Five vehicles in all hit. Six people injured.\n\n\n\nFlash floods from Texas to Louisiana have claimed at least four lives. The threat is expected to continue through the weekend with more downpours in the forecast. Some schools in New Orleans have now been closed. Residents are warned to seek higher ground immediately because some levies are in danger of being overtopped.\n\n\n\nThank you so much for joining me today. I'm Carol Costello. AT THIS HOUR WITH BERMAN AND BOLDUAN after a break.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Bridgerton, the first TV series made by Shondaland for Netflix, hit both Britain and the USA on December 25, 2020. A period drama set in London of 1813, the show is based on bestselling American novels, and offers a vision of Britain as only Americans could see it. Yet Brits, as enthusiastically as American viewers, have lapped up this soapy fantasy .\n\nThe show was lucky with its launch date. By late December, America was reeling from post-election crisis to pre-inauguration crisis, its citizens desperate for escapism. But on Christmas Day itself, Brits were in particular need of the magic Bridgerton offers. Five days earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had abruptly canceled the nation's promised Christmas relaxation of quarantine regulations. Young people living in London were disproportionately affected, prevented by overnight changes in quarantine zoning from traveling to their families outside the city. So instead of turkey and charades, Britain's millennials kicked back with Netflix.\n\nBridgerton offers viewers eight hours of candy-colored entertainment. (For some Brits of my acquaintance, that eight hours constituted their sole Christmas Day activity.) The story of Daphne, a beautiful debutante in Regency London, this is milquetoast Jane Austen fan fiction. There is some weeping and wailing about the possibility of spinsterhood or scandal, but nothing disquieting happens for long to anyone we care about. The chief crisis of our heroine's life involves her having to choose between a Prince and a Duke.\n\nLike the heroine of a fairy tale, Daphne is introduced from the opener as the fairest in the land, singled out by the Queen of 200 young ladies as the winner of the debutante beauty pageant, and declared the incomparable by the anonymous gossip columnist Lady Whistledown. She will face challenges -- both these fairy tale deities will temporarily withdraw their favor -- but we know that beauty and charm will always win.\n\nAcross the street we meet an evil stepmother, Lady Featherington, who primps up her two charmless elder daughters in lurid feathers and belittles her intellectual youngest, Penelope. We know, as surely as we know that only Cinderella's foot will fit the glass slipper, that these ugly sisters will end the season unmarried.\n\nAt times of economic pain, big media sells us fairy tales. The 1937 Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, released to wild success during one of the worst years of the Great Depression , is regularly cited as an example of this phenomenon. When the theorists Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer coined the term  culture industry , they were writing about the ways that big corporates shape our imagination: the Walt Disney Company sold the song Some Day My Prince Will Come to millions of young working class women struggling for a better life.\n\nAdjoa Andoh as Lady Danbury in 'Bridgerton.'\n\nFor women in 1937, that better life meant marriage and a male breadwinner. Like Snow White, Bridgerton finds British and American viewers at our most despairing. Like Snow White, it peddles dreams to a target audience of working class women. Some of the cast and crew of Bridgerton have tried to claim progressive credentials for their show. Certainly, its racially diverse casting is to be applauded: a major step toward black British actors finally getting a chance to play the great period drama roles they deserve. (Adjoa Andoh, for example, was born to play a Regency Grande Dame). But the happy-ever-after Bridgerton sells to its female viewers still consists of marriage and men. This is Snow White with added orgasms ; social conservatism dressed up in progressive breeches.\n\nWhy audiences can't get enough of the land of Austen\n\nAs for breeches and orgasms, why does the Regency world carry such appeal as a period backdrop? There is something culturally specific about this era which is deeply ingrained in contemporary female fantasy. The Bridgerton TV series is based on Julia Quinn's bestselling romance novels of the same name. The eight stories which follow Daphne and her siblings form only a part of the expansive Quinn universe. Her devoted fanbase has produced a rich and varied archive of its own fan fiction, much of it more nuanced and perspicacious than the frothy show you'll find on Netflix.\n\nIf there is a female gaze, Bridgerton is looking to define and cater to it. Sex scenes are shot to appeal to women who date men; they focus almost exclusively on the heaving torsos of Regé-Jean Page, who plays Daphne's love interest Simon, and Jonathan Bailey, who pursues his own panting storylines as Daphne's promiscuous brother Anthony. Simon is conveniently given a confidante in the person of his muscular boxing trainer, which offers ample opportunity for the two men to bounce about a boxing ring, shirtless and sweating. Is this feminism, or just female friendly?\n\nContemporary culture has long fetishized men in Regency dress (or undress). When the BBC adapted Pride and Prejudice in 1995, they invented the iconic scene in which Colin Firth, as Mr. Darcy, strips down to his undershirt and dives into a lake on his grounds. As recently as 2016, women lined up in Washington, DC, to view the very same shirt in a display at the Folger Shakespeare Library. What any of it had to do with Shakespeare was unclear. It is a truth universally acknowledged that men who dress like Austen's heroes are dreamy.\n\nJennifer Ehle and Colin Firth in 'Pride and Prejudice.'\n\nYet if Austen's heroes are dreamy, they don't emerge from fairy tales. Women tend to identify with Austen's heroines, and thus it's an easy step to find themselves loving Austen's men. But much of the reason modern women identify with Austen's heroines that they face real challenges to which 21st century women can still relate. For Austen's women, marriage is an economic prospect, and often the only economic prospect which allows an escape from poverty -- or at best, lifelong financial dependence on a reluctant relative. That is no longer true for women in the developed world, but their marital and sexual choices still face pressures and scrutiny unique to their sex.\n\nWhat Elizabeth Bennet could teach Daphne about economics -- and sexual consent\n\nBridgerton, as a cultural phenomenon encompassing both novels and TV series, seizes on women's great affection for Austen's books and shamelessly targets her fan base. Perhaps if you've ever identified with Elizabeth Bennett, you'll fall for any actor in Regency uniform. But while the landscape of Austen is peppered with tragic figures of women who've lost out in life, in Bridgerton, no one we like ever makes a long-term mistake. Marina Thompson, a Featherington country cousin with more wealth than first appears, does have to settle for respectable marriage in the absence of passion. But as she's already attempted to entrap a naive young man into falsely accepting paternity of her baby, our sympathy is limited. There is cosmic order in her story's neat ending, far happier than the messy lives of most unmarried pregnant women in the era.\n\nMeanwhile Daphne is a more fiscally naive heroine than any in Austen. In the first episode, she scolds her sisters for mocking her social success: my success on the marriage mart influences all of your prospects. We will all need to find love one day. In two sentences, this script has rejected every observation Austen ever made about Regency social norms. For Austen, marriage is an economic bargain in which love has little to do with worldly success; for Daphne it is a popularity contest in which worldly success and love will naturally come together.\n\nRegé-Jean Page as Simon Basset in 'Bridgerton'\n\nDaphne does get everything she wants. This includes cajoling her Duke, the dashing Simon, into embracing fatherhood, despite his lifelong wish not to have children. Bridgerton presents this development as an act of psychological healing by Daphne -- for who would actively choose childlessness, this show suggests, except as a symptom of unresolved childhood trauma? Yet this seeming cure involves a bedroom act that at worst can be called rape, at best reproductive coercion. She forcibly violates his expressed wish to use the (unreliable) withdrawal method.\n\nSexual consent doesn't cease to matter when it is violated by an attractive young woman. Daphne's justifications and Simon's eventual forgiveness send a poor message to anyone trapped in an abusive sexual relationship. None of this is feminist. Daphne's act perpetuates old stereotypes of women as seed-stealing succubae. Marina's treatment of Colin similarly signals that men should be careful of women's deceit.\n\nSuch conservatism would not have been out of place in the 1930s. Nor would Bridgerton's solid heterosexuality. There's a token gay character who features in a sub-plot to a subplot. When Daphne's brother Benedict explores London's art scene, he makes a friend and fleetingly walks in on the man embracing his lover in the side-room of an orgy. But Benedict rushes away to partake instead in a two-woman threesome -- a classic heterosexual male fantasy. Some Bridgerton fans are hopeful that Daphne's rebellious sister Eloise may turn out to be a lesbian in later series -- if so, it will be a departure from the novel series.\n\nIn the end, to escape is still bliss\n\nNonetheless, Bridgerton gives us escapism, and we need escapism today. If you're British, the anti-naturalism of this fantasy is particularly obvious. In the show's opening shots, we are presented with the most famous vistas of the city of Bath -- and yet we're told we're in the city of London. Buckingham Palace is shown with unsubtly CGI'd scaffolding. Anachronistic names pop up everywhere -- Nigel for a Regency aristocrat? Really? -- and instead of period music, Daphne and Simon's sex scenes are set to stringed orchestrations of Taylor Swift. These aren't errors, or the business of pedantic historians to dispute. They are features, not bugs.\n\nThis antipathy towards accuracy doesn't preclude a sense of historicism. Like the Quinn novels, the dialogue of TV adaptation is peppered with references to popular myths about the Regency era -- in the opening lines, one character suggests the use of lead and arsenic as effective makeup. A handful of genuine references to Regency social history are used and reused over and again: there incessant mentions of immature characters being 'barely out of leading strings', i.e. Regency baby-walkers . The purpose of such clangers is not historical accuracy: it is to hang a sign reading: We are not in 2020 anymore.\n\nBridgerton revels in the fantastical nature of its own world building: this is a world of extravagant wigs and crowded parties; a world in catering for a glamorous wedding can be laid on at three days notice; a world which has achieved racial restitution and equality, without any indication of the struggle and trauma taken to achieve this. In a brief expository scene, never referenced once in the rest of the series, Simon's godmother tells him that racial harmony arrived in Britain after King George chose to marry a black woman. It is as simplistic an idea as any fairy tale -- whatever your view of Queen Charlotte , whose distant African ancestry has in recent years put her cultural identity under the microscope , no racial progress is ever made that fast. One doubts Meghan Markle shares its confidence in royal open-mindedness. But what a wonderful fairy tale for us momentarily to believe possible.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nBut this is an American fantasy of Britain. Unlike the historical members of the Regency ton, who reveled in informal nicknames and scatological jokes, our aristocratic siblings use cold and formal language with each other. Fathers and sons perpetuate in cycles of emotional abuse; no one is capable of communicating their emotions. Even the hopeful vision of racial diversity is limited by an American lens: there are no lead actors of South Asian heritage, which is contemporary Britain's largest ethnic minority.\n\nIt is also, like most American fantasies of Britain, a conservative fantasy. Our heroines are aristocrats: there are no storylines for servants, no lead character drawn from the working class. As in a fairy tale, happiness is granted to the beautiful and innocent: Lady Featherington and her ugly daughters end the show outplayed and unhappy. Perhaps this is what we need to get us through 2021, but if so, we are in a very bad place.\n\nAn earlier version of this op-ed incorrectly referred to a character on Bridgerton as Andrew. The character's name is Anthony.
(CNN) There was a moment in the 2012 Lifetime reality show The Houstons: On Our Own which clearly defined the relationship between a then 20-something Nick Gordon and teen Bobbi Kristina Brown.\n\nIn the scene, the pair are shown being affectionate as Brown's aunt, Pat Houston, discusses their involvement.\n\nNick and Krissy are inseparable, Pat Houston says. They feel like it's them against the world. And that's not what I want for her.\n\nFor many who watched Bobbi Kristina grow up as the daughter of troubled singers Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown, it wasn't what they wanted for her either.\n\nGordon's death on Tuesday at the age of 30 brings to a conclusion one of Hollywood's most drama-filled tales, which saw not only the loss of one of music's biggest stars, but also cast that star's daughter as an heir to the demons that plagued both her parents.\n\nAnd at the center of the tragedy stood Gordon, who was viewed by many as a man who did more harm than good.\n\n'Lonely and hurting'\n\nWhitney Houston considered Gordon her godson and took him both under her wing as well as into her household when he was a teen.\n\nDuring a 2016 interview on the Dr. Phil show , Gordon explained how he came to live alongside the singer's then 14-year-old daughter.\n\nI gave my mom a couple of problems, Gordon said. I didn't agree with my stepdad on some things.\n\nGordon said Houston and her daughter were lonely and hurting in the wake of the star's split with her then-husband, singer Bobby Brown.\n\nThey were really hurt, Gordon told Dr. Phil McGraw. They talked about it all the time. It's something that really affected them in a negative way. Especially Krissy.\n\nHouston and Brown had a tumultuous 15-year marriage marked by allegations of infidelity, drug abuse and legal problems.\n\nBonded in grief\n\nGordon became the man of the house and was there to support 18-year-old Bobbi Kristina after her mother was found dead in a bathtub at the upscale Beverly Hills Hotel hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy awards bash hosted by her mentor, Clive Davis.\n\nThe Los Angeles County coroner later ruled Houston's death as an accidental drowning with the effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use as contributing factors.\n\nHouston and her daughter were incredibly close and there was much concern about how Brown would deal with losing her mother, especially after the teen was briefly hospitalized in the midst of her grief.\n\nThat worry was heightened after she and Gordon went public with their romance in the months following her mother's death. Many viewed the couple as having a brother-sister type of relationship.\n\nBrown's appearance on the family's 2012-13 reality show The Houstons: On Our Own also raised red flags, as she sometimes appeared to be slurring her words.\n\nIn one episode, her aunt Pat Houston worried that the underage Brown might have been drinking and noted that Houston would occasionally allow her teen daughter to have a glass of wine or champagne.\n\nAlso troubling to her family was Brown's growing reliance on Gordon, who she called her husband and partner in crime.\n\nThe pair announced their engagement in July 2013 and she often used her official Twitter account to express her love for Gordon.\n\nAhhhh relaxing day with the LoveOfMyLifeOfcourse :) @nickdgordon we had a long day,?Hubby's #shleep! Favpartofmyday?#Cuddlingwithmylove👈😍 — Bobbi Kristina H.G. (@REALbkBrown) August 3, 2014\n\nI've got MY BABY BACK!! 👈😃💎💍💥✨ #Bling! 👈☺️✌️❤️💪 thank you my love !! @nickdgordon :)(: Can you say overjoyed ? 😊 pic.twitter.com/p06SC8sr2U — Bobbi Kristina H.G. (@REALbkBrown) August 14, 2014\n\nAt one point, Brown posted a message on her Facebook page responding to critics of their relationship.\n\nI'm tired of hearing people say, 'Eww you're engaged to your brother or if Whitney was still alive would we be together or would she approve of this.' Let me clear up something. We aren't even real brother and sister, nor is he my adoptive brother, she wrote at the time.\n\nIn 2014 Brown tweeted that she and Gordon had married, but the couple were never legally wed.\n\nDeath of Bobbi Kristina\n\nOn January 31, 2015 Brown was found unresponsive and not breathing in the bathtub at her Roswell, Georgia, home -- nearly three years to the day after her mother accidentally drowned.\n\nGordon later told Dr. Phil he was confused as to why Bobbi Kristina would be in the bathtub because they both feared the tub following Houston's death.\n\nHe also claimed his girlfriend drank too much and passed out in the tub the night before Houston drowned.\n\nWhitney actually found her in there, Gordon said of Brown allegedly passing out in the tub.\n\nFollowing her near-drowning, Brown was treated in a hospital and then a hospice facility. She died six months later at the age of 22.\n\nAn autopsy declared that drug intoxication and immersion in water were the cause of the pneumonia and brain damage that ultimately led to Brown's death.\n\nAttention immediately turned to Gordon after Brown was discovered unresponsive and her father, singer Bobby Brown, was outspoken in his belief that her daughter's boyfriend was somehow responsible.\n\nNo criminal charges were ever filed against Gordon,but he was found legally responsible for Brown's death in a civil case and in 2016 was ordered to pay $36 million to the estate of his late girlfriend.\n\nGordon failed to appear for two hearings in the civil case in Brown's death, and her family won by default.\n\n'It got really bad'\n\nSoon after Brown's near-drowning, Gordon had an emotional appearance on the Dr. Phil show where he threatened suicide and was convinced to enter rehab.\n\nMy pain is horrible, Gordon said as he sat beside his mother during the interview and talked of his fear of losing Brown, who was in a coma at the time.\n\nIn a subsequent appearance, Gordon told Dr. Phil McGraw he was grateful to have gone to rehab after self-medicating with drugs and alcohol.\n\nHe also said he and Brown had done drugs together.\n\nIt got really bad after (Houston) had passed away, Gordon said. It was unfortunate, but at the time that was kind of the only way we knew how to deal with what had happened.\n\nYou know if there was something concrete I think I'd be in cuffs, he said.\n\nYou know what I was? I was a prince and then I became a pawn, somebody just to point the finger at, Gordon said. Now I won't stand for it as long as I can fight it.

(CNN) —\n\nLiberals anticipated fireworks on Day one of confirmation hearings for Jeff Sessions as attorney general.\n\nBut instead, they mostly saw an old tradition in Washington: senatorial courtesy.\n\nThe Alabama senator didn't have an easy time of it during the over eight hours of testimony and question in the Judiciary Committee, but Democrats also didn't draw blood to change the political dynamic. Liberals were hoping for more.\n\nThe first day of Senator Sessions' confirmation hearing proved that the rushed nature of the confirmation process places senatorial collegiality over the advice and consent responsibilities that are the Senate's constitutional duty, said a dismayed Wade Henderson, the president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.\n\nHenderson and others were watching to see if California Sen. Dianne Feinstein – the new top Democrat on the committee – was up to the task of holding Sessions' feet to the fire. But Feinstein's job was complicated by the fact that she was tasked with grilling a colleague who had worked for years with many members sitting on the dais.\n\nProgressives credit Feinstein with a behind-the-scenes effort to push for documents and more information to complete Sessions' questionnaire. And they were emboldened when she worked to ensure that members of the Congressional Black Caucus would be able to testify in a session on Wednesday. But some felt that the initial questions during the hearing – meant to set the tone — could have been more probing.\n\nSpeaking generally, Symone Sanders, a former spokeswoman for the Bernie Sanders campaign, said on CNN, that some questions were soft but she said that there was more testimony to come, referring to Wednesday's expected testimony of Democratic Sen. Cory Booker and Rep. John Lewis.\n\nThe Senate needs to further tease out Senator Sessions' view, Henderson said in a conference call with reporters. In few instances, did we see the kind of in-depth question with follow up that would be needed to amplify the record. Henderson is particularly critical of Senator Sessions for his views on voting rights issue.\n\nLooking ahead to Supreme Court\n\nNan Aron, of the Alliance for Justice said the hearing showcased the traditional courtesy Senators extend to one another, but she said she expected a radically different approach for the upcoming Supreme Court hearing. Senator Feinstein is as tough and as committed as they come, and the fate of the Supreme Court will be an important part of her legacy, Aron said.\n\nTuesday's hearing was interrupted on several occasions by protestors chanting to the senators at times black lives matter and Senators do your job.\n\nIt was Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley – in his opening statement – who made clear his theme for the day concerning Sessions: We know him well, he said.\n\nAnd Sessions responded in kind. You know who I am, he told his Senate colleagues.\n\nFeinstein, however, was quick to push back. She acknowledged that she had worked with him for years, which made the hearing very difficult for me.\n\nBut she stressed her job was not to evaluate him as a senator. It was to look at the attorney general job.\n\nThere is much fear in this country, she said, and stressed deep concerns and anxieties.\n\nShe made clear that an attorney general does not investigate or prosecute at the direction of the president.\n\nWhen it was her turn to ask a first round of questions her focus was abortion and she tried to pin him down. Sessions confirmed that he believed that Roe v. Wade, an opinion he has said was colossally erroneous, was established and settled for quite a long time. But Feinstein didn't probe.\n\nCNN's Jeffrey Toobin called Sessions' statement significant, but it also leaves a lot of room for the Justice Department to take and support steps that restrict the right to an abortion.\n\nToobin pointed out the pending Supreme Court vacancy – which could change the legal calculus – and added the federal government can do a lot to restrict abortion rights.\n\nSessions gave a similar answer when asked about gay marriage. The Supreme Court ruled on that, he said. The dissent dissented vigorously but it was 5-4 and a majority of the court has established the definition of marriage for the entire United States of America – I will follow that law. \n\nSarah Warbelow, the legal director of the Human Rights Campaign struck back.\n\nWhen an attorney qualifies that he will follow a decision by citing his opposition and noting the closeness of the vote, no one is reassured that the rule of law will be enforced, she said in a statement.\n\nThe real question is: if the composition of the court changes, would he seek to overturn the marriage decision? The next Attorney General will be asked to advocate on behalf of LGBTQ people in a wide range of contexts including future questions on how marriage equality affects other laws, she said.
(CNN) Being trapped on a cruise ship sounds bad enough, but imagine that the vessel in question is in outer space. That's the futuristic gag at the center of Avenue 5, a goofy HBO comedy from Veep creator Armando Iannucci, which has its moments but never consistently feels out of this world.\n\nThe starry cast includes Hugh Laurie as Ryan Clark, the glad-handing captain of the most ill-fated TV ship since a three-hour tour became Gilligan's Island. (As it turns out, Clark's accent is as put on as his impeccably pressed uniform, and watching Laurie slide back and forth between British and American English when agitated is one of the show's simplest pleasures.)\n\nClark is anticipating easy sailing when the spacefaring luxury ship -- in the midst of an eight-week vacation voyage -- experiences an unfortunate hiccup, potentially extending its stay in outer space. The powers that be aren't particularly eager to share that news with the passengers or public, so hysteria reigns not only in the ship's private quarters but back on Earth, where the team at mission control desperately tries to find a solution.\n\nTemporarily stranded, meanwhile, are a particularly odd assortment of personalities, including Avenue 5 owner Herman Judd (Josh Gad, sporting a Richard Branson hairdo), as eccentric as billionaires get. The harried staff, meanwhile, includes Judd's mostly unflappable right hand (Suzy Nakamura), the ship's level-headed engineer (Lenora Crichlow) and its officious customer-relations specialist (Silicon Valley's Zach Woods).\n\nThe passengers, too, share center stage, among them a couple (Jessica St. Clair, Kyle Bornheimer) whose terrible marriage isn't helped by the prospect of staying together in a small cabin much longer than either had intended; and a woman (Rebecca Front) whose loud complaints impede Clark's efforts to keep everyone calm.\n\nRead More
(CNN) —\n\nIn the absence of a wedding ring, there may be another way to determine someone's marital status: the speed at which they walk.\n\nAccording to a study published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One, married people have better physical and mental health at older ages than unmarried people. Specifically, they walk faster and have a stronger grip.\n\nLed by Natasha Wood from University College London's Institute of Education, researchers looked into the association between marital status and the ability to carry out everyday tasks in later life.\n\nThere's been a lot of other research which has shown that married people are healthier and have lower rates of mortality but very little research which has looked at physical capability, Wood said.\n\nThe team elected to focus on two indicators: walking speed and grip strength. Walking speed is an overall measure of health, which includes lots of things like balance, agility and speed, while grip strength reflects upper body strength, she explained.\n\nThe researchers analyzed data from two existing studies of older people and their physical capability: the English Longitudinal Study of Aging and the US Health and Retirement Study. The former surveyed English adults over 50, while the latter studied US adults over 51.\n\nWhen assessing walking speed, the researchers used only data for adults 65 and older, to match the lowest age for that indicator surveyed in the Health and Retirement Study.\n\nMarried people were separated into those in their first marriage and those who had remarried, while unmarried people were divided into those who were divorced, who were widowed or who had never married. People who are married are not a homogenous group of people, and someone who never marries is very different than someone who's been widowed or divorced, Wood said.\n\nThe researchers didn't look at people who were living together but weren't married, finding too few people in the two surveys who belonged to this category.\n\nUp to 4 inches per second faster\n\nIn both studies, married people came out on top. Both unmarried men and women had slower walking speeds than their married counterparts. Men in England in their first marriage walked 4 inches per second faster than never-married men and 3 inches per second faster than widowers. There was a far less significant difference between men in their first marriage and remarried men, with the former walking less than a tenth of an inch per second faster.\n\nThe results were similar in the United States: Men in their first marriage walked about an inch per second faster than never-married men and 3 inches per second faster than widowed men. Men in their first marriage were only about a fifth of an inch faster than remarried men.\n\nFor women in England, those in their first marriage walked from 2 to 3 inches per second faster than unmarried women, while their equivalents in the United States walked about 2 inches per second faster.\n\nA similar pattern was visible with grip strength – but only for men.\n\nAmerican men in their first marriage had a 1-pound stronger grip than those who never married and a 2-pound stronger grip than widowers. The survey indicated that grip strength was less strongly associated with marital status in women.\n\nBut men who had remarried performed best: Their grip was a half-pound stronger than that of US men in their first marriage and a pound stronger than men in their first marriage in England.\n\nIt might be something to do with selection into remarriage: People who are physically healthier are getting remarried, Wood said, though she stressed that more research was needed to establish this link.\n\nDown to wealth\n\nThe explanation for the majority of the findings, particularly better fitness, is wealth, which married people have accumulated more of by later life than unmarried people, she said.\n\nWealth, she explained, can impact health in a variety of ways: Wealthier people live in better surroundings, they don't have the day-to-day stresses associated with not having enough money, they probably eat more nutritious food, as they can afford it, they could have access to better health care, and they may have larger social networks and enjoy leisure activities as they have the money to do them.\n\nConsequently, they have better overall mental and physical health, and all of these things are associated with better physical capability, Wood said.\n\nThe new research cites a 2004 study published in the Journal of Marriage and Family, which used data from the 1992 Health and Retirement Survey to establish that people who were continuously married were markedly wealthier than those who weren't, while remarrying neutralized the wealth impact of separation.\n\nA second study cited, published in the journal Demography in 2011, also supported the association between marriage and greater wealth, adding that couples who lived together with their partner before marriage – provided they'd never lived with other partners – became wealthier than couples who did not.\n\nThose in mid to later life who are in relationships tend to have more shared routines involving wellness (exercise, regular doctors visits, maintenance of healthy diets, sexual intimacy) than single people in their cohort and this may account for a marriage advantage in the area of physical capability, said Ian Kerner, a licensed couples therapist and CNN contributor.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOn a lighter note, he added, As for stronger grip strength, there's nothing better for the grip than having someone to hold and hug on a daily basis.\n\nThe results of the research could have significant implications for older people's health as marriage rates decline, Wood posited.\n\nWith more people entering older ages unmarried, there could be more people with physical capability difficulties at older ages, she said.\n\nAlternatively, the health impact of marriage might shrink, Wood added. As marriage rates decline, it is also possible that the association between marriage and physical capability may not be so strong for younger people when they reach older ages, she said. So being unmarried may not be so important for their physical health.

This one's for Pop\n\nFrom Brian Todd\n\nCNN\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- Surviving a tight finish might have been easy, compared to talking about his dad.\n\nEvery year that I've been lucky enough to win this tournament, my dad's been there to give me a hug. He wasn't there today. I can't wait to get home to see him, to give him a big bear hug, Tiger Woods said Sunday after winning his fourth Masters tournament.\n\nThose who know and cover the game, and even Tiger Woods himself, agree he may never have won a green jacket if it hadn't been for Earl Woods.\n\nHe's the one who introduced me to the game. He got me started. He got me ingrained in the fundamentals. He taught me all those things, said Woods.\n\nAnd he did it, according to most accounts, starting when Tiger was learning to walk.\n\nHis father had a net in his garage and he'd go out and hit balls and he'd bring Tiger out, literally in a high-chair ... And his father realized fairly early on, that there was some talent in his young son, says Lorin Anderson, managing editor of Golf Magazine.\n\nEarl Woods was stern and driven, using gamesmanship -- talking or jiggling change on the boy's backswing -- to instill mental toughness.\n\nEarl knew something about that, from two tours in Vietnam as a Green Beret where he fought alongside a South Vietnamese officer nicknamed Tiger -- a man who saved Earl's life more than once.\n\nEarl gave his son the same nickname and the boy took to it so much that he legally changed his name from Eldrick to Tiger.\n\nEarl had three children from a previous marriage, but channeled his energy, time and devotion to Tiger.\n\nObservers say one shouldn't mistake him for a stage father.\n\nHe knew when to push, he knew when to pull away. He wanted Tiger to be able to do this on his own. He did not want to have to be in the background the whole time. And by the time Tiger was 20 and turned professional, Earl really had stepped aside and Tiger was making all of his own decisions, Anderson says.\n\nNow, after battling diabetes and heart disease for years, Earl Woods has prostate cancer.\n\nHe'll fight this battle knowing his son -- his prodigy, his best friend -- can do it on his own.\n\nThis, this is for Dad, a choked-up Tiger said after his victory Sunday.
Red packets of money will change hands and dragon dances will roar through the streets as people around the world, predominately of Chinese descent, usher in the Year of the Rat.\n\nBeyond the usual Lunar New Year traditions, however, is a holiday full of interesting quirks and customs in several destinations around the world. Here are 11 things to know:\n\n1. Locals don't call it Chinese New Year\n\nIn China , the festivities are known as Spring Festival or Lunar New Year -- the new year is determined by the lunar calendar. And the Chinese aren't the only ones who observe it.\n\nFrom late January to mid-February, Vietnam and other countries celebrate Lunar New Year. This year's Lunar New Year falls on January 25.\n\n2. Traffic is chaos\n\nChunyun is the world's largest annual movement of humans. Here's what happens when all of China goes on holiday at once.\n\nLunar New Year is basically like having an entire country throw a family reunion -- all at once. Traffic Armageddon inevitably strikes.\n\nIn China, the Spring Festival travel rush period (chunyun) is the country's, if not the world's, biggest season of human migration.\n\nWhether pushing their way into packed buses, buying black-market tickets from scalpers or standing for hours on a crowded train, travelers do whatever it takes to see loved ones.\n\nWith commuters and migrant workers returning home, the government expects about three billion journeys to take place this year.\n\nRelated content World's largest annual human migration now underway in China\n\n3. It's not just one day\n\nLunar New Year lasts 15 days.\n\nIt's an action-packed holiday -- you can bet on horse races, watch parades, bargain in bazaars and fight for prime worship spot at the temple.\n\n4. It's a season of superstitions\n\nDuring LNY, you live like a college student on the first day -- which means no showers, laundry or cleaning.\n\nAbove all, there's no taking out the trash -- doing so is said to wash away your luck and prosperity.\n\nYou hang out with family (especially in-laws) on the second day, which is considered the beginning of the year.\n\nOn the third day, visiting friends and family is frowned upon, because it's a day prone to arguments. On the seventh day, it's time to party in celebration of everyone's birthday.\n\n5. You can rent a boyfriend\n\nLunar New Year can be rough for singles, especially females. Many family reunions are highlighted by dreaded interrogations of singles who haven't settled down. Now there's a solution -- boyfriend/girlfriend rentals.\n\nVarious Chinese websites have offered fake boyfriend/girlfriend rentals, so parents and relatives can finally stop nagging.\n\nRenting a bogus marriage prospect ranges from RMB 500 ($77) to 6,000 ($925) per day.\n\nSome packages come with a free embrace, hand holding and a goodbye kiss on the cheek, as well as a list of additional specific service charges.\n\n6. Odd linguistic customs are observed\n\nIn parts of China, there are a few things you can and can't do over the Lunar New Year holiday -- simply because of how they sound.\n\nFootwear purchases are off limits for the entire lunar month, as the term for shoes (haai) sounds like losing and sighing in Cantonese.\n\nYou can however, turn the Chinese character for luck (fu) upside down to make dao (which sounds like arrival) and put it on your door to bring in good fortune for the new year.\n\n7. Firecrackers are for scaring away monsters\n\nInside one of China's largest fireworks factories, where the process of crafting a firework is an art in its own right.\n\nLegend says the half-dragon, half-lion monster Nian comes out of hiding and attacks people (especially children) during the Lunar New Year.\n\nHis weakness? Sensitive ears.\n\nIn the old days, people would light bamboo stalks on fire to frighten the monster.\n\nNowadays, you can watch spectacular fireworks display along the Hong Kong waterfront or play with firecrackers in a Beijing hutong.\n\nRelated content China ushers Year of the Pig with annual fashion binge -- and the environment is picking up the bill\n\n8. Wearing red is critical\n\nRed is associated with luck and prosperity, but it's used mainly for protective purposes.\n\nIn addition to being spooked by loud noises, Nian is frightened by the color red, which explains all the red you see on Lunar New Year decorations.\n\nInterestingly, the Cantonese term for pants (fu) sounds exactly like the word for wealth. Meaning you can't go wrong with red underpants.\n\nRelated content Lunar New Year dos and don'ts\n\n9. It's a time for sweets\n\nFood is an important part of the celebrations. Here, dumplings are prepared Lunar New Year. lang ga/china photos\n\nFood is central to all Chinese festivals, but sugary snacks are especially important for LNY, since they sweeten up prospects for the coming year.\n\nTraditional holiday treats include nian gao (rice pudding), babaofan (eight treasure rice), jau goks (crispy dumplings), candied fruits and seeds.\n\n10. It has its own movie genre\n\nChina and Hong Kong have a film genre called hesuipian devoted to Lunar New Year.\n\nThe films are usually illogical, uplifting comedies, with a focus on families and happy endings to make viewers feel warm and fuzzy. Similar to Christmas movies, really.\n\nHoliday favorites include the  All's Well, Ends Well  series (the 1992 classic stars Stephen Chow and Maggie Cheung), Fat Choi Spirit and It's a Mad Mad World.\n\n11. Customs are flexible\n\nCNN's Patricia Wu & Andrew Stevens take a look at some of the most popular and beloved traditions of the Lunar New Year.\n\nCustoms and superstitions aren't set in stone. There's room for flexibility in interpretation and application.\n\nBanning shoes for the entire lunar month?\n\nThat depends on how you read the rules -- the word for shoe might sound like sighing, but it also sounds like harmony (hexie).\n\nNot showering for the sake of Lunar New Year? Many pass on that for obvious hygienic reasons.

(CNN) As is custom at the beginning of the legislative session, state lawmakers across the country have proposed a torrent of bills intended to boost local economies, constrain or expand spending or make much-needed infrastructure fixes.\n\nBut mixed in among the standard bureaucratic business are bills that take aim at LGBTQ+ residents of states -- bills that attempt to limit or dismantle their protections.\n\nJust weeks into 2021, lawmakers in at least 14 states have proposed a slew of bills that would restrict the freedoms of LGBTQ residents. Most of the bills would affect transgender young people, according to Freedom For All Americans , the LGBTQ advocacy group that tracks the proposals.\n\nNBC News was the first to report about the spate of anti-LGBTQ bills.\n\nIn Alabama , lawmakers proposed a bill that would ban physicians from prescribing medication to trans children that would affirm their gender. In Oklahoma , a proposed bill would lift a ban on conversion therapy and other practices that aim to suppress a minor's sexual orientation or gender identity. And in Montana, lawmakers in the state House have already passed bills that restrict trans minors' access to health care and even school sports\n\nMost of the bills won't ever pass. But even introducing the legislation is damaging to LGBTQ people, especially youths, said Christy Mallory, legal director of UCLA Law's Williams Institute, a research center that centers on gender identity and sexual orientation law.\n\nEven just the campaigns around the bills can be really stigmatizing and hurt kids, even if the bills don't ultimately pass, she said. Just the fact that knowing that lawmakers are introducing these bills, people are seeing it and reading it, can signal to kids that maybe they're not supported by their states, that their government is not behind them.\n\nTransgender young people in particular are already at a higher risk of physical and sexual violence and suicidal thoughts than their cisgender peers, according to the Trevor Project , a suicide prevention resource for LGBTQ youth. In this way, limiting trans young people's rights by law and erasing their gender identities can be incredibly harmful, Mallory said.\n\nA growing trend of discriminatory bills\n\nThere's been a troubling trend of bills aimed at limiting LGBTQ rights since the mid-2010s, a discriminatory response to the successful (same-sex) marriage litigation, said Jenny Pizer, law and policy director of Lambda Legal, a national legal organization that works to advance the civil rights of LGBTQ people.\n\nLawmakers started to specifically target young trans people since 2016, when North Carolina passed its infamous bathroom bill, which restricted transgender people from using the restroom that corresponded with their gender identity in government-run buildings. That bill was repealed in 2017 , though activists at the time said the political compromise still allowed some discrimination against trans North Carolinians to persist, Mallory said.\n\nEven though the bill was later repealed, North Carolina's bathroom bill inspired a slew of copycat bills that took aim at transgender people's access to bathrooms, school sports and, critically, gender-affirming health care, Mallory said.\n\nThough the North Carolina bill passed before the 2016 presidential election, some lawmakers who've introduced similar bills since have likely been influenced by the Trump administration's often hostile policies toward LGBTQ and trans Americans, Mallory said, like the former President's transgender military ban or his attempts to roll back protections against discrimination in health care.\n\nIt's possible that some lawmakers are proposing new anti-LGBTQ laws as a response to the new Biden administration, Pizer said, which already lifted the trans military ban and enacted an executive order expanding protections for transgender people on Inauguration Day\n\nWe need to anticipate that some of those who prioritize creating licenses to discriminate against us will return their attention to states they perceive as welcoming their anti-LGBTQ agenda, Pizer said.\n\nThe bills that activists fear the most\n\nOf the bills proposed so far, Freedom For All Americans is most concerned about two proposals in Montana -- one that bans trans students from playing a school sport and another that would ban trans kids from receiving gender-affirming health care. Both bills have passed in the Montana House and will soon reach the state Senate, said Angela Dallara of Freedom for All Americans.\n\nStates where anti-LGBTQ bills have been proposed, 2021 Alabama Indiana Iowa Kentucky Mississippi Missouri Montana New Hampshire North Dakota South Carolina Tennessee Texas Virginia Utah source: Freedom For All Americans\n\nMontana Rep. John Fuller, who sponsored both bills, said the measures are necessary because every child deserves a natural childhood, one that allows them to experience puberty and other normal changes that shape who they will become, according to the Montana Free Press\n\nIf the state does pass the bills, it won't be done quietly. Several trans and non-binary Montana residents testified online and in person this month about the harm the school sports bill would cause young trans people in the state despite supporters of the bill continuing to use offensive language and misgender trans people, the SB Nation blog Outsports reported\n\nMuch of the reason similar bills don't pass is because of the overwhelming opposition to them, Mallory said, funded by civil rights organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union and led by local activists. Lawmakers in many of the same states where discriminatory bills have been proposed have introduced bills of their own that bolster nondiscrimination laws and better protect trans and LGBTQ people, Freedom For All Americans' legislative tracker shows

Larry King Live What Do Ronald Reagan's Love Letters to Nancy Say About the Former President? Aired September 9, 2000 - 9:00 p.m. ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. LARRY KING, HOST: Tonight: just-released love letters from Ronald Reagan to Nancy -- private words between a public couple. Joining us to share these intimate writings, three close Reagan friends: in Washington, Katharine Graham, chairman of the Executive Committee of the Washington Post Company; in New York, Mike Wallace, renowned correspondent of CBS News 60 Minutes; and in L.A, businessman, entertainer Merv Griffin. They're all next on LARRY KING LIVE. I'm in New York in the parking lot for this New York City, with this summit of world leaders. And it's a great pleasure to have this special program tonight with three distinguished guests looking at a new extraordinary book. The book is I Love You, Ronnie. There you see the cover -- the letters of Ronald Reagan to Nancy Reagan. We will start with Kay Graham before we read letters. And all our guests will be reading letters for you. Are you surprised that Nancy released this book? KATHARINE GRAHAM, WASHINGTON POST COMPANY: No, because I think that she had a very good reason. She said she was -- before she handed them over to the Reagan Library and they just disappeared in the stacks, she wanted to know what he was like and how wonderful he was. And I think it's a really great idea. It's a great book, in my view. KING: Mike, were you surprised? MIKE WALLACE, CBS NEWS' 60 MINUTES: I am surprised. I learned more about -- I learned more about Nancy, I think, who is a very private person... KING: Very... WALLACE: ... from this book than I had known. And I had known her for -- I don't know -- half-a-century or more. And the book is a good book. KING: You learned more about her by reading most of the letters to her? WALLACE: Well, not just the letters to her, but... KING: Her comments. WALLACE: ... her remarks in between the letters. She really lets it go. KING: Merv, were you surprised? MERV GRIFFIN, ENTERTAINER: Not really. I'm glad she did it. We know the whole man now. Their love story, their life together has always been very private. This is a real eye-opener. She might have done it also, Larry, because in the past, many affects of first ladies' have gone on the auction block. They've been sold. Presidents' letters have been sold. And she might have been preparing herself to keep that from happening before going, you know, to the library with the letters. And plus, she really feels strongly about the fact that people should write love letters. I worry about it, because lawyers have made that very dangerous to do. But I think... (LAUGHTER) GRIFFIN: And I think future first ladies might be, you know, sending -- printing books saying: E-mails From My Husband. KING: Yeah, Kay, this might be a thing of the past, the love letter, huh? GRAHAM: I think that it proves all over again how important it is to write letters. And I hope that art isn't lost to electronic devices, because... KING: And did you -- I'm sorry, go ahead, Kay. GRAHAM: No, you go ahead. KING: Did you know, Mike, that he was that romantic? Wait until the audience starts hearing some of this. WALLACE: I had no idea. I knew that they adored each other: she him and he her. But the stuff that you read here is -- it's extraordinary. KING: Merv, did you know that he was that much of a -- just a -- what do you -- Cupid? Like angelic -- I mean, this guy was... GRIFFIN: Well, you know, if you were ever together with them -- and, you know, I was on vacations with them. They came and stayed at my ranch. They weren't putting on a show for me. They were never without each other. And when they went to Washington and she was sort of criticized -- or a little bit laughed at -- for her adoring looks at him, those are real. And that's the way they are in private. I watched them on long walks. I watched them on the beach in the Bahamas. There was a lot of hand-holding and talking to each other. They are two people who are very, very much in love. KING: All right, let me give you folks a little background on this. And we'll start with Kay. Starting 1950, shortly after they met, and through the early '90s, as Alzheimer's disease began to catch him, Ronald Reagan sent scores of letters, cards, and telegrams to Nancy. She's now sharing them in this book: I Love You, Ronnie. The book includes Mrs. Reagan's own memories and comments, and offers extraordinarily personal insights into this very public couple. We are going to begin with Katherine Graham -- will read the first letter. This was written Sunday, March 20, 1955. The future president is in Atlanta, on the road. He's a spokesperson for General Electric -- Kay. GRAHAM: My darling, here it is, our day. If we were home, we would have a fire and funnies. And we would hate anybody who called or dropped in. As it is, I'm sitting here on the top of the sixth floor, beside a phony fireplace, looking out at a gray, wet sky, and listening to a radio play music not intended for one person alone. Nevertheless, I wouldn't trade the way I feel for the loneliness of those days when one place was like another, and it didn't matter how long I stayed away, with all the missing you there is still such a wonderful warmth in this loneliness. Like looking forward to a bright, warm room, no matter how dark and cold it is at the moment, you know the room is there and waiting. I love you so very much. I don't want -- I don't even mind that life made me wait so long to find you. The waiting only made the finding sweeter. I love you. Ronnie. KING: My god. This is poetry. WALLACE: It is. KING: I mean, he had -- has a flair. We keep saying had, because we haven't heard him speak in... WALLACE: And he's funny in some of the letters. And he's open in the letters. KING: Oh, very open. WALLACE: And you can see, somehow -- I see Ronald Reagan in these letters. KING: When we come back, Mike will read his. Merv will read his. I will do a few too. And we will be entertaining your calls as well. The book is I Love You, Ronnie. Don't go away. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, 1986) NANCY REAGAN, WIFE OF PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN (singing): Oh, my dear. our love is here to stay. Together, we're going a long, long way. In time, the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble. They're only made of clay. But our love is here, our love is here, our love is here to stay. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KING: We are back for this extraordinary book that's very emotional to handle. And now Mike will read. And this will be part of a letter. We will read the other part later. This was written on Wednesday, July 15, 1953: two years before the one Kay red. The letter is -- the letterhead is the Sherry- Netherland Hotel in New York. And Nancy Reagan calls it a real favorite, admits it makes her weepy -- Mike Wallace. WALLACE: He's in -- he's in New York alone, apparently at the Sherry-Netherland. Dear Nancy Pants, yesterday I went -- forgive me. Dear Nancy Pants, yesterday I went directly from the train to rehearsal, only stopping to check in here, then suddenly it was 2:00 p.m. and rehearsal was over. Back at the hotel, I put in a call to you and then tried for Lou Wasserman (not in town), Sonny Werblin (away on vacation), Nancy Poo Pants Reagan (away out yonder). Eight million people in this pigeon-crap-encrusted metropolis, and suddenly I realized I was alone with my thoughts and they smelled sulfurous. When dinnertime finally arrived, I walked down to Twenty-One, where I ate in lonely splendor. It was at this point, with self-pity coming up fast on the rail, that you joined me. Joined him in his heart. She was 3,000 miles away. KING: We will pick up more of that letter later. The one to be read by Merv was written to celebrate 19 years of marriage, some say 20, refers to the fact that in the year prior to their wedding the couple had been together so much they may well have been married. The date is March 4th, 1971 -- Merv. GRIFFIN: From the governor's office of the state of California. Dear Mrs. Reagan, your loving faithful devotion has been observed these 19 -- some say 20 -- years. There are no words to describe the happiness you've brought to the gov. It's no secret that he is the most married man in the world and would be totally lost and desolate without you. It seemed to me you should know this and be aware of how essential you are in this man's life. By his own admission, he is completely in love with you and happier than even a gov deserves. With love and appreciation, your in love gov. KING: Kay, I don't think the public knows this about President Reagan, does it? GRAHAM: No. I think both his eloquence and his passion for her, which never dies, no matter where he is or where she is -- sometimes they're in the same room -- he writes these letters, and they are really very moving. KING: Mike, don't you agree that the public -- this book will sell well and the public will be surprised. They haven't seen him in so long or heard from him in so long. WALLACE: Oh, this is a -- this is a view of these two people I don't -- I have never really known, never, and I knew them fairly well. And no, this is -- this is quite strange in a peculiar way, really. It's a very revealing look at the two of them. KING: Sadly, Merv -- it has to be asked -- there's a kind of tendency to think of him in the past tense, when a public figure is no longer in front of us. GRIFFIN: Right. KING: He's alive but he's not here. GRIFFIN: Right, right. And that's why she's donated so much of the revenues, the royalties of the book to the Alzheimer's Foundation and to the Ronald Reagan Library. It is an amazing book. But doesn't it really complete the whole man, the whole picture? Because that privacy of theirs never was really written about. We knew they were very much in love with each other, but I'm as amazed as anybody -- known them all these years -- to know that he was such an expressive writer and felt deeply in his heart. GRAHAM: One of the... KING: Go ahead, Kay. GRAHAM: One of the things I like the best in the book and I really think adds to history is her explanation of what was going on. It really is fascinating. She... KING: She writes very well as well. GRAHAM: She writes beautifully. KING: I'm going to do now Valentine lover letter, with doodles. This was written February 14, 1960. Darling Mommie Poo. February 14th may be the day they observe and call Valentine's Day, but that is for people of only ordinary luck. I happen to have a Valentine life, which started on March 4th, 1952, and will continue as long as I have you. Therefore, realizing the importance of this to me, will you be my Valentine from now on and forever and ever? You see my choice is limited. A Valentine life or no life, because I love you very much. Poppa. We'll be right back. Don't go away. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, JANUARY 14, 1995) KING: Did he propose? N. REAGAN: Of course. He called my father. KING: Before he asked you? N. REAGAN: Yes. KING: And? N. REAGAN: And my father said fine. (LAUGHTER) KING: And how did he ask you and where? N. REAGAN: He asked me at home. We were at home. My home. My apartment. KING: And he said casually, I called your dad? N. REAGAN: Yes, and it's all right with your family. Is it all right with you? KING: Were you coy? N. REAGAN: No... (LAUGHTER) ... and I don't think he felt I would be. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, JANUARY 7, 1991) KING: Did you hit it off right away? N. REAGAN: Right away. Right away. Right away. Yes. KING: What... N. REAGAN: It was a blind date, as you know. It was a blind date, and I knew right away. Took him a little bit longer. KING: Did you have to work on it? N. REAGAN: I had to push him a little bit. KING: But you knew right away? N. REAGAN: I knew right away. KING: What was it in retrospect? N. REAGAN: I don't know. He was so unlike any actor I had ever known. He wasn't talking about himself all the time: my last picture, my next picture, let's talk about me, what did you think of my last picture, you know. He was interested in so many things, and he was nice-looking also. Didn't hurt. (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: The book is I Love You, Ronnie, the letters of Ronald Reagan to Nancy Reagan, published by Mrs. Reagan, and for the benefit of the library and Alzheimer's. Random House is the publisher. The book is now everywhere, and our distinguished panel is reading some of these letters. We'll turn now to Kay Graham, and this letter was written Christmas Day, 1980. Mrs. Reagan calls it perhaps the most important turning out in all our lives. The Reagans would soon be leaving California for Washington and the White House, and the letter reads in part -- Kay. GRAHAM: My beloved first lady: I'm supposed to be sitting here with my fingers crossed watching you open a package. I, of course, would be hoping it was something you really wanted, something that would show how much I love you. You see, I have this problem. I miss you when you first leave the room; I worry about you when you go out the front door. Now, this isn't good for me, not since my transplant, you into my heart 29 years ago next March. Without you, there would be no sun, no moon, no stars. With you, they are all out at the same time. Merry Christmas, my love. Your husband. KING: Merv, where did he -- we've never seen this in the spoken dialogue of Ronald Reagan. GRIFFIN: No. KING: This (UNINTELLIGIBLE) and poetic sense. GRIFFIN: But don't forget he was called The Great Communicator, and his greatest one, I guess, was with Nancy. Can I comment on that first date she told you about? KING: Yes. GRIFFIN: She didn't tell you the whole story. When they met on the blind date and shook hands to go to dinner, they both made excuses -- she said, I have to be up early in the morning; and he said, Well, I'm making a picture and I have to be early, too -- just in case it didn't work. And after dinner, they went to see one of the most romantic singers of all time, which I think inspired them, Larry: Sophie Tucker. (LAUGHTER) (singing): One of these days... (LAUGHTER) I said, How did you get beyond that? (singing): I'm going to miss you, honey. Well... KING: Now you know the rest of the story. GRIFFIN: Yes, yes. KING: All right. Our next, Mr. Wallace will grace us with a reading of -- continuing the letter from the Sherry-Netherlands Hotel, July 15th, 1953. WALLACE: So the president -- 1953... KING: The actor. WALLACE: The actor is still at Twenty-One. He says: Yes, you and I -- she's 3,000 miles away, but she's in his heart. Yes, you and I had roast beef, although Twenty-One is one of those places where you have to say 'well-done.' Medium to them means sponge off the blood. (LAUGHTER) ... only a half bottle of wine, we were somewhat restricted in choice, but we politely -- he says we politely -- we politely resisted the huckstering of the wine steward, who couldn't pick sweet milk from vinegar, and settled for a '47 Pichon Longueville -- I don't know. It was tasty, wasn't it? And I thought the most amusing incident and the nicest was when the lady to my left leaned over, and apologizing for her boldness, introduced the distinguished gentleman with her, whose name, of course, we didn't hear. It seems he's the publisher of 'Gourmet' magazine, and they were surprised, as they put it, to see someone choosing a wine so carefully and so intelligently in Twenty-One of all places. KING: And then he adds... WALLACE: I, of course told them -- yes, thank you. I, of course, told them I really wasn't a gentleman: I just happened to marry a lady. KING: Now, there he is acting as if she's with him. GRAHAM: Yes. KING: So she was... WALLACE: I have to reread the thing because I wasn't sure whether that she had -- no, it's quite apparent he's by himself, Twenty-One, and she's in his head, in his heart, beside him. KING: When we come back Merv Griffin reads a letter from the president to the first lady, and lots more to come, and your calls, too. Tomorrow night, the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin. Don't go away. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, AUGUST 15, 1988) RONALD REAGAN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've been thinking for several days about what exactly I wanted to say today, how to put Nancy's role in my life into perspective for you. But what do you say about someone who gives your life meaning? What do you say about someone who is always there with support and understanding? Someone who makes sacrifices so that your life will be easier and more successful? Well, what you say is that you love that person and treasure her. (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, JANUARY 14, 1995) KING: Ronald Reagan drew this drawing of Jiggs -- this is the famous cartoon of Bringing up Father -- and he wrote, Dearest wife, a portrait of Jiggs, who was a married man who couldn't begin to be as happy as you've made me. IT W.W.W. Which stands for? N. REAGAN: In the whole wide world. KING: By Ronald Reagan. His drawing of Jiggs. N. REAGAN: Very sweet, isn't it? KING: He was a romantic, he is a romantic. I mean, he was... N. REAGAN: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh my, yes. He used to send my mother flowers every birthday, my birthday, thanking her for having me. (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Before Merv reads the letter, we were talking on the break, Mike. Do you think some skeptics might say this is too much in love, this is like it can't be this? WALLACE: I'm sure that there are skeptics. Listen, I used to look at them when they were in public situations like this. And come on -- I mean, the adoring look and all of that, and the way that he looked at her. I used to say, come on, it couldn't be that. Turns out it was, and the letters make it so apparent. KING: Merv, this letter written on White House stationery in celebration of their 29th wedding anniversary. Nancy reflects, by the way, that no matter how busy he was with duties as president, Ronnie always remembered their anniversary. This is March 4th, 1981 -- Merv. GRIFFIN: Dear first lady, as president of the United States, it is my honor and privilege to cite you for service above and beyond the call of duty: in that you have made one man, me, the most happy man in the world for 29 years. Beginning in 1951, Nancy Davis, seeing the plight of a lonely man who didn't know how lonely he really was, determined to rescue him from a completely empty life. Refusing to be rebuffed by a certain amount of stupidity on his part, she ignored his somewhat slow response. With patience and tenderness, she gradually brought the light of understanding to his dark and obtuse mind, and he discovered the joy of loving someone with all his heart. Nancy Davis then went on to bring him happiness for the next 29 years as Nancy Davis Reagan, for which she has received and will continue to receive his undying devotion forever and ever. She's done this in spite of the fact that he still can't find the words to tell her how lost he would be without her. He sits in the Oval Office, from which he can see, if he scrunches down, her window, and feels warm all over just to know she's there. The above is the statement of a man who benefited from her act of heroism. The below is his signature, Ronald Reagan, president of the United States. P.S.: He -- I mean I -- love and adore you. KING: We'll close out this portion. I'll read a letter. Nancy says: Ronnie always made a big deal of birthdays, holidays and Mothers Day. This is a handmade mothers greeting by the president. M - is for the misery, for which I have none. O - means only that without you I would die. M - is for how very much when we're apart I miss you. M - is for the million ways I love you. Y - Yippie!!! I'm so happy. Take them all together, they spell Nancy, my wife, my love, my life. Happy Mothers Day, from an admirer. If you're curious, my name is at the top of the page and I'm on the next pillow over. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KING: We are back on this special day: the publication of I Love You, Ronnie, the letters of Ronald Reagan to Nancy Reagan. The publisher is Random House. And our guests are -- let's reintroduce them -- Katharine Graham, chairman of the Executive Committee of the Washington Post Company, a long-time friend of the Reagans -- all our guests are -- Mike Wallace of CBS News' 60 Minutes, and the famed Merv Griffin, businessmen and entertainer, all known them for a multitude of years. This next letter, which Katharine Graham will read -- and we'll take some of your phones calls too -- Mrs. Reagan offers insights into how her husband became increasingly political while traveling for the General Electric theater. Now, here's an example the way Nancy writes -- Kay. GRAHAM: Well, this is what I think is so great, and the first time she is really articulated so well. She describes here the development of his political being. He was making speeches for General Electric at this time. Soon, Ronnie's speeches became shorter and shorter and his Q&A sessions longer and longer. People don't ask him about toasters. And gradually, his talks became more political. He learned a lot by listening to the hundreds of people he saw and hearing what was on their minds and what was worrying them. He began to express his concern that excessive government regulation was draining the American economy and the free-enterprise spirit, which is what he was hearing. Interestingly, General Electric never told Ronnie what to say or asked him to tone down his political content -- the political content of his speeches, until shortly before his show went off the air, anyway, under ratings pressure from the new color show, Bonanza, in the spring of 1952. When GE told him to stop talking politics and start talking product, Ronnie simply refused. 'I can't do it,' he said. 'When people ask me to speak, I can't switch lines completely and talk about a appliances.' KING: Nancy can write, you know? WALLACE: Oh, yes. Yes. KING: She has a -- they both have a flare that the public oddly doesn't know. WALLACE: People have said.... KING: I'm getting repetitious, but it's all new to me. WALLACE: People have said that maybe he didn't write that Alzheimer's letter -- that last one -- that somebody was so good that maybe it wasn't -- this gives the lie to that. I mean, this -- I'm sure you're going to read the Alzheimer's letters sooner or later. KING: I don't know. I guess. (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: I hope so. But it's pure Reagan. KING: Very unusual handwriting, right, Merv? GRIFFIN: Yes, very. KING: Small. GRIFFIN: Small, interesting. A little tough to read sometimes. KING: Yeah. GRIFFIN: But you know, after he wrote the letter Mike is talking about, he wrote a number of us each a personal letter about what we had meant to he and Nancy in their life. It was the most touching thing. I just sat down and I really sobbed. I never -- and nobody will ever receive a letter like that in their lives. And it's funny. It's -- and I keep it very private. It's one of the most compassionate, sweetest, nicest letters. For him to do that, knowing what he had just written to the American people. KING: Mike continues Ronnie's fantasy date with Nancy again. Nancy is not with him, but she's with him. This is from the Sherry- Netherland Hotel. WALLACE: And he is, at the moment, still at 21, still eating and drinking. The people on our right we ignored completely: a slick, Latin-looking joker with a doll by Jelky (ph) out of jail -- and a Brooks Brothers character who is evidently a fond father's junior partner with plenty of loot he never could earn for himself. I was sure the Latin was peddling the broad or a TV idea, until he raised his voice a little -- and so help me -- he was promoting backing for a smart old ladies' home he wanted to establish. He knew the world was full of young couples burdened with aging mommas who would leave at a chance to stable them in any his nifty new homes for promos (ph). And the payoff would top South Pacific. Then he says: 'We walked back in the twilight.' And I guess I hadn't ought to put us on paper from there on. Let's just say I didn't know my lines this morning.' KING: And now, I'll do one that about Hellcats. Nancy found this note in their hotel room when she showed up for first day of work on the 1957 film, Hellcats of the Navy, the only movie they made together. It's on the letterhead of the U.S. Grant and it refers to their movie roles. It reads: Darling, us old salts say: Welcome aboard. And my goodness, are you welcome. We are working a while tonight, so come on out to the war what you have stowed your gear. Heave yo! I love you. Commander Abbett (ph). In his role, he stays in his role. Merv Griffin now has a letter written sometime after the assassination attempt. Nancy says their bond was deep. And after the attempt on Ronnie's life, he would make jokes in letters such as this one to try to take the edge off her fear of his public appearances -- this after the assassination attempt, from Ronnie to Nancy -- Merv. GRIFFIN: The White House, Washington. Dear First Mama, I'm in Wyoming, Montana, or Nevada, depending upon what time you read this. But I'll be at Camp David at 9:15 p.m. Friday night. And I will be so glad to see you. I miss you even when I'm asleep. This is a very lonesome place when you are someplace else. Now, I don't want this to come as a shock to you, but, well, well, I'll just come right out with. I'm in love with you. There, I've said it, and I'm glad. You be careful. Don't talk to any strangers. And try to think kindly of me, because I love you mucher than you think. First Poppa. KING: This -- this constant need to express this. Any thought of, Kay, why? Or was it just a romance that never ended? GRAHAM: I didn't understand your question. KING: His constant need to, you know -- she must know by this time he's madly in love with her. And he's writing another letter every day, reinforcing that. GRAHAM: Oh, yes. Well, that was just to keep throwing vibes out to her about how much he loved her. And it was this habit of writing notes all the time. I mean, it's charming. WALLACE: I can hear -- I can hear conversations going on across America, with wives saying to husbands... KING: Uh oh. WALLACE: ... he could do it, why can't you? Come on. You haven't written me a letter in a-year-and-a-half. GRIFFIN: Because I can't spell dear. KING: Why did people stop writing, Merv? GRIFFIN: I don't know. Maybe, as I said at the beginning, the lawyers have put the fear of God into marriages. We read that it's 51 percent of Americans are divorced. How would you like those letters being read in court while demanding the house, the kids, the car and everything else from one spouse or another? I don't know why people don't do that anymore. Obviously, there are many mechanical ways. KING: Yeah. GRIFFIN: You can fax. You can e-mail. You can do all that stuff. But... WALLACE: That doesn't do it, though, does it, Merv? GRIFFIN: No, it doesn't. It doesn't. KING: Kay, do you think technology has wiped out the letter? GRAHAM: I'm worried that it has. It's, by way of writing, wiping out print, reading. And somebody is going to have to pull up their socks and make sure that writings is in school and in the education of kids. It's terribly important to write. KING: Are you afraid it's going to be... GRIFFIN: Larry, do you... KING: I'm sorry. Go ahead, Merv. GRIFFIN: I just want to say that with this book and your show and all these letters, it could possibly bring back romance in America: romantic movies, we haven't seen any. We haven't heard any good romantic songs in a long time. Have you? It could bring back romance. What a surprise that would be. KING: Want to sing when we go off? GRIFFIN (singing): It's very clear -- their favorite song. KING: Yeah, great song. Gershwin. Back with more of our panel. It's starting to get misty here. And we will include some of your calls -- and some more letters, too. Don't go away. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) R. REAGAN: I think it's all too common in marriages that no matter how much partners love each other, they don't thank each other enough. And I suppose I don't think Nancy enough for all that she does for me. So, Nancy, in front of all your friends here today, let me say thank you for all you do. Thank you for your love. And thank you for just being you. (APPLAUSE) N. REAGAN: Oh, dear. R. REAGAN: We better cuddle up. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, LARRY KING LIVE) KING: Sandusky, Ohio, for Ronald Reagan, hello. CALLER: Hi, real quick, Ron, I just want to tell you, I love you. And I just want to know what your favorite actor or actress was that you worked with. And I wish you could run again for many more years. R. REAGAN: Well... KING: Not a bad call. R. REAGAN: Thank you for your call. And appreciate it. And obviously, I have to tell you that my opportunity to act with an actress, Nancy Davis... KING: Didn't turn out too bad. R. REAGAN: She was a nurse, and I was a Naval officer and so forth. And we went home together, because we were married. (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Ronald and Nancy Reagan were only in one movie together: Hellcats of the Navy. Here's a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, HELLCATS OF THE NAVY) N. REAGAN: Hey. I was afraid you wouldn't come. R. REAGAN: Heard about Wes? N. REAGAN: Yes. Dr. Landon told me. Somehow, I feel it's all my fault. Heaven, he's such a mess now. Let's get out of here. I'll sign out. (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Huntington, California -- we'll include some calls -- hello. CALLER: Hi. KING: Hi. CALLER: I just want to say that I'm so overwhelmed that he was so (INAUDIBLE) Hello? KING: Yeah, go ahead. CALLER: OK. I just want to say I'm so overwhelmed that he was so articulate and poetic. Did any of you every realize he was this romantic? It's wonderful. KING: Kay, you go first. GRAHAM: I don't think you could have envisioned quite this degree of... KING: No. GRAHAM: ... expressed romance and love, no. I mean, one knew that they adored each other. KING: I'm sure that a lot of people are expressing the same thing in the calls, Merv. GRIFFIN: Yeah. KING: Surprise. I mean, they knew that he was a great communicator, yes, and he made a good political speech. And he certainly could bring a nation together in times of despair. But no one knew of this. (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: Forgive me. KING: Go ahead, Merv. What... GRIFFIN: I said, it's the private part of their life that really none of us, even the friends, knew, except they were in love. But we had no idea there existed these letters. And just think... WALLACE: You know who missed this, Merv? GRIFFIN: Who? WALLACE: Edmund Morris. I mean he had access to everything for so long. GRIFFIN: Oh, yeah. Yeah. WALLACE: He wrote that big, long book, and none of it came through. GRIFFIN: No, well, he put himself in the book as a character, so that kind of diluted the whole thing. (CROSSTALK) GRIFFIN: All these clips, Larry, have you noticed they have never done in public a screen kiss like Al and Tipper Gore: those long kisses? KING: Now, we are getting -- we are turning more romantic here. WALLACE: No, I think we are turning Republican here. Griffin is a... KING: Springfield, Missouri, hello. GRIFFIN: Good boy, Mike. CALLER: Yes, hello. KING: Hi. CALLER: I am really enjoying your show here. But I'm kind of curious as to, over the years, through all the letters and even now, there's never any reference to their children. They loved each other. How come no reference to the product of all that love? KING: Any thoughts? WALLACE: There is -- there are many references to the children. And there are some wonderful pictures of the two of them with the children. GRIFFIN: It's about their love affair, not... WALLACE: Yes, but -- you've seen the book, Merv. The pictures of the kids... GRIFFIN: Oh, the pictures are fabulous. WALLACE: That's correct, and... GRIFFIN: But this is a book about their love. KING: Yeah, the book is about... (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: The book is about their love, but she makes it quite apparent -- and the president -- and Ronald Reagan makes it quite apparent that -- he talks about young Ron when he was two-and-a-half years old, for pete's sake. KING: Look at that. WALLACE: Yeah. That was a happy family. KING: Look at that. There they are. WALLACE: There's a wonderful picture -- there's a wonderful picture in the book of the four of them... KING: Four kids grown. WALLACE: Yeah, grown -- with their parents. GRIFFIN: My favorite is the little one of Ron Jr., when he's leaning on the desk and Ronnie is taking his oath of office. They left something out of it. And he had to take it a second time as governor. WALLACE: Right. GRIFFIN: And little Ronnie is leaning on the desk looking at him with this -- taking the oath with him. WALLACE: That's right. KING: We will be back with more of our panel -- some more letters, too. Don't go away. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, THE MERV GRIFFIN SHOW) R. REAGAN: I have to tell you, when Nancy was doing all that decorating. And there were some of the most wonderful antique pieces of furniture that she found deteriorating over there in a warehouse. But I used to come home, you know, and come up here. And then I'd have to started hunting. Which room is she in? Where in the world is she? I was used to opening the front door and saying: I'm home. (LAUGHTER) (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KING: OK. We pick up now with Kay Graham. This is the last of Kay's readings. This was written on Christmas day, 1975. His stint as governor was over. They were living in Pacific Palisades. He was giving speeches, writing a newspaper column. There was talk of a possible presidential run. Nancy said she thought they were done with political life -- Kay. GRAHAM: This is -- this is a Christmas letter. Every year he wrote a Christmas letter. This one says: Dear Mommie, the star in the East was a miracle, as was the virgin birth. I have no trouble believing in those miracles, because a miracle happened to me and is still happening. That light still shines, and will as long as I have you. Please be very careful when you cross the street. Don't climb on any ladders. Wear your rubbers when it rains. I love my light and don't want to be ever in the dark again. I love you. Merry Christmas. Your ranch hand. KING: Boy, did he have away. Mike, the conclusion of the letter from the Sherry-Netherland. WALLACE: He's back there... KING: Back at the hotel now. WALLACE: Back at the hotel. Tonight I think we'll eat here at the hotel, he writes, and you've got promise to let me study -- at least a little while. I suppose some people would find it unusual that you and I can so easily span 3,000 miles, but in truth it comes very naturally. Man can't live without a heart. You are my heart, by far the nicest thing about me and very necessary. There would be no life without you, nor would I want any. I love you. The eastern half of us. KING: That whole letter written as if she was with him, because indeed in spirit she was. WALLACE: She was. KING: Merv will do the last letter, but first let's get in another call here. Port Richie, Florida -- hello. CALLER: Yes, hi, good evening, Larry. KING: Hi. CALLER: I was wondering if anybody on the panel this evening know how the president and Mrs. Reagan were introduced and how they met. KING: Merv, I think you would know, right? GRIFFIN: Yes, the gentleman who produced Wizard of Oz, quite a remarkable man at MGM, introduced them. He just felt they were right for each other. I think... KING: Boy, was he right. GRIFFIN: Huh? KING: Boy, was he right. GRIFFIN: Boy was he right, yeah, absolutely. He was extraordinary. KING: All right, let me get a break and we'll come back. Merv will read the last of the letters that we're reading. There are many more, of course, in the book. We'll have some closing comments as well. Don't go away. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KING: The book is I Love You, Ronnie, and the last letter we will read is read by Merv. Nancy worried about her husband making campaign trips by plane rather than car or train. Ronnie wrote this letter in 1966 from Milwaukee to ease her fears and encourage her not to blame herself if anything happens. It was written on a Thursday night -- Merv. GRIFFIN: I love these salutations. Dear, Little Mommie, knowing you in addition to loving you, I think it's time to put something on the record. I've always known that someday my groundhog days would end. And now these political shenanigans have made these someday come around. No one talked me into this, so no one should have any feeling of responsibility. I have to write this because of all our talks about flying and because you'd try to take the blame personally if ever something happened. That would be wrong. God last a plan, and it isn't for us to understand and only to know that he has his reasons. What you must understand without any question or doubt is that I believe this and I trust him, and you must, too. What you must also believe is that I love you more and more each day, and it grows more bright and shining all the time. Good night Middle-Sized Muffin, who is all the rest of me I need. I love you -- Poppa. KING: Kay, isn't that a great line, who is all the rest of me I need? GRAHAM: Yes, I love it. WALLACE: Where's the rest. KING: Yes, we're taking it off of where's the rest of me. This book will surprise many people. Mike, I think that's gone through this entire show tonight, don't you think? WALLACE: Well, I've noticed that you have misted up on about a half dozen occasions over this past hour. It's a stirring... KING: Yes, well, love will do that to you, Mike. WALLACE: You're in love. KING: Yes. So are you, right? WALLACE: Yes. KING: And the feeling of it just exudes -- Merv, you must miss him terribly. GRIFFIN: I do. I really do. I miss his -- I miss his sense of humor, his fast remarks, ad libbing, his great compassion, his joy, and one quality about him: You know, he was so famous all his life, first as a movie star, which was in his day a very big deal, much bigger than it is even today, and then he was governor and then he was president. And he worried about people coming to meet him that they were intimidated, so he went so far out of his way each time to make you feel comfortable. That's a great man. WALLACE: One thing in the book, there are also letters when things were not going so well professionally. And it was -- some of those letters are very, very moving. He was out of a job, he wasn't sure -- he was emceeing out in Las Vegas and not feeling... KING: I know. WALLACE: ... very well about it. KING: And, Kay, we only have 30 seconds left. And now she lives with Alzheimer's, probably the toughest disease of all. GRAHAM: She describes that in the end. She says that this is so lonely. And it's lonelier because of what he meant to her. And nobody can understand who hasn't been through such a thing how bad it is, that her friends are wonderful, that she loves them and that they make a great effort, but fundamentally you're alone. And it's really very moving, the end. KING: It sure is. Katherine Graham, Mike Wallace, Merv Griffin, thank you so much. I'm Larry King Vladimir Putin tomorrow night. CNN NEWSSTAND is next. The book is I Love You, Ronnie -- and boy, does he.

(GREG BAKER/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe night they fled, Reem and Rawan didn't dare sleep.\n\nIt was September 6, 2018. The two Saudi sisters were on a family vacation in Colombo, Sri Lanka. For weeks, they had helped their mother organize the trip, feigning excitement at the possibility of two weeks away from Riyadh, but knowing that if all went to plan, they'd never go back.\n\nFailure was not an option. Every step of their escape from Saudi Arabia carried the threat of severe punishment or death.\n\nWe knew the first time, if it's not perfect, it will be the last time, Reem says.\n\nCNN has changed the sisters' names and is not showing their faces, at their request for their safety.\n\nThe sisters say years of strict Islamic teaching and physical abuse at home had convinced them that they had no future in a society that places women under the enforced guardianship of men, and limits their aspirations.\n\nIt's slavery, because whatever the woman will do it's the business of the male, Rawan says.\n\nThat's why they say they renounced Islam.\n\nAnd that's why aged 18 and 20, they stole back their own passports, hid their abayas under the bedcovers, snuck out of their holiday home and boarded a flight from Colombo to Melbourne, via Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong stopover was supposed to take less than two hours.\n\nTwo hours has turned into five months.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN This photo was taken in a restroom in an airport during a trip to Turkey. The sisters wore this type of niqab when they were traveling outside Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhy they fled\n\nGood girls do what they're told, are quiet, don't argue or risk embarrassing their families. Reem and Rawan say they had turned being good girls into a fine art.\n\nIn our house, we (were) always the good girls they wanted us to be. So, if they want us to clean, we will clean. If they want us to cook, then we will cook, 18-year-old Rawan says.\n\nThe last two years it was really bad, because I just forget who I am, I am just pretending (to be) like an Islamic girl, says her 20-year-old sister, Reem.\n\nThey went to school, studied hard and avoided confrontation. Of course, the same rules didn't apply to their brothers. Beat your sisters, the siblings say their brothers were told, it'll make you better men.\n\nReem and Rawan are reluctant to talk about the abuse at the hands of their family. They say it didn't happen all the time, just enough to remind them of the rules. And enough to fill them with terror about what might happen if anyone found out about their plan or, worse still, caught them carrying it out.\n\nThe escape\n\nLeaving Saudi Arabia is not a simple undertaking for women who rebel against the system. Permission is needed from a male guardian for many basic activities, including international travel.\n\nReem and Rawan say they had been planning their escape in secret for two years. They didn't dare discuss it in case they were overheard, so, instead, they swapped WhatsApp messages, even while alone at night in their shared room.\n\nBefore they fled, the Sri Lanka vacation was just like any other. They wore their niqabs to the beach and sat away from the surf while their brothers swam and joked. They cooked the meals and spent most of their days inside. It was humid. Their niqabs stuck to their skin and made it hard to see.\n\nWe travel to move from a box to another box. From home to hotel, nothing will change, Rawan says. They will go out, they will live freely, the men, of course, we will sit away, watching them doing what they want.\n\nTheir five-year-old sister played in the sand, but their 12-year-old sister, like them, didn't. She too was learning that it's OK to be a girl in Saudi Arabia – until you grow up.\n\nDuring the trip, Rawan turned 18. The timing was no accident. The vacation was planned with gentle persuasion to coincide with a birthday that, unbeknown to their mother, allowed Rawan to apply for an Australian tourist visa.\n\nOn the last night of the trip, the sisters launched into action. Reem pre-booked the taxi. It was Rawan's job to retrieve their passports from a bag stored in their parents' bedroom. Around 2 a.m., she tiptoed past them as they slept, took the bag with their passports, then snuck back in again to return the bag so as not to raise suspicion.\n\nIt's a really great memory, exciting, Rawan tells CNN, smiling. Of the two sisters, she's the more talkative, taking the lead and occasionally looking to her sister for advice on the right word in English. Reem is more reserved. She's careful about what she says and who to trust. They both have dark, short, curly hair and being small in stature seem much younger than their years.\n\nWhen the cab driver arrived at 5 a.m., the sisters say they did something they'd never done before. They pulled on jeans they'd bought in secret and walked out of the house without their abayas.\n\nIt was only after they arrived at Colombo Airport that the sisters booked the flight they'd meticulously researched online: SriLankan Airlines flight UL892 departing Colombo at 9 a.m., arriving Hong Kong at 5:10 p.m. local time. From there, they'd take Cathay Pacific flight CX135 departing at 7:10 p.m. for Melbourne, Australia.\n\nThey had no trouble boarding the plane for the roughly six-hour flight to Hong Kong.\n\nIt was after they arrived at Hong Kong International Airport that things started to go wrong.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The younger sister takes a selfie in a hotel room. They say they felt like ghosts under the full-length black robe, as if they were invisible, not there.\n\nArriving in Hong Kong\n\nWhat happened in the transit area was something the sisters might have anticipated had they known their uncle had connections to the Saudi Interior Ministry or had realized the power Saudi officials could have over local airport staff.\n\nAs soon as the women stepped off the plane, they say two men approached them and asked if they were going to Melbourne. The women say the men asked for their passports and boarding passes, first saying they might miss their flight, then suggesting there was something wrong with their Australian visas.\n\nIn a letter to the sisters' lawyer obtained by CNN, SriLankan Airlines has identified the men as Naeem Khan, SriLankan Airlines station manager, and Noman Shah, a staff member for ground handling agent, Jardine Aviation Services.\n\nThe sisters say the men led them to another area of the airport, where their lawyer Michael Vidler says they canceled the women's Cathay Pacific flight to Melbourne and booked them, without their knowledge, on an Emirates flight to Riyadh, via Dubai.\n\nCathay Pacific tells CNN that the sisters' flight was canceled by representatives of SriLankan Airlines.\n\nSriLankan Airlines told CNN its staff members canceled the flight at the explicit request of the Saudi Consulate, which had already booked the sisters on the flight to Riyadh.\n\nThe airline said consular officials told its staff the women's father had phoned and said the sisters needed to go back to Saudi Arabia as soon as possible as their mother was terminally ill.\n\nThe women knew their mother wasn't ill and were quite sure there was nothing wrong with their visas.\n\nWe allege that they were the subject of an attempted kidnapping in an international airport in a restricted area, Vidler tells CNN. The Saudi Consulate was actively trying to deceive them.\n\nCNN has approached the Saudi Consulate in Hong Kong and the Saudi Foreign Ministry for comment on the sisters' claims and has not received a response. Hong Kong Police have confirmed that they're investigating the allegations.\n\nSriLankan Airlines says at no time did the sisters indicate there was a problem. The women disagree.\n\nVidler says that closed-circuit television seen by his team appears to confirm that Saudi Consul General Omar Al Bunayan was at the airport, speaking to the women and airline staff.\n\nThe presence of senior Saudi officials at the airport filled the women with dread. They'd heard about Dina Ali Lasloom, the 24-year-old Saudi woman who was forced onto a plane to Riyadh at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila in April 2017. Her hands, feet and mouth had been bound with duct tape, one witness told Human Rights Watch.\n\nReem and Rawan feared the same could happen to them.\n\nThey excused themselves to go to the bathroom where they made the decision to flee. As they emerged, they said they saw one of their passports on the table. Rawan tried to grab it.\n\nThe teenager says one of the men immediately slapped her hand, prompting the sisters to scream in Arabic, You kidnap us!\n\nThe sisters say they caused such a scene that the Consul General suggested they move to a quieter area where he presented them with their passports and new boarding passes – for Dubai.\n\nThey ran. First to the Cathay desk where counter staff told them their flights had been canceled. Then to the Qantas desk, where they'd hurriedly booked the next flight to Melbourne, QF30, departing at 7:00 p.m.\n\nSoon after they were issued boarding passes, the women say Shah, the ground handling staff member, tried to snatch them.\n\nJardine Aviation Services, whose staff members carry out a number of tasks within the airport, says its employees didn't tell the women their mother was ill or that was there was an issue with their Australia visas. It denies its staff members slapped Hawan's hand or tried to grab the sisters' boarding passes.\n\nHong Kong's Airport Authority has refused to give CNN a closed-circuit recording of the events that unfolded due to privacy concerns.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The women shared selfies they'd taken of their life before they fled. They wore niqabs in public from the age of 11 and at home were told to wear long gowns, so as not to tempt their brothers.\n\nFor the second time in two hours, the sisters say senior Saudi officials stopped them from flying. The sisters say Saudi Vice Consul Al Sharif told staff at the Qantas check-in desk they were running away, had stolen money, and weren't tourists.\n\nAustralian immigration officials were summoned on the phone and after a conversation with the women, Canberra canceled their visas.\n\nThe only issues with the visa occurred when the Vice Consul made what we believe to be false representations to the Australian authorities at the boarding gate of Qantas airlines, Vidler says.\n\nA spokesperson from Australia's Home Affairs department declined to comment on individual cases. Qantas also declined to comment but a spokesman pointed out that the airline does not make visa assessments.\n\nThe sisters say they stayed at the airport for three hours before asking Cathay Pacific counter staff for permission to leave. They wrote their names and a fake Hong Kong contact address then caught a train to the city.\n\nKhashoggi case puts Saudi Arabia under scrutiny\n\nReem and Rawan escaped Saudi Arabia weeks before the world's attention turned to the kingdom and the disappearance of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. They watched from Hong Kong as gruesome details emerged of Khashoggi's murder inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, allegedly by a team of hitmen who cut up his body with a bone saw.\n\nIn November, a source told CNN that the CIA had determined that Khashoggi was killed on the instruction of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, known as MBS, a claim the kingdom denies.\n\nThe Saudi sisters shrug when asked if they are surprised by Khashoggi's murder and the allegation that their country's de facto leader ordered it.\n\nWe know that Saudi Arabia can do stuff like this, Reem says. They are chasing innocent girls, not even important girls, Rawan agrees. We're just normal young women trying to find a life far away from violence.\n\nSoon after the women arrived in Hong Kong, their father and uncle came to the city to find them. Hong Kong police confirmed to CNN that a missing persons report had been filed.\n\nUsing a passport tracking system linked to hotel check-ins, Hong Kong police officers located the sisters on Monday, September 10 and took them into custody for questioning.\n\nThe women say they were held in a room in the imposing Wan Chai police headquarters for six hours, where they repeatedly refused requests from their father and their uncle to see them.\n\nPolice eventually drove them back to their hotel. By that time, it was after midnight and the women hurriedly packed their bags and fled.\n\nIn the five months since, they've moved from shelter to shelter, hotel to hotel, to evade detection and their potential forced return to Riyadh.\n\nThe sisters have not sought asylum in Hong Kong, however. Doing so would have put them at the end of a long queue of claimants caught in Hong Kong's Unified Screening Mechanism (USM), a system used by the government to process asylum claims. The UNHCR doesn't assess claims in Hong Kong.\n\nThrough their lawyer, Reem and Rawan are seeking a visa in a safe country. Vidler says they have few options. Their Saudi passports have been canceled and they don't have formal permission to stay in Hong Kong.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The sisters say being forced to wear the niqab robbed them of their identities. They knew they'd be expected to wear one for the rest of their lives, like their mother.\n\nLife in Saudi Arabia\n\nAt home in Riyadh, the sisters say they were beaten by their father and brothers for a reason and no reason.\n\nOne day when she was 14, Reem says her brother started hitting her for talking and laughing with Rawan. He said that people will hear my voice and it will bring shame, she says.\n\nThe sisters knew it was likely there would be an arranged marriage. There was talk of Rawan marrying her younger cousin, a boy still in high school.\n\nReem was the first to renounce Islam in October 2016, followed by Rawan in May 2017. They didn't dare tell anyone but say they announced it under fake names on Twitter.\n\nI knew If I told my family they will hurt me and I'll be killed. Because that what we studied in schools, that whoever left Islam should be killed. I knew no one will protect me because all my family are so religious and none of them will support me. I was afraid of them finding out, Reem says.\n\nThere are no firm figures on how many Saudi women have escaped the country – or how many have failed in their attempt to leave – but the total number of Saudi asylum seekers is rising.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, 575 Saudi nationals applied for asylum in 2015. Two years later, that figure had more than doubled to over 1,200.\n\nThe period coincides with the rising influence of MBS who in June 2017 was appointed heir to the Saudi throne by his father King Salman.\n\nSince then, MBS has made it clear that dissent won't be tolerated, even as the kingdom has earned international plaudits for new female-focused policies, including lifting the ban on women drivers.\n\nRana Ahmad, a 33-year-old Saudi national who runs the Atheist Refugee Relief agency in Germany, says the jailing and torture of the same women who campaigned for the right to drive had sent a message to some Saudi women that they have no future in the country.\n\nThey look at these women, they're trying to do something and the government puts them in jail. So they see no hope anymore, they want to leave, she said.\n\nAdam Coogle, a Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW), says women whose escape plans are thwarted are at serious risk of abuse.\n\nPunishments range from being locked in their room for months on end or banned from using a mobile phone, to criminal prosecution by the state for disobeying their parents or harming the kingdom's reputation. The women themselves say they fear they'll be killed by their own families.\n\nCoogle says there are few safe corridors for women to leave, because of political pressure the Saudi government applies to some foreign countries to return runaways without giving them the opportunity to claim asylum or put their case forward.\n\nAnywhere you go that doesn't have some sort of respect for refugee law or a strong record of rule of law is a problem because they're the countries where Saudi Arabia can apply its diplomatic pressure to get countries to cooperate, he says.\n\nFew regrets\n\nReem and Rawan say they could see signs of change in Saudi Arabia, but it wasn't moving fast enough for them. They laugh at the suggestion that progress was made by giving Saudi women the right to drive.\n\nDriving cars is not something to celebrate, Reem says. There is a woman abused in the house, and no one hears their voice, and they want us to celebrate a car? Rawan adds.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the sisters watch Netflix to pass the time. Wearing jeans and trainers, they could easily be mistaken for one of the millions of tourists that come through the city each year.\n\nSometimes Reem wears lipstick. She seems relaxed but has a habit of picking at the skin on her fingers when she's nervous. Sometimes, she does it so much that they start to bleed.\n\nThe sisters are anxious about what comes next. But even after five months of uncertainty and fear, they have few regrets.\n\nI regret not waiting, but not leaving, Reem says. From my childhood, I knew this is not my home. I always knew my rights would be taken.\n\nRawan says she too knew there was no life for her in Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhen I was growing up I saw my brothers do whatever they want, have whatever they want. But for me, I should be a good girl, a good woman, to marry someone, my cousin, because I should not even dream to choose my husband, to choose my partner.\n\nI want to study what I want, I want to work what I want, I want to choose the day I marry. To choose the man I marry. Even if I don't want to marry, I want the right to choose.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated with new information from human rights lawyer Michael Vidler who said he originally misspoke about which Saudi consulate official was at the Hong Kong airport speaking to the Saudi sisters and airline staff.

Even the royal family was being modernized, dragged into the 21st century showing just how far we have come. Right wing papers like the Daily Mail even heralded the Markles' remarkable achievement of going from cotton slaves to royalty in just 150 years. The only surprise is how quickly this post-racial fantasy unraveled, culminating in Sunday's tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey, revealing the harrowing time Markle says she endured as a serving royal.\n\nKehinde Andrews\n\nAs if the universe was trying to warn us, May 19 is also Malcolm X's birthday and I dread to think how fast he was spinning in his grave with all the talk of the wedding symbolising racial progress. Malcolm famously declared the 1963 March on Washington, despite its best intentions and relative success, a farce, a production that Hollywood couldn't have topped, so I shudder to think what he would have made of this.\n\nOne revelation from the Oprah interview -- that the couple were already married -- only strengthened the understanding of the event as a spectacle, a made-for-TV special to delude us into believing we were seeing monumental change. But the treatment of Markle, and the bombshells from the interview, are an excellent lesson about racism in the UK and the US in the present day.\n\nPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex and the Duchess of Sussex depart after their wedding ceremony at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on May 19, 2018.\n\nAt the time of the wedding, I worried that the best we could hope for is that Markle melted smoothly into the royal family to the point that she became indistinguishable. My biggest fear was that the couple would be routinely rolled out as a sign of progress and used to bolster Black and brown people's connection to the terrible institution of the British monarchy both in Britain and around the world . But Markle has actually become an object lesson in how racism works today, making it clear that Blackness and the monarchy are like oil and water.\n\nProbably the most shocking revelation from the interview was hearing that Markle was so depressed by her treatment she considered suicide whilst pregnant. Unfortunately, this will likely come as no surprise to any Black person who spends their time navigating White institutions. The constant feeling of being out of place, undermined and misunderstood take a daily toll. The term we use in academia is microaggressions -- the paper cuts of racism that have the cumulative effect of damaging our mental health.\n\nRead More

Anita Raghavan is the author of The Billionaire's Apprentice: The Rise of the Indian-American Elite and the Fall of the Galleon Hedge Fund. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Sixty years ago, two young people, living disparate lives in different parts of India, embarked on an odyssey that would change their future and over time help shape the complexion of a new country: America.\n\nOne came from a tiny fishing village on the country's southwestern coast. The other was a diplomat's daughter, studying in New Delhi, imbibing the intoxicating vapors of a newly independent India.\n\nMy father, Valayamghat Raghavan, and Shyamala Gopalan, Kamala Harris's mother, weren't acquainted but they were pilgrims in the great post-war migration of highly skilled Indians to the United States.\n\nBoth traveled to America in 1958 for their doctoral studies, my father at Princeton University and Gopalan at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nThe America they arrived in was a vastly different country than the one I live and work in today.\n\nIn 1946, in a symbolic relaxation of historic anti-Asian immigration policies, a quota was set of 100 Indians -- yes, 100 -- that were allowed into the US for permanent residence each year.\n\nUnderlying the strict limits on Asian immigration was an ugly but undeniable truth: America's embrace of immigrants was rooted in skin color. In the 1920s, one's whiteness even came to be a perquisite for citizenship through naturalization for Asians.\n\nIn rejecting the quest for citizenship of an Indian immigrant who had served in the US Army during World War I, the US Supreme Court ruled in 1923 that he was not White in the understanding of the common man.\n\nThe children of English, French, German, Italian, Scandinavian and other European parentage quickly merge into the mass of our population and lose the distinctive hallmarks of their European origin, the Court wrote in its opinion. But the children born in this country of Hindu parents would retain indefinitely the clear evidence of their ancestry.\n\nMy father and Gopalan had come to America on student visas which were more plentiful in supply. However, had they wanted to settle in the US after their studies, they would have fallen within the 100-person limit, which made the US unattractive to most Indian students.\n\nBut my father and Gopalan were not most Indians.\n\nAnita Raghavan's father, Valayamghat Raghavan, in Kerala, India, around 2008.\n\nA photo of young Kamala Harris with her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, posted on Harris's Facebook page in March 2017.\n\nLike others who would follow in the decades to come, they were the crème de la crème. As Professor Marcelo Suárez-Orozco, who studies migration, told me, the average Indian in the US is ten thousand times more likely to have a doctorate than the average Indian in India.\n\nTheir journeys -- Gopalan became a breast cancer researcher while my father had an acclaimed career as a botanist -- marked the early stirrings of a wildly successful immigrant group which vaulted to great heights in a single generation.\n\nThe Indian community's collective success in America today is often celebrated. Yet long forgotten are the struggles of the pilgrims -- like my father and Gopalan.\n\nAt a time when America appears to be lurching back to a darker era of prejudice and discrimination, Harris's triumph has to be tempered with a full recounting of the journey that brought us here.\n\nGrowing up as a young Indian girl in America, I was steeped in the story of my father's odyssey from Cochin, India, to New York Harbor.\n\nHe boarded a ship named the Flanders in the summer of 1958 and set off on a month-long journey, stopping along the way in Aden, as Yemen was then known, where he bought a watch, and later Naples where he indulged in a trip to Pompei.\n\nWhen he arrived in New York, he was immediately reminded of his foreignness.\n\nAn immigration officer thrust his chest x-ray on a light box to check for lesions, a clear sign of tuberculosis, a well-known scourge from India.\n\nThere were other reminders of his status as an outsider over the years; some were quite pointed.\n\nOne time, during a trip to the deep South, my parents accompanied friends of theirs, a Polish couple, to a restaurant. The couple were offered a seat in the main dining area. My darker-hued parents were shuttled to the back and served in the kitchen.\n\nThe visa issued to Lakshmi Menon, Anita Raghavan's mother, which allowed her to take up a job at Brooklyn Public Library in 1959.\n\nOften the slurs were not overtly racist, but the message was unmistakable. Students at Ohio State University where my father taught for decades would remark in reviews about his accented English, even though he had studied English in British India and his accent came from the Queen's English and not from adopting its looser American-tinged twang.\n\nIn her book, The Truths We Hold: An American Journey, Vice President Harris touched on the complexity of being an immigrant.\n\nOn the one hand, it is an experience characterized by an extraordinary sense of hopefulness and purpose, a deep belief in the power of the American Dream — an experience of possibility, she wrote. At the same time, it is an experience too often scarred by stereotyping and scapegoating in which discrimination, both explicit and implicit, is part of everyday life.\n\nShe recalled her mother being treated as if she was dumb because of her accent or being followed around a department store with suspicion because surely a brown-skinned woman like her couldn't afford the dress or blouse she had chosen.\n\nAnuradha Subramanian, Kamala Harris's mother's first cousin, said Gopalan told her of instances when Gopalan would be standing at a bus stop and someone would walk in front of her.\n\nComing from India where queuing is not a social tradition, Gopalan first thought America shared the same cultural quirk. But then she noticed a pattern.\n\nAt a restaurant, someone would walk in front of her as if she was not even there, Subramanian recalled. That woman had a right to a table while Shyamala had to wait.\n\nIt took her a little while to realize why they were doing it to her and that is when it ticked her off, continued Subramanian. She once chided someone who ignored her presence in a queue, saying, `Who do you think I am?\n\nStill the sting remained. There were those incidents where she felt very uneasy, where she felt you don't count for much, Subramanian observed.\n\nFor my parents and Gopalan, who passed away in 2009, prospering in America meant assimilation and accommodation.\n\nWhen speaking to colleagues, my father truncated his name to Val Raghavan, which he delivered, almost rehearsed, with a broad American accent and an inviting smile.\n\nHe bonded with coworkers by telling stories of opulent Indian weddings and the brocaded elephants that played a starring role. I suspect he never told them that his own marriage was quite simple; it took place before a justice of the peace in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nMy mother, who like Gopalan came as an unmarried woman a year after my father to work at Brooklyn Public Library, shed her sari for a brief time and wore polyester slacks to fit in at work.\n\nAnita Raghavan's mother, Lakshmi Menon, on her wedding day in 1962 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the Hart-Celler Act which ended national-origins based immigration policies and paved the way for highly skilled immigrants, including Indians, to gain permanent residence.\n\nToday, the results of the Johnson-era reforms are ubiquitous.\n\nTwo of the country's biggest technology companies, Alphabet and Microsoft, are run by men of Indian descent, Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella. One of the most visible symbols of Americana, drinks giant PepsiCo, was run until a few years ago by an Indian American woman, Indra Nooyi.\n\nIn politics, there's former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, touted as a presidential contender in 2024 and, in Hollywood, there's actress Mindy Kaling. Her professional name is a shortened version of the Tamil name Chokalingam.\n\nKamala Harris was sworn into office as San Francisco's district attorney on January 8, 2004, with her mother, Shyamala, at her side.\n\nAs I watched the Vice President being sworn in last month, I thought of my late father and Shyamala Gopalan, whose odysseys made possible the Pichais, the Nadellas -- and now Vice President Kamala Harris. At times, my father encountered people and situations that made him wonder if the opportunities America presented were just a mirage, but he persevered.\n\nHe left the US in 1963 after he received his PhD, only to return six years later with a coveted green card -- thanks to Johnson's immigration reforms.\n\nOver the next several decades, my parents partook in the American Dream, buying a car and a house. But my father never quite shook his Indian-ness, perhaps as a reminder to himself that he would always be a stranger, set apart from this country and its people by his ever-so-visible foreignness.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.

He arrived in a darker, less accepting America -- a country that Indians amid their heady success today all too often forget once existed.

(GREG BAKER/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe night they fled, Reem and Rawan didn't dare sleep.\n\nIt was September 6, 2018. The two Saudi sisters were on a family vacation in Colombo, Sri Lanka. For weeks, they had helped their mother organize the trip, feigning excitement at the possibility of two weeks away from Riyadh, but knowing that if all went to plan, they'd never go back.\n\nFailure was not an option. Every step of their escape from Saudi Arabia carried the threat of severe punishment or death.\n\nWe knew the first time, if it's not perfect, it will be the last time, Reem says.\n\nCNN has changed the sisters' names and is not showing their faces, at their request for their safety.\n\nThe sisters say years of strict Islamic teaching and physical abuse at home had convinced them that they had no future in a society that places women under the enforced guardianship of men, and limits their aspirations.\n\nIt's slavery, because whatever the woman will do it's the business of the male, Rawan says.\n\nThat's why they say they renounced Islam.\n\nAnd that's why aged 18 and 20, they stole back their own passports, hid their abayas under the bedcovers, snuck out of their holiday home and boarded a flight from Colombo to Melbourne, via Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong stopover was supposed to take less than two hours.\n\nTwo hours has turned into five months.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN This photo was taken in a restroom in an airport during a trip to Turkey. The sisters wore this type of niqab when they were traveling outside Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhy they fled\n\nGood girls do what they're told, are quiet, don't argue or risk embarrassing their families. Reem and Rawan say they had turned being good girls into a fine art.\n\nIn our house, we (were) always the good girls they wanted us to be. So, if they want us to clean, we will clean. If they want us to cook, then we will cook, 18-year-old Rawan says.\n\nThe last two years it was really bad, because I just forget who I am, I am just pretending (to be) like an Islamic girl, says her 20-year-old sister, Reem.\n\nThey went to school, studied hard and avoided confrontation. Of course, the same rules didn't apply to their brothers. Beat your sisters, the siblings say their brothers were told, it'll make you better men.\n\nReem and Rawan are reluctant to talk about the abuse at the hands of their family. They say it didn't happen all the time, just enough to remind them of the rules. And enough to fill them with terror about what might happen if anyone found out about their plan or, worse still, caught them carrying it out.\n\nThe escape\n\nLeaving Saudi Arabia is not a simple undertaking for women who rebel against the system. Permission is needed from a male guardian for many basic activities, including international travel.\n\nReem and Rawan say they had been planning their escape in secret for two years. They didn't dare discuss it in case they were overheard, so, instead, they swapped WhatsApp messages, even while alone at night in their shared room.\n\nBefore they fled, the Sri Lanka vacation was just like any other. They wore their niqabs to the beach and sat away from the surf while their brothers swam and joked. They cooked the meals and spent most of their days inside. It was humid. Their niqabs stuck to their skin and made it hard to see.\n\nWe travel to move from a box to another box. From home to hotel, nothing will change, Rawan says. They will go out, they will live freely, the men, of course, we will sit away, watching them doing what they want.\n\nTheir five-year-old sister played in the sand, but their 12-year-old sister, like them, didn't. She too was learning that it's OK to be a girl in Saudi Arabia – until you grow up.\n\nDuring the trip, Rawan turned 18. The timing was no accident. The vacation was planned with gentle persuasion to coincide with a birthday that, unbeknown to their mother, allowed Rawan to apply for an Australian tourist visa.\n\nOn the last night of the trip, the sisters launched into action. Reem pre-booked the taxi. It was Rawan's job to retrieve their passports from a bag stored in their parents' bedroom. Around 2 a.m., she tiptoed past them as they slept, took the bag with their passports, then snuck back in again to return the bag so as not to raise suspicion.\n\nIt's a really great memory, exciting, Rawan tells CNN, smiling. Of the two sisters, she's the more talkative, taking the lead and occasionally looking to her sister for advice on the right word in English. Reem is more reserved. She's careful about what she says and who to trust. They both have dark, short, curly hair and being small in stature seem much younger than their years.\n\nWhen the cab driver arrived at 5 a.m., the sisters say they did something they'd never done before. They pulled on jeans they'd bought in secret and walked out of the house without their abayas.\n\nIt was only after they arrived at Colombo Airport that the sisters booked the flight they'd meticulously researched online: SriLankan Airlines flight UL892 departing Colombo at 9 a.m., arriving Hong Kong at 5:10 p.m. local time. From there, they'd take Cathay Pacific flight CX135 departing at 7:10 p.m. for Melbourne, Australia.\n\nThey had no trouble boarding the plane for the roughly six-hour flight to Hong Kong.\n\nIt was after they arrived at Hong Kong International Airport that things started to go wrong.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The younger sister takes a selfie in a hotel room. They say they felt like ghosts under the full-length black robe, as if they were invisible, not there.\n\nArriving in Hong Kong\n\nWhat happened in the transit area was something the sisters might have anticipated had they known their uncle had connections to the Saudi Interior Ministry or had realized the power Saudi officials could have over local airport staff.\n\nAs soon as the women stepped off the plane, they say two men approached them and asked if they were going to Melbourne. The women say the men asked for their passports and boarding passes, first saying they might miss their flight, then suggesting there was something wrong with their Australian visas.\n\nIn a letter to the sisters' lawyer obtained by CNN, SriLankan Airlines has identified the men as Naeem Khan, SriLankan Airlines station manager, and Noman Shah, a staff member for ground handling agent, Jardine Aviation Services.\n\nThe sisters say the men led them to another area of the airport, where their lawyer Michael Vidler says they canceled the women's Cathay Pacific flight to Melbourne and booked them, without their knowledge, on an Emirates flight to Riyadh, via Dubai.\n\nCathay Pacific tells CNN that the sisters' flight was canceled by representatives of SriLankan Airlines.\n\nSriLankan Airlines told CNN its staff members canceled the flight at the explicit request of the Saudi Consulate, which had already booked the sisters on the flight to Riyadh.\n\nThe airline said consular officials told its staff the women's father had phoned and said the sisters needed to go back to Saudi Arabia as soon as possible as their mother was terminally ill.\n\nThe women knew their mother wasn't ill and were quite sure there was nothing wrong with their visas.\n\nWe allege that they were the subject of an attempted kidnapping in an international airport in a restricted area, Vidler tells CNN. The Saudi Consulate was actively trying to deceive them.\n\nCNN has approached the Saudi Consulate in Hong Kong and the Saudi Foreign Ministry for comment on the sisters' claims and has not received a response. Hong Kong Police have confirmed that they're investigating the allegations.\n\nSriLankan Airlines says at no time did the sisters indicate there was a problem. The women disagree.\n\nVidler says that closed-circuit television seen by his team appears to confirm that Saudi Consul General Omar Al Bunayan was at the airport, speaking to the women and airline staff.\n\nThe presence of senior Saudi officials at the airport filled the women with dread. They'd heard about Dina Ali Lasloom, the 24-year-old Saudi woman who was forced onto a plane to Riyadh at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila in April 2017. Her hands, feet and mouth had been bound with duct tape, one witness told Human Rights Watch.\n\nReem and Rawan feared the same could happen to them.\n\nThey excused themselves to go to the bathroom where they made the decision to flee. As they emerged, they said they saw one of their passports on the table. Rawan tried to grab it.\n\nThe teenager says one of the men immediately slapped her hand, prompting the sisters to scream in Arabic, You kidnap us!\n\nThe sisters say they caused such a scene that the Consul General suggested they move to a quieter area where he presented them with their passports and new boarding passes – for Dubai.\n\nThey ran. First to the Cathay desk where counter staff told them their flights had been canceled. Then to the Qantas desk, where they'd hurriedly booked the next flight to Melbourne, QF30, departing at 7:00 p.m.\n\nSoon after they were issued boarding passes, the women say Shah, the ground handling staff member, tried to snatch them.\n\nJardine Aviation Services, whose staff members carry out a number of tasks within the airport, says its employees didn't tell the women their mother was ill or that was there was an issue with their Australia visas. It denies its staff members slapped Hawan's hand or tried to grab the sisters' boarding passes.\n\nHong Kong's Airport Authority has refused to give CNN a closed-circuit recording of the events that unfolded due to privacy concerns.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The women shared selfies they'd taken of their life before they fled. They wore niqabs in public from the age of 11 and at home were told to wear long gowns, so as not to tempt their brothers.\n\nFor the second time in two hours, the sisters say senior Saudi officials stopped them from flying. The sisters say Saudi Vice Consul Al Sharif told staff at the Qantas check-in desk they were running away, had stolen money, and weren't tourists.\n\nAustralian immigration officials were summoned on the phone and after a conversation with the women, Canberra canceled their visas.\n\nThe only issues with the visa occurred when the Vice Consul made what we believe to be false representations to the Australian authorities at the boarding gate of Qantas airlines, Vidler says.\n\nA spokesperson from Australia's Home Affairs department declined to comment on individual cases. Qantas also declined to comment but a spokesman pointed out that the airline does not make visa assessments.\n\nThe sisters say they stayed at the airport for three hours before asking Cathay Pacific counter staff for permission to leave. They wrote their names and a fake Hong Kong contact address then caught a train to the city.\n\nKhashoggi case puts Saudi Arabia under scrutiny\n\nReem and Rawan escaped Saudi Arabia weeks before the world's attention turned to the kingdom and the disappearance of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. They watched from Hong Kong as gruesome details emerged of Khashoggi's murder inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, allegedly by a team of hitmen who cut up his body with a bone saw.\n\nIn November, a source told CNN that the CIA had determined that Khashoggi was killed on the instruction of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, known as MBS, a claim the kingdom denies.\n\nThe Saudi sisters shrug when asked if they are surprised by Khashoggi's murder and the allegation that their country's de facto leader ordered it.\n\nWe know that Saudi Arabia can do stuff like this, Reem says. They are chasing innocent girls, not even important girls, Rawan agrees. We're just normal young women trying to find a life far away from violence.\n\nSoon after the women arrived in Hong Kong, their father and uncle came to the city to find them. Hong Kong police confirmed to CNN that a missing persons report had been filed.\n\nUsing a passport tracking system linked to hotel check-ins, Hong Kong police officers located the sisters on Monday, September 10 and took them into custody for questioning.\n\nThe women say they were held in a room in the imposing Wan Chai police headquarters for six hours, where they repeatedly refused requests from their father and their uncle to see them.\n\nPolice eventually drove them back to their hotel. By that time, it was after midnight and the women hurriedly packed their bags and fled.\n\nIn the five months since, they've moved from shelter to shelter, hotel to hotel, to evade detection and their potential forced return to Riyadh.\n\nThe sisters have not sought asylum in Hong Kong, however. Doing so would have put them at the end of a long queue of claimants caught in Hong Kong's Unified Screening Mechanism (USM), a system used by the government to process asylum claims. The UNHCR doesn't assess claims in Hong Kong.\n\nThrough their lawyer, Reem and Rawan are seeking a visa in a safe country. Vidler says they have few options. Their Saudi passports have been canceled and they don't have formal permission to stay in Hong Kong.\n\nPHOTO: Supplied to CNN The sisters say being forced to wear the niqab robbed them of their identities. They knew they'd be expected to wear one for the rest of their lives, like their mother.\n\nLife in Saudi Arabia\n\nAt home in Riyadh, the sisters say they were beaten by their father and brothers for a reason and no reason.\n\nOne day when she was 14, Reem says her brother started hitting her for talking and laughing with Rawan. He said that people will hear my voice and it will bring shame, she says.\n\nThe sisters knew it was likely there would be an arranged marriage. There was talk of Rawan marrying her younger cousin, a boy still in high school.\n\nReem was the first to renounce Islam in October 2016, followed by Rawan in May 2017. They didn't dare tell anyone but say they announced it under fake names on Twitter.\n\nI knew If I told my family they will hurt me and I'll be killed. Because that what we studied in schools, that whoever left Islam should be killed. I knew no one will protect me because all my family are so religious and none of them will support me. I was afraid of them finding out, Reem says.\n\nThere are no firm figures on how many Saudi women have escaped the country – or how many have failed in their attempt to leave – but the total number of Saudi asylum seekers is rising.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, 575 Saudi nationals applied for asylum in 2015. Two years later, that figure had more than doubled to over 1,200.\n\nThe period coincides with the rising influence of MBS who in June 2017 was appointed heir to the Saudi throne by his father King Salman.\n\nSince then, MBS has made it clear that dissent won't be tolerated, even as the kingdom has earned international plaudits for new female-focused policies, including lifting the ban on women drivers.\n\nRana Ahmad, a 33-year-old Saudi national who runs the Atheist Refugee Relief agency in Germany, says the jailing and torture of the same women who campaigned for the right to drive had sent a message to some Saudi women that they have no future in the country.\n\nThey look at these women, they're trying to do something and the government puts them in jail. So they see no hope anymore, they want to leave, she said.\n\nAdam Coogle, a Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW), says women whose escape plans are thwarted are at serious risk of abuse.\n\nPunishments range from being locked in their room for months on end or banned from using a mobile phone, to criminal prosecution by the state for disobeying their parents or harming the kingdom's reputation. The women themselves say they fear they'll be killed by their own families.\n\nCoogle says there are few safe corridors for women to leave, because of political pressure the Saudi government applies to some foreign countries to return runaways without giving them the opportunity to claim asylum or put their case forward.\n\nAnywhere you go that doesn't have some sort of respect for refugee law or a strong record of rule of law is a problem because they're the countries where Saudi Arabia can apply its diplomatic pressure to get countries to cooperate, he says.\n\nFew regrets\n\nReem and Rawan say they could see signs of change in Saudi Arabia, but it wasn't moving fast enough for them. They laugh at the suggestion that progress was made by giving Saudi women the right to drive.\n\nDriving cars is not something to celebrate, Reem says. There is a woman abused in the house, and no one hears their voice, and they want us to celebrate a car? Rawan adds.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the sisters watch Netflix to pass the time. Wearing jeans and trainers, they could easily be mistaken for one of the millions of tourists that come through the city each year.\n\nSometimes Reem wears lipstick. She seems relaxed but has a habit of picking at the skin on her fingers when she's nervous. Sometimes, she does it so much that they start to bleed.\n\nThe sisters are anxious about what comes next. But even after five months of uncertainty and fear, they have few regrets.\n\nI regret not waiting, but not leaving, Reem says. From my childhood, I knew this is not my home. I always knew my rights would be taken.\n\nRawan says she too knew there was no life for her in Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhen I was growing up I saw my brothers do whatever they want, have whatever they want. But for me, I should be a good girl, a good woman, to marry someone, my cousin, because I should not even dream to choose my husband, to choose my partner.\n\nI want to study what I want, I want to work what I want, I want to choose the day I marry. To choose the man I marry. Even if I don't want to marry, I want the right to choose.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated with new information from human rights lawyer Michael Vidler who said he originally misspoke about which Saudi consulate official was at the Hong Kong airport speaking to the Saudi sisters and airline staff. Only the Consul General was seen by Vidler's team on closed circuit television.

In 2001, the crane was sold and it took the new owners two years to turn the former machine room into a cozy space.\n\nGuests access the room, which sits at 49 meters (160 feet) in the sky, via an elevator made from the original external ladders of the crane.

In 2010, Jesse Armstrong's script Murdoch -- about an imagined dinner between Twenty-First Century Fox FOX\n\nArmstrong is back with Succession, a new HBO series about the skirmish for control of the world's fifth-largest media conglomerate, presided over by an imperious mogul and his kids. But those associated with the show are shying away from saying it's a fictionalized version of the Murdoch dynasty, citing rather a laundry list of family-run media enterprises, both now and in the past.\n\nCurrent events have certainly done their part to help promote the drama, which stars Brian Cox as Logan Roy, billed as a media titan and pal of prime ministers, as well as Jeremy Strong as his son and presumptive heir. Like Murdoch, Roy has three children (two boys and a girl) from his second marriage and an older child, not in the business, from his first.\n\nKnown primarily as a satirist, the British-born Armstrong said he never feared any You'll never work in this town again-type repercussions from the Murdoch script. On Succession, his collaborators include director Adam McKay, who has experience bringing high-finance machinations to the screen in the movie The Big Short; and journalist Frank Rich, an executive producer on HBO's Veep, who helped shepherd along the project.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the premise is certainly informed by my knowledge of the Murdoch family, Armstrong insisted the screenplay isn't intended to be a Roman a clef -- real people presented under fictitious names -- but rather an amalgam of stories.\n\nRelated: Lachlan Murdoch, not James, will lead new Fox company\n\nArmstrong cites Viacom's Sumner Redstone -- whose company has passed to daughter Shari -- the book Disney War (about the struggle over that company) and the Murdoch-Robert Maxwell tabloid rivalry of the 1980s among a diverse array of influences, along with family-run enterprises like Comcast and the Sinclair broadcast group.\n\nIt's touching that people only think there's one of these around, Armstrong said. Dynastic families are all around us.\n\nThis has been a boom time for corporate succession tales, with Murdoch's planned sale of most Fox entertainment assets to Disney (DIS); Shari Redstone and Leslie Moonves' pitched and public battle over CBS (CBS) and Viacom (VIA); and AT&T's pending acquisition of Time Warner (TWX).\n\nSpeaking of Time Warner, the company -- which owns HBO and CNN -- was the subject of a takeover bid by Murdoch in 2014.\n\nReferring to recent headlines, Armstrong said, When you're doing a show like this, you're always thinking, 'S—t, we just missed our moment.'\n\nRich allowed that the show possesses a certain kind of similarity to those billionaire families, but added that whatever parallels media-savvy viewers see in Succession, the series will rise and fall on the basis that people are drawn into these characters.\n\nAccording to the producers, HBO gave the creative team complete freedom, with nary a note about its mostly unflattering depiction of this modern-day media baron and his progeny, who -- much like the characters in Showtime's Billions -- reside within a world of wealth and privilege, wielding sharp elbows at those who dare cross them.\n\nAs with Veep and comics like Bill Maher and John Oliver, Rich said, the premium channel is willing to take on the powers that be.\n\nSuccession premieres June 3 on HBO.
Los Angeles (CNN) Even after his emergency surgery, the path to recovery is long and uncertain for golf legend Tiger Woods , following his car accident in California.\n\nHe is still in that acute phase where they may still have a lot of work to do in the present, in moments, in days to come, Dr. Jeremy Faust, emergency physician Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, told CNN on Wednesday. It's unclear to me whether he will be going back to the operating room or not.\n\nWoods was initially treated at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance but was transferred Thursday to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for continuing orthopedic care and recovery, said Anish Mahajan, interim CEO/CMO of the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.\n\nOn behalf of our staff, it was an honor to provide orthopedic trauma care to one of our generation's greatest athletes, Mahajan said in a statement.\n\nThe 45-year-old was driving Tuesday in Rancho Palos Verdes, near Los Angeles, shortly after 7 a.m. PT when his SUV crossed a median and veered across two lanes of road before hitting a curb, hitting a tree and landing on its side in the brush, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said Tuesday.\n\nWoods sustained injuries to his leg that required a rod, screws, pins and a surgical release of the muscle covering -- one that surgeons likely believed would save his leg from amputation, Faust said.\n\nAuthorities believe that the incident was  purely an accident , but will have to pull the black box event recorder from the vehicle to make that determination, Villanueva said. When he saw Woods in the hospital Tuesday, the 15-time major champion told investigators he had no memory of the crash.\n\nJust a month after his fifth career back surgery, the most recent crash threatens to set back his hopes of returning to golf glory.\n\nTiger Woods of the United States looks on after a shot on the second hole during the final round of the Masters at Augusta National Golf Club in 2020.\n\nHe has made comebacks before\n\nThough fellow golf professionals have acknowledged that Woods' health and his family are the most important things to consider at this time, they are also not counting him out.\n\nHe has done it before, Rory McIlroy said.\n\nFamous from an early age, Woods turned professional in 1996 at just 21 years old, and his talent and charisma transformed him into a global icon. He won a remarkable 14 golf majors from 1997 through 2008 and looked set to stroll past the all-time record of 18 set by Jack Nicklaus.\n\nBut a series of injuries and personal issues derailed that career trajectory. In 2009, a car crash outside his Florida home led to tawdry revelations about his rampant infidelity and the collapse of his marriage.\n\nAfter a break from the sport, he returned to golf but without the smothering dominance of his earlier years. There was also a growing list of injuries, leading to four back operations, including spinal fusion surgery, as well as the dark times where the pain was so bad he couldn't even get out of bed or play with his kids.\n\nThe operations and pain led to an addiction to opioid painkillers, and he was arrested on a DUI charge in 2017 in Florida. He pleaded guilty to reckless driving as part of a program to keep him from serving prison time.\n\nThat low point made his return to the top of the sport in 2019 all the more stunning. At the Masters, he surged to the lead and, followed by roaring crowds, clinched his first major win since the US Open in 2008 in one of the great comebacks in sports history.\n\nWorld No. 2 John Rahm said he hoped Woods would be able to play golf and win more tournaments.\n\nAnd that he would be able to then have a proper retirement, by standing on the iconic Swilcan Bridge in St. Andrew's Golf Course in Scotland and just being able to properly say goodbye to the game.\n\nA tow truck recovers the vehicle driven by golfer Tiger Woods in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, after a rollover accident..\n\nSafety features and the seat belt saved his life, authorities say\n\nWoods was driving a Genesis SUV courtesy vehicle by himself and is believed to have been traveling at a high rate of speed before the crash, authorities said. There were no skid marks or other indications of braking, Villanueva added.\n\nVillanueva said that section of road is downhill on a curve, and he and Gonzalez said the area is known as a trouble spot for speeding and accidents. The road has seen 13 accidents since last January.\n\nLos Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Carlos Gonzalez, who responded to the crash, found a lucid Woods still strapped into his seat belt but trapped as the SUV had rolled over onto the driver's side door.\n\nI do think the fact that he was wearing a seat belt and that the vehicle safety features worked as designed by the manufacturer likely resulted in either reducing his injury or saving his life, Gonzalez told CNN's Chris Cuomo.\n\nThe car he was driving also featured an all-new safety platform, an executive for the automaker said in a statement to CNN.\n\nThe safety features of the Genesis GV80 include a strong focus on passenger compartment protection/reinforcement areas, said Dana White, Chief Communications Officer for Genesis Motor North America. This includes the use of advanced high strength steel for rigidity and safety.\n\nThe vehicle was equipped with 10 standard airbags, including a center-side airbag unique to Genesis that deploys between the front seats, according to White.\n\nWhile the exterior of the vehicle was mangled in the crash, the interior damage was such that Woods could survive.\n\nWe have seen accidents with far less obvious (damage) that are fatalities, Villanueva told CNN.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nANNOUNCER: In the CROSSFIRE, the fallout from the 9/11 Commission hearings.\n\n\n\nRICHARD CLARKE, FRM. COUNTERTERRORISM ADVISER: By invading Iraq, the president of the United States has greatly undermined the war on terrorism.\n\n\n\nANNOUNCER: Is Richard Clarke's criticism believable?\n\n\n\nJOHN F. LEHMAN, COMMISSION MEMBER: You've got a real credibility problem. I hope you'll resolve that credibility problem.\n\n\n\nBOB KERREY, 9/11 COMMISSIONER: Everything that you've said today, and done has not damaged my view of the integrity.\n\n\n\nANNOUNCER: Today on CROSSFIRE.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nANNOUNCER: Live from the George Washington University, James Carville and Robert Novak.\n\n\n\nJAMES CARVILLE, CO-HOST: Welcome to CROSSFIRE. The Bush administration is sure trying hard to discredit Richard Clarke. Too bad they don't put as much effort into fighting al Qaeda before 9/11.\n\n\n\nROBERT NOVAK, CO-HOST: Richard Clarke's allegations are not credible, but since when have the Democrats cared about credibility? We'll get to that debate right after the best political briefing in television, our CROSSFIRE Political Alert.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nNOVAK: It was weeks ago that John Kerry clinched the presidential nomination, but Howard Dean is just getting around to endorsing Kerry. That must be hard, considering the nasty things Dean said about Kerry during the campaign. Paul Maslin (ph), Dean's former pollster writes in the Atlantic Monthly that Dean really disliked Kerry, that the two were like oil and water. Maslin also says Dean was ready to give up the nomination rather than release personal correspondence where he (UNINTELLIGIBLE) his nasty thoughts about fellow Democrats. Pollster Maslin says on Dean, quote, he's (UNINTELLIGIBLE) judgment, loose tongue, and overall stubborness wore our spirits down. He refused to be scripted, to be discipline or to discipline himself, end quote. Only Howard Dean could make John Kerry look good.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: Bob, you're a very experienced reporter. You know a lot about politics. Tell me how much does -- do George Bush and John McCain, how much do they really like each other?\n\n\n\nNOVAK: I thought we're talking about...\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: I know but you were saying it's unusual that Dean doesn't like Kerry. I'm asking you as a seasoned journalist, how much affection is there between George W. Bush and John McCain?\n\n\n\nNOVAK: You're going to change the subject.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: No, I'm not.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: I thought you were changing the subject.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: No, I'm just saying it's not unusual that people -- I know you won't answer the question because you're too honest a man to answer because you know the answer is none.\n\n\n\nWhite House -- White House spokesman Scott McClellan this weekend defended the administration against charges of negligence before 9/11 saying, fighting al Qaeda was, quote, top priority before the attacks. Well, my good friends over at the Center for American Progress have done a little research and they can't find one example of President Bush, Vice President Cheney, or National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice ever speaking the words al Qaeda or Osama bin Laden between the time they took office and 9/11.\n\n\n\nSo they're holding a contest. Anyone that can find an example of Bush, Cheney or Condi saying the words al Qaeda or Osama bin Laden before 9/11 gets a prize. In fact, I'll throw in a copy of my book, Had Enough, to the first person who can prove they're wrong. Just log on to Progressreport.org for more information. These guys say that they're such great terror fighters but prior to September 11 they didn't hear any evil, they didn't see any evil, and they sure in hell didn't speak any evil.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: Matter of fact, James, having to get your book is not a prize, I would say.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: I'll throw in something else.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: I would hope so.\n\n\n\nI would think that you were not present at the meetings of the administration where they talked about Osama bin Laden. They talked about al Qaeda. That is really...\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: Why didn't he say anything publicly?\n\n\n\nNOVAK: Wait a minute, let me finish my sentence. That is really stupid to say that because those things go on behind closed doors.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: I said if they'd have wanted al Qaeda they should have sent them a check.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: If you have $1,000 to waste on Democrats, you might still get a ticket for tonight's party unity dinner in Washington. What a band of brothers. Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, who detest each other, will be at the same head table. They last saw each other just after 9/11. President Clinton also will be back with his estranged running mate, Al Gore. They haven't even seen each other for months. But Congressman Dennis Kucinich was kept out because he has not yet endorsed Kerry. He'll have to -- Dennis will have to miss going with Clinton, Carter and Gore, nightclubbing in Washington, to hear Outcast, Ginuwine, Kenneth Babyface Edmunds and Q-Tip. That should distract the feuding Democrats.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: What -- what feuding Democrats? I don't know how to tell you this, Bob, but this party is the most united that I've ever seen it. I don't know -- what's so unusual about Democrats getting together and having a fund-raiser? Good God, that's all the White House does. They have ten a day. I tell you what, there are not going to be many people in the pollution industry at a Republican fund-raiser, if we get the people at the...\n\n\n\nNOVAK: You used to have a sense of humor.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: I've got one.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: Maybe. But I think it's really funny that Clinton and Carter, who have even each other once in ten years have to go to a nightclub together. If that isn't funny, I don't know what is.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) with Jimmy Carter in 1992. What are you talking about? President Clinton went down there and helped build houses. Today George W. Bush released two new television advertisements. The first says that John Kerry's economic record is, quote, troubling. And that ad doesn't mention George Bush's economic plan has turned up a $5.6 trillion surplus into a $4 trillion deficit.\n\n\n\nTo me that's kind of...troubling. The second ad says Bush's tax cut helped the economy. What it doesn't say is President Bush promises tax cuts would create 4 million jobs. So far he's lost 3 million. By my math, 7 million short. When you look at what these ads say compared to what President Bush has done, I've got three pieces of advice for our president, stop lying, stop digging and for God's sake's stop bragging. It's troubling.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: I'll tell you what's troubling for me and it better be troubling for John Kerry and they're nervous as hell because they're telling the truth about the fact that Democrats have their own disease, attacks tax increase disease. He is coming out to talk about increasing taxes, he's way...\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: Sure is. He's going to raise taxes on the top 1 percent to pay for health care for middle Americans. And middle America, you've got a choice. Vote me a tax cut or you health care. You want me to get a tax cut, vote for Bush. You want health care vote for Kerry. NOVAK: That is the line that is matter of fact when he rolls back these taxes, he rolls back the marriage penalty thing, the children's credit, all of that and a big gas tax on top of it.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: That's not true.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: Investigating the 9/11 attacks. Is it all strictly politics? and can anybody in Washington ask that question with a straight face?\n\n\n\nAnd why is President Bush making such a face? We'll let the president himself answer that a little later.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: Richard Clarke says the Bush administration blew its chance to take down al Qaeda by going after Iraq. And so just today in a newly released audiotape we've got al Qaeda's No. 2 guy supposedly calling for the overthrow of Pakistan's government.\n\n\n\nTo debate the extent of the Bush administration's incompetence we're joined from Capitol Hill by Democratic Congressman and my dear friend and general pain in the behind Congressman Rahm Emanuel of Illinois. And one of my favorite Republicans, Congressman Peter King of New York. Thank you all for coming.\n\n\n\nMESERVE: Congressman Emmanuel, let me read to you from Richard Clarke's resignation letter to President Bush just about a year ago. Said, It has been an enormous privilege to serve you these last 24 months. I will always the courage, determination, calm and leadership you demonstrated on September 11.\n\n\n\nAnd then at yesterday's hearing, Mr. Emmanuel, when Mr. Clarke was challenged why besides that (UNINTELLIGIBLE) language and a briefing with the press he had been even more supportive of the president. Why did he say that? Here's what his answer was. Let's listen to it.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCLARKE: I was asked to highlight the positive aspects of what the administration had done, and to minimize the negative aspects of what the administration had done.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nNOVAK: In other words, this guy is a spin artist. You know, how can you tell he's telling the truth now when he says he wasn't telling the truth a year ago when he was briefing the press?\n\n\n\nREP. RAHM EMANUEL (D), ILLINOIS: Bob, I think I know something about spin. Dick Clarke is not a spin artist. And the fact is, look, when I worked with him, you had good days and bad days. He was a tough guy to work with. He worked for Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Bill Clinton and this president. Three Republicans, one Democrat. But nobody ever questions his patriotism. You may not like the way he forcefully -- I'm like a dog with a bone. He's like a dog with a bone. He was tough. But he always did it because he thought of protecting America. He thought what he wanted to do was right for America.\n\n\n\nTo question his patriotism or to somehow what he's doing is political you're missing the point. This guy is a true patriot. You may not agree with him.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nNOVAK: Congressman, I am so sick of every time I criticize one of the Bush bashers, they say you're questioning his patriotism. I didn't say a damn thing about patriotism.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nNOVAK: Let me repeat -- let me repeat what my question was. And don't give me this patriotism baloney. I'm asking you, how can you tell...\n\n\n\nEMANUEL: Bob, it's great to be on the show.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: Wait a minute, let me ask the question. How can you tell when he's telling the truth when he says I was just giving a lot of baloney before? How do you know he's telling the truth now?\n\n\n\nEMANUEL: Because he was there. That was a different question than what you asked, Bob.\n\n\n\nBut what you said to me, he was just a spin artist. I said no he's not a spin artist. He happens to be a patriot. I didn't say you questioned his patriotism, No. 1.\n\n\n\nNo. 2, as Dick Clarke oversaw -- the war on terrorism. He has a very particular point that's worth debating if you want to have a debate, which is by going to war in Iraq we diverted resources from the war on terrorism in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nRecently we just sent some resources to Afghanistan we couldn't have sent because we had them tied down in Iraq. That is a legitimate policy discussion. And he made that claim. I happen to think it's right. And that is a legitimate -- being held in this country. That doesn't make him a spin artist. Happens to make him a person who has a view on foreign policy.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: Congressman King?\n\n\n\nREP. PETER KING (R), NEW YORK: Yes, sir.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: Today Senator Zell Miller said that these hearings were detrimental to America. Do you agree with him?\n\n\n\nKING: I think the hearings served a purpose. But I have to say that I think Dick Clarke's conduct over the past week has been shameful. And I have to question his integrity, not his patriotism.\n\n\n\nThe reason I'm saying that is what he's saying today is so different from what he said a year and a half ago. And the facts don't back up what he is saying.\n\n\n\nListen, I was not one of those people who attacked Bill Clinton for everything he did. I think he did not get enough credit for going into Bosnia. That did stop al Qaeda from moving more into Europe.\n\n\n\nIn 1998, I did support the attacks in the camps. I think he could have done more. There's also a lot there to criticize. But I realize what a tough issue it is.\n\n\n\nAnd for Dick Clarke to be saying what George Bush did from January 20 to September 4th of 2001, that he was not paying attention to terrorism, was not important, I think that's shameful.\n\n\n\nNothing he said in that -- in the previous three years backs up anything he's saying today.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: Can you point to anything, can you help my friends help me out and point to any time that President Bush or Vice President Cheney or Condoleezza Rice ever mentioned the words Osama bin Laden or al Qaeda or talked about what they were going to do? Can you help us out? You'll get a free copy of my book.\n\n\n\nKING: First of all...\n\n\n\nNOVAK: He doesn't want a free copy.\n\n\n\nKING: I don't want any copy. Give me the book anyway.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: OK, I'll be glad to.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nKING: James, be serious about this.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: I'm very serious.\n\n\n\nKING: So am I.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: How many times you think they mentioned tax cuts for oil companies?\n\n\n\nKING: James, this is a very serious issue. The fact is from January 20 through September 4 there were any number of meetings held, as Dick Clarke himself said a year and a half ago.\n\n\n\nThe Bush administration continued everything the Clinton administration is doing, plus they increased spending 500 percent for covert activities, starting dealing with Pakistan and Uzbekistan and turned around their policies. There were real, substantive steps. Would that have been enough? I don't know. But to say they're ignoring terrorism is absolutely untrue. It's disgraceful. It's shameful. People like you are perverting this issue.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: Congressman Emanuel, the height of this controversy and the most outrageous thing that Dick Clarke said was that the attack on Iraq was hurting the war on terrorism. And I would like to get the response to that by the Democratic vice presidential nominee of the year 2000, your man, Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and let's listen to him.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. JOE LIEBERMAN (D), CONNECTICUT: I just can't believe it. There's no evidence of it.\n\n\n\nI know that the administration after September 11 was very focused on uniting the country and then going on to strike back at al Qaeda in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nAnd we had some very important, and constructive moments of non- partisan, national unity after September 11. And I don't want to rewrite that history. That was important.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nNOVAK: Now, is that -- is that honesty and patriotism? Why Joe Lieberman didn't do well in the primary elections?\n\n\n\nEMANUEL: Joe is entitled to his view. I happen to think that a lot of people in the military and in our national foreign policy establishment to this country, both in government and out of government, happen to agree with Dick Clark's position.\n\n\n\nIt is Dick Clarke's view that the war in Iraq diverted resources right at the crucial time when we had al Qaeda and specifically Osama bin Laden on the run.\n\n\n\nAnd if you don't think that, then your subscription to the newspapers has ended about a year ago. We've had this debate in the country, and a lot of people believe that. In fact, many men and women in the leadership, the military believe because we were tied down in Iraq, we couldn't keep the resources...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nEMANUEL: That's right. And General Shinseki told you it's going to take 200,000, was fired for telling his view. The fact is, we just recently sent troops over to Afghanistan that had prior to that been in Iraq and tied down. That is a dedication of resources.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: Congressman King, Vice President Cheney, the president's No. 1 go-to guy was placed in charge of two task forces. One on energy and one on terrorism. Just guessing, which one do you think met more often, the one to give tax breaks to oil companies or the one to try to stop al Qaeda? KING: The fact is when it comes to terrorism it was President Bush that met every day with the director of Central Intelligence who he kept on from the Clinton administration, which I think showed his interest in the issue and his bipartisanship.\n\n\n\nNow listen, I could take a cheap shot by saying that Bill Clinton never met with his own CIA director. But he had a different way of doing things. President Bush did meet with George Tenet every day. If that doesn't show a commitment to countering terrorism, I don't know what does.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: Congressman, I asked a question. What met more, Dick Cheney's task force on tax breaks for the energy companies or the one on terrorism?\n\n\n\nKING: James, that is a stupid question. The fact is...\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: Why is it a stupid question? I don't understand why it's stupid.\n\n\n\nKING: Because it took the Clinton administration eight years to come up with an anti-terrorism policy. Within seven months, the Bush administration came up with a policy.\n\n\n\nBut let me say something about Iraq, if I could. I agree with Rahm. I think we can't have a legitimate debate about Iraq. But what's wrong for Dick Clarke to do is say that it was wrong for Rumsfeld or Wolfowitz to bring this up after September 11.\n\n\n\nI remember meeting with Jim Woolsey three days after September 11 and he thought Iraq was involved.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: OK, next in RapidFire we'll ask our guests if the 9/11 hearings are helping or hurting the war on terrorism.\n\n\n\nAnd right after the break, a tape said to come from an al Qaeda leader threatens a key player in the fight against terrorism.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: It's time for Rapidfire. So you can't blame us for asking short questions and expecting short answers. We're talking about the 9/11 blame game with Democratic Congressman Rahm Emanuel of Illinois and Republican Congressman Peter King of the great state of New York.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: Rahm Emanuel, what about your old friend Zell Miller saying that these hearings and all this abuse of the president hurts America around the world in the war on terrorism?\n\n\n\nREP. RAHM EMANUEL (D), ILLINOIS: Every hearing we've ever had to evaluate a national crisis in America has strengthened America for the future and I disagree. CARVILLE: Congressman, do you think that Condoleezza rice should testify publicly so the families can understand what she was doing or not doing at this time?\n\n\n\nREP. PETER KING (R) NEW YORK: She's a great public servant. I believe in the separation of powers. She's testified for four hours. She'll testify as long as she has to in private. Again, remember all the times executive privilege was claimed during the Clinton administration and seriously there's a constitutional basis for it. I support it. She will cooperate completely. You cannot have a presidential adviser testifying before a congressionally mandated commission.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: Congressman, do you believe, you're a sophisticated guy, do you believe watching these hearings that Dick Clarke has a problem with this African-American woman Condoleezza Rice?\n\n\n\nEMANUEL: Say that again?\n\n\n\nNOVAK: Do you believe that Dick Clarke has a problem with this African-American woman Condoleezza Rice?\n\n\n\nEMANUEL: No, no. Bob, give me a break. No. No.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: Congressman King, give us three factual errors contained in the Clarke book.\n\n\n\nKING: Well, actually, the main one is first of all saying that there was a Clinton plan. There was no Clinton plan.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: Factual error in the book.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: That's a factual error.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: No, that's a conclusion. Factual error in this book.\n\n\n\nKING: I would say it's wrong for him to say that it was inappropriate for the president to raise Iraq. Let me ask you. You tell me one thing...\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: That's an opinion.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nNOVAK: Wait a minute. This is Rapidfire.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: I think it was stupid to go into Iraq. That's my opinion. That's my opinion. It's the stupidest thing we ever did.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: Congressman Emanuel, why didn't President Clinton, when he had the gunsights of the country on Osama bin Laden, pull the trigger?\n\n\n\nEMANUEL: Well...\n\n\n\nNOVAK: After the Cole incident. EMANUEL: Bob, he did as Peter mentioned earlier, he threw cruise missiles at him when we thought we had him. We had him a couple of times. One of the things that hasn't been said in this show, on 12/31/99 we stopped the terrorist act here in America.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: We're out of time. I'll have to brief you on it sometime. Rahm Emanuel, thank you very much. Peter King. Next, just who was President Bush calling in this picture?\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: We have our political differences but I'll say this for President George W. Bush, once he leaves government he might find a future as a comedian. Here's a snippet of his slide show at last night's White House -- excuse me, Radio and Television Correspondents dinner.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This one was taken a couple of months ago. I had just gotten word that Howard Dean had lost Iowa.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: Here's another. The president said when he was impersonating North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il, calling John Kerry to say, you're my guy.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: As a matter of fact, Kim Jong-Il, they're very close. He's very close to Kerry.\n\n\n\nCARVILLE: Yes, absolutely. You've got to believe it. Terribly close to him, just like a whole kind of other people are close. From the left, I'm James Carville, that's it for CROSSFIRE.\n\n\n\nNOVAK: From the right, I'm Bob Novak, join us again next time for another edition of CROSSFIRE.

(Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nRihanna claims her father and his business partner fraudulently used her name to make money and she's suing them over it.\n\nThe singer alleges that her father, Ronald Fenty, and his partner, Moses Perkins, falsely represented their company's affiliation with her.\n\nAlthough Mr. Fenty is Rihanna's father, he does not have, and never has had, authority to act on Rihanna's behalf, nor has he ever been authorized to use her name, intellectual property or publicity rights, the suit obtained by CNN reads. Similarly, neither Mr. Perkins nor the Company has any affiliation whatsoever with Rihanna.\n\nThe pair launched Fenty Entertainment, a production and talent company, in 2017.\n\nRihanna's popular Fenty Beauty line of cosmetics also launched in 2017. She has a lingerie product line as well.\n\nThe suit states that Fenty and Perkins have repeatedly been asked to stop misrepresenting themselves and to cease and desist all activity and efforts to exploit Rihanna's name and the goodwill associated with the Fenty brand.\n\nThe pair unsuccessfully attempted to register the Fenty name for a line of resort hotels, according to the suit.\n\nRihanna also alleges that Fenty and Perkins negotiated an unauthorized deal for her to perform 15 shows in Latin America for $15 million, and two 15-minute sets at Calibash at Staples Center and T-Mobile Arena for $400,000.\n\nThe singer is seeking to stop the pair from using her name or the Fenty brand, as well as damages and attorney's fees.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Rihanna talked about her complicated relationship with her father, who, she said, had a tumultuous marriage with her mother.\n\nHe taught me everything, Rihanna told Winfrey. As awful as he was to my mom at times, it didn't compare to how great he was as a father.\n\nCNN has reached out to Rihanna, Fenty and Perkins for comment.
Editor's note: The article contains descriptions of alleged abuse that some may find disturbing.\n\nParis (CNN) It all started with damning allegations from book excerpts published in France's prestigious Le Monde newspaper as the new year began.\n\nI was 14 and I let it go (...). I was 14, I knew and didn't say anything.\n\nMy stepfather would come into my brother's room. I could hear his footsteps in the hallway and knew he was joining him. In this silence, I imagined things. That he was asking my brother to stroke him maybe, to suck him.\n\nI was waiting. I was waiting for him to come out of the room, full of unfamiliar and immediately despised smells, the book's author, 45-year old lawyer Camille Kouchner, wrote. By not naming what was happening, I participated in the incest.\n\nMore than a month after its publication, Kouchner's book, La familia grande, continues to rock France.\n\nIn it, Kouchner accuses her step-father, leading French intellectual Olivier Duhamel, of abusing her twin brother starting when he was 14.\n\nThe twins are the children of former French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner.\n\nTheir step-father, Duhamel, is a Socialist former member of the European Parliament and a renowned political pundit who also headed the governing board of Sciences Po, one of France's leading universities.\n\nBeing subjected to personal attacks, and in an attempt to preserve the institutions in which I work, I terminate my functions, Duhamel wrote on Twitter on January 4, shortly after the accusations surfaced. The tweet coincided with his quitting the governing board of Sciences Po as well as leaving roles in an intellectual club and a political science publication.\n\nDuhamel has since deleted the tweet and his Twitter account.\n\nThe book La familia grande, written by Camille Kouchner, has prompted a national reckoning with child abuse.\n\nOn January 5, the Paris Prosecutor's office announced it was opening an investigation into Duhamel for rape and sexual assault by a person having authority over a 15-year-old minor, despite the statute of limitations having run out.\n\nCNN has reached out to Duhamel's attorney for comments but has not received a reply. The political scientist has not publicly spoken since his resignation.\n\nDuhamel's stepson -- Camille's Kouchner's twin brother -- also filed a complaint against Duhamel last month, according to a statement by his lawyer Jacqueline Laffont obtained by CNN and initially sent to AFP news agency.\n\nIn the context of the 'Duhamel case', the alleged victim informed the AFP, through his lawyer, Jacqueline Laffont, that he had filed a complaint against his ex-stepfather, Mr. Olivier Duhamel following the opening of a preliminary investigation by the Paris prosecutor's office, the statement read.\n\nTop university shaken\n\nThe repercussions of the Duhamel case are being felt far beyond his family circle.\n\nSciences Po director Frederic Mion resigned on Tuesday in a letter to professors and students that was published on the university's website.\n\nThe university is one of France's most elite schools, having produced five French prime ministers and five French presidents including current leader Emmanuel Macron.\n\nFor the past month, Mion was under pressure to resign from student groups after acknowledging he was made aware of the allegations against Duhamel as early as 2018.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Mion referred to an Education Ministry report on his handling of the case, conceding that he committed an error of judgment in dealing with the allegations that were communicated to me in 2018 as well as inconsistencies in the way I have expressed myself on this case after it broke.\n\nIn a statement released on January 7, Mion reacted to an article published in Le Monde newspaper the day before claiming that he knew of the allegations despite initially denying them.\n\nWith neither tangible evidence nor any further or precise knowledge of the situation, I had difficulty believing that the rumors could be founded, Mion wrote in the statement. He said that discovering through press reports the extent of Duhamel's alleged actions was a shock to me personally.\n\nBut on Wednesday, in an email to CNN, former Culture Minister Aurélie Filippetti -- once a colleague of Mion at Sciences Po -- said that Mion had called her when the revelations around Duhamel surfaced a month ago and allegedly told her: We shouldn't let anyone think that we knew.\n\nCNN has reached out to Mion but has not received a reply.\n\nMion is only one of many members of the French elite to be hit by the Duhamel scandal.\n\nJean Veil, a prominent attorney and old friend of Duhamel, admitted to Le Monde newspaper that he was aware of the incest for at least 10 years, invoking professional secrecy to explain his silence.\n\nCamille Kouchner denounced what she views as the silence of the French intelligentsia in her book.\n\nVery quickly, the microcosm of people in power, Saint-Germain-des-Prés [a fancy neighborhood on the Left Bank that has long been associated with the French intellectual elite] was informed. Many people knew, and most pretended nothing had happened, she wrote.\n\nVictims come forward\n\nBeyond the country's elite where it originated, the Duhamel scandal has prompted a national reckoning on incest in France, with hundreds of purported victims coming forward on social media under the hashtag #MetooInceste. French people took to Twitter to share harrowing stories of childhood abuse at the hands of parents and family members and how that trauma -- and the accompanying sense of shame and isolation -- often persisted well into their adult lives.\n\nFeminist thinker and activist Caroline De Haas, who was one of the initiators of #MeTooIncest, told CNN: We wanted to show incest was a political, collective issue.\n\nShe explained the #MeTooIncest movement came from a will to shift from the individual story of the Kouchner twins towards a collective history of incest.\n\nStudents demonstrate in front of the Sciences Po university to denounce gender-based violence. Signs read We believe you and Silence = accomplice.\n\nFrench lawyers have also seen a rise in the number of victims stepping forward to share their stories. Child protection lawyer Marie Grimaud told France Inter radio on Tuesday that for three weeks we have received many calls from women who have realized the need to speak, to meet a lawyer, to file a complaint. In addition to victims themselves, Grimaud said her office had been contacted by people on behalf of a brother or little sister or a niece who they believe may be in danger.\n\nFacing Incest, an NGO supporting abuse victims, said 10% of French people had suffered incest, according to a representative survey of 1,033 French adults aged 18 and above, interviewed online November 4-5, 2020, by the IPSOS polling agency. It is a mass crime we are talking about, says the non-profit.\n\nFacing Incest has long advocated for changing the legislation to better protect minors from sexual abuse within the family. With the Duhamel scandal grabbing French media headlines for over a month, the government has taken hold of the issue.\n\nJustice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti told France 2 public broadcaster on Tuesday that the government planned to categorize any penetrative sexual relationship with a child under 15 as rape.\n\nCurrently, for a sexual relationship with a minor under 15 to be treated as a serious crime -- rather than a lesser offense with a lighter penalty -- it is necessary to prove coercion, violence, threat or surprise.\n\nThe issue of consent of the victim won't be raised anymore. We won't question whether or not the victim was consenting, if they were under 15, junior Minister for Children and Family Adrien Taquet told Europe 1 on Tuesday.\n\nIn France, incest is legally defined as sexual intercourse between two people who are related to a degree where marriage is prohibited. Besides direct family ties, the prohibition also includes relatives by marriage -- so divorcees cannot marry a child or parent of their ex-spouse for instance. The civil code doesn't prohibit marriage between cousins.\n\nBeyond that, incest is not illegal as long as the relationship is freely consensual between people above 15, the age of sexual consent in the country. While rape is prohibited no matter who the perpetrator is, sexual offenses committed by a family member or any person having authority over the victim face a heavier penalty.\n\nFacing Incest said on its Twitter account that the government's proposals on the age of consent were elusive and expressed the hope that MPs would bring more clarity as they work on the bill.\n\nDe Haas told CNN that the current debates around the bill bothered her due to their focus on repressive legislation. What's needed is a public policy of training and prevention, she said.\n\nReflecting on the broader impact of the Duhamel scandal on French society, De Haas said the case had brought incest to the forefront of public debate and made it a high-profile political issue.\n\nThat is thanks to the legacy of #MeToo she said, noting that the movement brought a realization that sexual violences were not isolated acts but a social and political phenomenon.
In December 2003, Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin happily shared their baby news, but tried to keep their status as newlyweds a secret. It didn't quite work. While fans were anticipating the arrival of Paltrow and Martin's first child, the press sniffed out the news that the couple had gotten married in a surprise, secret ceremony two days after announcing they were expecting.\n\nJessica Alba and Cash Warren were so intent on keeping their marriage private that they did away with wedding guests altogether. The only other person present at the couple's uber-private ceremony at a Beverly Hills courthouse in May 2008 was the official who married them.\n\nAt first, Kelly Clarkson tried to trick us into believing that she and Brandon Blackstock wouldn't have a wedding, and instead would just elope. But in October 2013, she shared photos of herself and her new husband getting hitched at Blackberry Farms in Tennessee.\n\nThe world knew that Halle Berry was planning to marry French actor Olivier Martinez as of March 2012 -- when Martinez himself let the news slip -- but Berry didn't talk about it until weeks later. The couple's moves toward the altar were closely tracked, which meant that even though they didn't talk about it, we still knew they were tying the knot in a private affair in France in July 2013.\n\nFormer Destiny's Child star Kelly Rowland is just as secretive as her friend Beyonce. The singer kept her engagement to her manager, Tim Witherspoon, to herself for months before revealing the news in December 2013, and was just as private when it came to their wedding in Costa Rica that May. The couple is now expecting their first child.\n\nLike Brangelina, Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell declined to get married until their gay friends could legally wed, too. But once that was accomplished, Shepard and Bell didn't make a big deal out of their ceremony. In October 2013, they went over to the Beverly Hills County Clerk's Office and had a no-frills ceremony that Shepard later said set them back just $142.\n\nIt's hard to be inconspicuous when your husband-to-be's last name is Rocknroll, but Kate Winslet managed it anyway. After quietly getting engaged in the summer of 2012, Winslet and Ned Rocknroll had a super-private wedding in New York in early December -- and the rest of the world was none the wiser until the end of the month.\n\nIn 2011, LeAnn Rimes played a Britney Spears card and tricked the media. While friends and family thought they were attending an engagement party for Rimes and actor Eddie Cibrian that April, they were actually attending their wedding.\n\nWhen Britney Spears wants to get married, she doesn't hesitate. The singer first had a quickie wedding to childhood friend Jason Alexander in Las Vegas in January 2004. Then, after getting that 55-hour marriage annulled, she held a second surprise wedding in September 2004 to backup dancer Kevin Federline. Her secret there was the switcheroo: The ceremony was held a month prior to the date that was publicized.\n\nWhen Anne Hathaway wanted to create a low-key wedding, she made like Natalie Portman and headed for Big Sur in California. The Oscar winner didn't fully escape all eyes as she wed Adam Shulman in September 2012 -- paparazzi caught the bride in her custom Valentino dress -- but at least the walkup to her private affair wasn't publicized.\n\nThe courtship of Skyfall star Daniel Craig and actress Rachel Weisz is a little hazy. As far as the public knows, the former Dream House co-stars became romantically involved following Weisz's breakup with director Darren Aronofsky in November 2010. But before anyone could get a good sense of the newest Bond's new dating life, the couple quietly married in upstate New York in June 2011.\n\nIn 2012, we knew that Ryan Reynolds was romantically linked to Gossip Girl actress Blake Lively, but no one saw their Southern wedding coming. That August, Lively and Reynolds secretly said I do in South Carolina. Even though the wedding had Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine performing, somehow the couple managed to keep the ceremony so under wraps, we still don't know what the bride wore.\n\nLike Saldana, Kerry Washington has been extremely reluctant to talk about her husband or her baby. There were multiple reports that the Scandal actress had wed football player Nnamdi Asomugha in June 2013 in Idaho, but the actress refused to say whether it happened or not. She played it similarly close to the vest when she became very evidently pregnant toward the end of 2013.\n\nZoe Saldana appears to be the type who'd rather show than tell. The actress and her artist husband, Marco Perego, were spotted wearing gold wedding bands in September 2013, which led to confirmation that the couple had actually married earlier that summer in front of a small gathering of family and friends. And with the couple now expecting their first child, Saldana stayed quiet until she confirmed her pregnancy by getting her husband to take the ALS bucket challenge for her.\n\nCutting down on the number of attendees is one way to keep your matrimony on the DL. In 2006, Sacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher swapped vows in Paris in front of just six wedding guests.\n\nJanet Jackson just isn't one to marry and tell. The pop superstar wed Rene Elizondo, Jr. in 1991, but no one knew about it until Elizondo filed for divorce around 2000. Jackson's so good at keeping secrets that she pulled off another hush-hush wedding in 2012, when she married Wissam Al Mana in a quiet, private, and beautiful ceremony.\n\nBen Affleck and Jennifer Garner declined to officially announce their engagement in April 2005, and they were just as elusive with their secret island wedding that June.\n\nGood luck guessing what Natalie Portman is going to do next. The star isn't known for sharing much about her private life, but when she does she drops some doozies. In December 2010, the actress caught fans off guard with her out-of-the-blue engagement to French dancer Benjamin Millepied, which was announced at the same time as her first pregnancy. Portman keeps her personal life so hush-hush that onlookers thought she and Millepied had wed months before they actually tied the knot in August 2012.\n\nBeyonce and Jay Z are professionals in every sense of the word, especially when it comes to keeping their private life hidden. The couple dated for six years before secretly marrying in New York on April 4, 2008. They were so insistent on keeping it just between them that Jay Z pretended not to know what a reporter was talking about three days after tying the knot.\n\nDespite being one of the most closely watched couples in the world, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie managed to get married in complete privacy. Their French wedding on August 23 was so secretive, it took five days for the rest of the world to hear about it.\n\nThe same weekend that Harris and Burtka married, TV star Fran Drescher was quietly marrying Shiva Ayyadurai at their home. Drescher met Ayyadurai, who developed an email program when he was a teenager, just over a year ago. She shared the surprise marital update on Twitter on September 7.\n\nAfter a 10-year relationship and two kids together, David Burtka and Neil Patrick Harris finally tied the knot in Italy the weekend of September 5 without a peep of advance notice.\n\nWhen High School Musical star Ashley Tisdale married musician Christopher French on September 8, she reportedly had a plan in place to keep the ceremony private. According to E!, the couple had guests arrive at a different location before shuttling them over to the wedding's private venue.\n\nScarlett Johansson and French journalist Romain Dauriac were married for more than a month before the rest of the world caught on. According to Gossip Cop, the couple set off for Philipsburg, Montana, to tie the knot in secret on October 1.\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt and girlfriend Tasha McCauley, here in NYC in August, married in a quiet ceremony at their home on Saturday, December 20. The Don Jon star, 33, is known for keeping his private life quiet. Tasha is the CEO of Fellow Robots, a NASA-based robotics company.\n\nCameron Diaz and Benji Madden wasted no time heading down the aisle.

Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN\n\nKeeping you in the know, Culture Queue is an ongoing series of recommendations for timely books to read, films to watch and podcasts and music to listen to.\n\nRomantic love is often regarded as the most important partnership one can have. But in the mid-1990s, when pop-rock group The Rembrandts released the now-famous Friends theme song I'll Be There For You -- an ode to a support system you have even when your love prospects are DOA -- they placed friendship in its rightful top spot.\n\nIf you are more in the mood to celebrate your friends this year instead of your valentine -- as Leslie Knope of the sitcom Parks and Recreation did when she founded the fictional holiday Galentine's Day -- consider the new pop-science book Friends. In it, British anthropologist and evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar asserts that the benefits of a circle of close friends far outweigh those of any single relationship, and that maintaining one is the best thing you can do for your health.\n\nAccording to anthropologist and psychologist Robin Dunbar, having a small group of quality friendships is the best thing you can do for your health. Credit: NBC/Getty Images\n\nThe biggest predictor of your psychological health and well-being, your physical health and well-being, even your risk of dying, is the number and quality of close friendships you have, Dunbar said in a video call.\n\nWe often consider how well we eat, how much we exercise and the medicines and vitamins we take to keep us healthy. But Dunbar says while those factors are important, research has shown our social connections can be even more crucial. Bolstering his claim is a 2010 analytical review, which found that participants across 148 studies had a 50% increased likelihood of survival if they had strong social relationships.\n\nDesigned for complexity\n\nTo Dunbar, who turned his attention to human social behavior after a career as a zoologist, the human social world is by far the most complex thing in the universe.\n\nThat's because it is so unpredictable, and it's constantly turning over and changing, he said. People fall out with each other, they find better friends, they move apart, they just get bored.\n\nYet our brains are designed to navigate the intricate social networks we build, and extract benefits from them.\n\nAccording to Friends, strong social support systems are associated with a lower risk of depression and dementia and a better chance of survival, while loneliness -- which Dunbar calls an evolutionary alarm signal -- can be detrimental to our health. In one meta-analytical review cited in Friends, researchers looked at 70 studies conducted over an average of seven years that involved nearly 3.5 million people. They found those who were socially isolated, living alone, or simply felt persistently lonely had about a 30% increased chance of dying.\n\nMood-boosting bonds\n\nThere are a few theories as to why your friendships keep you healthy, according to Friends, from providing you help in crisis to giving you a fortifying mood lift. Studies show that friendships trigger the release endorphins, stress-relieving chemicals in our bodies, which then stimulate the production of the white blood cells that protect us from bacteria and viruses.\n\nA scene from Parks and Recreation: Galentine's Day Credit: Colleen Hayes/NBC/Getty Images\n\nBut the depth of those friendship also matters more than their quantity. Having loads of acquaintances won't give you the same benefits that a few close bonds will. In a 2020 survey of nearly 40,000 subjects aged 50 or older in 13 European countries, researchers, including Dunbar, found that having just a few close friends was associated with a lower risk of depression and better quality of life. Having many social connections did not appear to be beneficial, and could actually be detrimental.\n\nIf you have more than about five (close friends) you're spreading yourself too thinly among all these extra friends, Dunbar said. And so none of them quite have the same sense of bonding.\n\nThough our ability to see our friends has become more limited due to the coronavirus pandemic, Dunbar said there's no need to panic. Virtual activities may not be a perfect replacement, but we can still derive some of the benefits of social bonding from afar, and keeping up with friends by phone or video call will help nurture our relationships until we can spend quality time in person again.\n\nSo keep that weekly Zoom game night going or start up a new one to give your endorphins a boost.\n\nAdd to queue: BFFS 4EVER\n\nLeslie Knope's overzealous gift-giving (including 5,000-word essays to each of her friends on why they are awesome) is on full display in the now-classic episode that made February 13 an unofficial holiday to celebrate your girlfriends.\n\nIn 2014, long-distance best friends Aminatou Sow and Ann Friedman began Call Your Girlfriend , a podcast in which they ring each other to chat about politics and pop culture. Last year, they released a book about what it takes to ensure your friendships go the distance.\n\nGeena Davis and Susan Sarandon changed the buddy road trip trope forever when they played best-friends-turned-wanted-criminals on a weekend trip gone wrong.\n\nFour childhood best friends, played by Morris Chestnut, D.L. Hughley, Bill Bellamy and Shemar Moore, navigate love and family life as the prospect of marriage begins to shake their bond.\n\nMaya Erskine and Anna Konkle relive their painfully awkward middle school years in this comedy series -- only they're adult actors and their classmates are all kids.\n\nDespite being off the air for nearly two decades, Friends continues to be one of the most popular shows to stream, making The Rembrandts title track a permanent fixture in any playlist about friendship.
In Britain, being a genius can save you a bundle on a divorce. But you'll have to convince a judge you fit the bill.\n\nA former star investor who made hundreds of millions for Lone Star Funds in Japan failed to qualify this week.\n\nWilliam Randall Randy Work was unable to persuade a divorce court on Tuesday that his genius in business meant he should be entitled to a larger share of his $225 million family fortune than the 50% typically awarded.\n\nWork was appealing a lower court decision from 2015 that found he had not made a special contribution to his marriage. That's the legal test used to determine whether he should receive a larger share of the couple's assets.\n\nWhat constitutes a special contribution? The lower court defined the term as earnings that were the result of an exceptional and individual quality.\n\nPut another way: The law requires you to prove you're a genius in business or another field.\n\nThe word 'genius' tends to be overused and is properly reserved for Leonardo Da Vinci, Mozart, Einstein, and others like them, Judge Edward Holman mused in his 2015 judgment.\n\nIn Work's case, the bar was just too high.\n\nHe was very good at his job. He worked very hard indeed. But he did not create Lone Star, Holman wrote. His role in the Japanese sector of the business was very important, but it was not unique.\n\nThe U.K. High Court upheld that view Tuesday.\n\nRelated: Elon Musk and Talulah Riley to divorce - again\n\nOne prominent business figure at least has qualified as a genius in recent years.\n\nMartin Sorrell, the founder of advertising giant WPP (WPPGF), was awarded 60% of the assets in his 2005 divorce case, while his ex-wife received 40%.\n\nThe overwhelming preponderance of the fortune is derived from the shares in WPP, the court said. His genius was the generator of that fortune.\n\nBut is genius an easy thing to define?\n\nI personally find that a difficult, and perhaps unhelpful, word in this context, Holman wrote in 2015. After all, he said, how would any person with a modicum of modesty answer when asked if they are a genius?

Written by Nick Glass, CNN\n\nThey were discovered in shoeboxes and old folders tucked away in a bedroom cupboard in Greece after her death: an extraordinary forgotten archive of more than 5,000 photographs. Joan Leigh Fermor sometimes referred to her own work as snaps, but she was a far better photographer than she knew.\n\nShe is usually only remembered as the muse of a famous writer, her husband, Patrick Leigh Fermor. But the discovery and conservation of her archive is very likely to change all that.\n\nJoan Leigh Fermor on horseback. Credit: Courtesy Joan Leigh Fermor/Haus Publishing\n\nFifteen years after her death, she is the subject of a new book and an accompanying exhibition at the Benaki Museum in Athens, both the book and exhibition are entitled The Photographs of Joan Leigh Fermor: Artist and Lover. Shot in black and white on a high-end Rolleiflex camera, the photographs are carefully composed and simply beautiful. In a pre-digital age, she clearly didn't waste a frame.\n\nThe largely unseen archive is a postwar record of travels across Europe, of marriage, friendships and an abiding love of her adopted homeland, Greece, and its peoples. We have the Aegean, the Greek landscape and its ancient sites before mass tourism, Delphi and Epidaurus empty of visitors. We have visiting friends: Margot Fonteyn and Freddy Ashton limber up with morning barre exercises using the handrail on a yacht; Fonteyn, asleep, stretched out in the sun, is utterly natural in her nakedness.\n\nSuitcase of old photos shows unseen side of London\n\nAnd of course, there is Joan's spirited husband, Paddy, the great Anglo Irishman who could happily sing and recite in Greek and multiple other languages. At one moment, he's dancing down stone steps, at another, contemplating the Aegean, heroically and athletically bronzed in shorts. Often, there is cigarette between his fingers. We have Greek villagers, wrestlers, musicians, potters and fishermen; a cobbler outside his shop, a traveling entertainer with his dancing bear, the skeleton of a wooden fishing boat under construction.\n\nA boy poses on a tower in Greece. Credit: Courtesy Joan Leigh Fermor/Haus Publishing\n\nOlivia Stewart, coauthor of the new book, detects an extraordinary stillness in the pictures. An old family friend and regular visitor to the Leigh Fervor home -- a wonderful stone house the couple built by the sea in Mani in Greece -- it was Stewart who first who discovered the photographs in Joan's bedroom cupboard in 2003. Quickly realizing their importance, she packed them into an old Globe-Trotter suitcase and took them back to England. They've since been donated to the National Library of Scotland and have been properly conserved.\n\nWith the book and exhibition, Stewart said, I wanted Joan to have the recognition as the artist she was.\n\nJoan Leigh Fermor captures her husband, Patrick, a famed writer. Credit: Courtesy Joan Leigh Fermor/Haus Publishing\n\nOn her passport and marriage certificate, Joan Leigh Fermor wrote photographer as her profession. She was active between the 1940s and 1960s taking photos for her husband's books and receiving commissions from magazines like Horizon and the Architectural Review. But at some point, in her late 40s, she simply stopped taking pictures. We don't know why, but, if Joan had a true vocation, it was probably looking after Paddy. By her own choice, he came first.\n\nBut all these years later, Joan Leigh Fermor is finally and quietly stepping out of her husband's shadow and perhaps for the first time. Were she alive, she would likely be doing so reluctantly. She was naturally reticent about herself and her talent. Stewart thinks Joan would be very pleased by the beauty of the photos and horrified by the attention.\n\nFamed ballet dancers Margot Fonteyn and Frederick Ashton show off their technique while at sea.

She died aged 91 in 2003; he followed her in 2011, aged 96. They are buried side by side at Dumbleton Hall, her family seat in Worcestershire.\n\nPaddy Leigh Fermor was an intrepid traveler, heroic soldier and, above all, a revered travel writer. Joan was muse not only to Paddy, but to many others including Giacometti, Balthus and novelist Lawrence Durrell. (Her blonde hair, cut short, led Durrell to refer to her as the Corn Goddess.) In their separate ways, Paddy and Joan both cast a spell.\n\nA view of a church overlooking the sea.

He was 95.\n\nThe veteran died early Sunday in Newport, Rhode Island, just two days before his 96th birthday, daughter Sharon Molleur told CNN. He will be buried at St. Columba Cemetery in his hometown of Middletown, Rhode Island, she said.\n\nWhen I look at that photograph, I just think of my dad's service, and how happy he was that it was all over, Molleur said.\n\nPHOTO: Victor Jorgensen/U.S. Navy/AP On August 14, 1945, a sailor kisses an unsuspecting woman in New York's Times Square.\n\nThough Mendonsa never persuaded Life magazine, which first published Alfred Eisenstaedt's photo, that he was the man in the picture, several sources over the years – including the authors of The Kissing Sailor: The Mystery Behind the Photo that Ended World War II – have concluded the smooching seaman is Mendonsa. The authors cited facial recognition technology and high-tech forensic reconstructions.\n\nIn a 2015 interview, Mendonsa told CNN that he never failed to convince anyone of the fact.\n\nAnd when I get through showing you the photos … if you don't admit that, I'd say you're a phony bastard, he told a reporter who visited his Middletown home.\n\n'We're all drinking and raising hell'\n\nThe picture, which has sparked numerous homages as well as admonitions from those who say it represents an unwanted sexual advance, was truly a product of its time.\n\nIt was taken August 14, 1945, shortly after news of Japan's surrender – aka Victory Over Japan Day or V-J Day – spread through New York's streets, a prelude to World War II's imminent end. Even the caption Life placed under the photo, known alternatively as V-J Day in Times Square, speaks to the sexism tolerated in newsrooms during the era.\n\nPHOTO: Mario Tama/Getty Images Carl Muscarello and Edith Shain, who also claimed to be in the photo, re-created their moment in 2005.\n\nIn the middle of New York's Times Square a white-clad girl clutches her purse and skirt as an uninhibited sailor plants his lips squarely on hers, the caption says, describing the 21-year-old woman who, decades later, would be identified as Greta Friedman.\n\nMendonsa was on leave after a stint in the Pacific, he told CNN in 2015, and was on a first date with Rita Petry, who was related to his younger sister's new husband.\n\nWhile taking in a matinee, a crowd outside Radio City Music Hall began pounding on the theater doors, shouting, The war is over! – a cry that resonated through the building.\n\nMendonsa and Petry walked outside to find thousands of revelers in the streets. They stopped at a bar.\n\nThe booze was flying, and I popped quite a few, he recalled. We're all drinking and raising hell.\n\nAfter leaving the bar, they found themselves in Times Square.\n\nSo we get into Times Square and the war ends and I see the nurse, he remembers.

It didn't matter to me.\n\n'It wasn't that much of a kiss'\n\nMendonsa, 22 at the time, said he was overwhelmed with emotion upon hearing news of Japan's surrender – For Chrissake, the war is over! he remembered thinking – and he grabbed Friedman, who he mistook for a nurse, because he'd seen the nurses in action during the war and was appreciative of their work to save and heal his fellow troops.\n\nIt's a sentiment his daughter recalls hearing from her father.\n\nThey ran out of the theater and began celebrating.

It wasn't that much of a kiss. It was more of a jubilant act that he didn't have to go back.\n\nThe sailor was very strong, she told the Veterans History Project. The smooch wasn't romantic, she said. It was more that the war was over, she said, and people were so thankful.\n\nHe was just holding me tight. I'm not sure about the kiss, she said.

(CNN) Eunice was just 9 years old when she was married off to a man older than her father.\n\nThe young girl from northern Kenya lived with the man for two weeks, she said, enduring abuse before she ran away with the help of another of his wives.\n\nShe told me the next morning: 'You will pretend that you are going to look after the cattle, then I will show you the road to escape.' \n\nThe road led Eunice to the Samburu Girls Foundation , a nonprofit that has rescued more than 1,000 Kenyan girls from forced marriages and harmful cultural practices such as female genital mutilation.\n\nNow 15, Eunice is helping other young girls who have similar stories. She was recently a student mentor for the Tehani Photo Workshop, which put cameras into the hands of 18 Kenyan girls who escaped child marriage.\n\nWe were really kind of helping them reclaim their narrative and understand that this is not something about just their community or that there's something wrong with them -- this is happening to girls around the world, said Stephanie Sinclair, an award-winning photographer who founded the nonprofit Too Young to Wed and has been working on the issue for about 15 years now.\n\nStudents participate in the community exhibition at the end of the Tehani Photo Workshop in Kenya. (Nichole Sobecki/Too Young to Wed)\n\nEvery year, 15 million girls around the world are married before the age of 18 -- that's about one every two seconds, according to Girls Not Brides , a global partnership of more than 800 organizations committed to ending child marriage.\n\nAlthough the problem is largest in sub-Saharan Africa, where four in 10 girls are married before the age of 18, it is found in nearly every region of the world, across many different cultures and religions.\n\nIt's not, however, an issue that is always in the spotlight. It's not a problem that is always easy for many people to see. Sinclair and her group are hoping to help change that, in part, through the photo workshops she started.\n\nThese workshops can be therapeutic for the girls, who form friendships and learn they are not alone. But they can also be empowering and a source of real change.\n\nYou can tell your story so you can protect other people from kind of having to go through the same thing, Sinclair said.\n\nStudent mentor Eunice, 15, photographs Mary, 16, during the workshop. (Stephanie Sinclair/Too Young to Wed)\n\nSinclair recalled watching these young Kenyan girls speak out at the end of the workshop, when they held a photo exhibition in front of more than 100 members of their community, including members of the government.\n\nThey kind of admonished them for not protecting their rights and not protecting the girls in their community, Sinclair said.\n\nIn 2014, Kenya's Parliament set the minimum age of marriage to 18. But as in many countries, there is still work to be done.\n\nIn some countries it's legal, and in some countries it's not, Sinclair said. In most countries it is illegal in some way, but it's a cultural tradition.\n\nThe community awareness is still not where it needs to be. And they don't really understand that there are alternatives. They don't understand that the girls' value is more than just their bodies. It's more than their ability to work in the farms or take care of the cattle or cook. If they're educated, they can bring so much more. They can be doctors, they can be psychologists, they can be engineers, they can be teachers, they can do all kinds of things that they can bring back to their community and then also bring them out of a level of poverty where the most extreme forms of child marriage are definitely happening -- in underdeveloped areas. The poverty is cyclical there.\n\nToo Young to Wed founder Stephanie Sinclair greets one of the girls' mothers at the end of the photo workshop in Kenya. (Nichole Sobecki/Too Young to Wed)\n\nIt was in 2003 when Sinclair became fully aware of the problem of child marriage. She was in Herat, Afghanistan, doing a project about girls who were committing suicide by setting themselves on fire.\n\nMany of the girls were married very young, and by that I mean prepubescent, between the ages of 9 and 13, she said. They were trying to escape their lives and a lifetime of abuse.\n\nSinclair did more research into the issue and noticed that there weren't many photographs about it. Since then, she has taken the problem head-on, eventually starting her nonprofit.\n\nWe began Too Young to Wed to give back directly to girls, she said. And we do that through scholarships for many of the girls in my photographs. We do it through the photography workshops.\n\nSinclair hopes to do her next workshops in Nigeria, with girls who were abducted by Boko Haram, and in India, with girls who were burned with acid because they rejected proposals.\n\nI found my independence and empowerment through photography. ... I'm also a big believer in journalism and the power of journalism and of sharing one's story, she said.\n\nThe following photos were all taken by Kenyan girls in the Tehani Photo Workshop, which was sponsored by Canon:\n\nAnita, 15, took this photo of Rosilla, also 15, during the workshop. When I was 10, my father married me off, Anita said. When the morning came, I was circumcised. ... I would like to say to the parents they should educate all the children. They should not discriminate between a boy and girl, because boys and girls are equal.

Tastries Bakery owner Cathy Miller did not want to make a cake for a same-sex couple's wedding.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nArtistic expression usually isn't a big part of discrimination cases, but it proved central to a judge's thinking in a case out of California.\n\nKern County Superior Court Judge David R. Lampe ruled this week against the State of California, which took legal action against a Bakersfield baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.\n\nTastries Bakery owner Cathy Miller told Eileen and Mireya Rodriguez-Del Rio in August that she couldn't create a cake for their wedding because same-sex marriage clashed with her Christian faith. She instead referred them to another bakery, according to Lampe's ruling.\n\nMireya Rodriguez-Del Rio filed a complaint with California's Department of Fair Housing, which in turn sought an injunction against Miller that would force her to stop what it considered a discriminatory practice.\n\nBut Lampe ruled for Miller, saying her actions were protected by the First Amendment, because making a cake can be considered an act of artistic expression.\n\nThe right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment outweighs the state's interest in ensuring a freely accessible marketplace, Lampe wrote in his ruling. A wedding cake is not just a cake in free speech analysis. It is an artistic expression by the person making it that is to be used traditionally as a centerpiece in the celebration of a marriage. There could not be a greater form of expressive conduct.\n\nThe couple's lawyer said Lampe's ruling won't be the end of the matter.\n\nBakersfield and Kern County in general is very conservative and that unfortunately includes some of the judges, attorney Patricia Ziegler Lopez said in a statement to CNN affiliate KBAK. But it's not over. Our fight against bigotry and discrimination is only beginning.\n\nMiller told KBAK that she felt God had won in court and she's glad society is trying to balance tolerance with free speech.\n\nThe community and the government is starting to see that we have an issue that needs to be resolved, Miller said. And I think that's really good.\n\nThe US Supreme Court took up a similar case in December, involving a Colorado baker who refused to make a cake to celebrate a same-sex couple's marriage because he believes that God designed marriage to be between a man and a woman.

Written by Hannah Lack, CNN\n\nDelving into the archives of pop culture history, Remember When? is a series offering a nostalgic look at the celebrity outfits that defined their eras.\n\nOne Manhattan night in 1954, an ivory-white cocktail dress made cinematic history when it collided with an upward breeze. That unforgettable moment, from the whimsical comedy The Seven Year Itch, had everything to do with the person wearing the dress.\n\nIn Billy Wilder's film, Marilyn Monroe stars as a guileless model who keeps her underwear in the fridge and dunks potato chips in her Champagne. A summer of flirtation with her downstairs neighbor leads to the climactic scene when, after the pair catch a movie on 52nd Street, Monroe pauses over a subway grate to savor a cool blast of air from a passing train -- Isn't it delicious? she says in her jingling Betty Boop voice, as her dress takes flight.\n\nWilliam Travilla, a leading costume designer for 20th Century Fox, didn't think much of the garment that became his most famous creation -- he called it that silly little dress. Travilla worked on eight of Monroe's films, including How to Marry a Millionaire and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. The actress adored his clingy, figure-hugging designs: Billy Dear, please dress me forever. I love you, she once wrote to him. Travilla crafted her Seven Year Itch dress from rayon-acetate crepe, a fabric heavy enough to swing as Monroe walked, but light enough to catch that all-important breeze. Bias-cut with a halter neck and sunburst pleats, a slim belt winds its way around the waist into a neat bow: ...cool and clean, in a dirty, dirty city, as Travilla described it.\n\nActress Marilyn Monroe and actor Tom Ewell on the set of The Seven Year Itch. Credit: Sunset Boulevard/Corbis/Getty Images\n\n14 takes\n\nIn the early hours of September 15th, 1954, Monroe stood under Klieg lights on Lexington Avenue, while a member of the crew crouched in the grill beneath her heels operating a wind-machine. A few feet away behind a police barricade, thousands of fans and press photographers jostled to catch a glimpse of the star. (The Russians could have invaded Manhattan and nobody would have taken any notice, her publicist Roy Craft later recalled.)\n\nThe throng wasn't quite as spontaneous as it seemed -- Fox had spread word of the impending event, counting on some free publicity. Wilder shot 14 takes (the scene was later re-shot at a studio lot in California), while the mostly male crowd shouted higher each time a blast of wind lifted Monroe's skirt. (She had come prepared for the gawkers in two pairs of white underwear.)\n\nIf onlookers were delighted, Monroe's then-husband, New York Yankees center fielder Joe DiMaggio, was less thrilled. In his book, Wilder described the look of death on DiMaggio's face as he stormed off set to stew in the nearby St. Regis Hotel. Several biographers have chronicled the stormy argument that ensued in Suite 1105 when Monroe returned. It was one of many straws that allegedly ended a tumultuous marriage; back in Los Angeles three weeks later, she announced their divorce.

This year, sculptor Seward Johnson 's kitsch, stainless steel rendering of her will be permanently installed in Palm Springs, offering photo opportunities for tourists to stand beneath the 26-foot-tall Marilyn's skirt. A similar towering sculpture was found ditched face down in a garbage dump in Guigang, China, while an image of her was even grown in a Japanese rice field\n\nSpectators gather around Seward Johnson's 26-foot-tall sculpture of Marilyn Monroe.

In 2011 Reynolds sold her collection of Hollywood memorabilia to avoid bankruptcy and the pleated dress, by now one of the most recognizable costumes in film history, fetched $4.6 million at auction\n\nIts success wasn't entirely due to the dress's revealing attributes -- Travilla's design embodied the same alchemical mix of innocence and seduction that Monroe was so masterful at projecting onto celluloid. Both angelically white and daringly audacious, it reflected the actress's own beguiling contradictions.\n\nMarilyn Monroe, photographed wearing her famous white dress for The Seven Year Itch. Credit: Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nIn Norman Mailer's biography of the star, he wrote of Monroe's The Seven Year Itch performance: It is an unbelievable performance for an actress who is on the edge of separating from her husband, has two atrocious films behind her, is in psychoanalysis, drinking too much, and all the while thinking of breaking her contract....\n\nMonroe betrayed none of that private turmoil onscreen, instead capturing the spirit of booming, 1950s American exuberance with a carefree effervescence that cemented iconic status both for herself and that silly little dress.
Beyoncé graced the cover of the coveted September issue of Vogue in August 2018.

The singer accepted the award on August 24 from her husband, Jay Z, and daughter, Blue Ivy.\n\nAfter Jay Z's infamous scuffle with Beyonce's sister, the power couple faced numerous rumors that their relationship was on the rocks. But when they started their joint On the Run summer tour in Miami on June 25, they held a united front, playing their never-before-seen wedding video and showing footage of daughter Blue.\n\nJay Z and his sister-in-law Solange Knowles, right, reportedly had an altercation at a Met Gala after-party at New York's Standard Hotel in May 2014. Security camera footage that appeared on TMZ doesn't tell the whole story, but there are plenty of pictures of the rapper, Beyonce, and her sister leaving the party.\n\nTime magazine has praised Beyonce as an industry tastemaker. In April 2014, the magazine called Bey one of the 100 most influential people in the world.\n\nIn December 2013, Beyonce stunned fans by releasing a surprise visual album. The project was well-received and shot to No. 1, spawning platinum hits like the single Drunk In Love.\n\nIn May 2013, Beyonce was the subject of pregnancy rumors as observers noted that her dress to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala conveniently covered her midsection. The speculation grew stronger after she had to cancel a concert due to exhaustion and dehydration. She denied that she was pregnant.\n\nIn early April 2013, the singer and her husband were once again the subject of critical headlines when they took a trip to Cuba to celebrate their fifth anniversary.\n\nKelly Rowland, Beyonce and Michelle Williams reunited as Destiny's Child to perform during the Super Bowl XLVII Halftime Show on February 3, 2013, in New Orleans.\n\nAfter the inauguration dust-up, Beyonce had something to prove when she held a news conference for her Pepsi Super Bowl XLVII Halftime Show on January 31, 2013.

A hand-written note accompanying the photos reads, We welcome you to share our joy.\n\nIn 2011, Beyonce stole the show at the MTV Video Music Awards when she walked the red carpet and, with the careful placement of her hands, revealed that she was expecting. The star and husband Jay welcomed Blue Ivy in January 2012.\n\nAfter releasing another best-seller with 2006's B'Day and starring in Dreamgirls that same year, Beyonce was readying to release a third solo album, I Am ... Sasha Fierce when she took the stage at the 50th Grammy Awards Show on February 10, 2008.

She is the founder of TheLi.st, a network and media platform for women. The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nBeyoncé sure knows how to get our attention.\n\nShe's done it again and again with her culture-stopping music, videos and and performances.\n\nAll The Single Ladies, which launched countless YouTube videos of toddlers dancing and one infamous Kanye West tirade. Or, how about when she asked Who run the world? (The answer: girls - a theme she would return to again and again). Striding out at the 2014 VMAs flanked by the giant word FEMINIST.\n\nRachel Sklar\n\nOther significant moments: Her 2013 self-titled visual album, stealth-dropped in late December and instantly required listening and viewing. Also, the revelation that was Formation. And her 2016 Superbowl performance (very popular with conservatives). Lemonade, the album that launched a thousand thinkpieces about her politics and identity (sample headline: Beyonce's 'Lemonade' Is an Anthem for the Retribution of Black Women.)\n\nThen, earlier this week, she added her announcement via Instagram - bedecked in flowers, a veil and her glorious fecundity - that she is pregnant with twins.\n\nPredictably, the Internet went bananas. Her post zoomed to most-liked-ever status inside a day. Twitter was beside itself with bee emojis and YASSS QUEEEN updates. The joy was palpable.\n\nJoy – and relief. Because, man did we ever need some good news.\n\nIt has been a rough few weeks in the news cycle (for people who care about democracy and due process and the welfare of their fellow humans).\n\nA breathless pace of executive orders attacking the environment, women, refugees, lawful visa-holders and US parks employees has led to record-breaking protests, an unrelenting call-your-Senator schedule and Jon Stewart channelling just how exhausted we all are. So we really, really needed something to feel good about.\n\nBeyoncé delivered that to us with her announcement, which was styled with the kind of bravado, exuberance and confidence that even a dude who lives in a solid-gold tower could never get away with. And she doubled down on it with a collection of photographs so resplendently gorgeous and near-otherworldly (I mean, just look at this one and this one, and this one) that it actually succeeded in not just distracting us from the dark craziness swirling around the country, but transporting us completely, if momentarily, into another (happier) world.\n\nThis is classic Beyoncé. Beyoncé, who flagrantly loves her body and demands that you respect it, now reminds us that it's a body that can march like a boss in heels but also swell with life and hope, sexy and powerful in all its forms. (And she does it while sitting on a throne of flowers, lest you forget she is the Queen.)\n\nIt is possible, of course, for Beyoncé's pregnancy to exist without reference to Donald Trump. He doesn't get to be part of every story, even as he barges into our every waking moment with new acts of cruelty or rule-flouting or self-aggrandizement or jaw-dropping ignorance. Even so, it's hard not to see a juxtaposition here. Trump's administration has focused on restricting, undoing, and upending. But Beyoncé is creating.\n\nThat was the theme of her photo collection. Called I Have Three Hearts, it was paired with a poem of the same name by the Somalian poet Warsan Shire, who also wrote the poetry in Lemonade – and who, I guess, would not be allowed to enter the United States.\n\nIt reads: There's life growing inside of me and I'm beside myself with dreams. In a real and visceral way, Beyoncé has reminded us that even in times that feel broken, we are vessels of power and glory and hope.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIs what I am saying over the top here? Maybe, but I found those images coupled with that poem to be profoundly moving as a mother and a feminist and, well, a human. I will leave the smart thinkpieces about the poem to other writers, (I'm looking at you, Melissa Harris-Perry) but one line in particular stands out to me: Flowers grow wherever.\n\nFlowers grow wherever. When the books are written about this period in time, I believe that will be an enduring theme – the hope that sprang up out of the chaos, and the real and visceral good that it created. Beyoncé just named it. Creators gonna create.

A Trump-supporting Republican confronts his party on same-sex marriage\n\nBRENTWOOD, New Hampshire – Jim Morgan is a Republican who runs a semiconductor company, serves on his town council and supports President Donald Trump's reelection. He's also gay.\n\nAnd this year, he's on a crusade: trying to persuade his fellow New Hampshire Republicans to remove the language in the state's party platform that defines marriage as solely between a man and a woman.\n\nOn a frigid Saturday morning in January, this mission takes Morgan and his husband, Paul Michael Freitas, to the auditorium of a nursing home here in Brentwood, where the Rockingham County Young Republicans are gathering to discuss the platform ahead of the state's GOP convention in May.\n\nI'm up here because my kids don't understand why I'm a Republican, Morgan, 53, says of his two adult children as nearly two dozen activists listen to his pitch. What I'm asking you to consider is that the marriage definition is an insult to my marriage, plain and simple.\n\nWe Count: Untold Voters Stories As America prepares to make its choice in the 2020 elections, CNN ventured into the lives of voters around the country who are often overlooked in the traditional narratives about politics. In this installment, we visit the early voting state of New Hampshire, where a gay Republican is challenging his party on its same-sex marriage stance. Read part 1: 'Being black isn't enough'\n\nLet's prove we are the big-tent party.\n\nAs a gay Republican, Morgan defies the national pattern. CNN's exit polls in the 2018 midterm elections, for instance, show 63% of LGBT voters identified as Democrats and 27% as independent or something else. Just 10% of those surveyed said they were Republicans.\n\nAnd while support for same-sex marriage has grown, fewer than half (44%) of Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters support it, a 2019 survey by the Pew Research Center found. By contrast, three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic leaners back same-sex marriage.\n\nFreitas, a 30-year-old photographer and digital marketer, says that sometimes can make the Republican Party a lonely place for him, even though he's a registered Republican, married to someone active in GOP politics and shares common cause with the party on issues such as gun rights and allowing conservatives more of a voice on college campuses.\n\nI feel politically homeless at times, he says.\n\nMorgan's 24-year-old daughter, Zoe, a political independent who lives in Raleigh, North Carolina and works for a video game company, is befuddled by her father's GOP activism. When I go home to visit them, I'm visiting my Dads, she says. So to have someone be part of a party that doesn't accept or recognize their marriage is difficult to understand.\n\nWhen it's legal all across the country, why are we still arguing about it?\n\nModerate Republican and Trump supporter\n\nMorgan sits in his spacious office in Londonderry, about an hour north of Boston, surrounded by photos and memorabilia celebrating the New England Patriots, team quarterback Tom Brady and legendary Boston Red Sox slugger David Ortiz.\n\nLeaning back on his couch, he says he first became interested in Republican politics as a high school student in neighboring Massachusetts, watching Ronald Reagan's ascent to the White House.\n\nI'm a Reagan moderate Republican, he says. I believe in smaller government, less taxes, less regulation and a strong national defense.\n\nMorgan, who is in his second term on the Derry Town Council, also supports Trump. He shares many of the President's views on the economy, trade and immigration.\n\nAnd, he notes, I was raised to support the president, no matter who that president is.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump cast himself as a champion of gay rights. In his speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination that year, for instance, he denounced the mass shooting that had killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando the previous month. The killer, Omar Mateen, was an American who claimed allegiance to the Islamic State.\n\nAs your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology, Trump said, becoming the first GOP standard-bearer to elevate gay rights in a nomination address.\n\nBut critics say Trump's administration has sided with the evangelical Christians who helped secure his victory, as it has moved to dismantle policies that benefit the LGBTQ community.\n\nDuring his three years in office, those actions have included moving to restrict transgender recruits from joining the military and to rescind protections for transgender students that allowed them to use bathrooms that corresponded with their gender identities along with rolling back an Obama-era rule intended to protect transgender people from discrimination in health care.\n\nThe Trump-Pence White House is the most anti-LGBTQ White House in modern history, says Charlotte Clymer of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay-rights organization.\n\nThey have spent the last three years attacking LGBTQ people on a daily basis.\n\nMorgan says he agrees with some of Trump's controversial positions, such as the Pentagon's transgender policy. It requires troops to adhere to their genders assigned at birth while in the service and bars from joining those who require treatment for gender dysphoria, a condition in which there is a conflict between someone's assigned gender and the gender with which they identify.\n\nI know several transgender people who went through transition, Morgan says. It's a very difficult process. It's very involved, and I'm not convinced that people should sign up to go into the military and then have the government pay for those services.\n\nThe New Hampshire chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans, which Morgan chairs, has endorsed Trump's reelection – as has the national Log Cabin Republicans, which bills itself as the nation's largest group representing LGBTQ Republicans and their allies. The national group had declined to endorse Trump in 2016.\n\nIn defending the President, Trump's supporters point to his pledge to end the spread of HIV/AIDS in a decade and his appointment of a gay man, Richard Grenell, to serve as US ambassador to Germany. Grenell also is overseeing the administration's global effort to decriminalize homosexuality in nearly 70 countries.\n\nNational fight\n\nThis cycle's endorsement by the national Log Cabin group exposed a sharp divide among LGBTQ Republicans and their allies.\n\nJennifer Horn resigned her seat on the national board over the endorsement. In a letter to the Log Cabin leaders at the time, Horn, a former New Hampshire Republican Party chairwoman, said Trump's regular verbal assaults against women, immigrants, elected members of Congress and others subvert the founding principles of our great nation.\n\nIn a telephone interview with CNN last month, Horn said she joined the Log Cabin Republican board as a straight ally because she wanted to add her voice to the civil rights movement of our day.\n\nI don't understand how any organization that says that's what their founding purpose is can turn around and endorse Donald Trump, said Horn, who now serves as an adviser to an anti-Trump super PAC called The Lincoln Project.\n\nThe Log Cabin Republicans have gone down the same path that every other organized Republican committee or organization has gone down, Horn added. They have decided they would rather have access to perceived power than stand on principle.\n\nCharles Moran, the managing director of the national Log Cabin group, said the 2020 endorsement has helped give the group a voice inside the Trump administration and allowed it to work more closely with the President's campaign and the Republican National Committee.\n\nWe've been brought in on the policy level. We are being brought in at the political level, says Moran, who served as an LGBTQ surrogate for Trump's 2016 campaign. Our seat at the table has reappeared. As an example, Moran cited his attendance, along with Log Cabin Chairman Bob Kabel, at a special meeting of the US Mission to the United Nations last December.\n\nAt the gathering, Grenell and US Ambassador to the UN Kelly Craft publicly criticized countries that criminalize same-sex relationships.\n\nFor his part, Morgan says Horn long has harbored a personal hatred for Donald Trump.\n\nLet's face it, the President has made comments in the past that have been derogatory towards women. I can imagine that as a woman that would probably make me very concerned about the person that's leading the country.\n\nI just don't put feelings into those things. I look at policy, he says. I look at what we've done on immigration. What we've done on trade. I'm in a business that sells internationally. NAFTA was terrible, horrible. Trump has fixed that.\n\nPersonal and political journey\n\nMorgan's entrepreneurship is central to his life story. And as he travels the state, he reels off his resume before Republican groups in presentations that feel like early versions of stump speeches.\n\nHe started his first business as a teenager, skipping college to run a bakery before joining the semiconductor firm where his dad worked as an engineer. By the time he was 20, he had persuaded his father to join him in their own startup.\n\nHe married in his 20s and had two children.\n\nBut, in an interview, Morgan grows more personal. He says he reached a turning point in 2005, the year his brother Henry died of cancer caused by HIV complications. Before he died, Henry looked at me and he said, 'Live your life for you. Don't live your life for somebody else.' \n\nTwo years later, he had sold his first semiconductor business and had begun unraveling his marriage of 17 years. I took a step back and realized … that I love my wife, but I'm not in love with my wife and I can't do this.\n\nIn 2007, he met Freitas. They married in 2011 and maintain close ties with Morgan's ex-wife and children.\n\nWe met the same way all gay people in New Hampshire meet: online, Freitas says.\n\nWe both swiped right! Morgan adds, grinning.\n\nMorgan first dabbled in politics in 2000, joining a coalition that successfully advocated for the creation of a high school in Bedford, New Hampshire, and ended the long tradition of sending students to the nearby city of Manchester.\n\nBut he has become more deeply engaged in politics in recent years. In 2016, he won his seat on the town council in Derry, where he now lives. He served a stint as finance chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party in 2018, before taking the helm of the state's Log Cabin chapter last year.\n\nMaybe someday, he says when asked whether he has his sights on higher office. He thinks running for Congress or governor would be viable political options in the future.\n\nMorgan says he's been called a traitor and despicable for his Republican activism. People feel like that if you are gay, you have to be a Democrat. 'You can't vote for a Republican. They'll take your rights away,' he says.\n\nMy answer to that is we need people on both sides of the aisle.\n\nEvolution on same-sex marriage\n\nIn 2009, state lawmakers voted to make New Hampshire the sixth state to legalize gay marriage – six years before it would become the law of the land with the Supreme Court's ruling that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples under the 14th Amendment.\n\nIn 2018, the state barred licensed therapists and mental health counselors from practicing so-called gay conversion therapy for minors, one of just 14 states to do so, according to the National Center for Lesbian Rights.\n\nThat same year, state voters elected Democrat Chris Pappas, New Hampshire's first member of Congress who publicly identifies as gay. (This year, another gay man -- Matt Mayberry, Morgan's vice chairman in the New Hampshire Log Cabin group -- is one of the candidates seeking the GOP nomination for Pappas' seat.)\n\nAsked about the most prominent gay politician of the 2020 cycle, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Morgan says the Democrat does a good job of not making his sexual orientation the top issue in his campaign for his party's presidential nomination.\n\nMorgan says it's not a significant part of my being either.\n\nIt's just who I am.\n\nMy beliefs in capitalism, my beliefs in democracy, my beliefs in the government staying out of people's lives is much more prevalent than who I sleep with, he says. He thinks many in New Hampshire agree.\n\nBut the issue of same-sex marriage has divided some of the state's Republicans.\n\nAn earlier attempt, led by Horn, to drop the marriage definition from the party's platform and substitute the word nurturing for traditional marriage was quickly tabled in a closed-door meeting of the state's GOP delegates.\n\nMorgan is lobbying his fellow Republicans with a new approach: He doesn't want to define marriage at all.\n\nChanging that marriage definition to read anything other than what it says is an insult to religious conservatives, he tells the Young Republicans group. What do people do when they both realize that no matter what you do, you can't change it to make everybody happy? You just drop it.\n\nMost in the audience seem to agree.\n\nMy question is: Why is the government involved with your personal choice? asks Jeffrey Oligny, a former member of the New Hampshire House from Rockingham.\n\nMorgan also has made inroads with some of the New Hampshire GOP's critics of gay marriage.\n\nState Rep. Al Baldasaro, an outspoken Trump supporter who helped scuttle the previous effort to change the marriage language, tells CNN he's promised Morgan he will not move to table the issue this time around and will support an up-or-down vote on the plank when the party convenes in May.\n\nI'm a Catholic. I stand by family values, but the debate is over, he says. The Supreme Court has said it's constitutional. So, let's move forward.\n\nMoran, of the Log Cabin national group, said the organization has not tracked how many state GOP platforms still include the one-man, one-woman marriage definition.\n\nIt does, however, remain in the national GOP plank, adopted at the 2016 convention. That platform actually goes further, calling the Supreme Court's landmark Obergefell v. Hodges decision legalizing same-sex marriage a lawless ruling that robbed 320 million Americans of their legitimate constitutional authority to define marriage.\n\nMorgan thinks he has an 80% chance of removing the language from the state platform in May, but knows any national fight will far last longer.\n\nIt's a game of dominoes. We're going to tip our domino over and see what happens, he says.\n\nMorgan ends his daylong round of lobbying at tiny Geno's Chowder and Sandwich Shop on the waterfront in Portsmouth.\n\nAs the small crowd digs into paper bowls of steaming-hot fish chowder, he talks about the bridges New Hampshire Republicans could build if they only would walk away from the current marriage definition: more allies on fights for lower taxes and against abortion. More people willing to open their wallets to support the state party.
(CNN) A court in China has ordered a man to pay thousands of dollars in compensation to his former wife for housework she shouldered during their five-year marriage, in a landmark divorce ruling that has sparked discussion in the country over the value of unpaid domestic duties.\n\nWang, a homemaker, demanded restitution equivalent to $24,700 from her husband after he filed for divorce at a district court in Beijing in October. Wang said she was left to take care of the couple's child and housework alone, as her husband barely cared about or participated in any kind of domestic chores, the state-run China National Radio (CNR) reported\n\nIn its ruling, the court ordered the husband to pay Wang around $7,700 as housework compensation, after splitting their joint property equally. Wang was also awarded custody of their son and $300 per month in alimony, according to CNR.\n\nThe ruling is the first of its kind under China's new civil code, a wide-ranging legislative package that the Chinese government and legal experts say will better protect the rights of individuals. In effect since January, it includes a clause enabling a spouse to seek compensation from their partner during divorce for taking more responsibility in caring for children and elderly relatives.\n\nThe ruling, which was first reported by local media in early February, became a trending topic on Weibo, China's Twitter-like service, this week after a hashtag was created to draw attention to the court's decision. As of Wednesday, the hashtag has been viewed more than 500 million times. While some comments applauded the ruling as a recognition of the hard, unpaid labor at home, others said the amount awarded was too little to cover five years of housework and childcare.\n\nUnequal gender roles in domestic life have been a topic of public debate in China in recent years amid a rising feminist movement. Despite increasing education levels and women's growing economic status, gender norms and patriarchal traditions have not caught up with these changes, and women are still expected to carry out most of the childcare and housework after marriage.\n\nChina's divorce laws\n\nHousework compensation is designed to offer additional protection to spouses who have undertaken more domestic chores -- and sacrificed opportunities to advance their career or education, according to legal experts.\n\nFor the spouse who works outside, after divorce they can still enjoy the resources, connections and status they've had -- and still earn the same level of income. But for the spouse who has been paying efforts quietly at home, they will have to face the problem of returning to (work), Long Jun, an associate law professor at Tsinghua University, told state-broadcaster CCTV\n\nThis means that the homemaker has to pay a hidden cost in addition to the efforts they paid during the marriage, Long said.\n\nThe right to seek housework compensation in divorce proceedings is not a new concept in Chinese law. In 2001, housework compensation was added to a revision of China's marriage law with the precondition that it only applied to couples who agreed to separation of property, in which each spouse retains exclusive ownership of property acquired during the marriage.\n\nIn reality, however, legal experts say few Chinese couples have reached formal agreement to keep their property separate, so it's rare for divorcing spouses to qualify for court-approved housework compensation.\n\nAccording to our survey, only 3% to 5% of couples in our country implement the separation of property, Xia Yinlan, a professor specializing in marriage law at the Chinese University of Political Science and Law, told CCTV . That's why the precondition was scrapped in China's new civil code, Xia said.\n\nFalling marriage, rising divorce\n\nOn Weibo, many users expressed disappointment that Wang was only awarded $7,700, after she dedicated five years of her life to taking care of her family, especially in the Chinese capital -- where the cost of living and income levels are among the highest in the country.\n\nI'm a bit speechless. I feel that the job of a full-time housewife has been underestimated. In Beijing, hiring a nanny would cost more than 50,000 yuan per year, said a top comment under CNR's report.\n\nThis is why young people are not willing to get married and have children. The cost is too high, said another.\n\nChina's marriage rate has been plunging since 2013. And in just six years, the number of Chinese people getting married for the first time has fallen by 41%, according to data released by China's National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nDivorce rates, meanwhile, have climbed nearly five times in the past three decades. According to government statistics, there were 0.69 divorces per thousand people in 1990. By 2019, the latest figures available, that number stood at 3.36.\n\nFeng Miao, the judge who presided over the Beijing court case, told CNR that the amount of compensation in this ruling was decided based on factors including the husband's income levels and the cost of living in the Chinese capital.\n\nNow that the new civil code is in force, the judge said she expected more cases involving demands for housework compensation to be filed. But in practice, we still need to accumulate experience in how to meter out the amount of compensation, she said.
Couples are taking a lot longer to walk down the aisle these days -- if they do it all.\n\nIn 1960, 72% of American adults were married. Around half are married today, according to the Pew Research Center. More people are co-habitating with their significant others and raising children outside of marriage.\n\nMarriage offers some legal protections over finances in the case of a split. While that's no reason for couples to decide to say I do, experts recommend unmarried couples be careful when it comes to their finances.\n\nJust in case it doesn't work out, you need to protect yourself, said Katharine Perry, a certified financial planner at Fort Pitt Capital Group.\n\nTalk honestly about money\n\nIt might be uncomfortable, but partners should have detailed -- and frank -- conversations about their finances.\n\nKeeping secrets about money can stir up trouble in a relationship.\n\nBreak down how much money you earn and spend, and make sure you're honest about any debt you have, suggested Perry.\n\nIf you are hiding any credit card debt, now is the time to tell them, she said. Look at what is coming in and out each month and then discuss who will be responsible in regards to bills.\n\nRelated: 5 money mistakes that could doom your new marriage\n\nDon't open a joint account\n\nAnyone named on a bank account can withdraw all the money and never be seen again -- and that's perfectly legal.\n\nA lot of people don't worry about a bank account, said Chicago divorce attorney Andrew Vaughn. But if you set up a joint account, either person who is on it can take all of the money out.\n\nHe worked with a professional athlete who lost $700,000 in a joint bank account to his girlfriend after they broke up.\n\nSo unless you're confident both of you are in this for the long haul, it's best to consider keeping your bank accounts separate.\n\nIf you still want to open a joint account with your significant other, experts recommended keeping the majority of your earnings in your own account and a limited amount -- about one month of expenses -- in the joint account.\n\nThis way your real risk is a month's worth of financial exposure, Vaughn said.\n\nBe smart about buying a house\n\nBuying a home with someone who isn't your legal spouse can expose all sorts of issues, warned Vaughn. For instance, will both names be on the title? How will the mortgage be paid each month? What happens to the house in the event of a breakup?\n\nHe suggested creating a contract that details exactly how the home will be handled if the owners go their separate ways.\n\nThe optimal way is doing a pre-purchase contract, he suggested. That document could specify who would get the home in a separation, how long the new sole owner would have to pay off the other owner, or how sale proceeds will be split.\n\nRelated: Is 2018 the year to buy a house?\n\nA rental lease can also get complicated when a couple splits. If only one person is listed on the lease, it can leave the other out in the cold.\n\nEvery time you get into a fight and you aren't on the lease ... they can kick you out and you have [limited] rights of recourse, said Vaughn.\n\nOn the other hand, if both names are listed on the lease, it's a good idea to have a plan on who is going to move out if the relationship ends, he added.\n\nThink twice before co-signing a loan\n\nSo maybe your partner has bad credit, and needs to use your good name to secure a loan. Think twice before agreeing.\n\nCo-signing means you are equally responsible for paying it back. A bank doesn't care if your girlfriend cheated on you or your boyfriend disappeared without a word. You will still be on the hook for the debt -- even if you are no longer together with the debtor.\n\nIf you co-sign on a loan, you have to trust that person to not screw you over, to not tarnish your debt or stick you with debt if you break up, said Perry. Don't put your name on something that you are not willing and able to be 100% responsible for.\n\nCalculate: When will you be debt free?\n\nKeep your credit cards separate\n\nAdding your partner's name to your card might seem like a simple way to handle shared expenses, but credit card companies aren't likely to sympathize if you're dealing with a break up.\n\nIt is a horrific idea, because someone can really impact your credit and ruin a big chunk of your life going forward, said Vaughn. After you break up, what incentive does the significant other have to behave in a responsible way?

Miller was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. Follow him on Twitter @aarondmiller2. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nWhat do you do when it's increasingly clear that one of your longtime Middle East partners doesn't share either your values or many of your interests?\n\nThis is only one of the troubling questions that President Obama confronted this week as he sat with Saudi King Salman to discuss the state of the region and the U.S.-Saudi relationship.\n\nThe Saudis sent a lower-level official to greet Obama and Saudi state television didn't even bother covering the President's arrival.\n\nSo to paraphrase Hamlet, clearly something is rotten in the state of the U.S.-Saudi relationship.\n\nAnd regardless of how this week's meetings conclude the Saudi-American enterprise will remain a delicate and fraught affair. The answers to the following five questions tell you why.\n\nIs Saudi Arabia a U.S. ally?\n\nThat depends of course on how you define the word ally. But by any measure countries that don't share common values and whose interests on many critical issues seem to fundamentally collide can't simply be described the way we might look at U.S. relations with fellow democracies like Britain or Canada.\n\nSaudi Arabia is an authoritarian regime that discriminates against women, doesn't permit religious freedom, and prevents freedom of the press. It has been exporting a fundamentalist Wahhabist ideology for years that demonizes Shia, Jews, Christians and the West.\n\nYet Saudi Arabia isn't the Islamic state, nor as some analysts have suggested, a junior version of it.\n\nIt's not seeking to undermine the regional order or sponsor terror against the West and create a caliphate. In fact, the Saudis are themselves a victim of jihadi terror and have worked closely with the United States against al Qaeda in Yemen and on counterterrorism against ISIS.\n\nStill al Qaeda developed out of Wahhabist doctrine and Saudi Arabia has done more than its fair share to nurture Islamic extremists and to fund jihadi groups in Syria such al Nusra. And the latest Saudi threat to sell off U.S. securities if Congress passes legislation holding them responsible for any official involvement in the 9/11 terror attacks highlights a disturbing possibility of some link.\n\nDo U.S.-Saudi interests fundamentally diverge?\n\nOn a number of issues, you bet they do. It's tempting to turn the U.S.-Saudi relationship into a morality play that pits the forces of goodness on one side against the forces of darkness on the other. But the inconvenient reality is that over the past two decades, the two sides' interests have simply diverged in fundamental ways.\n\nThe broad trade-off between access to Saudi oil in exchange for a U.S. commitment to its security from external threats has broken down, and even though the Obama administration has sold almost $95 billion in arms to the Saudis, on core issues such as Syria, Iran, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Egypt and democratization in the region, there are major differences. The perception that the United States is withdrawing from the region, the Iranian nuclear deal and what must appear to the Saudis as U.S. acquiescence in a rising Iran have combined to create a foundation of suspicion and mistrust.\n\nIs Saudi Arabia headed for instability or collapse?\n\nNot really. Despite some analysts who believe Saudi Arabia is somehow on the verge of collapse, the Saudis are likely to be around for some time to come. The Saudis have many serious problems. The transition to a new King and his young, inexperienced and risk-ready son have created some turmoil within the royal family and could pose problems during the succession after Salman.\n\nFalling oil prices have created budgetary deficits and spending restrictions; the Saudis are trapped in a costly war in Yemen and pressed by a rising Iran. But the kingdom weathered the Arab spring and regional turbulence with little difficulty and remains a stable and highly functional state, with the world's largest oil reserves, low debt and high cash reserves.\n\nIf you compared Saudi Arabia to Egypt, Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon, it would seem a model of stability. Still, internal problems over succession can only complicate the U.S.-Saudi relationship and create tension and turmoil in the years ahead. Saudi Arabia will change; the question is whether that process will be an evolutionary or revolutionary one.\n\nIs the U.S.-Saudi relationship too big to fail?\n\nProbably for now. However imperfect Saudi policies, the United States still requires local friends in the region to help stabilize matters and pursue American interests. The United States may increasingly be weaning itself off Arab hydrocarbons, but the rest of the world isn't. And since oil still trades in a single market, a disruption in supply will impact the economies and markets around the world, including the United States.\n\nSo, stability in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf is still a vital American interest. And Saudi Arabia with all its imperfections is still the key element in that. Moreover, Wahhabis or not, Washington still needs the Saudis for intelligence sharing and operations against ISIS and al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen and requires Riyadh's cooperation in trying to manage the Syrian problem if there is to be an outcome to the current civil war more favorable than the black hole of chaos that exists there now.\n\nWill relations Improve under the next President?\n\nClearly, the Saudis are looking past President Obama to the next administration and doubtless hoping for a different kind of President. Obama's comments to the Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg that Saudi Arabia was a free rider essentially benefiting from a U.S. security guarantee without doing its fair share to support U.S. goals hasn't endeared him to the King. Nor has his risk-aversion on Syria or risk-readiness to reach an accommodation with Iran. But these policies may not change significantly in 2017.\n\nThe painful fact is that the United States is stuck in a bad marriage with Saudi Arabia, where neither divorce nor reconciliation is likely. The same Middle East mess that estranged the two sides will likely also force them to cooperate. Indeed, despite what divides them it's more than likely that for the foreseeable future the United States and Saudi Arabia will find a way to muddle through – cooperating where they can and agreeing to disagree where they must.\n\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\n\nRead CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.\n\nAaron David Miller is a vice president and distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and author of The End of Greatness: Why America Can't Have (and Doesn't Want) Another Great President.

(CNN) Amid a gradual shuttering of American society due to the spread of coronavirus, the two leading Democratic candidates for president debated Sunday night -- the first one-on-one debate of the election, between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders .\n\nI watched, took notes and picked some of the bests and worsts of the night that was. My thoughts are below.\n\nWINNERS\n\n: Biden pledged unequivocally on Sunday night that he will pick a woman to be his vice president . That's a BIG deal as it will mark -- assuming Biden is the nominee -- only the third time in the history of the Democratic Party that a woman will be on the national ticket. (The other two? 1984 and 2016.) That's a BIG deal. And if you are Warren, Harris, Abrams or Klobuchar, you just had a surprisingly good Sunday night, politically speaking.\n\n: The President's handling of the coronavirus -- the ONLY issue anyone cares about right now -- has been shaky to say the very least. He's made a number of factually inaccurate statements about the threat posed by the virus. He continues to suggest everything is perfectly under control. He refuses to take any responsibility for any of the mistakes his administration has made to date.\n\nIn short, you would think that he would have been a target-rich environment for both Sanders and Biden, right? After all, the first 30 minutes (at least) of the debate was dedicated to the coronavirus and how each man would fix it if they were president. And yet, with the exception of an occasional mention here and there, Trump was barely mentioned.\n\nMuch of the rest of the debate was Sanders savaging Biden's voting record from more than three decades in the Senate -- on everything from the bankruptcy law to Social Security cuts to the Defense of Marriage Act -- that isn't likely to change the trajectory of the Democratic race (Biden seems likely to win overwhelmingly in states set to vote Tuesday) but provides terrific lines of attack for Trump once Biden is the nominee.\n\n* No live audience: The reason there was no live audience at this debate was because of concerns about crowds and coronavirus. While I wish a global pandemic wasn't the motivator, I do think this debate was FAR better than recent ones in which the cheering, booing and ooohing from the audience was both distracting and wrongly influential for the TV audience. We need to accept that this is a TV event. The vast majority of the people who are watching are doing so from afar. Why let a few hundred people the campaigns (and Democratic National Committee) choose to invite influence the broader audience?\n\n* Elbow bump: Sure, it looked sort of weird when : Sure, it looked sort of weird when Sanders walked over to Biden and gave him an elbow bump rather than a handshake. It was also a) the right thing to do amid the coronavirus outbreak and b) a powerful symbol to the general public about how we all need to adjust our behavior accordingly.\n\nAlso, it gave us these amazing quotes that you could NEVER have foreseen coming up in a presidential debate in 2020.\n\n1) I am using a lot of soap. -- Bernie Sanders\n\n2) I wash my hands god-knows-how-many-times with hot water and soap. -- Joe Biden\n\n* The You Tube: With much of the country committed to staying at home to protect ourselves (and the broader society) from coronavirus, a massive video-sharing website probably doesn't need any help. But it got some anyway when Sanders urged people to go to the You Tube.\n\nLOSERS\n\n* Bernie Sanders/Joe Biden: Both men had good moments. Both had bad moments. But overall, they spent two hours attacking each other's voting records -- often focusing on the sort of legislative minutiae (Hyde Amendment!) that the average voter simply tunes out. And in the process, handing the Trump campaign a whole lot of soundbites to be used in the general election. Both men looked small more often than they looked big. And with the country facing a threat unlike any it's ever seen before, that felt like a major missed opportunity.\n\nLet's deal with Sanders first. The expectation going into the debate -- judging from the tone of Sanders' announcement last week that he was planning to stay in the race -- was that the Vermont senator would use the one-on-one format with Biden to try to force the former VP to acquiesce to some of his policy proposals but generally avoid taking any big swings at the man who, according to the delegate math, is the near-certain Democratic nominee. Sanders badly missed the mark when he tried to turn the coronavirus conversation into a recitation of his Medicare for All program. His unwillingness to walk back his praise for Cuba under Fidel Castro was a major mistake. That said, if you are a Bernie backer, you likely loved him taking it to Biden on Social Security, the war in Iraq, the Defense of Marriage Act and a few other major pieces of legislation where the two men were on opposite sides.\n\nNow, Biden. He clearly benefited from a one-on-one format, making more sense and staying more relevant for the entirety of the debate. He was VERY smart to make news by announcing he would pick a female VP. His focus on the need for trusted leadership during the coronavirus crisis made Sanders look small. But his trademark verbal flubs -- he seemingly mixed up coronavirus, SARS and H1N1 on several occasions -- were there, and immediately picked up on by the Trump campaign . Biden's answer on whether he put Social Security cuts on the board was not clear or good. He gave the Trump campaign clear openings for attack with his support for no deportations in the first 100 days and support for ending fracking.\n\nNeither one came out of that debate looking great. And neither one's supporters moved an inch closer to each other either. Biden summed things up nicely when asked what he would do, if he is the nominee, to bring Sanders into the fold: He's making it hard for me right now.\n\n* Ambitious male Democratic politicians: Sorry, Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker and Andrew Yang. The best you guys are going to do is to make it into a Biden Cabinet (if it happens). Also, credit to Yang for the : Sorry, Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker and Andrew Yang. The best you guys are going to do is to make it into a Biden Cabinet (if it happens). Also, credit to Yang for the tweet of the night following Biden's pledge to choose a female VP: Wow Joe just committed to a woman as VP. I like it. Though he didn't mention that to me when we spoke.
Story highlights There's been a recent movement to get President Andrew Jackson off the $20 bill His legacy is mired in controversy, particularly his anti-Native American and pro-slavery positions\n\nProgram note: Explore the vicious rematch between Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams on Race For The White House, Sunday, April 3, at 9 p.m.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nYou've probably heard about the movement to replace Andrew Jackson's image on the ubiquitous $20 bill, but why exactly did the United States put him on there in the first place?\n\nIt's no secret that Andrew Jackson's legacy is complicated. He's described by the organization that wants him off the $20 bill as the slave-trading, Indian-killing seventh President.\n\nYet, his humble origins as a poor orphan with little education exemplified the American dream that anyone could become president.\n\nBiographer James Parton put it this way: He was a democratic autocrat, an urbane savage, an atrocious saint.\n\nWe may never know exactly why the U.S. Department of Treasury selected Jackson as one of about a dozen American presidents and statesmen to adorn U.S. currency. But here's a look at why Jackson's legacy is mired in controversy:\n\nHis anti-Native American policies\n\nJackson believed Westward expansion would keep America a great and strong republic, yet this came at a terrible price for Native Americans.\n\nPresident Jackson signed into law the Indian Removal Act of 1830 allowing the U.S. government to forcibly evict native Americans east of the Mississippi to land west of the Mississippi. The Cherokees, who had helped Gen. Jackson win a decisive battle in the War of 1812, fought the new law in the U.S. Supreme Court and won.\n\nBut it didn't matter.\n\nOPINION: Why the U.S. apologized to the Cherokees\n\nInfuriated by the ruling, Jackson declared, [Chief Justice] John Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it.\n\nA few years later, nearly 17,000 Cherokees were rounded up and forced out of Georgia to present-day Oklahoma on the Trail of Tears.\n\nFamilies were rousted out of their cabins and directed at gunpoint by soldiers, wrote author and historian Tiya Miles. Forced to leave most of their possessions behind, they witnessed white Georgians taking ownership of their cabins, looting and burning once cherished objects.\n\nThousands died on that journey, many from smallpox and cholera.\n\nChampion of the average (white) man\n\nTo those who supported Jackson, he was almost a folk hero, an embodiment of the American spirit. He grew up the poor son of Scotch-Irish immigrants in the Carolinas during the Revolutionary War. He joined a militia at 13 after his older brother died fighting in the war and served as a courier.\n\nPHOTO: Library Of Congress/Getty Images Andrew Jackson was the 7th U.S. president.\n\nWhile ferrying messages across battle lines, the teenage Jackson was captured along with his brother by the British. A British officer reportedly ordered him to clean his boots and when Jackson refused, the officer slashed him across the face and hand with a sword.\n\nHe was later released in a prisoner exchange. The incident not only fueled his lifelong hatred for the British colonists, but it added his legendary status.\n\nLater, as the swashbuckling commander during the War of 1812, his cunning and fearlessness led him to win the Battle of New Orleans, despite being outnumbered nearly two-to-one.\n\nGetting rich off slavery\n\nJackson's legendary status appears quite tarnished when you consider his involvement and position on slavery.\n\nSlavery was the source of Andrew Jackson's wealth, according to The Hermitage organization, which maintains Jackson's plantation home near Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nHe owned hundreds of slaves whose labor produced the cash crops from the 1,000-acre Hermitage and his plantation in Alabama. Enslaved African-Americans also ran nearly every aspect of everyday life at these large plantations.\n\nJackson actively supported pro-slavery policies during his presidency in an attempt to keep the nation together. At one point, he even ordered the postmaster general to destroy abolitionist pamphlets mailed to the Southern states, fearing the newsletters could fuel discontent around slavery and spark a civil war.\n\nDefender of women's honor\n\nWhen Jackson decided to run for president against John Quincy Adams in 1824 and 1828, his marriage to a not-quite-divorced-yet woman in the 1790s became fodder for his political opponents.\n\nJackson's elopement with the married Rachel Robards was a perfect example of his rampageous personality, wrote historian Ann Toplovich, summing up the Adams campaign's assessment of Jackson's nuptials.\n\nPHOTO: Kean Collection/Getty Images/MPI/Getty Images) Andrew and Rachel Jackson\n\nJackson tried unsuccessfully to shield his wife from the negative press about their marriage, while his campaign team tried unsuccessfully to put the matter to rest.\n\nAfter Jackson's 1828 victory, Rachel Jackson died before her husband could be sworn in.\n\nREAD MORE: How Jackson tried to save his wife's honor\n\nStung from his wife's death, the newly elected President refused to bow to pressure not to appoint his longtime supporter and friend John Eaton as his war secretary. Washington society had deemed Eaton scandalous because he – like Jackson – had married his wife under not-so-politically correct circumstances,\n\nJackson refused to give in.\n\nDo you suppose that I have been sent here by the people to consult the ladies of Washington as to the proper persons to compose my Cabinet? he told his critics.\n\nThe ensuing Petticoat Affair led to the resignation of several of Jackson's Cabinet members but also cemented Jackson's legacy as a Washington outsider who refused to bend.\n\nJackson was the first president under the newly created Democratic Party, which stood for simple, frugal and unintrusive government, according to the nonpartisan Miller Center.\n\nWhile ordinary, working people were at the heart of the Jacksonian Democrats' mission, the party's pro-slavery stance would create a schism many years later.\n\nYet the key Democratic principles set forth by Andrew Jackson would be utilized many generations later by American women, blacks and other minorities to advance their rights with the same passion and fervor that Jackson did for white men.
New York (CNN) — Many of the millions of tourists who come to New York City every year only leave Manhattan to go to or from the airport.\n\nBut for travelers who want to get a sense of the city the locals live in, exploring New York's other four boroughs is a way to see more of the metropolis -- with the added benefit of much smaller crowds.\n\nBrews and botanicals in the Bronx\n\nThe Bronx often gets a reputation for being gritty. But locals know that the Bronx is home to two of the most beautiful natural spaces in the entire city.\n\nThe New York Botanical Garden (NYBG), which is reachable by the D subway train or the Metro-North railroad from Grand Central, is a stunning 250-acre expanse of orchids, roses, ferns and more. During the cooler months, visit the NYBG's glass houses and library, which have permanent displays.\n\nThe garden also works with visual artists. This year, renowned glass artist Dale Chihuly has large-scale works displayed throughout the grounds, and you can visit at night to see them illuminated.\n\nThe other outdoor jewel in the Bronx is Wave Hill , an outdoor garden and cultural space overlooking the Hudson River. Formerly an estate for wealthy New Yorkers like Teddy Roosevelt to rent in the summer, the space was donated to the city of New York and now hosts everything from community picnics to nature tours and jazz concerts.\n\nWhen it comes to food and drink, there's plenty of both in the Bronx. Foodies should head to City Island, a small island just off of the Bronx, for some of the East Coast's best seafood. Take the bus all the way to the end of the island, begin with slushy pina coladas and fried shrimp at Johnny's Famous Reef Restaurant, then work your way back toward the mainland, stopping at crab shacks along the way.\n\n\n\nThe island has a rich maritime history -- boats were made there for the Navy during World War II -- so stop in at the island's nautical museum to learn more about City Island's past.\n\nDumplings and dance parties in Queens\n\nThe Unisphere Pixabay/Creative Commons\n\nQueens is not only New York's largest borough, it also has the most number of languages spoken of any place on earth.\n\nAs a result, the borough considers multiculturalism a way of life, and its dynamic food scene is perfect evidence of that.\n\nEach neighborhood is known for its regional specialties, from Indian and Pakistani in Jackson Heights to Filipino in Sunnyside. To get the most bang for your buck, head to Flushing, the Chinatown of Queens that dwarfs its Manhattan cousin in both size and scope.\n\nRelated content Take a whirl on New York City's carousels\n\nIt's easy to fill a whole day trying every kind of dumpling on offer -- you can't go wrong with crab-and-pork soup ones from Joe's Shanghai, sweet red bean dessert ones from Maxin Bakery and choose-three-ingredients custom ones (they can include anything from sea bass to pickles to eggs) at Tianjin Dumpling House.\n\nAlso in Flushing is Flushing Meadows-Corona Park , the largest in the borough.\n\nIt's home to the Unisphere, a huge silver globe commemorating the 1964 World's Fair, and is walking distance from both Citi Field, home of the Mets, and the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center , which hosts the U.S. Open every summer.\n\nBut that's not the only way to spend time outdoors in Queens.\n\nIt's sometimes hard to see this on a subway map, but Queens loops around and down over Brooklyn, meaning that Rockaway Beach -- yes, the one the Ramones sang about -- is technically in Queens.\n\nAlthough Rockaway experienced major damage from Superstorm Sandy in 2012, the area has rebounded nicely.\n\nRockaway's sand is now lined with pop-up boutiques and trendy food options like surfside taqueria Tacoway Beach\n\nIf you still have energy left over after a beach or park day, take the subway back toward Manhattan and stop at Long Island City, the neighborhood just across the river from Midtown East.\n\nThe neighborhood is home to several top-notch art destinations, including the Isamu Noguchi Museum and the Socrates Sculpture Garden, but don't miss PS1 , an outpost of Manhattan's MoMA known for edgy works by out-there artists and a huge outdoor neighborhood dance party every weekend in summer months.\n\nSelfies and serenity in Staten Island\n\nStaten Island Ferry Pxabay/Creative Commons\n\nEven the most die-hard lifelong New Yorkers will sometimes admit they've never been to Staten Island.\n\nNot only is the borough the most underrated one in the city, getting there is half the fun.\n\nThe Staten Island ferry departs regularly from Lower Manhattan every day and is totally free to ride -- which also makes it the least expensive way to see and get selfies with the Statue of Liberty.\n\nRelated content Best street food in New York City -- from falafel to bagels\n\nWhen heading to Staten Island, stand on the top level on the right for the best views of Lady Liberty, but also look out for the Verrazano Bridge -- which connects Brooklyn and Staten Island -- as well as Ellis Island along the way. On the way back to Manhattan, reverse that and stand on the top left.\n\nDon't just turn around and head back the minute you get to Staten Island, though. Walk or take the S40 bus over to Snug Harbor , which began as the country's only retirement home for sailors and is now a breathtaking garden and historic site.\n\nThe centerpiece is the Chinese Scholar's Garden, the first traditional Chinese garden to open in the United States.\n\nWalking through the tree-shaded pathway into the white-walled garden, you'll feel relaxed, meditative -- and a million miles away from Manhattan's hustle and bustle.\n\nOn the way back to the ferry terminal, make a stop at the Staten Island September 11th Memorial.\n\nThis outdoor sculpture is painted bright white and resembles a pair of wings.\n\nIf you look at the sculpture head-on, it acts as a frame for the slice of downtown Manhattan that the Twin Towers once occupied; along the sides you'll see engravings of names of Staten Islanders who lost their lives on that day.\n\nParks and pizzas in Brooklyn\n\nExplore New York City's ever-changing waterfront with New York magazine architecture critic Justin Davidson, author of Magnetic City: A Walking Companion to New York.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to get from Manhattan to Brooklyn also happens to be the most beautiful -- a walk along the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nWhile some use the bridge to commute to and from work -- trains aren't permitted, but bikes are -- the bridge is a pop culture icon, having made appearances in everything from Sex and the City to Annie Hall, so don't be surprised if you see people recreating their favorite movie scene.\n\nIn fact, you're likely to witness a marriage proposal or two on the bridge.\n\nOnce in Brooklyn, you'll find yourself in the neighborhood known as Dumbo (aka Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass). This riverside community is home to one of the fiercest rivalries in New York City, over a topic everyone in town has opinions about -- pizza.\n\nGrimaldi's is arguably the best known Brooklyn pizzeria, with lines snaking down the block and Frank Sinatra on constant loop.\n\nBut scandal struck when Patsy Grimaldi, who originally founded the pizzeria and then sold it, came out of retirement to open a nearby spot called Juliana's to instant raves.\n\nNo matter which one you choose -- we suggest both, with a vote at the end -- you're in for a truly great New York slice.\n\nA number of wild parrots were shipped to New York in the 1960's destined for pet stores. Many escaped and their descendents live in the trees of Brooklyn as CNN's Richard Roth discovered.\n\nAnd the bridge isn't the only iconic landmark in Brooklyn. Coney Island, which has inspired everyone from the poet Federico Garcia Lorca to the TV show Mr. Robot, is a perennial hit with tourists and locals alike.\n\nMake a full afternoon at Coney with rides on the Wonder Wheel and roller coaster The Cyclone, then pick up hot dogs from Nathan's Famous and walk along the boardwalk.\n\nThere's also a newly vibrant Coney nightlife scene -- you can often get same-day tickets to see the minor-league Brooklyn Cyclones, whose stadium is here, and do a beer flight at Coney Island Brewing Company next door.\n\nMany of the brewery's offerings are inspired by classic soda pops and beach day snacks, so try the surprisingly-not-saccharine Kettle Corn Cream Ale and Cotton Candy Kolsch.\n\nFinally, you won't want to miss Prospect Park, Brooklyn's answer to Central Park. The park's bandshell plays host to summer music performances and film screenings, while adventurers will enjoy the miles of bike trail that loop throughout the green space.\n\nIf you enter the park near Grand Army Plaza, keep an eye out for the farmer's market there, as well as the Brooklyn Museum (which is free to visit on Friday evenings) and the main branch of the Brooklyn Public Library. Come for the the architecture, stay for the slice of lemon chess pie from Brooklyn's beloved Four and Twenty Blackbirds , which you can take with you into the park for a picnic.\n\nExploring the archipelago\n\nOne thing that is easy to overlook is that New York City isn't just one island -- it's an archipelago.\n\nWhile not all of the islands have hotels on them, many are easy to visit and explore.\n\nGovernor's Island, which is accessible by ferry from both Manhattan and Brooklyn, is a great place to spend an afternoon biking, lounging in a hammock or attending a major outdoor event like the Jazz Age Lawn Parties that get New Yorkers dressing up in their finest Roaring Twenties costumes and challenging each other to games of croquet.\n\nThe relatively sleepy Roosevelt Island is reachable via a tram that goes over the East River -- providing gorgeous, Instagram-ready views of the city.\n\nEllis Island, known for its connection to America's immigrants, has a museum where people can trace their family's genealogy.\n\nAnd Lady Liberty, of course, has her very own island.

London (CNN) BAFTA bosses have acknowledged the infuriating lack of diversity after Tuesday's film nominations revealed that every person shortlisted for an acting award this year is white.\n\nNot a single person of color features out of the 18 people nominated across the four leading and supporting actor and actress categories in the UK's prestigious BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) Film Awards this year.\n\nJoker star Joaquin Phoenix -- who won a Golden Globe for best actor in a drama film on Sunday for his role in the dark origin story of the comic book villain -- joins Leonardo DiCaprio, Adam Driver, Taron Egerton and Jonathan Pryce in the leading actor category.\n\nJessie Buckley, Charlize Theron, Scarlett Johansson, Saoirse Ronan, and Renée Zellweger -- who took home a Golden Globe on Sunday -- all received nods for leading actress.\n\nJohansson was also nominated for best supporting actress for her role in Jojo Rabbit.\n\nRead More
(CNN) —\n\nRand Paul once called Donald Trump a delusional narcissist and an orange-faced windbag. Which makes the fact that the Kentucky senator has emerged as the chief defender of the President's unproven claims of being wire-tapped by the Obama Administration all the more amazing.\n\nThis was a witch hunt that began with the Obama administration, sour grapes on the way out the door, Paul said Tuesday of the reported requested unmasking of Trump campaign officials by former national security adviser Susan Rice. They were going to use the intelligence apparatus to attack Trump, and I think they did. (Paul took it even further, arguing that Rice should be subpoenaed to force her to tell Congress what she knows about the unmasking efforts.) Rice denies the allegation.\n\nThe Trump-Paul alliance is, like most things in Washington, a marriage of political convenience.\n\nPaul has long been an outspoken opponent of the breadth and reach of the so-called security state, insisting that things like the Foreign Intelligence Services Court and the broad-scale listening programs exposed by Edward Snowden run directly counter to American civil liberties.\n\nHe clearly sees a chance in this Trump-Russia controversy – all of which stems from a tweet by the President alleging he had been wiretapped by President Barack Obama – to score political points on the idea that the government is listening to everyone all the time and that it is a very bad thing indeed. And, remember that the controversial Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows for the bulk collection of data from Internet service providers, is set to sunset at the end of the year – and Paul believes that it's possible he can win the fight against re-authorization.\n\nFor Trump, he is happy for any defense he can get for his allegation in search of evidence. His claim of being wiretapped has been totally debunked by, among others, FBI Director James Comey, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and even House intelligence committee Chair Devin Nunes.\n\nAt this point, Trump's best (only?) way out is to muddy the water enough regarding wiretapping that he can clam he was right and move on. Paul is very much helping him do that, conflating Trump's wire-tapping claims with the broader idea of a surveillance state.\n\nIt's worth noting here that Paul's conflations aren't, well, accurate. We know from Clapper that no FISA order for the wire-tapping of Trump Tower exists; I can deny it, Clapper told NBC's Chuck Todd when asked directly about the existence of a FISA order.\n\nBut, for Paul and Trump that's besides the point. Their mutual interests intersect in creating the idea of an all-knowing, always-listening intelligence community who is using the information they gather for their own political penchants.\n\nSo, Paul and Trump are friends. For now.
(CNN) Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is facing intense backlash for indicating support for political violence and pushing wild conspiracy theories and extreme anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic comments before she was elected to Congress.\n\nThe House voted Thursday evening to remove Greene from her committee assignments. On Wednesday, GOP House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Republican Conference declined to take action against the freshman Republican for her violent endorsements and incendiary comments.\n\nA CNN KFile review of both newly-uncovered and previously reported comments highlight the fringe nature of what Greene shared on and offline.\n\nGreene defended herself ahead of the House vote in a floor speech Thursday as she tried to distance herself from her past conspiracy comments.\n\nAfter Greene saw things in the news that didn't make sense to me, she said she stumbled across QAnon at the end of 2017. She became very interested in the theory and began posting about it on Facebook because she was upset about things and felt she could not trust the government.\n\nThe problem with that is, though, is I was allowed to believe things that weren't true, and I would ask questions about them and talk about them, and that is absolutely what I regret, she said.\n\nBecause if it weren't for the Facebook posts and comments that I liked in 2018, I wouldn't be standing here today and you couldn't point a finger and accuse me of anything wrong, continued Greene, who went on to blame the media, including CNN, for her comments.\n\nHere are some of the most extreme things Greene has done:\n\nGreene repeatedly indicated support for political violence and execution of top Democrats and FBI agents\n\nAs CNN's KFile previously reported , Greene repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democratic politicians -- including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John Kerry -- and FBI agents in 2018 and 2019 before being elected to Congress.\n\nGreene created a White House petition to impeach Pelosi for treason after Pelosi did not vote to fund former President Donald Trump's border wall in 2019. In newly found posts from 2019, she also wrote a press release and a previously unreported blog post promoting the petition and suggested that Pelosi could be executed for treason.\n\nIn other newly-uncovered tweets and posts, Greene also liked a call to put Pelosi to death. In one tweet , she said she hoped Pelosi would lose her memory sitting in prison.\n\nGreene, in a statement, did not deny that she liked posts and replied to comments but claimed that many people have run her Facebook page. Greene did not specify whether she or a member of her team were behind the posts reviewed by CNN's KFile.\n\nOver the years, I've had teams of people manage my pages. Many posts have been liked. Many posts have been shared. Some did not represent my views. Especially the ones that CNN is about to spread across the internet, Greene said in a statement last week.\n\nCNN previously reported that Greene posted on her candidate Facebook page in September 2020 an image of herself holding a gun alongside images of Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. The caption encouraged going on the offense against these socialists and was interpreted by observers as a threat against the politicians. The Facebook post was taken down for violating its policies.\n\nGreene's campaign told CNN in an emailed statement in September 2020 that those who think the picture incites violence are paranoid and ridiculous.\n\nThe only way you get your freedoms back is it's earned with the price of blood, she said in the video from 2020.\n\nWhile she was a congresswoman-elect and a sitting congresswoman this January, Greene fanned the flames of the Capitol insurrection by encouraging the big lie that Trump, and not Joe Biden, won the election and objected to the election certification process. Greene later denounced the violence at the Capitol but falsely blamed it on BLM/Antifa violence in a statement.\n\nGreene promoted violent, deranged conspiracy theories online\n\nBefore she ran for Congress, Greene embraced violent, fringe conspiracies. Chief among them was the QAnon conspiracy theory -- a discredited conspiracy that pits former President Trump in an imagined battle against a cabal of Satan-worshipping, child-abusing Democrats and celebrities -- though in August 2020 she tried to distance herself from QAnon and claimed that it doesn't represent me.\n\nOne of the most disturbing violent conspiracies Greene engaged with in May 2018 is the Frazzledrip'' conspiracy , which exists deep within conspiracy rabbit hole. The conspiracy baselessly contends that Hillary Clinton and former Clinton aide Huma Abedin were videotaped sexually assaulting a child and then ripping off the child's face to wear as a mask in a Satanic blood sacrifice. The theory then alleges that Clinton ordered an assassination hit against the police officer who found the footage, named Frazzledrip, according to reporting from Media Matters.\n\nAfter facing backlash from her plane comments, Greene said in August 2020 , Some people claimed a missile hit the Pentagon. I now know that is not correct. The problem is our government lies to us so much to protect the Deep State, it's hard sometimes to know what is real and what is not.\n\nIn her floor speech on Thursday , Greene said, 9/11 absolutely happened. I remember that day, crying all day long, watching it on the news. And it's a tragedy for anyone to say it didn't happen. So that I definitely want to tell you all, I do not believe it's fake.\n\nGreene peddled conspiracies that mass shootings were false flags and staged\n\nWhile Greene peddled violent conspiracy theories online, she often speculated if real-world violent events were part of a deeper conspiracy and were actually false flag operations, which refers to acts that are designed by perpetrators to be made to look like they were carried out by other individuals or groups.\n\nIn 2018, she questioned whether the Parkland shooting that killed 17 people was a planned event and called Parkland survivor and activist David Hogg a paid actor. In a recently surfaced video from March 2019 , Greene follows Hogg as he walks toward the US Capitol and can be heard making false and baseless claims as she asks him a series of questions related to gun rights and how he was able to meet with senators. Hogg continues to walk without addressing Greene.\n\nAt the end of the video, Greene calls Hogg a coward and claimed Hogg's activism was funded by billionaire philanthropist George Soros, who is often the subject of far-right conspiracy theories, and other liberals. He can't say one word because he can't defend his stance, she said.\n\nIn another video , she mocked Hogg as an idiot who only talks when he is scripted.\n\nGreene also supported Facebook comments from 2018 that alleged the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that killed six adults and 20 children was a staged event.\n\nIn a statement posted on Twitter following intense backlash to some of her comments, Greene acknowledged that 17 people died in the Parkland shooting and blamed gun free zones at schools for the tragedy.\n\nAfter live bombs were sent to Democratic politicians and CNN in October 2018, Greene repeatedly liked and agreed with multiple comments that the terrorist act was a false flag operation staged by Democrats.\n\nIn one little-remembered Facebook post from September 2018, Greene claimed that the mythical figure Q -- whom Greene had previously called a patriot --warned of false flags for school shootings.\n\nShe then questioned if a shooting at Kennesaw State University in Georgia that killed one person was a failed op? What about hearing voices? Mental illness? Demon possession? Or military grade intelligence developed weapons like Voice of God technology, which refers to a government-controlled device implanted in a person's head.\n\nWe don't know, but I do believe all three of those exist, she wrote.\n\nGreene made similar unreported comments about the Voice of God conspiracy on Twitter in 2018.\n\nIn her floor speech Thursday , Greene affirmed that school shootings are absolutely real and every child that is lost, those families mourn it.\n\nGreene spread anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic comments and conspiracies\n\nOn and offline, Greene frequently engaged with extreme anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim rhetoric. Some of the targets of her comments included her future colleagues in the House of Representatives, like Tlaib and Omar, and Obama, who Greene falsely said is Muslim.\n\nThese are women that really would like to see Sharia in America, Greene said in one since-deleted Facebook video, captured by CNN. Sharia refers to Islamic law, which is interpreted from the religious text of the Quran, and encompasses marriage, divorce, inheritance and punishments for criminal offenses.\n\nAnd as an American woman, as a business owner, as a mother, I have two daughters -- I never want to see Sharia in America. And so I really want to go talk to these ladies and ask them what they are thinking and why they're serving in our American government. They really should go back to the Middle East if they support Sharia. So let's go talk to them. Definitely want to go talk to them.\n\nIn a 2018 Facebook comment, captured by CNN, Greene responded truth, to a comment comparing Obama to terrorist Osama bin Laden. The comment came in response to a post where Greene said the Obama presidency was flooding our country and government with Muslims that don't like our American ways!!!!!\n\nIn another video from 2019, saved by CNN's KFile, Greene spoke about going into Omar's and Tlaib's offices and saying all Muslims want to take away women's rights.\n\nDid you see the part where we went into Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib's office? Greene said. I was like, so are you going to make me live under Sharia law? And I'm an American woman. Are you going to take away my equal rights?\n\nThey would in a heartbeat, responds another rally participant.\n\nYeah, Greene responded. They all, all, all Muslims. That's the goal of Islam. The goal of Islam is Sharia, and they want to conquer. They want to conquer America and we're not going to do it.\n\nGreene directed anti-Muslim rhetoric at the American Muslim Women Political Action Committee in 2018.\n\nWtf is their mission??? To make sure every women is dominated by Islam, is covered in sheets, loses our freedoms, and has to have our vaginas mutilated???, she wrote in 2018 on Facebook. Greene then liked a comment that the PAC was an invasion of our government. In another instance, Greene liked a comment saying We don't need gun control! We need Muslim control!\n\nIn 2018, she liked a tweet from an account that pushes anti-Semitic conspiracies suggesting intelligence services for the nation of Israel killed President John F. Kennedy. In another post from 2018 , Greene wrote a theory that the deadly wildfires in California that year were caused by a laser from space, possibly controlled by the Rothschild investment bank. The Rothschilds are frequent targets of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.\n\nGreene has also called Soros, the Democratic donor and philanthropist, a Nazi and peddled a conspiracy that Soros is a Jew who turned in his own people over to the Nazis; Soros is a Holocaust survivor.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect the House's vote to remove Greene from her committee assignments.
(CNN) If you thought what's known as Film Twitter was populated by insufferable bores before, just wait till you see them now that a movie for which many advocated, Parasite, was named best picture at the Oscars.\n\nStill, in a way the landmark win for the South Korean thriller -- the first non-English-language film to receive that accolade -- represents one of the highest callings of the critical community and, not incidentally, award shows, which is leading people to try movies and TV shows they might not otherwise watch.\n\nThe Academy Awards, of course, talk a good game about advancing the art of movies, but they also serve various masters, including the TV network that airs them. Because the assumption has long been that viewers have more of a rooting interest when they've actually seen the films, there's been a push by ABC/Disney to nominate more blockbusters, including a brief flirtation by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences with introducing a popular film category\n\nThat effort ultimately fizzled, and in any event would have likely been as insulting to the folks who work on such movies as adulatory.\n\nThe broader point, though, is that blockbusters don't need the respect of puny critics, as Hulk might say, to attract audiences and thrive commercially. Whereas something like Parasite, or any number of other nominees, potentially do.\n\nRead More
Dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'\n\nAnd just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted\n\nPlay that funky music white boy\n\nPlay that funky music right\n\nPlay that funky music white boy\n\n– Wild Cherry, Play That Funky Music\n\n(CNN) – The first time I realized white people are people too is when I heard the song Play That Funky Music.\n\nIt was a monster hit in the summer of 1976, especially in my neighborhood, an all-black community in West Baltimore. The song blasted from car radios and TVs tuned to Soul Train. As soon as my friends heard the opening guitar riff, someone would shout, Oh, that's my jam, and people would start bopping their heads and singing along.\n\nI thought the band behind my summer anthem was black. Then one day I turned on the TV and experienced what psychologists call cognitive dissonance. My jaw dropped when I saw Wild Cherry, a bunch of skinny white guys with permed afros, tear into my song. I remember suddenly feeling guilty for liking it and wondering if some racial boundary had been crossed. I had never heard white people talk about being white before.\n\nI hear plenty of it today, though. There's been a rise of racial consciousness among white Americans. Whiteness studies programs are popping up at colleges across the US. Rural white Americans are the focus of popular books like Hillbilly Elegy and White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America. Whites now believe they suffer more from racism than blacks, according to a recent study. Some political pundits even attribute President Donald Trump's election victory to an uprising among rural white voters.\n\nBasically, white has become the new black.\n\nThis could be awkward This is part of an ongoing series by CNN's John Blake and Tawanda Scott Sambou on race, religion and politics\n\nThis is a flip of the traditional racial script in America. Being American traditionally meant white. It was the norm. If you're white, you're alright, one popular expression went. Whiteness, according to author Toni Morrison, was the definition of 'Americanness.' People of color were the ones who traditionally told stories of suddenly discovering they were different, of not fitting in. These are the painful stories heard in CNN's new video series, The First Time I Realized I Was Black.\n\nNow white people are telling the same kind of stories. Here are three people talking about the moments they discovered they are white. One says it was triggered by a simple question on a school test; another points to an innocuous question from a girl; and a third cites an encounter that ended with him bleeding and confused.\n\n'My parents knew I'd eventually figure out I'm white'\n\nA Sunday School teacher once asked Dani Fitzgerald's mom: When are you going to tell her she's white?\n\nHer mom, Debbi, laughed it off.\n\nWe don't talk about people's color, ever, she told the teacher.\n\nSometimes we hear people say they don't see color, that their family taught them to ignore racial distinctions. But Fitzgerald's story illustrates how raising someone in a racial cocoon presents risks as well as rewards.\n\nToday, Fitzgerald is a 23-year-old teacher with cherub cheeks, blue eyes and, occasionally, a tiny silver nose ring. Her racial cocoon was a predominately black church in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. That's where she spent most of her childhood.The Pentecostal church was led by her grandfather, and the only white people in the church were members of her family. Homeschooled by her parents, she says they never talked about people's races, including their own.\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy Kayla Milroy from Kayla Bri Photography Dani Fitzgerald's parents raised her not to see color, a decision that initially confused their daughter.\n\nAs a child my parents never made a distinction between races – ever, she wrote in an essay titled I Didn't Know I Was White, which was published by her college newspaper two years ago.\n\nBlack people weren't those people in her world. They were her people. They were the people she prayed and sang with in the pews and laughed with at church picnics. Even today the songs she sings to lift her spirits are drawn from the black experience. She loves black spirituals like Have a Little Talk with Jesus or Precious Lord, Take My Hand.\n\nAround the age of 10, though, she started sensing she was different from her church family. Her parents invited white friends to their church, but they rarely accepted. When they did, they were visibly uncomfortable. Only later would she learn that her parents were criticized for having black friends.\n\nI can remember the tightened faces and widened eyes of our white friends as my church family embraced them with a hug and wet kiss on the cheek, said Fitzgerald. It was little moments like that where I noticed something different about my church family and my white friends. It was confusing.\n\nThe confusion intensified as she got older. Though her parents attended a virtually all-black church, they lived in white suburban neighborhoods. When she became a teenager, her parents let her attend a public high school. There were about 2,000 students in the school; only about a half dozen were black.\n\nStill, she said, her church held such a powerful hold on her that she was unsure of her racial identity. Then one day in 8th grade she had to take a standardized test that asked her to check a box for race.\n\nThat was one of the first times I can recall having to put down my race for anything, said Fitzgerald. Seeing the races lined up like that, I had no idea what to put.\n\nThe First Time I Realized I Was Black In The Souls of Black Folk, W.E.B. Du Bois talks about the first time he realized his skin color made him different. We asked celebrities, CNN anchors and reporters, and others to tell us when they first realized that being black affected how people treated them. Share your own story with #realizediwasblack\n\nWATCH ALL 20 VIDEOS\n\nShe looked at the kid next to her and saw he checked Asian. She did the same thing.\n\nIt wasn't until a year later that she realized her mistake. She overheard a group of white students talking about how odd the word Caucasian was because they only used it on test forms.\n\nIt hit me like a flashback, she said. It was then that I remembered I put the wrong race. … That was difficult because at my age, I should've known that I was white. When my friends were talking about being 'Caucasian' I felt really stupid. How didn't I know that?\n\nLater, Fitzgerald would see another disconnect: Some of her white friends' descriptions of black people didn't match what she knew about her black church family.\n\nOnce she was in a car with her white friends when they entered a black neighborhood.\n\nI remember their parents saying, 'Lock the doors! Lock the doors!' And when I looked outside, I saw black people.\n\nWhen she started dating a black guy – now her fiancee – some of her white friends were bewildered. Some still are. They ask her how her parents reacted.\n\nWhen I give a quick explanation of my parents' love for all people, the reply is usually, 'Yeah, my dad would kill me if I brought home a black guy.' And they give me an explanation for how 'totally not racist' their father is.\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy Dani Fitzpatrick Fitzgerald was so shaped by the black church she attended that she didn't really know she was white until she was older.\n\nI asked if her mother ever sat her down to tell her she was white. It never happened.\n\nMy parents knew I'd eventually figure out I'm white, she said. They just didn't want to have an influence on that. They wanted me to grow up in an environment where I'm loved by all people, some white, some black.\n\nHer family's attitude toward race is rooted in their faith. Jesus ignored racial, cultural and gender distinctions. So should his followers, she said. One of her favorite passages comes from Galatians 3:28: There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\n\nThose are beautiful sentiments. I wonder, though, if Fitzgerald will retain her parents' optimism when she has children.\n\nShe is currently teaching English as a second language in Thailand. When she returns to the US, she plans on marrying her fiancee, who is studying criminal justice, and starting a family.\n\nWhat racial box will she tell their children to check?\n\nOr will she, like her parents, not talk about people's color, ever?\n\nThey shouldn't have to pick one race because they will be as equally black as they are white, said Fitzgerald. But how does that look practically? I'm not so sure.\n\n'I have never fully grappled with my own race'\n\nWhitney Dow once thought he knew what being white was all about. A bespectacled filmmaker who talks passionately about race, he's given speeches on the subject, appeared on television and made films for PBS on civil rights – including Two Towns of Jasper, a critically acclaimed documentary about the murder of a black man in Jasper, Texas.\n\nBut it was a simple question from a 7th grader that made him realize he was white, he said.\n\nPHOTO: Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images North America/Getty Images It didn't really hit Whitney Dow that he was white until a girl posed a question, which inspired the filmmaker's next work.\n\nHe'd been invited to a fundraiser to talk about the making of Two Towns of Jasper. A group of middle school students came to hear him speak; afterward a young girl asked about his experience working with his black filmmaking partner, Marco Williams.\n\nWhat did you learn about your racial identity working with Marco?\n\nDow's response was instinctive: I don't have one, he told her. I'm an individual.\n\nBut then he thought back to his experiences in Jasper and had what he calls a racial epiphany. He realized he was more than an individual. He was white, and there was a huge difference between understanding this intellectually and experiencing it emotionally.\n\nWhile filming in Jasper, he'd gone into a black-owned auto shop to talk to workers and customers about the 1998 murder of James Byrd Jr., who had been chained by the ankles to the back of a pickup truck and dragged to his death by a group of white men.\n\nDow said he felt like a crusading filmmaker getting the true story. But then Marco later went to the same shop and filmed his own interviews with the same people. When he and Marco compared footage, Dow was stunned.\n\nThe black people in the shop had given Dow false names and an entire set of false stories. His good intentions didn't matter. They didn't see an individual; they saw him as a threat, a white man in a town where other white men had tortured and murdered a black man.\n\nDow was 14 when he met Marco, and he thought they were similar. But it wasn't just their footage that didn't jibe; they clashed over certain goals and scenes in the film.\n\nWe got to the point that we couldn't agree on reality, he said. We left the film feeling that there were certain gulfs that could not be bridged.\n\nBy asking her question – and triggering his memories of Jasper – that 7th grader changed how Dow saw himself.\n\nI had never fully grappled with my own race, he said. I had never really understood that this was an active, dynamic component that impacted every moment of my life.\n\nI heard about Dow because he's become an authority on whiteness. His latest work for PBS is an interactive investigation called the Whiteness Project. Dow travels the country asking people who identify as white or partially white to talk about what being white means to them. Two installments have aired so far.\n\nWhen Dow approached potential donors for the Whiteness Project, some thought he was joking. It's easy to understand why. At first glance, defining whiteness seems so elusive. People tend to think of it in extremes.\n\nWhiteness is on a toggle switch between 'bland nothingness' and 'racial hatred,' author and historian Nell Irvin Painter wrote in a New York Times essay, What is Whiteness?\n\nBut the evolution of whiteness is so much more complex. It was invented; not inherited. Some race scholars say it was created around the 17th century as a legal term to confer certain protections and privileges on Americans of European descent. It was also used to reinforce the notion of a superior white race – and to justify slavery.\n\nDow gives some of this historical context in the Whiteness Project in between interviews with his subjects. But I think the most fascinating part of his project is seeing white people grapple with their racial identity. Some people denied their whiteness. Others were apologetic. One young white man said I'm not happy that I'm white, citing the historic oppression associated with his people. Another guy wondered why black people still get hung up on the slave thing.\n\nOne interview stood out above the rest. I could see the moment a young man discovered he was white.\n\nHe was a white millennial in Dallas, Texas, who looked like he could be a J. Crew model. He was clean-shaven, square-jawed and broad-shouldered. He was also a former drug dealer who sheepishly confessed he had been arrested at least 20 times, but that the only mark on his record was a public intoxication charge.\n\nHe said he knew if he got a lawyer, the judge would go easy on him because of how he looked.\n\nI basically did whatever I wanted to, knowing that there were absolutely no consequences, he said. I would be in jail if I wasn't white.\n\nDow asked him if he ever felt guilty about his past. He paused to consider the question. A look of confusion on his face gave way to realization.\n\nMe talking about it, he said, is making me realize: Damn, I'm pretty lucky.\n\nDow, 55, said he understands why more white people are talking about being white today. Some have a sense they are being left behind. They might not see more people of color in their personal lives, but they see them in movies, on newscasts and throughout popular culture.\n\nIt's almost as if you're a person of color, you are on the trajectory up, he said. It's a positive narrative. It's against oppression. Things are getting better. It's not a straight line, but the narrative is we're working for equality and freedom.\n\nDow is still working to understand what being white means. He said the 7th grader's question inspired him to start the Whiteness Project.\n\nI don't think she realized that she changed my life, he said.\n\nIn that moment, she also inspired him to change his answer. After he told her he had no racial identity, Dow thought about his experiences in Jasper and decided to answer again.\n\nOf course, that's not true, he told her. I have the most powerful racial identity in America. I'm a white male.\n\n'I felt this overwhelming sense of sadness'\n\nEditor's note: The section below contains language that could be offensive to some.\n\nWhat if racial categories aren't set in stone but stretch like taffy?\n\nThat's the analogy I thought of when I considered the story of a black man who discovered he was white.\n\nThat man is my younger brother, Patrick.\n\nI don't normally write about family. But my brother and I belong to the partially white category Dow explores in his Whiteness Project. We are biracial. When I told my brother about this story, he told me about the day he discovered he was white.\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy Patrick Blake Patrick Blake saw himself as black, but being biracial meant others in his community saw him as an enemy.\n\nIt was one of the saddest and strangest tales I've ever heard him tell.\n\nOur mother is Irish and our father is black. But we didn't see ourselves as white. We grew up with our father's family in a black community. We didn't meet our mother or her family until we were young men.\n\nWhen we were kids, being biracial wasn't cool or exotic. It was the 1970s and early '80s in inner-city Baltimore. Our world was all black. Whites were viewed with disdain. The only whites we saw were police officers or bill collectors. They were so vilified that I never told anyone my mother was white. It was a badge of shame.\n\nAnd it could get you hurt. That's what happened to my brother one day when he was 13. He was walking home alone on a deserted stretch of railroad tracks when he heard a chorus of voices behind him.\n\nHey white boy! White boy! Hey you honky, a group of boys shouted.\n\nAt first, my brother didn't know they were talking to him. Then he realized he was the only other person on the tracks. He heard their footsteps quicken. They were coming after him. He started running.\n\nThen they started throwing rocks – not small ones but those big, jagged rocks that line railway beds. One hit him on the side of his head. It made a strange thwack when it hit his skull. He started bleeding. He finally outran the boys and arrived home trembling.\n\nI felt this overwhelming sense of sadness, said Patrick. They were mad at me because of the color of my skin. I remember walking home, tears coming to my eyes, not because of the physical assault but because these were my own people. But they didn't see it because of the color of my skin.\n\nI knew how he felt. I would lash out whenever kids called me white boy. I got in so many fights because of those two words. I can still remember the taunts from the boys in my neighborhood as I rolled on the ground fighting my latest accuser: It's a fight, it's a fight; between a nigger and a white.\n\nMy brother told me his whiteness made him feel like a person with a disability. If he walked outside, he would immediately attract second looks because of his fair complexion and hair texture.\n\nI thought of myself as black, said Patrick, now 51, but I understood myself to be white in my neighborhood.\n\nNeither of us had the understanding of race to articulate what we were going through then. Only later would I learn that whiteness is actually elastic. The Irish, our mother's ethnic group, were once not considered fully white in 19th century America. The same with Italians, Jews and Greeks. They had to work their way into whiteness, often by conspicuously hating blacks.\n\nThose kind of appeals to racial solidarity wouldn't have made any difference to the boys I tangled with in my neighborhood. They saw me and my brother as the enemy.\n\nBut then, years later, my brother had his white credentials revoked. It happened during a dinner date with a white woman.\n\nAfter moving to Charlotte, North Carolina, my brother joined a church where he was one of four blacks in a congregation of 1,500. There was a young German woman who had her eyes on Patrick, so he invited her to dinner. As they ate in his apartment, she asked him where was he from. Not satisfied by his answer of Baltimore, she asked another question: What's your race?\n\nOh, I'm both. I'm black and white, my brother told her.\n\nThe woman's eyes widened and she dropped her fork. Then a look of fear appeared on her face.\n\nI have to leave, she told him. I don't believe in the mixing of races.\n\nMy brother said he was too stunned to get mad.\n\nPHOTO: John Blake/CNN Patrick Blake says he knew his black identity was secure when a group of white men called him by a racial epithet.\n\nThen one day he had an experience that should have made him even angrier – if it hadn't been comforting in an odd way.\n\nIt happened in college after he got a job working at a home improvement store. He was using a forklift to unload a truck when he heard some voices behind him in a car yell, Hey nigger.\n\nI thought they were talking about the truck driver, he said. He was black. I'd never been called nigger before.\n\nHe ignored them until one of the voices said: Hey you nigger on the forklift.\n\nHe shrugged as the white man in the car flipped him the bird and drove off.\n\nI kind of felt relieved, he said. I had arrived. It was comical. I remember smiling, saying, 'Damn, I'm black now.'\n\nAs time went on, he embraced the racial whiplash. Sometimes he checked the box for white on job applications; sometimes African-American. But he's always seen himself as African-American because that's how he's viewed by most people he meets.\n\nDoes he miss being white?\n\nHell no, because I'm more comfortable in my skin now, he said. If somebody calls me a white boy, I'm not offended, and we can deal with it if necessary.\n\nOne crucial moment made us both comfortable with our partial whiteness: when we first met our mother. I was 18, he was 17.\n\nWe knew the reason for the separation. Our mother's family had disowned us because of our father's race. Our mother was an unwed teenager when she gave birth to us, and she was forced by her family to keep away from her children. Interracial marriage was illegal when we were born.\n\nMy brother still remembers how he felt at that meeting. I felt the same way: whole. For the first time in our lives, the circle was complete. Until then, we hadn't felt like we belonged anywhere; we'd felt victimized by racial prejudice from both blacks and whites.\n\nWhen she came out to greet me, I didn't see any hesitation over whether I was black or white, said Patrick. She was a sweet, loving person who loved her boys 100%. It really helped me be comfortable and not be ashamed of the whiteness in me. I don't really give a flip about people who say I look too white or black, because I have two loving parents.\n\nAnd because I'm both.\n\nI worked out my racial identity a little differently: Meeting my mother drove me to read books about race. When I read about the Irish, I see similarities with African-Americans. Both peoples had their culture and language usurped by a more dominant group. Both were looked down upon; the Irish used to be called white niggers.\n\nFew use that derogatory term today because the Irish are now considered white. Others may soon join the club. People talk about the browning of America, but already more Hispanics are identifying as white, according to a study of census forms.\n\nIt no longer surprises me when white people talk about being white. Nobody gives a second look at white boys playing funky music – or grappling with the different ways of being white.\n\nMy ultimate hope, though, is for another day – when we learn not that we're white, black, brown or something else.\n\nWe'll discover that we're all human, and race no longer divides us.
Editor's Note: Grace Forrest is a founding director of Walk Free Foundation, an international organization focused on the eradication of modern slavery. Davina Durgana is a report co-author and senior statistician on the Walk Free Foundation's Global Slavery Index. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nOn any given day in 2016, 40.3 million people were living in slavery – more than the populations of Australia, Portugal and Costa Rica combined.\n\nWhen this startling research, The Global Estimates of Modern Slavery, was released at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2017, it revealed the true scale of this often-invisible scourge. A crime thought to be left in the 19th century, not only existing but thriving in the present day.\n\nPHOTO: Grace Forrest, Walk Free Foundation Grace Forrest\n\nThe pioneering data set was the culmination of years of hard work between the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Walk Free Foundation, in partnership with the International Organisation for Migration.\n\nThe research provides governments with a baseline estimate of the problem, and encouragingly, some are already acting.\n\nTackling slavery across borders\n\nIn January, the Canadian government announced the creation of an independent ombudsman to investigate allegations of human rights abuses linked to Canadian corporate activity overseas.\n\nPHOTO: Davina P. Durgana, Walk Free Foundation Davina Durgana\n\nThis means the Canadian government is actively working to scrutinize and eliminate slavery, especially forced labor, within global supply chains.\n\nRead more on modern-day slavery\n\nA country like Canada showing leadership on this issue is something to be celebrated and marks a major development in the international debate.\n\nIt is in line with the research partners' call for global cooperation between governments, organizations and the business community to tackle modern slavery across sectors and borders. A crime this large and far-reaching requires a transnational and cross-sector response.\n\nExploiting the vulnerable\n\nGlobal slavery is one of the most profitable criminal industries in the world. Despite this it is largely invisible, in part because in many societies it disproportionately affects the most vulnerable and marginalized. That is why measuring this problem is so crucial in exposing and ultimately resolving it.\n\nWomen and girls are disproportionately affected by modern slavery, accounting for 28.7 million, or 71 per cent of the overall total, 84 per cent of victims of forced marriage and 99 per cent of victims of forced labor in the commercial sex industry, according to the Global Estimates.\n\nRead more: Women and girls are key to slavery fight\n\nThe Global Estimates included forced marriage – finding about 15 million people were in forced marriages around the world.\n\nMore than one third of all of these victims were children at the time of the marriage, and almost all child victims were girls. This is an area that still requires significant global intervention.\n\nIn the Global Estimates, forced marriage refers to situations where people, regardless of their age, were forced to marry without their consent. This can happen through physical, emotional or financial duress, deception or the use of force and threats.\n\nIt has been recognized for more than 60 years that forced marriage is in international law a slavery-like practice. Once forced to marry, all too often victims of forced marriage are subjected to other human rights abuses, including sexual and domestic servitude, and forced labor. Children are particularly vulnerable in these situations.\n\nBuilding tangible change\n\nThe Global Estimates of Modern Slavery represented a milestone achievement for the field. It is the baseline foundation on which we now must take action and build tangible change.\n\nFrom the data we have collected over the last five years, we know that 89 million people have experienced some form of modern slavery during that time – for periods ranging from a few days to the entire five years.\n\nIt is important to reflect on the significant challenges that remain. While the odds may seem overwhelming, we must remember that the challenges that face us are man-made.\n\nEach and every individual has the right and the power to continue this momentum by applying pressure to governments and corporates.\n\nThis report should serve as a sharp reminder to all world leaders about the responsibility they have in individually and collectively tackling this problem. We must work collaboratively and effectively to finally eradicate modern slavery in this century.\n\nNational governments must take responsibility for modern slavery at home and be accountable for the slavery that may permeate their borders through long supply chains.\n\nThe Global Estimates provides governments with clear visibility of a problem that has long been overlooked. Ignorance is no longer an excuse.\n\nWe cannot accept that on any given day there are tens of millions of people living in modern slavery.
Some of us like to escape our Blursday monotony with a breathless page-turner. Others seek out nonfiction to better understand the complex, chaotic world around us. And some of us just can't stop doomscrolling on our phones.\n\nNow is not the time to judge anyone's literary tastes or reading habits -- hey, whatever reading helps you get through this is fine.\n\nThank goodness the publishing industry keeps churning out new books.

Now Thomas is back with a prequel of sorts about Starr's father, Maverick Carter, a gang member who tries to go straight after he becomes a father for the first time. Like its predecessor, Concrete Rose poses moral questions as it forces its teenage protagonist to decide what kind of adult to become.\n\nMy Year Abroad, by Chang-Rae Lee (February)\n\nThe acclaimed Korean-American writer's new novel is about an uninspired American college student whose life is transformed when he is chosen to accompany an eccentric entrepreneur on a long, freewheeling journey across Asia. Author Jeffrey Eugenides says Lee's book describes the enticements, mirages, pleasures and catastrophes that attend not only the pursuit of wealth but the pursuit of happiness in all its forms.\n\nA Bright Ray of Darkness, by Ethan Hawke (February)\n\nOne of Hollywood's most literate actors, Hawke is no dilettante when it comes to writing fiction. This novel , his first in almost 20 years, is about a self-destructive young actor making his Broadway debut in Henry IV as his marriage is falling apart. No doubt any similarities between the book and Hawke's own life -- he debuted on Broadway at 21 and endured a messy divorce from actress Uma Thurman -- are coincidental.\n\nOf Women and Salt, by Gabriela Garcia (March)\n\nThis buzzy debut novel by the daughter of immigrants from Mexico and Cuba is a layered saga about three generations of Latinas. It's the story of a troubled Miami woman who travels to Cuba to see her grandmother and grapple with secrets from her family's past. Writer Roxane Gay says Garcia captures the lives of Cuban women in a world to which they refuse to surrender and she does so with precision and generosity and beauty.\n\nLater, by Stephen King (March)\n\nA Stephen King thriller rarely disappoints, and this one , his third entry in the retro Hard Case Crime series, revisits one of his recurring themes: tormented adolescents facing off against evil.

' Just As I Am ' is my truth ... plain and unvarnished, she writes. And here in my ninth decade, I am a woman who, at long last, has something meaningful to say.\n\nA Shot in the Moonlight: How a Freed Slave and a Confederate Soldier Fought for Justice in the Jim Crow South, by Ben Montgomery (January)\n\nOne night in 1897, a mob of armed White men surrounded the Kentucky home of George Dinning, a freed slave who was wrongfully accused of stealing livestock. Dinning fired back in self-defense, killing one of the men. We've all read enough history to know how such stories end, but this one takes a remarkable turn: With the help of a Confederate soldier-turned-lawyer, Dinning triumphs in court, becoming the first Black man in America to win damages after a wrongful murder conviction. Pulitzer-winner Colson Whitehead, author of The Underground Railroad, has praised Montgomery's book as inspiring and terrifying in its timelessness.\n\nHow to Avoid a Climate Disaster, by Bill Gates (February)\n\nGates has been lobbying publicly for years about the need for drastic action on climate change, and now he's collected his ideas into a book .

The book includes reminiscences from hundreds of Nichols' famous collaborators, including Elaine May, Meryl Streep, Robert Redford, Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.\n\nWomen in White Coats: How the First Women Doctors Changed the World of Medicine, by Olivia Campbell (March)
(CNN) —\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Rep. Tulsi Gabbard issued a video apology to the LGBTQ community on Thursday, after a CNN report revealing that in the early 2000s she had touted working for her father's anti-gay organization.\n\nIn my past, I said and believed things that were wrong, and worse, they were very hurtful to people in the LGBTQ community and to their loved ones, said Gabbard, a Hawaii Democrat.\n\nShe continued, Many years ago, I apologized for my words and more importantly for the negative impact that they had. I sincerely repeat my apology today. I'm deeply sorry for having said them. My views have changed significantly since then.\n\nCNN's KFile reported earlier this week that Gabbard had told the Honolulu Star-Bulletin in 2002, Working with my father, Mike Gabbard, and others to pass a constitutional amendment to protect traditional marriage, I learned that real leaders are willing to make personal sacrifices for the common good. I will bring that attitude of public service to the Legislature.\n\nGabbard's father ran The Alliance for Traditional Marriage, a political action committee aimed at opposing pro-gay lawmakers and legislation that organized and spent more than $100,000 to pass an amendment in 1998 that gave the Hawaii state Legislature the power to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples. The amendment to the state's constitution passed.\n\nFollowing the report, Gabbard issued a statement to CNN saying, First, let me say I regret the positions I took in the past, and the things I said. I'm grateful for those in the LGBTQ+ community who have shared their aloha with me throughout my personal journey.\n\nShe added, Over the past six years in Congress, I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to help work toward passing legislation that ensures equal rights and protections on LGBTQ+ issues, such as the Equality Act, the repeal of DOMA, Restore Honor to Service Members Act, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, the Safe Schools Improvement Act and the Equality for All Resolution. Much work remains to ensure equality and civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ Americans and if elected President, I will continue to fight for equal rights for all.\n\nCNN's Andrew Kaczynski contributed to this report.
Del Rio, Texas (CNN) Azeneth Perry traced the sign of the cross on her body as she watched the ambulance drive away.\n\nHer husband, Paul, felt fine the day before, but he woke up with pain in his legs January 25. Later that morning, she dropped him off at the hospital in Del Rio, Texas. She got a call within a few hours saying he had tested positive for Covid-19 and was being transferred for specialized treatment in San Antonio, nearly three hours away.\n\nAzeneth raced to the hospital and said goodbye while her husband was loaded into an ambulance for transfer. With tears welling up behind her face shield, she told him she loved him and begged him to keep breathing.\n\nShell-shocked, Azeneth stood in disbelief at the speed of what had just happened.\n\nIt might be the last time I see him, she said, still standing in the hospital parking lot.\n\nTransfers to San Antonio are crucial for the Val Verde Regional Medical Center in Del Rio, a quiet town of about 36,000 near the Texas-Mexico border. The small hospital already has two Covid wings, but when it reaches capacity -- or when patients need more specialized treatment, like a pulmonologist -- they're shipped out to a bigger city with more resources.\n\nJust down the street from the hospital, four ambulances sit ready at the edge of a hotel parking lot, standing by for the moment a bed opens up somewhere else. They're part of a five-vehicle team that transfers patients from Del Rio and Eagle Pass, another small town nearby.\n\nHealth systems face being overwhelmed\n\nAs Covid-19 cases exploded along this stretch of the border over the past couple of months, the transfers became a daily reality in the fight to keep health systems from becoming overwhelmed.\n\nFarther south along the border, in Laredo, Texas, hospitals are also struggling to keep up with the post-holiday spike in infections. The state set up medical tents and surged resources to treat the flow of patients.\n\nDr. Ricardo Cigarroa, a renowned cardiologist in Laredo, said fatigue over Covid-19 restrictions became a deadly factor in this part of Texas.\n\nWe have a sniper here that has killed 600 people and is on track to kill another thousand before this year is up -- and we don't fear it? I guarantee you if it was a sniper with a rifle, there wouldn't be one parent letting their child out, he said, referring to the 675 Covid-19 related deaths in Laredo as of Thursday.\n\nHospitalizations reached record highs in Texas over the past month, with more than 14,200 patients hospitalized during a mid-January peak. The South Texas area is now among the worst-hit regions in the country -- a sliver of dark red on CNN's county-by-county map of cases and deaths.\n\nCigarroa opens his cardiology clinic every day from 6 p.m. to midnight for coronavirus patients who don't need hospitalization but do need a doctor. On a Tuesday night in late January, his lobby had 25 patients waiting to see him. More were coming later that night.\n\nDubbed the Dr. Fauci of South Texas by Texas Monthly magazine, Cigarroa has been a prominent voice on the dire situation in Laredo for months. He routinely advocates for tougher restrictions.\n\nIf you were to take a survey, 80% of Laredo would say we have to shut this down, he said. Every family has had a death.\n\n'It hit us like a train'\n\nBack in Del Rio, nurses and doctors say the recent wave feels like a case of post-traumatic stress disorder following last summer's devastating crush of cases and deaths in their small community.\n\nIt hit us like a train, said Dr. Aurelio Laing, a physician and president of the board at Val Verde Regional Medical Center. We got through it. We lost a lot of friends. We lost employees. We lost family members.\n\nDr. Aurelio Laing and intensive care unit coordinator Leila Cervantez check each other's personal protective equipment before going into the Covid-19 ICU.\n\nAt the time, military medical personnel were brought in to assist with the surge of hospitalizations. The state still provides medical staff, but Laing said the doctors and nurses feel better equipped this time around to treat patients.\n\nStill, the dying doesn't get easier.\n\nIt's just emotional fatigue, said Laing. It's the loss of life. It's not our normal.\n\nThis is cutting people's lives short. These are people who aren't ready to go, he continued. Knowing you're going to put someone on a ventilator, and you're probably the last person they're going to see, that's a real tough one.\n\nThe lives lost\n\nAmong those lost: one of the hospital's most beloved employees, Irma Santellanes, a unit secretary who worked at the Val Verde center for 43 years. She was diagnosed on a Tuesday in July and died two days later. She was 62.\n\nMida Santellanes poses with her mother, Irma Santellanes, on Mother's Day in 2019. They worked at the same hospital in Del Rio, Texas, before Irma Santellanes died from Covid-19 on July 16, 2020.\n\nMida Santellanes, Irma's daughter, is a nurse at the hospital and proudly carries her mother's photo on her badge, a practice adopted by many of the doctors and nurses on staff. Mida was working at the hospital the night before her mother died and got to see her one last time -- an in-person goodbye so rare amid the pandemic.\n\nI gave her a hug, and I kissed her forehead with my mask and my suit on. I didn't know that would be the last time I saw her, she said, growing emotional. But I will always cherish that.\n\nWithin a few weeks, Mida Santellanes, who contracted Covid-19 around the same time as her mother's death, was back at work in the hospital and battling the summer surge of patients. She feared she would relive tragedy once again in January when her brother tested positive and required hospitalization for five days.\n\nBut he survived, sparing her family another loss.\n\nMida Santellanes wears a photo of her mother on her badge, a practice adopted by many other staff.\n\nIn Del Rio, at least 179 people have died from Covid-19 -- a startling number for such a small and relatively isolated community.\n\nWe know everybody, said Laing, who grew up here. So when you bring in that one person, it's so-and-so's grandmother. It's so-and-so's mother.\n\nHospital capacity the top concern\n\nThe biggest concern for doctors and nurses is whether there's enough space in the larger cities if the Val Verde Regional Medical Center needs to transfer someone.\n\nSometimes it can take days for a bed to open up in San Antonio, which admits patients from rural areas across southwest Texas.\n\nOn January 25, six of the seven Covid-19 intensive care unit beds at the Val Verde center -- and 12 of 18 beds in its less-critical-care Covid-19 unit -- were occupied by coronavirus patients, amounting to 50% of the hospital's total beds.\n\nOne patient in the ICU had been on a ventilator for two days, and the medical team was relieved when they got the call that a bed opened up in San Antonio. They began preparing for the transfer immediately.\n\nThe patient died a few days later.\n\nThe fast-changing status of their charges is a roller-coaster ride of emotions for the medical staff, who not only bond with their patients but routinely provide updates to family members not allowed inside.\n\nNurse Lana Sanchez said that when her patients die, she holds their hands, prays for them and plays their favorite music. It's not normal to see so much death, she said. And I don't want it to be normal for anyone.\n\n'We are going to get out of here'\n\nJose Limón, a baseball coach who's been in the Val Verde ICU for nearly three weeks, likes to peer out over his breathing mask and scroll through photos on his phone of his three children and six grandchildren.\n\nJose Limón was in the hospital for nearly three weeks with Covid-19. He was determined to get out to see his wife, three children and six grandchildren.\n\nLast week, he teared up during an interview while talking about his wife. They've never spent this much time apart in their 44 years of marriage.\n\nDubbed a fan favorite by the hospital staff, Limón was fighting for his life. We're going to get out of here, he said, looking up at his nurse, Sanchez. We're going to do it. We're going to make it.\n\nA little over a week later, Limón was wheeled out of the hospital doors to greet his beloved family.\n\nJose Limón is reunited with his family after being hospitalized with Covid-19.\n\nOver the past week, the numbers at the hospital have improved. As of Thursday, two patients were in the Covid ICU and six in the less-critical-care unit, according to hospital officials.\n\nIt's perhaps a sign of hope that this community could be over the hump from the most recent surge, but the medical staff know all too well that things can change -- quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, Azeneth Perry, who watched her husband leave in an ambulance, is feeling fortunate. Her husband, Paul, was released from the hospital in San Antonio four days later, and they're now at home together in Del Rio. She also has Covid-19.\n\nPerry said although her husband survived, she's keeping a close eye on him. He's weak and disoriented, and she has seen one too many family members and friends succumb to the virus lately.\n\nIt's spreading like wildfire, she said. This is real life.
(CNN) Christopher Plummer, the elegantly voiced, Oscar-winning actor perhaps most fondly remembered for The Sound of Music, died Friday at his home in Connecticut, his manager said in a statement. He was 91.\n\nChris was an extraordinary man who deeply loved and respected his profession with great old fashion manners, self deprecating humor and the music of words, his longtime friend and manager Lou Pitt said in his statement to CNN. He was a National Treasure who deeply relished his Canadian roots. Through his art and humanity, he touched all of our hearts and his legendary life will endure for all generations to come.\n\nIn addition to co-starring as Captain Von Trapp in the 1965 musical opposite Julie Andrews, Plummer won a supporting actor Academy Award for his role in the 2010 film Beginners, and was nominated again as recently as 2018 for All the Money in the World, in which he replaced Kevin Spacey as billionaire J. Paul Getty, after the younger actor was engulfed by scandal.\n\nPlummer stayed remarkably busy well into his 80s, co-starring in the 2019 hit murder-mystery Knives Out. Other memorable roles included portraying newsman Mike Wallace in The Insider, a Klingon general in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country and the voice of the villain in the Pixar animated movie Up.\n\nPlummer also played Rudyard Kipling in the Michael Caine-Sean Connery classic The Man Who Would Be King and Sherlock Holmes -- on the trail of Jack the Ripper -- in the 1979 movie Murder by Decree.\n\nRead More

The candidates will lay out strategies for the 2018 midterm elections, rebuilding the Democratic Party and the DNC's role under the Trump administration.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nPete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old openly gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who served in the Navy during the war in Afghanistan, announced on Wednesday that he is launching an exploratory committee for a 2020 presidential bid.\n\nButtigieg made the announcement in an email to supporters and in a video posted online where he lays out his message of generational change centered on three values: Freedom, security and democracy. In that video, Buttigieg leans into how he took over South Bend when he was 29 years old and claims he turned around what had been referred to as a dying city.\n\nThere's a new generation of voices emerging in our country, walking away from the politics of the past and ready to deliver on our priorities. There is no 'again' in the real world; that's not a bad thing, Buttigieg says in the video. We are ready for a fresh start.\n\nButtigieg's 2020 argument is that he would like to do the same for the country that he did for South Bend, even if he knows the odds are against him, and that the only way to accomplish change like that is through a generational shift in American politics.\n\nWhat will America look like in 2054, when I reach the age of the current president, he asked in his email to supporters. How will we look back on 2020?\n\nButtigieg, who most recently ran for chair of the Democratic National Committee after the 2016 election, has been exploring a presidential bid for over a year, moving closer with a trip to Iowa in December where he was well received by an audience of progressives in Des Moines.\n\nThe mayor, who has little national name recognition and could struggle to get attention in a crowded field including heavyweights like Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\n\nButtigieg followed up his announcement with a news conference in Washington where he told reporters that there has been a total realignment in the politics of this country and that his age would be a selling point in a crowded Democratic field. But he also acknowledged his long odds.\n\nWe are not going to be the most established, we are not going to be the most well-funded, I am obviously not stepping onto this stage as the most famous person in this conversation, he said. But I belong to a party whose characteristic has always been to look for fresh voices, new leadership and big ideas, and I think that is what 2020 is going to be about.\n\nIn an interview with CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Buttigieg said, if you are planning to be here for decades, you just look at the world a little bit differently than older candidates.\n\nI think when you run at this age, your face is your message in a lot of ways, he said. And part of what we are looking at is the idea that it's time for a new generation in American leadership.\n\nButtigieg was born and raised in South Bend and went on to attend Harvard College and later became a Rhodes scholar. After a three-year stint at the consulting firm McKinsey and Company, Buttigieg came back to Indiana and lost a race for state treasurer in 2010. The race helped him with his name recognition in the state, however, and he successfully won his first term as mayor of South Bend in 2011. Buttigieg was first deployed to Afghanistan two years later in 2013.\n\nAnother issue for the mayor's bid is how to pronounce his last name, something that has become a bit of a running joke between he and his husband, Chasten, who tweeted a list of possible pronunciations in 2018 that included boot-edge-edge, buddha-judge and boot-a-judge.\n\nOptions:\n\n\n\nboot-edge-edge\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n\nBuddha-judge\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n\nBoot-a-judge\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n\nBoo-tuh-judge — Chasten Glezman Buttigieg (@Chasten) December 17, 2018\n\n(Buttigieg's name is Maltese and roughly translates to lord of the poultry. He told reporters that people in South Bend call him Mayor Pete and that is fine with me.)\n\nButtigieg, who came out in 2015, will also be the first openly LGBTQ elected official to run for President, according to the LGBTQ Victory Fund.\n\nIn an interview with CNN in December, Buttigieg wondered if his sexuality would be an issue for more conservative Democrats.\n\nThe only way to know is to get out there, he said. I will say I got re-elected with 80% of the vote after I had come out while Mike Pence was governor of Indiana. I don't think these things decide your fate.\n\nBut the party has shifted dramatically on same-sex marriage over the last decade, with a Gallup poll in 2018 finding that 83% of Democrats support it.\n\nAnnise Parker, the openly gay former mayor of Houston and President of LGBTQ Victory Fund, called Buttigieg's announcement a historic and powerful moment for the LGBTQ community and the entire country.\n\nIn such a wide-open presidential race, Mayor Buttigieg would be a welcome contribution to the marketplace of ideas that will determine where our nation is headed in 2020 and beyond, she said. And while he is not running on his sexual orientation, his presence will undoubtedly elevate LGBTQ issues in the Democratic primary.\n\nAnd after his speech in Iowa in December, a number of attendees commented that they appreciated that he embraced who he was and made it part of his broader story.\n\nI like that Mayor Pete guy, one woman standing near the elevator was overheard by CNN. He's gay and going places.\n\nButtigieg told reporters his sexuality was a fact of life and that the race was not just about profile, but he was mindful of the fact that this just might make it a little easier for the next person who comes along.\n\nOne of the things that every person should think about in the run-up to 2020, especially because there are so many people, is that it is not only the outcome, but it is the conduct of campaigns that will make an impact on political life in our country, he said when asked about some of the response to the historic nature of his candidacy. The world is changing, but it is not changing on its own. So, if by bringing forward good ideas I can be part of chipping away at that, that is one more reason to give this a look.\n\nRepublicans quickly blasted Buttigieg's announcement, suggesting his leadership of South Bend does not merit a presidential run.\n\nBefore Buttigieg wastes time on a presidential campaign, he should focus on his town's sea of potholes and sky-high crime rate, said Michael Ahrens, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. His bid isn't just bad news for residents, it's more proof that Democrats are about to endure the most crowded, divisive, and contentious primary in history.\n\nButtigieg's first book, Shortest Way Home, will come out in March and will serve as an explanation for his longshot 2020 bid. The subtitle of the book is One mayor's challenge and a model for America's future, and the youthful-looking Buttigieg is on the cover rolling up his sleeves.\n\nButtigieg told CNN last year that despite his long odds, he felt like he had to give running for president a shot.\n\nA field that is spread very thin probably works to the advantage of a newcomer if you are very good at it, he said with a smile. The only way to find out is to be tested in the field.\n\nThis story has been updated.
Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel and his wife, Lis Cuesta, vote in the referendum for the new Cuban constitution in Havana on February 24.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nCubans have overwhelmingly voted to approve a new constitution that enshrines the one-party system and ushers in a series of economic and social changes, according to government officials.\n\nAlmost 87% of the 7.8 million people who participated in the historic referendum on Sunday voted to ratify the new constitution, according to preliminary results.\n\nMore than 700,000 Cubans – or 9% of those who voted – marked their ballot against the constitution, a rare sign of widespread dissent on the communist-run island. Cuban officials heavily pushed voters to approve the constitution and censured or stifled public campaigning against the referendum. Just over 4% of the ballots were left blank or were invalid, officials said at a news conference in Havana on Monday.\n\nAuthorities said the results would be official once the final count is done.\n\nThe updated constitution was crafted with the input of ordinary Cubans, through thousands of meetings between government officials and citizens to suggest modifications to the constitution.\n\nThe new document replaces the 1976 Soviet-era charter enacted under Fidel Castro. It protects private property and foreign investment, and for the first time places two five-year terms on the office of the presidency.\n\nHowever, following a backlash by conservative religious groups, the government backed off from language that would have legalized same-sex marriage in the constitution.\n\nA matter of patriotism\n\nThe referendum was widely seen as a vote on whether or not socialism had a future in Cuba.\n\nEarlier this week, US President Donald Trump claimed that socialism is dying and described Cuba as a captive nation. But Cuban officials framed voting yes to the constitution as a matter of patriotism.\n\nAcross the island, government supporters placed signs on buildings, doorways and school buses urging people to vote for the constitution. There were few – if any – public displays supporting a no vote. Dissident complained they had been blocked from campaigning against the constitution.\n\nIn one government-produced video released on social media ahead of the vote, former Cuban spy and onetime US prisoner Gerardo Hernandez raises the stakes.\n\nI will vote 'yes' because there are two groups, the 'yes' and the 'no', he said. The ones calling us to vote 'no' are the traitorous enemies of Cuba.\n\nOn his official Twitter account, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said a yes vote was a mobilization for peace and against imperial intervention in Latin America.\n\nUnder the new constitution, the Communist party is still the only political party allowed in Cuba, and it remains the guiding force for all government policy.\n\nCNN's Patrick Oppmann in Havana and Jaide Garcia in Atlanta contributed reporting.

Similarly, neither Mr. Perkins nor the Company has any affiliation whatsoever with Rihanna.\n\nThe pair launched Fenty Entertainment, a production and talent company, in 2017.\n\nRihanna's popular Fenty Beauty line of cosmetics also launched in 2017. She has a lingerie product line as well.\n\nThe suit states that Fenty and Perkins have repeatedly been asked to stop misrepresenting themselves and to cease and desist all activity and efforts to exploit Rihanna's name and the goodwill associated with the Fenty brand.\n\nThe pair unsuccessfully attempted to register the Fenty name for a line of resort hotels, according to the suit.\n\nRihanna also alleges that Fenty and Perkins negotiated an unauthorized deal for her to perform 15 shows in Latin America for $15 million, and two 15-minute sets at Calibash at Staples Center and T-Mobile Arena for $400,000.\n\nThe singer is seeking to stop the pair from using her name or the Fenty brand, as well as damages and attorney's fees.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Rihanna talked about her complicated relationship with her father, who, she said, had a tumultuous marriage with her mother.\n\nHe taught me everything, Rihanna told Winfrey. As awful as he was to my mom at times, it didn't compare to how great he was as a father.\n\nCNN has reached out to Rihanna, Fenty and Perkins for comment.
New York (CNN Business) When the government releases its monthly jobs report on Friday, a history-making methodology change will be lurking in the footnotes.\n\nFor the first time ever, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will include same-sex couples in its count of married workers in the US economy.\n\nPreviously, categories tracking marital status only included people in heterosexual marriages.\n\nThat methodology change, which will be indicated in footnotes on Tables A-9 and A-10 , marks an incremental milestone for the LGBTQ community, which has pushed to be recognized in official government statistics.\n\nThe change will not impact the top-line jobs report numbers but rather only a few categories in the underlying statistical tables. Economists expect the report to show US employers added 160,000 jobs and the unemployment rate remained at 3.5% in January.\n\nStill, the new method is indicative of a bigger change underway at the government's statistical agencies. This year, the 2020 Census will change its questionnaire to include same-sex husband/wife/spouse and same-sex unmarried partner. The same married and unmarried options will exist for opposite-sex couples with the hope that more specific categories will decrease the room for error when people accidentally tick the wrong box.\n\nDuring the 2010 Census, when same-sex marriage wasn't yet legalized federally, the questionnaire didn't make a distinction between same-sex and opposite-sex marriages.\n\nThe methodology changes are a big step forward for the LGBTQ community in part because government statistics inform policymakers' decisions and actions.\n\nWe're very excited about the new data from the BLS and the Census, said Meghan Maury, policy director at the National LGBTQ Task Force. Maury has also served on a Census advisory committee since 2014, advocating for more data on the LGBTQ community. That data can help LGBTQ people build political power and get access to more services, she added.\n\nWe know that LGBTQ folks are more likely to be living in poverty , she said, adding that's why including the community in labor market data is so important.\n\nStill, much work remains to be done, Maury said.\n\nEven though the inclusion of same-sex married couples is a meaningful change in the government's monthly jobs reports, they won't get their own category. They'll be lumped in with heterosexual couples in the same category tracking workers by marital status. The jobs reports will not separately break out unemployment rates and other labor market statistics for LGBTQ people.\n\nWe're still missing so much of that community, Maury said. The real next step is to collect data on gender and sexual orientation in all surveys.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe Lifetime docuseries Surviving R. Kelly sparked renewed interest in allegations of sexual misconduct by the singer.\n\nBut the accusations of abuse, manipulation and inappropriate encounters with girls and young women have been around – and vehemently denied – by Kelly for decades.\n\nJanuary 1992\n\nKelly's debut album, Born into the 90's, is released a year after he signs a deal with Jive Records. It features his group Public Announcement and includes hit singles Honey Love, Slow Dance (Hey Mr. DJ) and She's Got That Vibe. Fans will later note that one of the lyrics on the latter says, Little cute Aaliyah's got it.\n\nNovember 1993\n\nKelly releases his solo album 12 Play. Songs such as Bump n' Grind and Your Body's Callin'  firmly cement his image as an artist specializing in sexual lyrics.\n\nAugust 1994\n\nThe 27-year-old singer reportedly marries his 15-year-old protégé, Aaliyah Haughton. Kelly is the lead songwriter and producer on her debut album, Age Ain't Nothing But a Number.\n\nVibe magazine later publishes a copy of what they report is the couple's marriage license, listing Haughton's age as 18.\n\n20 years ago, Vibe prints marriage certificate of Aaliyah & R.

The song becomes one of the singer's biggest hits.\n\nDecember 2000\n\nJim Derogatis and Abdon M. Pallasch publish their first report in the Chicago Sun-Times on allegations of Kelly having sexual relationships with girls as young as 15.\n\nThe article outlines the Hawkins suit as well as Kelly's marriage to Haughton.\n\nAccording to the story, Chicago police had twice investigated allegations that Kelly was having sex with an underage girl but dropped the investigations because the girl would not cooperate.\n\nA representative for Kelly declines to comment.\n\nJanuary 2001\n\nDerogatis anonymously receives a videotape that appears to show Kelly having sex with a young woman, he later reports in the Sun-Times.\n\nOut of concern that the person on the tape may be underage, it is turned over to Chicago police.\n\nAugust 2001\n\nTracy Sampson, an aspiring rapper and former intern at Epic Records, files a lawsuit against Kelly, claiming he initiated a sexual relationship with her when she was 17.\n\nThe case is settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.\n\nFebruary 2002\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times reports police are investigating Kelly after another sex tape is sent anonymously.\n\nThe girl in the video, now 17, was identified by her aunt, who said that her niece would have been 14 at the time the tape was made, based on her appearance, the paper reported. Kelly can also be heard on the tape referring to the girl by her first name.\n\nKelly denies the allegations.\n\nIt's not true. All I know is this: I have a few people in the past that I've fired … people that I've thought were my friends that's not my friends, he tells WMAQ Channel 5 at the time. It's crap, and that's how we're going to treat it.\n\nMarch 2002\n\nBootleg copies of the R. Kelly sex tape are sold on the streets, according to multiple news reports.\n\nApril 2002\n\nThe singer is sued by Patrice Jones, who alleges she was 16 when she began a sexual relationship with Kelly.\n\nShe also accuses Kelly of pressuring her into terminating a pregnancy that resulted from their alleged encounters.\n\nKelly's attorney, Gerry Margolis, calls the suit a collection of half-truths, distortions and outright lies.\n\nThe case is settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.\n\nMay 2002\n\nDancer Montina Tina Woods, 33, sues Kelly after she alleges he secretly taped their sexual encounter and the tape was being sold.\n\nRepresentatives for Kelly call the suit ridiculous and nonsensical. The case is later settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.\n\nJune 2002\n\nKelly is indicted on 21 charges related to child pornography resulting from the second anonymously sent videotape of him appearing to have sex with a young girl.\n\nThe singer is arrested at his Florida vacation home.\n\nKelly maintains his innocence and is released on bail.\n\nSeptember 2005\n\nKelly's wife files for an order of protection.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThis week, on Martin Luther King Day, Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris announced that she will run for president in 2020. Almost immediately, headlines appeared declaring her the female Barack Obama. Like many other prominent women, she is – wrongly and inaccurately to boot – best known as a derivative of a more-famous predecessor.\n\nPHOTO: Holly Thomas Holly Thomas\n\nThere are similarities between Harris and Obama, to be sure. Both are Democrats, both have a background in law, both have a mixed-race background. There is an obvious convenience to the comparison. It neatly captures the public imagination at a time when Harris is yet to be world famous, but is charismatic, on the rise and prepared to challenge President Donald Trump, while Obama's name continues to conjure a nostalgic, anti-Trump emotion.\n\nIt makes superficial sense. But it's also symptomatic of a lazy habit that infantilizes high-profile women in America and abroad, and skims over the personal details and unique circumstances that shaped them.\n\nKamala Harris is the first Indian-American woman to have a seat in the US Senate. She was also the first woman, black, Indian-American or South Asian, to serve as district attorney of San Francisco, and as California's attorney general. The most famous instance of public sexism she faced before announcing her presidential bid occurred in 2013, when none other than Barack Obama called her the best-looking attorney general. Obama later apologized to Harris after the remark was widely criticized (rightly) as sexist.\n\nThe two are very different political beings. Obama, with some liberal moves such as reduced sentences for drug offenses aside, did not make prison reform a priority, and was against mass incarceration. But the prison system is a subject close to Harris' heart.\n\nDespite personal reservations, she promised to defend the death penalty in California as attorney general, and proved herself an often harsh prosecutor, favoring long periods of imprisonment. In other areas, Harris has positioned herself further to the left than the former President. Those only aware of her overlap with Obama might make assumptions about her attitudes elsewhere, which would turn out to be untrue.\n\nHarris is far from the only female politician to receive this media treatment – and that treatment isn't always limited to comparisons to more famous men (though admittedly that's overwhelmingly the case when it comes to world leaders).\n\nTake Theresa May. Coverage of the British Prime Minister is regularly peppered with references to Margaret Thatcher. Throughout her negotiations over the Brexit deal in Brussels, Belgium, in December, newspapers referred to May's handbag-wielding Maggie moments – Thatcher's handbag being the mythical weapon with which she would supposedly clobber her opposition.\n\nConsidering Margaret Thatcher was in favor of Europe, fought for Britain's interests within the EU, and for Britain to strengthen its position as a member of the EU, this likeness is especially ironic.\n\nTheresa May's Brexit strategy has been to make determined noises while championing a cause – leaving the EU – she campaigned and voted against, and she consistently makes zero productive headway with it. Her predecessor David Cameron's negotiation of the ultimately null EU reform deal in 2016 was far more Thatcheresque in its intention and execution (even if the referendum he called subsequently was not). Coverage of his doings, however, didn't call him Maggie – or indeed, refer to other male PMs who went before him. When he acted in his own name, he was treated as such.\n\nThe fudging of political personalities can be derogatory in both directions, depending on individual sympathies. When Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer succeeded Angela Merkel as leader of Germany's Christian Democratic Union last year, she noted the commentary describing her as a mini Merkel, or Merkel 2.0.\n\nI have read a lot about what I am and who I am, she told her party. Mini, a copy, simply 'more of the same.' Dear delegates, I stand before you as I am and as life made me, and I am proud of that.\n\nThe attention paid to Kramp-Karrenbauer's likeness to Merkel distracts from the future implications of her attitudes for the country, and indeed, Europe at large. Kramp-Karrenbauer is extremely conservative on same-sex marriage, and has likened it to incest in the past. Her stance on migration is also vastly stricter than Merkel's, and she has made it clear she is keen to dial down the more liberal attitude exhibited by the party in the last decade.\n\nWhile Merkel's political career was catalyzed by the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification, Kramp-Karrenbauer's has been forged in the wake of Merkel's. That by definition gives her an adapted frame of reference, which merits its own scrutiny.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nEvery politician – every person – is a product of their own time and place. In the coming months, it looks quite possible that Kamala Harris might win Obama's endorsement of her bid for president.\n\nIf she does, the comparisons between the two are likely to reignite. As with May and Kramp-Karrenbauer, those watching would do better to pay attention to the political landscape Harris is working within now, rather than any nostalgic connotations. The president whose footsteps are most pertinent to Harris, the president who she will be measured against should she prevail against her fellow Democratic candidates, is Donald Trump.\n\nIf she finds herself competing with him, the very least Harris deserves, the very least the voting public deserves, is to be judged as an adult in her own right, running under her own name.

Atlanta (CNN) Just before Christmas, Jessica Caraballo and her husband got the break they had long worked for.\n\nIn their three-year marriage, the 31-year-old and her husband, Shalique, have gotten job after job trying to support their children. She has driven for Uber, he embalmed bodies at an Atlanta funeral home, and she worked all night at a Walmart store.\n\nIt was just last month when things finally appeared to be falling into place. Caraballo, a Transportation Security Administration officer at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, was promoted to a full-time position and her husband got a new job selling cars.\n\nBuying a home, getting a second car and even just enrolling their three children in extracurricular activities at school would now be more than just dreams, they said.\n\nBut their joy lasted only a few days.\n\nThe partial government shutdown that began December 22 left Caraballo and 420,000 other federal workers across the country forced to work without a paycheck . Two weeks have passed and dozens of families like the Caraballos have put their lives on hold.\n\nRent is due, light bill, gas bill, my car bill is due the 26th, Caraballo said. I already got my last paycheck and there's no paycheck to come.\n\nI don't know when we would be able to celebrate birthdays, when we would be able to get ahead, she added. This is a pushback.\n\nJessica Caraballo, 31, drove for Uber and worked part-time with the Transportation Security Administration for months. She had just been promoted when the shutdown began.\n\nCalling in sick is her last option\n\nCaraballo has been fighting a cold for about a week but said she can't afford to miss a day of work -- even if she is not sure when she will get paid.\n\nFriday afternoon, hours before she had to report to work, the family drove 45 minutes from their rental home in Forest Park, near the airport, to her parents' home in Griffin. Caraballo's parents would take care of her three kids -- Danyelle, 10, Daellah, 7, and 5-year-old DaMara -- while she and her husband went to work.\n\nI know that I have a partner, but he cannot do everything by himself. It takes two people in a household to keep it afloat, she said, coughing at times outside her parents' home.\n\nCaraballo has accumulated paid sick time for months but is not allowed to take it during the shutdown. Instead, employees are offered leave without pay, she said.\n\nI'm going to keep going to work until they issue me a paycheck, she said. One thing I know is that I can't afford to not go to work and then have them let me go.\n\nHer sense of duty keeps her motivated\n\nWhen Caraballo gets out of bed at 3 a.m. and puts on her royal blue TSA shirt and black pants, the first thing that comes to mind, she said, are others: her family and the thousands of travelers she sees every day.\n\nRegardless of if you pay me or not, I'm doing my job because it's not about Trump. It's about the people who are flying on this airplane, she said.\n\nCaraballo's husband, Shalique, drives her to work around 3:30 a.m. five days a week because they only have one car.\n\nHer job, she said, is making sure travelers make it safely from Atlanta to whatever their destination may be.\n\nI would feel some type of way if you got in a plane and because (of) some lax ... security your plane goes down, Caraballo says. It would weigh heavy on me if something was to happen to you when my job is to secure your flight.\n\nCaraballo began working for TSA last May, following the steps of her brother, who is also a TSA officer at the Atlanta airport. At first, she saw her job merely as a stepping stone before trying to join the Navy this year -- but she said she quickly realized it's something she enjoys.\n\nWith this job, I do not have to fight myself to get up, she said. I like going to work no matter how early it is. Of course, I would love to get paid rather than to be like this, but I do love my job.\n\nShe feels disrespected\n\nSome 55,000 TSA employees screen around 800 million passengers a year. In a typical work shift -- which lasts between five and 10 hours -- they rotate every 30 minutes among tasks that include checking boarding passes, directing travelers to take off their shoes and screening them.\n\nSince the shutdown, Caraballo's brother, James Miller, said he's been asked to work double shifts because of staffing shortages.\n\nFirst thing on my mind was, 'No, don't do it,' but I understand that although we are in shutdown, its not the agency's fault, so I didn't want them to be saddled, he said.\n\nWorking for TSA is a family affair. Caraballo's brother, James Miller, also works for the agency at the Atlanta airport.\n\nBoth Miller and Caraballo said they feel disrespected by politicians in Washington and can sense an extremely low morale among their colleagues.\n\nYet they try to leave that sentiment outside the screening lines, especially when travelers acknowledge their struggle.\n\nMost of the people I've dealt with are very appreciative of us being there and said they are hoping and are praying for a quick resolution, Miller said.\n\nIt gives me hope that everybody is not only concerned about themselves. It just makes me feel like we are heading in a better direction.\n\nHer family lives paycheck to paycheck\n\nAs the Caraballos brace for the coming days or even weeks before the shutdown ends , they know their options are slim.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management's sample letters for employees to send to their creditors and mortgage companies during the shutdown, they said, are out of the question.\n\nI just don't see how that is going to stand, Caraballo said. A piece of paper isn't going to cut it. I know it wouldn't cut it for me (if I were a landlord).\n\nWhen asked whether they are thinking about using their savings, Caraballo and her husband just started laughing.\n\nWe live paycheck to paycheck right now, just trying to get ahead, Caraballo said.\n\nLike the Caraballos, about 78% of Americans who work full time live paycheck to paycheck, according to a study conducted by Harris Poll.\n\nWhile Shalique Caraballo remains positive and falls back on his faith, the couple said they'll really begin to worry if next week's check doesn't come.\n\nGovernment shutdown or not, we still gotta live, we still gotta move forward, Shalique Caraballo said. I would work day and night if I have to.
Mayor defends same-sex marriages\n\nSan Francisco will resume issuing licenses Monday\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom said Sunday he is willing to sacrifice his political career over his belief that denying gay men and lesbians the right to marry is wrong and inconsistent with the values this country holds dear.\n\nI think we're on firm legal footing and legal grounds, and certainly I believe very strongly and passionately we're on the right moral ground, Newsom said on CNN's Late Edition.\n\nNewsom unleashed a political and legal tempest February 12 when he ordered the city clerk to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\nNearly 3,200 same-sex couples have gotten licenses in a nine-day frenzy that included thousands of family, friends and soon-to-be betrothed couples ringing City Hall, sometimes for days.\n\nNewsom halted the practice Friday but will allow the clerk to resume issuing licenses Monday morning by appointment only.\n\nI will not abdicate and step back and say what we were doing 10, 15 days ago -- before this action -- is appropriate, Newsom said. I do not believe it's appropriate for me, as mayor of San Francisco, to discriminate against people.\n\nAnd if that means my political career ends, so be it.\n\nA judge denied a request by conservative groups Friday to issue a temporary restraining order against the city, ruling the groups had failed to prove the actions caused irreparable harm. It was the second time last week that an injunction on a lawsuit was denied. (Full story)\n\nThe city filed its own lawsuit Thursday, charging a state law that defines marriage as being between one man and one woman violates the California Constitution. (Full story)\n\nThe two suits against the city and the city's suit against the state have been combined and are scheduled for trial next month.\n\nNewsom said he believes that the equal-protection clauses of the state's constitution trump the state law.\n\nI took an oath of office to bear truth, faith and allegiance to the constitution of the state of California, and there is nothing in that constitution that says that I have the right to discriminate against people on any basis, he said. And I simply won't do that.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger urged Newsom to obey the law.\n\nI've talked to the mayor, Schwarzenegger said on NBC's Meet the Press. He's a reasonable guy, he's a terrific mayor, but we just disagree on that particular thing.\n\nSchwarzenegger said Friday he had asked Attorney General Bill Lockyer to resolve the issues underlying San Francisco's lawsuit against the state.\n\nSchwarzenegger told NBC that though he was very much against same-sex marriage, he believes very strongly in domestic partnership rights.\n\nNewsom said that such provisions, which would provide the same benefits to same-sex couples that marriage provides to male-female couples, amount to a separate-but-unequal status.\n\nSome opponents have argued that allowing same-sex marriage would lead to a lessening of taboos against illegal drug use, prostitution, polygamy and incest.\n\nNewsom dismissed that argument as stale rhetoric. Divisive rhetoric. Absurd.\n\nThat's exactly the same kind of rhetoric that was used against blacks marrying whites in the 1960s, he said.\n\nIt's the same kind of rhetoric used when they made comments about Catholics being able to marry Protestants at the turn of the century.\n\nIf people had the opportunity, as I have, to witness these kinds of bonds, to witness these kinds of unions, to see life and marriage affirmed, to see children weeping because finally their parents have the same kind of rights that are extended to my relationship with my wife -- it is real, it's tangible now, he said.\n\nNewsom, 36, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, a CNN legal contributor and San Francisco assistant district attorney on leave, were married in 2001.\n\nNewsom bristled at the suggestion by Democratic U.S. Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who is gay, that San Francisco's action was simply a symbolic point that diverted attention from the real struggle for gay rights.\n\nI have great respect for Barney Frank, the mayor said. I don't think it's symbolic to Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, a relationship of five decades. I think it's very significant for them.\n\nLyon and Martin, who in 1955 founded the Daughters of Bilitis, the first lesbian organization in the country, were the first same-sex couple to be married in San Francisco.\n\nThe mayor also rejected the idea from some supporters of gay rights that the San Francisco controversy was giving Republicans fodder for the 2004 presidential campaign.\n\nNewsom said President Bush made the subject an issue by saying in his State of the Union address that marriage should be between a man and a woman.\n\nWe're reacting to the president's decision to use this as a wedge issue to divide people. I think what he's doing is wrong. It's hurtful, Newsom said.\n\nThe mayor also said that those gays and lesbians who flocked to San Francisco's City Hall for a marriage license understand that their battle is not over.\n\nI frankly think politicians have been toying with their emotions for decades by abdicating responsibility, by saying one thing privately and saying another publicly, by ... waiting for the next state to do something, he said. You've got to stand up on principle.
Robert Hradil/Getty Images\n\nBrazilian football legend Ronaldinho has denied a report he will marry two women at the same time in August.\n\nIt's the biggest lie, he told SporTV on Thursday (h/t the Mirror's Matt Roper and Liam Prenderville).\n\nWhile polygamy is outlawed in Brazil, O Dia (h/t Dan Gartland of Sports Illustrated) reported civil unions between more than two persons is not uncommon, and that Ronaldinho, Priscilla Coelho and Beatriz Souza already live together.\n\nMirror Football shared this image of the three:\n\nO Dia (h/t Roper) claimed Ronaldinho asked for their hand in marriage in January of last year. He originally dated Coelho before meeting Souza in 2016.\n\nO Dia's report added Ronaldinho's sister will not attend the ceremony, as she does not approve of the union. Coelho's family also does not approve, with a friend telling Extra (h/t Gartland): They are upset because they discovered that every present he gives to Priscilla, he also gives to the other girl.
Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) Less than four weeks from the Iowa caucuses, former Vice President Joe Biden in many ways appears to be in a stronger position now than he was when he entered the 2020 presidential race .\n\nBiden has defied perceptions that he is a weak front-runner, retaining his strength with non-white voters and ranking consistently as the candidate likely voters believe has the best chance to defeat President Donald Trump. Predictions that his age, penchant for gaffes and lengthy record would be his undoing have not come true.\n\nNow, a confluence of events in the lead-up to the first primary votes being cast are playing to Biden's strengths.\n\nNational headlines have been dominated by the turmoil in Iraq and Iran , amplifying Biden's core message that he has the most experience on the world stage to be president.\n\nThere is a smart way to counter them, to counter Iran -- and a self-defeating way. Trump's approach in my view is demonstrably the latter, Biden said in a foreign policy speech Tuesday in New York.\n\nAnd with electability remaining at the forefront of Democratic voters' minds, Biden is racking up endorsements , including several from swing-district congressional Democrats this week.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic foes who were most eager to attack Biden have either dropped out of the race or failed to qualify for the debate stage, leaving Biden to spar with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the sorts of predictable progressive-vs.-moderate spats that are well within the comfort zones of both candidates.\n\nBiden's resilience in the Democratic race for president has again made him a target for his top competitors, setting up the potential for a heated match up at next week's debate in Iowa hosted by CNN and The Des Moines Register.\n\nIncreasingly, Biden's rivals are attempting to change voters' minds about his electability.\n\nOn CNN on Monday night, Sanders jabbed Biden for voting for the North American Free Trade Agreement and for voting to authorize the use of military force in Iraq under former President George W. Bush.\n\nYou think that's going to play well in Michigan or Wisconsin or Pennsylvania? Sanders said. If we're going to beat Trump, we need turnout. And to get turnout, you need energy and excitement. And I don't think that that kind of record is going to bring forth the energy we need to defeat Trump.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren set up a new fight with Biden when released a plan to roll back several of the provisions of the 2005 bankruptcy law that she and then-senator fought over.\n\nBiden's ultimate priority in the first half of February, in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, is survival. Those two states' Democratic electorates have more white, college-educated voters -- one of Biden's poorer-performing demographics -- than many that follow.\n\nBiden would like to win, but his campaign has been lowering expectations of a victory in the two states for months. What he needs is to advance to more diverse states in the Democratic race -- Nevada, then South Carolina, then California, Texas, southern states and more on Super Tuesday in early March -- with most of his existing support intact.\n\nPolling in Iowa has been scant in recent weeks, but a CBS News poll released over the weekend showed Biden in a three-way tie with Sanders and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. The same poll showed Biden and Sanders leading the pack in New Hampshire.\n\nIn Iowa, Biden is pressing his two biggest advantages over his Democratic rivals: His deep support from black voters, and the sense likely voters have consistently expressed to pollsters that Biden is the party's most electable candidate against Trump.\n\nOver the next week, Biden's campaign is sending a host of diverse surrogates to Iowa.\n\nThe group includes Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, California Reps. Ami Bera and Lou Correa, and Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver.\n\nThe not-so-subtle message to Iowa's largely white electorate: Do you really want to vote for candidates like Buttigieg, who have made next to no inroads with non-white voters?\n\nIn recent days, Biden has racked up endorsements from swing-district members of Congress -- freshman Democrats who won in Republican-held seats in 2018. Virginia Rep. Elaine Luria, Pennsylvania Rep. Chrissy Houlahan and Pennsylvania Rep. Conor Lamb backed him Sunday.\n\nDays earlier, Iowa Rep. Abby Finkenauer endorsed Biden, becoming the first member of the state's congressional delegation to endorse in the 2020 race. She then spent the weekend traveling the state with him, introducing him at events and urging attendees to caucus for the former vice president.\n\nDuring his recent four-day swing through Iowa, at events, voters said Biden's electability was a driving force behind their support for him.\n\nChase Lampe, a 30-year-old high school government teacher in Des Moines, spoke with Biden on the ropeline after a Saturday night event in Des Moines. Biden leaned in and grabbed both of his shoulders after Lampe thanked Biden for being first -- ahead of former President Barack Obama -- to announce his support for same-sex marriage.\n\nLampe started the 2020 campaign season expecting to back former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, then supported California Sen. Kamala Harris, and finally was interested in Buttigieg -- but said he's landed on Biden.\n\nThe closer and closer we get to it, the more and more I want to win, he said.\n\nLampe said he was thinking not just about facing Trump, but down-ticket state races.\n\nIt's important that the presidential candidate can do well here in Iowa because there's a chance we could win the Senate here in Iowa, he said.\n\nBiden's campaign has argued that, while other candidates saw spikes in support (in the case of Harris, who has dropped out) or rose and then appeared to stall (like Warren), Biden has been at or near his floor for a long time -- and that Biden would climb as voters began to see the stakes rising.\n\nI don't know if there's any of the campaign that has a coalition as diverse and broad as ours, said Ras Smith, an Iowa state representative and the Biden campaign's Iowa director of coalition-building.\n\nI'm the youngest member of the Iowa Democratic caucus in the House. Rep. Finkenauer used to own that title. And I think the fact that he has the support of Rep. Finkenauer and myself speaks to kind of where we're at, what we're seeing, and there's movement in the state, Smith said. People are starting to say, you know what? I think I've gotta go Joe.\n\nVoters still have concerns about Biden. The worry expressed most frequently among early-state voters is his age (Biden turned 77 in November).\n\nDeb Hansen, a retired dental hygienist in Johnston, said Saturday night she's considering Biden, Booker and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. She said Biden does a great job and connects well with the crowd, but she's worried about his age.\n\nIf I knew who his vice president was -- if he puts Amy or Kamala in for vice president -- it's hands down, she said.\n\nAt the same time, national news developments have strengthened Biden's position: The crisis in the Middle East has moved foreign policy -- where Biden has long argued his decades of experience are an advantage -- to the forefront of the 2020 race. And Trump's impeachment, over efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Biden's son's business dealings there, gave Biden a big boost in online fundraising -- jumping 121% during impeachment proceedings compared to the weeks prior, his campaign said.\n\nThe morning after Trump ordered a strike that killed a senior Iranian commander in Iraq, Peggy Kaune, a retired nurse in Dubuque, said she's considering Biden and Sanders -- but that it makes me nervous that Sanders could be too liberal for the general election on foreign policy.\n\nI watched the news until three in the morning last night, she said. It's just frightening. We've got to stop (Trump). He's got to be stopped.\n\nAnd -- echoing the Biden campaign's argument that the former vice president's support has remained strong through attacks from Trump and his Democratic rivals largely because voters feel like they know him -- she said Biden is the candidate she trusts the most to meet the moment.\n\nBiden, she said, has got the experience, and his energy is really good. He gives me a lot of confidence.

It will brighten your inbox every Saturday morning.\n\n(CNN) High school sweethearts who were separated nearly seven decades ago reunited during the coronavirus pandemic and are now married.\n\nThe love story began 68 years ago, when Fred Paul and Florence Harvey first found each other.\n\nThe couple met as teenagers in Wandsworth, a small town in Newfoundland and Labrador province, Canada. They spent every moment they could together, taking walks after church, stealing kisses in between classes, and attending concerts.\n\nEvery night during the two years they were together, Paul would flicker his porch light before going to bed. It was his way of telling Harvey, who lived across the bay, good night and that he loved her.\n\nShe was my first love. My first girlfriend and my first true love, Paul, now 84, told CNN.\n\nBut when Paul turned 18, and Harvey was 15, the two went their separate ways. Paul moved to Toronto for work. A year later, when he came back to look for her, Harvey had moved to another town.\n\nEventually, they both married other people and started families.\n\nBut in 2017, Harvey found herself single again after her husband Len died of cancer. The couple, who were happily married for 57 years, had five children together.\n\nTwo years later, Paul's wife of nearly 60 years, Helen, also died after suffering from multiple health issues, including dementia. They had two children together.\n\nIt was the shared grief over losing their spouses that brought them back together.\n\nRekindling an old flame\n\nWhen Harvey heard that Paul's wife passed away, she called to reassure him that things would slowly get better.\n\nDuring that first conversation, which occurred a day after Valentine's Day, they spoke about their separate lives, their children and grandchildren and celebrated each other's happy memories.\n\nI never thought it would go past that, Harvey, 81, told CNN. But we went from talking once a week, to twice, to three times, to every day for hours. We had really reconnected even though we hadn't seen each other in all those years. I knew this was it.\n\nFred Paul and Florence Harvey when they were younger.\n\nMonths later on his birthday in July, Harvey surprised Paul by coming to Toronto where they were finally reunited.\n\nWhen I found out she was in town and was coming to me, it was 10:30 at night. I ran out of bed and got dressed and wrote 'Welcome Florence' in chalk on the driveway and when she arrived, I walked to the car, gave her a hug and a kiss on the cheek, and I held her hand and I knew right away that she had taken my heart, Paul said.\n\nJust three days after reuniting, the couple were ready to get married. Their families questioned why they moved so fast, but Paul and Harvey had no doubts they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together.\n\nPaul was also one month away from starting treatment for stomach cancer, but Harvey was committed to being by his side throughout the good and the bad, no matter what that meant.\n\nA 'most profound' wedding ceremony\n\nOn August 8, Paul and Harvey exchanged vows in front of family and close friends at Norval United Church in Georgetown, Ontario. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, they kept the guest list small.\n\nYou were the first young man to walk me home in my teens, Harvey told Paul during the ceremony. I guess you'll be the last man to walk me home.\n\nTheir marriage was officiated by the church's lead minister, Paul Ivany, who conducted more than 500 wedding ceremonies in his career, but said this one was the most moving, most profound service he had ever been a part of.\n\nFred Paul and Florence Harvey kissing on their wedding day.\n\nThey both had been married for years and had created families and memories and wonderful lives. They both had truly fulfilled their vows to their first spouse 'In sickness and in health. In joy and in sorrow. To love and to cherish. As long as we both shall live', Ivany told CNN.\n\nAnd now, with all the wisdom they had gathered up in life, through all of life's joys and sorrows, life's ups and downs, they were ready to say those vows again. Not, with the naive emotionalism of young love but out of the depths of lived experience. They were willing to say those vows again. And mean them, again. It was so powerful.\n\nAfter exchanging vows, Paul brought out his accordion and sang a Ricky Skaggs song, I Wouldn't Change You If I Could, to his bride.\n\nThere were tears in the eyes of all gathered. You couldn't help but feel you were watching a real, live miracle, that you were witness to an unimaginable love story, Ivany said.\n\nNow, Harvey said excitedly, the couple plans to retrace the first chapters of their story by visiting the childhood town where they met and fell in love all those years ago.

Story highlights The term fifth trimester marks the period of time when new moms return to work The book The Fifth Trimester offers advice based on interviews with over 700 women\n\nEditor's Note: Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nOn my first day back at work as a network news correspondent after my first child was born 11 years ago, a late assignment meant I arrived home long after my daughter had gone to bed.\n\nA few mornings later, the phone rang as I got ready for work. My boss said I needed to travel to Massachusetts to cover a story. I hung up and burst into tears.\n\nMy husband tried to make me feel better, saying I would be on the national news that evening, but all l could think about was being away from my daughter.\n\nMy re-entry to the work world was anything but easy and seamless. Before I gave birth, I thought I'd return to my hard-charging television correspondent role three months after delivery and pick up exactly where I left off.\n\nAnd then I held my baby and couldn't imagine leaving her for an hour to get a haircut, let alone 12 hours, which is the time I typically logged each day at work before I became a mom.\n\nI struggled with a changing identity and balancing the demands of motherhood with the challenges of a network role. Why hadn't anyone told me how hard it was going to be – or was it just me? So many other women seemed to be handling things much better.\n\nIf only I had known then that what I was going through was the fifth trimester, a term coined and trademarked by author Lauren Smith Brody, a former executive editor of Glamour magazine and a mother of two.\n\nWe mark pregnancy in three trimesters, and the fourth trimester is used to mean that time after delivery when your baby is adjusting to life outside the womb.\n\nPHOTO: Nancy Borowick Lauren Smith Brody is author of The Fifth Trimester.\n\nThe fifth trimester? It's the time when new mothers, just months after delivery, are going back to work but often before they feel emotionally and physically ready to return, said Brody, author of the new book The Fifth Trimester: The Working Mom's Guide to Style, Success, Sanity, and Big Success After Baby.\n\nBrody considers the fifth trimester to be the first few months back at work, whether women return after a week or after six months of leave, whether they work in blue collar or white collar professions, whether they have paid leave, or are like the majority of Americans who work at companies that don't offer any paid leave. (The United States is the only industrialized nation that does not mandate paid maternity leave.)\n\nFor the first three trimesters, you could fill bookshelves full with the number of books out there, and then the same actually when (my son) was born, there was the fourth trimester, which was a term that was new to me at the time, she said. She was helped along by books about re-creating the womb during those first months after her son was born.\n\nBut then I got back to work, and I had this weird feeling of both, 'Oh, thank goodness, I know how to do this,' and then also, 'Oh, no, I really don't know how to do this with a baby,' and there were very few resources to help me ease back in and to help me manage my expectations of myself and not blame myself for it being such a struggle.\n\nPHOTO: Doubleday The Fifth Trimester includes tips and advice for new mothers returning to work.\n\nBrody, whose sons are now 5 and 8, said she remembers feeling so harried when she returned to work that she didn't even take the time to look around to see whether any resources might be available for her. She realized later that she had undiagnosed postpartum anxiety after her first child was born.\n\nI hated that I wasn't what I expected of myself, she said. And that after all these years of achieving at work … here I was with a baby, just absolutely incapacitated, and I was so thrown by that and so disappointed in myself.\n\n'Everybody talked about guilt'\n\nThe veteran women's magazine editor was open with her colleagues about her struggles in returning to work. As her sons got older, she found herself offering advice to women in the office who were starting families. And then, as she started thinking about what she might want to do next in her career, she wrote a memo of story ideas. The concept of promoting the fifth trimester was one of the ideas on her list.\n\nIt was really, really eating at me, she said. I felt this sisterhood of mentorship and this working-mom mentor thing was really needed and real. And I knew that my experience alone is not enough to help everyone in the world, my God, definitely not. But if I could collect this huge breadth of experiences and put them all together and offer people that working-mom mentor that I didn't really feel like I had, that would be really valuable.\n\nShe put together a 50-question survey and sent it via email to people within her network, asking that they also share it socially and with their respective networks of family, friends and colleagues.\n\nShe hoped for 100 responses but ended up with more than 700, representing working women from every state in the country and from a range of professions, including police officers, teachers, doctors, lawyers, Fortune 500 executives, business owners, waitresses and freelancers. She followed up with more than 100 of the women, conducting in-depth interviews with them that help form the basis of her book.\n\nIt was amazing to see the differences in their experiences, but what I actually found more remarkable was sort of the emotional through line of the things they had in common, Brody said. Everybody talked about guilt, even if it meant a different thing to each person. Everyone talked about coming back to work, feeling different and knowing that people saw them differently, no matter what field they were in.\n\nSeventy-five percent of the women Brody surveyed said they wished they had been able to take a longer maternity leave. When asked how much extra time they would want, the most common answer was a few more months, according to the book. This response tracks with what Brody heard from the women in terms of when they felt physically and emotionally back to normal after giving birth: The average respondent said they were physically back 5½ months after delivery and emotionally back after almost six months.\n\nBrody interviewed women who returned to work a week after delivery and others who had six months of leave. Either way, there's a monumental transition, she said. I like to point out that the fifth trimester might be longer for some women and shorter for others. You kind of don't know how long that transition time is going to be until you're on the other side of it … I will say that when women went back very, very early, they seemed to have lengthier transitions.\n\nBrody's survey is not scientific, she admits, but it does reflect some of the major stresses new mothers experience when they return to work. Even if a woman is able to take the three months of unpaid leave required in the United States under federal law in most cases (companies with fewer than 50 employees are exempt), she is still returning months before she feels emotionally and physically back – and months before she is getting a decent night's sleep. The typical baby in Brody's survey was sleeping through the night at just over 7 months old.\n\nWhen you add in the stresses on a relationship, you've got what Brody aptly describes as a mess. Seventy-one percent of women said they battled more with their partners in the first three months after returning to work than they had ever before. It was the most stressful time in their relationship, they said, even more stressful than adjusting to a newborn or the first year of marriage.\n\n'What do I need right now?'\n\nSo what's a new working mother to do? Brody, who is a passionate advocate of paid leave, uses her book to focus less on what companies can and should do to help women with re-entry, and more on what women themselves can do. She provides tangible tips and helpful advice from women who have been there and who more than survived, they thrived. She covers such issues as how to win over any resentful colleagues and preparing for that first day back at work, which she calls the second cutting of the cord.\n\nShe encourages women to get their child care up and running slightly before the first day so they can try it out and adjust to leaving their loved one in the hands of someone else.\n\nShe's proudest of a chapter on the importance of emotional health titled On Feeling Human Again and says the simplest way to feel very good again is to ask, What do I need right now? Think about what you need – at home and at work – and ask for it, she said.\n\nAbout one in seven women will have a postpartum mood or anxiety disorder, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Her risk increases if she is facing any kind of extenuating circumstance, such as single motherhood, loss of a job or a big life transition, according to Brody.\n\nGoing back to work sooner than you are ready can be an extenuating circumstance, she believes. One study found that the risk of postpartum depression was higher in women who took maternity leaves of less than six months.\n\nThis is a matter of moms feeling like, from the very beginning, they can ask for what they need, she said. If you don't ask for what you need, you will find yourself in a deeper and deeper hole to dig yourself out of.\n\nBrody has also created a business called The Fifth Trimester, which works with new parents and companies to create more family-friendly cultures in the workplace. In addition to working with companies on ways to invest in women once they come back from work, she spends a lot of the time in her workshops talking about those soft skills that can help new mothers get what they need, whether it's at work or at home.\n\nShe points to unique approaches some companies are taking, such as home furnishings firm Wayfair, where conversations begin about how employees want their jobs to transition even before they go on leave.\n\nThey are so forward-thinking in this stuff, and they have just completely made it the norm that whenever someone is at the point where they announce a pregnancy or that their partner is going to have a baby, the conversation is completely opened up: 'How do you want your job to change and evolve?'  Brody said.  'It is just an assumption that you're probably going to want to, so let's talk about it,' and then it becomes an opportunity, and this is something that I think a lot of companies of any size could do.\n\nShe also points to how women can feel good about their skill set when they are back at work. New mothers are much more decisive about what they say no to – they are making calculations about what comes at the expense of time with their child.\n\nBut the things you say 'yes' to, like that new project you're taking on, you are so committed to it, because you've done the math on it, you've done the kind of emotional math on it to figure out, 'what am I going to feel from what compromises I'm making in order to be able to really commit to this?' So when you do commit, like, you are all in, and I think that's an amazingly valuable approach that women have when they come back to work and quality that they have when they come back to work.\n\nAs more parents and companies start talking about the fifth trimester, Brody hopes people will come to understand that this transitional time exists and presents a host of challenges but also that women can get through it and come out stronger in every way.\n\nFor me, I found that it was really helpful also to understand that the transition was finite and that when I got to the other side of it, I would actually see, really clearly see all of the ways in which I was a better editor, a better employee, a better manager and leader.\n\nFor any women who are adjusting to the return to work or who have gone through it, Brody hopes they'll be open about their experiences. She says she wants every woman to do what works for them emotionally but hopes they realize that the more open they are, the better off we'll all be.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nIf you are just open about what is challenging in this transition, about the fact that it is probably too soon (to return to work) if you feel that way, but then also about the fact that look at this, you are still getting your job done … and even the things you're struggling through, you're going to get through it, look back and see that you made it through and came out stronger, she said.\n\nI hope the book gives new moms the courage to be honest and open about the challenges of new working motherhood, so that even when you're struggling, you are doing a greater good by educating your workplace – and shifting workplace culture for the better.\n\nMore than anything, it's important to be transparent about the challenges but also about the triumphs. … That will also help everyone be less afraid of it, both of going through it and managing people who are going through it.\n\nWhat do you think is the best way to help new moms when they return to work?
