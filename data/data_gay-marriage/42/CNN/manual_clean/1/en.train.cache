this country's history, though, is filled with examples of how people have allowed skin color to blind them to other people's humanity. and interracial relationships can provoke all sorts of strong and conflicting emotions. when some people see a black and white couple, they don't see two individuals -- they see a projection of their own racial myths, insecurities and fantasies.

he says does not want to discriminate; he just wants to be left out of celebrations that he finds religiously problematic. that claim, based on the hundreds of articles that have been written on both sides, is a complicated argument alive with multiple values in dialectic tension. phillips should have had his religiously neutral day in court.

bridgerton, as a cultural phenomenon encompassing both novels and tv series, seizes on women's great affection for austen's books and shamelessly targets her fan base. perhaps if you've ever identified with elizabeth bennett, you'll fall for any actor in regency uniform. but while the landscape of austen is peppered with tragic figures of women who've lost out in life, in bridgerton, no one we like ever makes a long-term mistake. marina thompson, a featherington country cousin with more wealth than first appears, does have to settle for respectable marriage in the absence of passion. but as she's already attempted to entrap a naive young man into falsely accepting paternity of her baby, our sympathy is limited. there is cosmic order in her story's neat ending, far happier than the messy lives of most unmarried pregnant women in the era.

yet if austen's heroes are dreamy, they don't emerge from fairy tales. women tend to identify with austen's heroines, and thus it's an easy step to find themselves loving austen's men. but much of the reason modern women identify with austen's heroines that they face real challenges to which 21st century women can still relate. for austen's women, marriage is an economic prospect, and often the only economic prospect which allows an escape from poverty -- or at best, lifelong financial dependence on a reluctant relative. that is no longer true for women in the developed world, but their marital and sexual choices still face pressures and scrutiny unique to their sex.
there's been a troubling trend of bills aimed at limiting lgbtq rights since the mid-2010s, a discriminatory response to the successful (same-sex) marriage litigation, said jenny pizer, law and policy director of lambda legal, a national legal organization that works to advance the civil rights of lgbtq people.

theresa may's brexit strategy has been to make determined noises while championing a cause ‚Äì leaving the eu ‚Äì she campaigned and voted against, and she consistently makes zero productive headway with it. her predecessor david cameron's negotiation of the ultimately null eu reform deal in 2016 was far more thatcheresque in its intention and execution (even if the referendum he called subsequently was not). coverage of his doings, however, didn't call him maggie ‚Äì or indeed, refer to other male pms who went before him. when he acted in his own name, he was treated as such.

like with any married couple, the buttigiegs didn't take much prompting to acknowledge their spouse isn't perfect. the mayor is a bit too loose with food expiration dates and a bit of a hoarder when it comes to his old corduroy pants, according to chasten. and in return, the mayor made it clear that he's the only one that folds any laundry in their house. all of this playing out while their new dog, buddy, tried multiple times to steal their attention and their lunch (brazenly climbing on the dining room table as everyone watched). then there was truman, the other dog in the family, who kept quiet watch from his perch under the piano.
