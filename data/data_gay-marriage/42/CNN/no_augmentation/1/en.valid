The question is, is it not just about asking regulators what went wrong but bringing members of JPMorgan Chase and of course this is all complicated by the fact that JPMorgan Chase has been the responsible bank and they've been powerfully arguing against regulation, against the Volcker Rule. Well, that argument is going to be a lot tougher to make going forward as we find out this loss isn't two billion as they said last week, but now four billion perhaps or higher. This is a complicated position they find themselves in of their own making.

Experts say a chamber like this is what you use to test a nuclear weapon. And we talked to them. They confirmed that. Important to say, though, that this picture is not a picture that we have confirmed the authenticity of. There are, though, new signs that the economic sanctions against Iran are working. Take this story on the front page of today's Washington Post. Quote Iran unable to sell oil stores it on tankers. Literally they're storing it on tankers, turning off the GPS on the tankers so that -- because it's against maritime law to do so because they don't want anyone to know where the tankers are (INAUDIBLE) they're trying to sail into ports and just find anyone to buy their oil.

And to a lot of people the way he says it sounds a little smug.

Clyburn made a passionate case that getting beyond this difficult moment requires all of us to reflect on moments in Black history when people got out of their comfort zones to help make America better: We may feel safe and secure remaining inside our bubble interacting only with those who look and think like us. But doing so risks living in echo chambers and insular existences.
Much of Wednesday's melee was more reminiscent of both the triumphs and the tribulations of the historical era that created the Lost Cause : Reconstruction. Its distorted representations in popular culture, with its brilliantly hopeful beginnings, its progressive ideals, and its attempts at racial justice unbearably gave way to an unrelenting violent, deadly white backlash that had no repercussions or consequences for home-grown terrorists.

But I think, you know, this is not even an economic ad. This is an attempt by the Obama camp to draw an early contrast to define the candidate further as a person. It is a personal attack, a personal characterization about values underlying the economy, rather than anything aiming to provide a prescription for how to solve this problem.

This is a women's college.
Theresa May's Brexit strategy has been to make determined noises while championing a cause – leaving the EU – she campaigned and voted against, and she consistently makes zero productive headway with it. Her predecessor David Cameron's negotiation of the ultimately null EU reform deal in 2016 was far more Thatcheresque in its intention and execution (even if the referendum he called subsequently was not). Coverage of his doings, however, didn't call him Maggie – or indeed, refer to other male PMs who went before him. When he acted in his own name, he was treated as such.
They described in emotional detail the most difficult moments -- Meghan revealing her thoughts to Harry hours before they were due to go to an event; the Prince arriving home from work each day to find his wife crying while breastfeeding their newborn -- and said a lack of support and lack of understanding were the reasons they chose to step away.

FEINSTEIN: Well, there is a strong difference between the United States and Israel. There also is a strong likelihood that if Israel were to attack, the United States would be drawn into what would become rapidly another war with Iran that could have catastrophic consequences throughout the Middle East. And one of the things that we don't do well is follow through on figuring out if you do this and they do that, then what happens? Do we support Israel? Israel is close to us. Obviously we're going to back up Israel.

Of course, they also did not really know me. Falling in love in those pre-Instagram, pre-cell phone days was understood as a mysterious matter, where facts and the onerous getting to know each other played little part.

When was the last time you gave a second thought to the lightbulbs in your home? Probably when one flickered out and it needed to be replaced, right?

That's 15 percent of the U.S. economy, JPMorgan and it's 45 percent bigger now than it was right before the financial crisis, just to be clear.

The prince, who is sixth in line to the throne, said there is a culture of suffering in silence in the royal family.

One of most surprising success stories on vaccine rollout comes from the UK. At the height of the pandemic last year, the British had one of the highest national death tolls in the world. Now, thanks to an early series of big bets on then-unproven vaccines, as well as its centralized National Health Service, the UK has the third-highest vaccination rate in the world -- behind only Israel and the UAE. That's especially good news, as more evidence suggests that the coronavirus variant first identified in the UK is linked to more severe disease . The UK's success comes as new research from Israel finds that the Pfizer-Biotech vaccine appears to reduce symptomatic coronavirus infections by more than 90%. Elsewhere in the world, the rollout hasn't gone as smoothly: Peru's foreign minister resigned r ecently after being outraged that government officials had been vaccinated even before the country started offering doses to health care workers.

The other impact Greece crashing out of the euro may have is the impact of contagion.

From their first screen test for 2008's Twilight, Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart were the perfect match. According to director Catherine Hardwicke, Stewart felt connected to (Pattinson) from the first moment. That electricity or love at first sight or whatever it is. Whatever it was, it didn't survive a cheating scandal in 2012, when Stewart admitted that she'd had a momentary indiscretion with her Snow White and the Huntsman director, Rupert Sanders. She went public with her relationship with screenwriter Dylan Meyer in 2019.

Lev Golinkin, the nation must also reckon with its role in allowing some Nazi and Nazi collaborators to seek refuge here after World War II. Golinkin wrote: We're in the middle of a heated national conversation fueled by a hunger for racial justice. But how can we hope to acknowledge the impact of centuries-old institutions like slavery and Jim Crow when we can't be honest about coddling perpetrators of the Holocaust, which still has living eyewitnesses, victims and veterans? Bigotry and hatred in our history, unless rooted out and fully addressed, leave toxic traces that cannot heal.

CORKER: I mean -- you know my race last time was a national race that was huge. There were people who contributed from all walks of life and the same is true this time. I was the first person who called for a hearing here, so I don't think that's the case at all and I know it's not the case. And, no, I don't feel conflicted at all. Look, I tell these guys when they come in, I just had this same conversation with Jamie Dimon recently and a group of other people here I'm not a friend of banking.

Several Republican senators were angered by Wednesday's events -- despite sending a signal of impunity for Trump's previous abuses of power by voting to acquit him in his impeachment trial and forging a marriage of convenience with Trump to pursue shared goals like confirming conservative judges.
In one recent high-profile case, multiple family members of Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois released a letter shunning the politician for his criticism of then-President Donald Trump. What a disappointment you are to us and to God! they wrote . It is now most embarrassing to us that we are related to you.
This is a wake-up call, said study author David Williams, chair of the department of social and behavioral sciences and a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in a statement.
Buttigieg's best moments came when he talked about his own experiences. As a veteran, Buttigieg was excellent when talking about Trump being unfit to serve as a commander-in-chief. He argued that Trump has no regard for the military when he does things like refusing to read the intelligence reports or pardoning war criminals.
He came home the other night, I hadn't seen him, probably for a week. And so I think it's important in a marriage that you keep that spark going, she told CNN in an interview in Concord, New Hampshire. Before I saw him, I lit the candles. I put on the fire. We sat down and we started talking. And like always, it's always about the kids and what's this person doing or that person doing, or the grandkids. But after 20 minutes, we were like, 'God, we're exhausted.' So we went to bed.
Prince -- dressed in blue suit and chest-bearing orange button-down, hair covered with a black scarf -- performing Purple Rain in the middle of a torrential storm, purple symbol guitar in hand, was a glorious finale to a performance that saw one of history's most incandescent performers giving his all for 140 million views.
DAVID FRUM, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: That is a pretty tough ad. But I wonder whether it really counts as a pivot to the economy. What exactly is President Obama proposing to do? I mean, if private equity really is bad, if it does more harm than good, it's free to operate in the Obama administration. President Obama isn't proposing to do anything to restrict private equity.

He said Merkel had delayed on the issue until her hand was finally forced by pressure from rival political parties ahead of September's elections.

Often called the national dish of Singapore, this steamed or boiled chicken is served atop fragrant oily rice, with sliced cucumber as the token vegetable. Variants include roasted chicken or soy sauce chicken. The dipping sauces -- premium dark soy sauce, chili with garlic and pounded ginger -- give it that little extra oomph to ensure whenever you're not actually in Singapore eating chicken rice, you're thinking of it.

BURNETT: When you say everyone is on the same page about a deal, I was talking to Prime Minister Netanyahu a couple of weeks ago and he said he would allow no enrichment, none at all, not even the three percent that you would be using if you were using nuclear power for medical use or things like that. That doesn't really seem to be the same page as the United States, though, right? I mean would --
As historian Heather Cox Richardson argued Thursday , Yesterday the Executive Branch of our government tried to destroy the Legislative Branch. Perhaps realizing this, Sen. Lindsay Graham , one of Trump's most ardent defenders, finally spoke out against the violent attempts to avenge Trump. Invoking the 1876 election that essentially ended Reconstruction, Graham quipped that for people looking for historical guidance, this is not the one to pick. As a White Senator from the state that launched the Civil War, his aside about Reconstruction served to historically distance himself from the bloody violence and racist terror of his Confederate and segregationist forefathers.

In-flight entertainment has come a long way. The first in-flight movie dates back to the 1920s, but aerial cinema took its biggest leap in the 1990s with small personal screens at each seat. Airlines started adding sluggish wi-fi in 2004, but it wasn't until smartphones and tablets arrived a decade ago, that carriers started to think differently about aerial entertainment.
There are some diners who will not frequent an establishment if it does not have brownie and ice cream on the dessert menu. You may call them fools.

For keeping starvation at bay for the entire student population of the United Kingdom, the doner kebab should clearly be honored.

You never know entirely -- it's true. This could play out in a bad way for him or in a good way. Remember during the 1960 campaign -- we all read about, I should stress, wasn't actually playing attention then. We read about John F. Kennedy's outreach to Martin Luther King's family and the kind of surprising impact that that had. These social issues are not as straight and linear and easy to predict as sometimes the economic indicators are. So this will have ripples. But we don't know in which direction the ripples will go.

NEJAME: He'll have an uphill battle, that's for sure. We have very -- as I said, very open not only discovery, but sunshine laws in Florida. So he'll have to make an argument that the public's right to know is far outweighed by the public policy of protecting the safety of some of these witnesses because of the possibility of some death threats or injury or harm coming to some of these witnesses, to possibly being harassed and witness tampering. One would imagine that he would try to bring that out to show that some public safety outweighs the public's right to know. It will be an uphill battle.

Can the same be said of the Thunder and Pelicans, with both teams hovering around .500? What could the Lakers offer, knowing they may be able to lure George and/or Cousins in free agency?
To make a deal with the Pelicans, the Lakers would need to send out at least $13 million in salary to acquire Cousins. Randle is earning just $4.1 million, which means they'd have to include other players with him, be it Caldwell-Pope or a bigger package with Corey Brewer, Tyler Ennis and Zubac.

One of most surprising success stories on vaccine rollout comes from the UK. At the height of the pandemic last year, the British had one of the highest national death tolls in the world. Now, thanks to an early series of big bets on then-unproven vaccines, as well as its centralized National Health Service, the UK has the third-highest vaccination rate in the world -- behind only Israel and the UAE. That's especially good news, as more evidence suggests that the coronavirus variant first identified in the UK is linked to more severe disease . The UK's success comes as new research from Israel finds that the Pfizer-Biotech vaccine appears to reduce symptomatic coronavirus infections by more than 90%. Elsewhere in the world, the rollout hasn't gone as smoothly: Peru's foreign minister resigned r ecently after being outraged that government officials had been vaccinated even before the country started offering doses to health care workers.

What I want to see is that we have capital markets -- that we have capital markets in this country that function appropriately, that we have a financial system that meets the needs of an economy like we have in the U.S. and I just want to see it work in the appropriate way. One of the biggest setbacks we've had to our economy is the crisis in this financial system that sets us back years.

But the bitter feelings unleashed by Trump are not confined to the tens of thousands of supporters who flocked to Washington, DC. The President and his media shills have seeded a pernicious mistrust of democracy across vast swathes of the country. The majority of Trump voters are not violent. But millions of them believe his poison about the election being stolen — and think their country is being taken away from them. This raises the possibility that Wednesday's unrest is more than the violent death throes of a failed presidency, but a venomous force that will not only thwart Biden's hopes of healing corrosive divides but will fester once Trump leaves office and offer him a platform for continued extremism.

To highlight the contrast between her and Trump, Klobuchar continually repeated, I know you and will fight for you.

New audio and video recordings from the January 6 insurrection on Capitol Hill offer even more insight into how some rioters had little fear of police as they launched a large, coordinated attack. The footage also highlights the restraint of police at the scene, and suggests the riot could have been deadlier had officers acted more aggressively.

Peking duck! its a wonder..... wrote Shan Cao on our Facebook page. We can only guess Shan Cao was in the middle of forking a piece of this maltose-syrup glazed duck dish into his/her mouth and forgot to finish the sentence.

On Saturday the House passed the relief bill -- and the minimum wage hike, though that will be stripped out in the Senate version after a ruling by the Senate parliamentarian.wrote in the Washington Post's Made By History that much of the debate on that issue leaves out an important historical point borne out by the original New Deal minimum wage legislation:  The basic idea: Raising wages would increase consumption , thus giving businesses the incentive to hire more workers. It worked, reminding us today that mandating higher wages doesn't just increase standards of living. It boosts the economy.
For example, the image of Robinson entering the major leagues is of a man who kept his temper in check, engaging in the Christ-like gesture of turning the other cheek, in Burns' words.

BURNETT: When you talk about access, I want to ask you about Israel in a second, Israel issue, but access. I have this picture which I know is -- it looks a little strange. The Associated Press obtained this from a government that is skeptical of Iran's honesty in its nuclear program and they say this is a chamber used for testing explosives for nuclear weapons. We did make some calls today and experts said indeed this would be consistent with that, but we haven't independently verified the source government. Supposedly it's at the Parshan (ph) site though, which is the site the IAEA has not been able to --

AVLON: Well, look, follow the money. That's one of the tougher things to do, but certainly in this specific case calling for a hearing is a step in the right direction. The question is, is it not just about asking regulators what went wrong but bringing members of JPMorgan Chase and of course this is all complicated by the fact that JPMorgan Chase has been the responsible bank and they've been powerfully arguing against regulation, against the Volcker Rule. Well, that argument is going to be a lot tougher to make going forward as we find out this loss isn't two billion as they said last week, but now four billion perhaps or higher. This is a complicated position they find themselves in of their own making.

Even in rural Pakistan, where marriages are still generally arranged and love is a separate realm, Valentine's Day is now a known, if not openly, celebrated quantity. Where trysts between lovers can be arranged via the ubiquitous cell phone, any excuse to meet in the sugarcane field – including Valentine's Day – is used.

But the bitter feelings unleashed by Trump are not confined to the tens of thousands of supporters who flocked to Washington, DC. The President and his media shills have seeded a pernicious mistrust of democracy across vast swathes of the country. The majority of Trump voters are not violent. But millions of them believe his poison about the election being stolen — and think their country is being taken away from them. This raises the possibility that Wednesday's unrest is more than the violent death throes of a failed presidency, but a venomous force that will not only thwart Biden's hopes of healing corrosive divides but will fester once Trump leaves office and offer him a platform for continued extremism.
SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CA), SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRWOMAN: I think all of us pretty much know what the parameters of an agreement are.

Given its significance today, you'd think the Super Bowl halftime show has always been a prestige event.

He was a good-looking boy, and he could find dates, but when do you tell someone you have a colostomy bag? The night you go out? Two weeks after you go out? Durham asks.

It's clear that we need healthy and productive ways to engage across different opinions, but we should never have to accept false information. We can and should challenge non-factual statements.

As rioters, incited by the President and with some carrying White supremacist imagery descended upon the Capitol , scaled its walls, planted pipe bombs, and dangled from its railings, the pictures and videos were simultaneously stunning and revolting: The bright reds of the Confederate and Nazi flags and matching MAGA hats simmered against a sea of Trump flags now sold on street corner popup shops that outnumbered American flags, a noose, a raised wooden cross reminiscent of Klan lynchings, and a sweater reading Camp Auschwitz. The lineage between the slaveholding secessionists and the modern insurrectionists could not have been more clear: Both groups were willing to destroy the union and both used violence to deflect their own racial fantasies of power and privilege slipping away.
The IAEA is in the middle of its first talks with Iran in three months. The latest report from the agency, of course you may recall, said there were quote strong indications of possible nuclear weapons development. Indications like this picture from The Associated Press in today's Washington Post. Now let me just explain exactly what you're looking at here because I looked at this and said what is this? Something that could be in my backyard. It's a drawing of what's believed to be a nuclear explosion containment chamber hidden at a secret Iranian military base perhaps near a site called Parshan (ph) that the government in Iran has refused weapons inspectors access to.

JAY AHERN, FORMER HEAD OF U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION: Yes, I think when you actually take a look, Erin, the numbers may be closer to 50,000 since December of 2006 when President Calderon really started to take the fight to the cartels. We've seen it start to level a little bit in the last few months. Leveling is really a statement of choice here, that about 1,000 killings per month. But the gravity and the heinousness of the killings this past few days really shows as far as how aggressive and how ruthless these individuals are. Beyond just the beheadings, the cutting off the arms and legs sends a strong signal.

NEJAME: He'll have an uphill battle, that's for sure. We have very -- as I said, very open not only discovery, but sunshine laws in Florida. So he'll have to make an argument that the public's right to know is far outweighed by the public policy of protecting the safety of some of these witnesses because of the possibility of some death threats or injury or harm coming to some of these witnesses, to possibly being harassed and witness tampering. One would imagine that he would try to bring that out to show that some public safety outweighs the public's right to know. It will be an uphill battle.

That's different now, said Coleman, whose focus is mainly on estrangements between parents and adult children. Such ruptures are particularly painful, and the Cornell University survey found they're the most common of all.
Let's also focus on some of the facts that occurred the last few years as well. When you take a look at the apprehensions along the Mexican border coming into the United States, last fiscal year was 340,000. That's down 53 percent from 2008, and one-fifth in 2000, when it reached the tied of 1.6 million coming across the border.

Diana held a mirror up to (the royal family). She forced them to change and modernize and look outwards. I think Meghan will also be a force for good.
The appalling scenes horrified an incredulous watching world and recalled the revolts and palace rebellions of unstable banana republics rather than the stately rituals of the supposed last best hope for democracy on Earth.
AHERN: Well, I think one of the things that's important to recognize, these are criminal organizations and they certainly will diversify what their level of criminality is, whether drugs today, weapons tomorrow or a need to move high-valued targets across the border. Certainly, that was a great piece of work by the federal agencies specifically doing drug investigations and actually uncovered the individual who was contemplating an assassination attempt.

You may not realize it, but a mirror is an excellent way to direct the natural flow of sunshine in your space. As shamanic practitioner and coach John Moore explains, sunlight impacts our mind, body and spirit.

That is a useful frame for trying to make sense of the dramas that proliferated on Capitol Hill this week as Congress took up multiple nominations to President Joe Biden's Cabinet and held its first hearing on the January 6 insurrection. As Garber notes, the translation of individual traits into a national character most often occurs at times of stress, as a marker not so much of social progress as of social and cultural anxiety.
We also, of course action heard from Air Force General Douglas Fraser, who testified on whether there was other terrorist activities going on in Mexico to get into the United States, and here's what he said.

And the apparently meager US Capitol Police forces that were overwhelmed in Congress contrasted sharply with the heavily armed phalanxes of security forces Trump poured onto streets filled by Black Lives Matters protests over the summer. On that notorious occasion, the Justice Department sent federal troops into Lafayette Square with tear gas to clear protesters ahead of an absurd presidential photo-op.
Many historians have feared, and some have warned of the possibility of this day for months, some for years. Trump even campaigned in the style of the Jim Crow South's White supremacist demagogues, running on hatred and grievance, and cashing in on racism and xenophobia.
In most poor societies, it's the girls who are more readily taken out of school (or never sent in the first place). Parents may believe that education is wasted on a girl whose destiny is to marry and leave home.

He was a Republican who attended the 1964 GOP convention but then supported Democrats as the political parties' makeup changed. He struggled with the social tumult of the 1960s, a conflict poignantly reflected in his relationship with his son, a Vietnam War veteran who overcame a drug problem only to die in a car accident. He had a rich and devoted marriage to his wife, Rachel, his partner and sounding board.

The fudging of political personalities can be derogatory in both directions, depending on individual sympathies. When Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer succeeded Angela Merkel as leader of Germany's Christian Democratic Union last year, she noted the commentary describing her as a mini Merkel, or Merkel 2.0.
Rachel Bloom and Dan Gregor are about to get crazier. The married couple who collaborated on her hit series Crazy Ex-Girlfriend went public in September with the news they are expecting their first child.

Being a non-citizen and German would have certainly raised an eyebrow or two, but there would have been many questions early on in the training stage to gauge loyalty, Daubert said.
It makes sense for American to focus on giving customers the best entertainment and fast connection options rather than installing seatback monitors that will be obsolete within a few years, the company said in a statement.
Lenny Kravitz and former Cosby Show star Lisa Bonet seemed tailor-made for each other, right down to their love of hippie style. The pair met at a New Edition concert in 1985 and married in 1987, welcoming daughter Zoe a year later. We were very young, and it was wonderful, Kravitz recalled in 2013. Now, Zoe's mom and I are best friends, Kravitz said. It's interesting because that's how the relationship started. Bonet is now married to actor Jason Momoa.

BURNETT: So -- but JPMorgan itself, I mean is it possible you could do something about the bank? I mean you talk about it being small for that bank, and it is. And some people say, oh, well that's a sign that the system is strong. But then you could look at it and say why is the bank so big. It's 45 percent bigger in terms of assets, 2.3 trillion in assets. That's 15 percent of the U.S. economy, JPMorgan and it's 45 percent bigger now than it was right before the financial crisis, just to be clear.
JAY AHERN, FORMER HEAD OF U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION: Yes, I think when you actually take a look, Erin, the numbers may be closer to 50,000 since December of 2006 when President Calderon really started to take the fight to the cartels. We've seen it start to level a little bit in the last few months. Leveling is really a statement of choice here, that about 1,000 killings per month. But the gravity and the heinousness of the killings this past few days really shows as far as how aggressive and how ruthless these individuals are. Beyond just the beheadings, the cutting off the arms and legs sends a strong signal.
The equilibrium between cohesion and individual happiness varies between cultures and families. In the Cornell University study, for example, participants from families who immigrated to the US from the Caribbean, Africa and Latin America reported feeling strong social pressure to repair any rifts with estranged relatives.
For Houran, this outgrowth of illness-specific dating sites and services is a boon. Niche sites are growing in popularity because they allow people with these very specific needs or interests to connect in a way that's not possible on the big dating sites, he says.

When Japan wants to build something right, it builds it really right. Brand giants such as Toyota, Nintendo, Sony, Nikon and Yamaha may have been created by people fueled by nothing more complicated than raw fish and rice, but it's how the fish and rice is put together that makes this a global first-date favorite. This perfect marriage between raw fish and rice has easily kept sushi in the top five. And like one reader, Nymayor, wrote, Now to be fair, DELICIOUS can be simple. The Japanese don't live practically forever for no reason -- they want to keep eating this stuff.
BURNETT: All right. Thank you very much to Matthew Chance. Of course, Europe the biggest trading partner for America. So if it falls, major job losses and another deep recession would happen here.
Of all of our senses, scent is the one that brings us back to a rose-colored memory the fastest. Maybe it's the smell of the ocean that reminds you of a childhood by the shore or a flower from your wedding bouquet. Whatever it is, create a morning, midday or evening ritual with candles that make you smile, suggests Tia Graham, the founder and chief happiness officer at Arrive at Happy.
Anything that's been around since the 1860s can't be doing much wrong. The staple of the Victorian British working class is a crunchy-outside, soft-inside dish of simple, un-adorned food fundamentals. Sprinkled with salt, vinegar and dollops of tartar sauce, it is to nouveau cuisine what Meat Loaf is to Prince.

Love in Pakistan may seem like a tale from a very distant elsewhere, but one could argue that the slightly waning popularity of Valentine's Day here (or at least the cynicism that hangs over some) is for reasons remarkably similar, if reverse, from those seen in Pakistan.

NEJAME: Well, it's entirely possible that they're just not completed -- they have not completed everything yet and they're not going to turn it over until in fact they are. And if I could, you had indicated earlier that all this was information they were planning on using. Not necessarily, in Florida we have very open discovery laws. And if in fact there's something that's favorable or unfavorable, it still needs to be turned over to the defense and then a determination will be made if one side or the other plans on using it and if it's even admissible in court. So there's a very open discovery --

This is actually a great story, as related by Alabama's athletics website. Basically, during a much-hyped 1930 game between Alabama and Ole Miss, the Alabama team came out with such strength and force, fans yelled, Hold your horses, the elephants are coming! and the name Red Elephants stuck amongst sportswriters.

Once upon a time in 1999, a young blonde pop star named Jessica Simpson met another young blond-ish pop star, Nick Lachey, at a Teen People party, and they immediately fell in love. Lachey even wrote a song about their passion -- that would be My Everything -- and then he and his new bride signed up to film their love for an MTV reality show called Newlyweds. But instead of finding happily ever after, Lachey and Simpson found grounds for divorce in 2005 after three years of marriage. They both are now parents and married to others.

We need to build our economy back, better than ever, Buttigieg said. The Department of Transportation can play a central role in this, by implementing President Biden's infrastructure vision creating millions of good-paying jobs, revitalizing communities that have been left behind, enabling American small businesses, workers, families and farmers to compete and win in the global economy, and tackling the climate crisis.
While Pakistanis may have moved from the arranged to the semi-arranged sort of marriage, Americans have moved from the love by accidental chance or serendipity to a more calculated – if not algorithmic-driven – sort of love. In the data-driven, virtually-infused and forever-impatient realm of finding a partner, social media and the internet provide a ton of information faster than the spark of attraction.
It seems likely that May will survive the confidence vote. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) – the Northern Irish party that props up May's minority government – said it would work with the Prime Minister to secure a better deal.
Country stars Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert stunned fans when they announced in July that they were divorcing after four years of marriage. There was much sadness on social media over the split. She married police officer Brendan McLoughlin in 2019 and Shelton has been dating singer and fellow The Voice coach Gwen Stefani since 2015.
Things have changed in Pakistan. Not only is Valentine's Day a pretty big deal now – there are specials at florists and displays at stationery shops and tinsel-wrapped candy everywhere – the encroachment of the semi-arranged marriage, on the realm between love and arranged marriage, seems to have altered the path and pattern of both. These semi-arranged marriages, particularly popular among the growing urban middle class, seek to add a little of love's mystery to the once standard arranged marriage, whose closely chaperoned interactions leave little room for romance and where the two being wed do not know each other at all.
Madonna's four-year marriage to Sean Penn was one of the wildest rides of the '80s, and that's saying something, but we agree with her words after their divorce in 1989: I do believe we all have soul mates, she told People magazine. I don't believe that we necessarily end up with them. After their split, both Madonna and Penn moved on to new relationships (several times).
Despite this act, and the formation of Black militias and voting blocs throughout the South, White supremacist violence accelerated unabated throughout the region for another 90 years with a legacy that still haunts us today. Slavery, Jim Crow and Reconstruction's failures to prosecute treasonous Americans materialized yesterday - in the plume of gun smoke inside the Capitol.

I think the violence is going to continue during the next few months. We have a presidential election coming up in Mexico and I think some of the cartels are positioning themselves to make sure that they control this particular areas for a number of reasons.
Think about why it is you care about this person or why you like them or appreciate them, Silander said. That can soften your response and help you better articulate your perspective and lend credence to their viewpoint.

WALDMAN: Well, again, if the numbers for women or the numbers for independents on election day are on this poll, then it's president- elect Romney. But it is a bit of an outlier. The one bit of good news for President Obama in that poll, interestingly, was that independents and women and young people were more likely to be supportive of the president's stance on same-sex marriage than other voters.
Go a step further and acknowledge the other position, Silander suggests.
