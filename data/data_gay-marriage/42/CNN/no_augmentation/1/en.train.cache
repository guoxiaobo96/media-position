waffle weave: waffle-weave towels have raised threads that form a 3d honeycomb-pattern surface. they are believed to be more absorbent because the honeycomb indentations draw in moisture from the surface, thus arguably drying you more quickly and effectively than a traditional woven terry. that greater surface area weave also means a faster-drying towel, especially helpful in smaller or less well-ventilated bathrooms — so goodbye to musty, still-damp bath towels the next day. these towels are so different experientially than traditional terry cotton options; you'll find they're immediately absorbent without feeling heavy or fluffy in any way. plus, their flat-weave structure results in a texture with a lot of benefits: it makes them lighter and less bulky than terry cotton, and thus easier to carry, store, transport and launder.

if you're looking for a greener yoga practice, the jade yoga harmony mat is a solid choice. pvc-free and made in the usa, the 4.5-millimeter thick natural rubber mat's textured surface offers up a sticky resilience perfect for low-impact and high-octane workouts alike, while the underside stays put on hard floors and carpeting. available in two lengths (68 and 74 inches), the mat comes in a slew of cute colors, from fire engine red to a pretty slate blue. one downside was that the flat texture of the mat tended to pick up lots of dust and debris off our floors, which made wiping it clean a bit tougher. bonus: jade yoga plants a tree for every mat sold, and even the mat's label is printed on recycled paper with soy ink. unfortunately, the brand offers only a one-year warranty.

hands down, the kohler forte shower head provides the best overall shower experience, offering three distinct settings. backstory: lots of shower heads out there feature myriad settings that, when tested, are pretty much indecipherable. the forte's three sprays, however, are each incredibly different and equally successful. there's the drenching, full-coverage rain shower, the pulsating massage and the silk spray setting that is basically a super-dense mist. the forte manages to achieve all of this while using only 1.75 gallons per minute (gpm), making it a great option for those looking to conserve water.

(adjoa andoh, for example, was born to play a regency grande dame). but the happy-ever-after bridgerton sells to its female viewers still consists of marriage and men. this is snow white with added orgasms ; social conservatism dressed up in progressive breeches.

they're nice-looking on the towel rack and feel great against the skin, thanks to being crafted from 100% turkish cotton and described as spa quality of extra thickness. we've established already that the level of plush a consumer wants in their towel is relative, and this one was closer to the frontgate type. that is to say, one person in this household likened drying themselves with this to drying off with a stuffed animal. you can't buy these individually, only for $69 for a set of two — that limitation, plus the heavy-plush factor, were two detractors that ratcheted this one down to just below our winner's circle of bath towels. to that point, brooklinen does offer classic, waffle and ultra-thin bath towel options, so if you're already loyal to this brand, you're likely to find one you'll love, and at a pretty good price point for the quality.

here are the easy words for him: i do … swear that i will … to the best of my ability. … unlike say, seats in the congress or on the court, the presidency is a strikingly personal office, with the entire power of a branch of government vested in and revolving around a single individual. the words i and my should come easily to trump's lips because these are strikingly self-centered words and he is unusually self-centered. interestingly enough, these words in the presidential oath clause are the only first-person-singular words in the entire constitution, a document that begins, famously, with collective language — we, the people, … do ordain and establish… — and that also elaborates the legislative and judicial branches, which are far less personal than the presidency.

the amazon basics quick-dry towel is a lightweight product that achieves what it's advertised to do: after being hung over a banister for a mere two hours, it felt nearly fully dry. made in an oeko-tex standard 100 factory to meet independent environmental standards, these towels were absorbent and effective enough at drying. they come in eight bright or more muted colors and can be purchased in three-piece or eight-piece sets, including washcloths and hand towels, as well as in bath sheet sizes (though the standard bath towel size of 54 inches by 30 inches felt plenty sizable to us). these didn't rank higher in our testing, though, because they felt flimsy compared with the other towels we tested — something the price reflects, at less than $20 for a set of two. we also noted some loose threads in these towels after a few washes.

perhaps the most criminally underrated game on this list, sunset overdrive is an irreverent, neon-soaked shot of delightful open-world action. part ratchet & clank, part tony hawk's pro skater, this colorful apocalyptic adventure makes the act of moving and shooting a joy as you can grind on rails, run on walls and use all manner of creative weapons to take out energy-drink-infused zombies (yes, you read that right). if you need a break from the many overly grim and serious action games out there — or just want to catch up on one of microsoft's best hidden gems — sunset overdrive is the exact type of foul-mouthed fun you're looking for.

upon first use, we did feel some of the towel's fibers shedding onto our skin, which is apparently normal in thicker plush towels, and shedding reduces after subsequent washes and dries. this weight of towel also, fairly enough, takes longer to dry than the thinner options, naturally. those two factors kept this one from being one of our very top winners, but it was a close finalist. the towel is also available in a whopping 25 color options, and in both bath towel and bath sheet sizes.

what we love most about the manduka eko superlite yoga and pilates travel mat is that if you took away its portability selling points (more on those below!), it's a superior nonslip mat. here's why: while it's light enough to travel with, the mat still maintains enough weight to stick to the floor and stay put, whether it's on hard surfaces or carpet — which is rare for a thinner, lightweight mat. but the mat's chief asset is the excellent grip provided by its tightly woven surface. with a slightly dimpled appearance and a tacky texture, the mat provided tons of traction and stability during even our sweatiest workouts.

being gay is part of who i am and i'm aware of what it represents to be that kind of first elected official to try to do this who's out, he says. at the same time, ultimately, i want to be evaluated based on the ideas that i bring to the table. it's kind of like being mayor. if i'm plowing the snow and filling in potholes then i'm a good mayor and if we fail to do that, i'm not. and it's got almost nothing to do with whether when i come home it's to a husband or to a wife.

available in five happy colors (from a pretty pink to kelly green), the mat features more than a dozen indicators (etched in a slightly darker shade of the mat's color) from top to bottom, including end-to-end lines that keep hands and feet parallel lengthways, reverse points that keep your hands and feet even when on your back, central lines that keep you centered widthways and 45-degree lines that align your back heels when in standing postures. having used these markers in our own workouts, we felt more confident as we glided through the motions, knowing that each of our poses was not only accurate but also safe, preventing any unwanted injuries that could occur when left to our own (somewhat uneducated) devices. those lines also helped us to achieve optimal results and learn exactly where we should be on the mat and thus how our bodies should feel in those positions.
