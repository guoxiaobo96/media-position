{"original": "The Scream is fading. And tiny samples of paint from the 1910 version of Edvard Munch's famous image of angst have been under the X-ray, the laser beam and even a high-powered electron microscope, as scientists have used cutting-edge technology to try to figure out why portions of the canvas that were a brilliant orangeish-yellow are now an ivory white.\\n\\nSince 2012, scientists based in New York and experts at the Munch Museum in Oslo have been working on this canvas — which was stolen in 2004 and recovered two years later — to tell a story of color. But the research also provides insight into Munch and how he worked, laying out a map for conservators to prevent further change, and helping viewers and art historians understand how one of the world's most widely recognized paintings might have originally looked.\\n\\nThe art world is increasingly turning to labs to understand how paintings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries are behaving. Vincent van Gogh's chrome yellows, some of which have started to brown, and his purples, some of which have turned blue, have been widely studied. But less is known about Munch's palette, and scientists, using updated technologies and tools like transmission electron microscopes, are breaking new ground.\\n\\nJennifer Mass, the president of the Scientific Analysis of Fine Art lab in Harlem, whose team is on The Scream research, explained the science recently in her lab. She pointed to a photograph of what looked like a set of stalagmites: It was the surface of The Scream seen under a microscope."}

It's a tad cute to ascribe symmetry to the career of the French star Michel Piccoli, but one can draw a line from his work in Contempt (on Saturday) — the 1964 Jean-Luc Godard masterpiece in which he plays a screenwriter whose marriage disintegrates during a production of The Odyssey — to I'm Going Home (on Thursday), Manoel de Oliveira's 2002 portrait of a grieving theater actor near the end of his life, vexed after being abruptly cast in a film production of James Joyce's Ulysses. Film Forum's retrospective goes heavy on marquee directors: It features Mr. Piccoli's collaborations with Luis Buñuel (Diary of a Chambermaid, showing on Tuesday), Jacques Demy (Une Chambre en Ville, on Sunday, and The Young Girls of Rochefort, on Sunday and Tuesday) and Marco Ferreri (Dillinger Is Dead, on Wednesday and March 23, and La Grande Bouffe, from Saturday to Monday and on Thursday), plus another chance to catch the recent revival of Jacques Rivette's great La Belle Noiseuse (on Monday).\\n\\n212-727-8110, filmforum.org"}
{"original": "In opera, the drumbeat of time is written on — and in — the body. Vocal cords grow brittle; high notes start to quaver; low tones hollow out. Singers have to retire the roles of their youth, and eventually retire altogether.\\n\\nBut not yet: Nine years ago, the American mezzo-soprano Susan Graham told me she hoped she had 10 more years of singing in her. Heard on Tuesday at Alice Tully Hall, and turning 60 in July, she sounds like she could easily go another decade.\\n\\nAs it happens, the following evening Marianne Crebassa, a lively 33-year-old French mezzo, made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera, just across the street from Tully, as Cherubino in Mozart's Le Nozze di Figaro.\\n\\nCherubino, a horny pageboy sung by a woman in adolescent male drag, was one of Ms. Graham's calling cards in the 1990s. To hear a superb rising artist in the role, 24 hours after hearing Ms. Graham limn the stages of a woman's life, was a poignant juxtaposition, but also a lovely one. The kids are all right, these performances made clear, and so are the parents."}
{"original": "A few days later, Jodi has completed her quest and fulfilled her decades-old promise to Paula. Except the abused boy, Ricky, is now a troubled and troubling adult, rescued but not always grateful to his savior. Along the way Jodi has also found a new locus of desire, Miranda — a beautiful, impulsive young woman with an addictive personality and three young children from her broken marriage to a faded country music star. Jodi and Miranda's complex relationship, with its tough and delicate moments of attraction and then romance, shapes one of the book's strongest movements.\\n\\nImage\\n\\nBefore the six of them — damaged and desperate — shoehorn into Miranda's Chevette and head up to West Virginia in time for Jodi's first appointment with her parole officer, Jodi tells Ricky, Whatever you want for a new life, bring it here with you in the morning. But the new life they're all fleeing toward is harsh, and its margins so tight that a welfare benefits card counts as a major asset.\\n\\nThroughout the narrative, which jumps back and forth in time between the late 1980s and 2007, the events leading to Jodi's conviction spin in her memory, becoming clearer bit by bit. Her teenage affair with Paula once took Jodi into a dark, frightening and exciting underworld of gambling, guns and passion. At one point, remembering a flight in a small plane over the ocean with Paula, Jodi searches in vain for the right words to describe the color of the water, as elusive as her swirling emotions — words sufficient to catch the heart-wild magic of it.\\n\\nNow, back in West Virginia with her collection of fugitives, Jodi holds to her prison vision of living simply on the land, an old and deeply American dream that is hard to let go. She finds that her grandmother's farm has been sold, but that doesn't deter her from moving her group into the cabin anyway for a brief cigarette-and-whiskey outlaw idyll. Instead of peace and hope and love, however, they find they're under constant threat in an Appalachian community gutted by meth and opioids, by fracking creeping so close that a neighbor can set his tap water on fire, and, as always, by limitations on upward mobility for the underprivileged that have been baked into American culture from its beginning.\\n\\nThough the powerful pulls of land and home and sense of place persist, one of the primary questions Sugar Run asks is what these concepts even mean now in this country. Maren is masterly at describing America's modern wastelands, the blasted towns not yet and maybe never-to-be the beneficiaries of rehabilitation and reoccupation. The book's landscape is dotted with roadside casino trailers, abandoned mining operations, country brothels set up like prisons with chain-link fences and armed guards to control both the customers and the immigrant prostitutes. Jodi's own brother uses her in an opioid transaction and then threatens her by suggesting that locals might consider Miranda's children better off with a more Christian family. How do you possibly find or make a home under such conditions?"}

She was 94.\\n\\nHer death, at a care facility, was confirmed by her daughter, Linda Alvarado.\\n\\nMs. Vidaurri, who was nicknamed La Calandria, or the Lark, belted out songs with a powerful voice, often making risqué wisecracks during her performances. Based in San Antonio, she sang in Mexico, Cuba and other parts of Latin America, performing with artists like Nat King Cole, Eydie Gorme & Los Panchos and Celia Cruz. By the 1950s she was mentioned alongside such famous Tejana entertainers as Eva Garza and Lydia Mendoza.\\n\\nRanchera, traditional Mexican country music, often features wistful love ballads or boisterous paeans to places in Mexico and Texas.\\n\\nMs. Vidaurri retired from the stage in the late 1950s at the insistence of her husband and former booking agent, Hillman Edward Eden. (They later divorced.) She performed rarely until 2001, when Graciela Sánchez, director of the Esperanza Peace and Justice Center in San Antonio, invited her to sing at an 85th birthday celebration for Ms. Mendoza."}
{"original": "Another congregation that is working with those grappling with religious trauma is the Holy Trinity Community Church in Nashville, with a membership that is over 80 percent L.G.B.T.\\n\\nBrice Thomas, the lead pastor, says he first grasped religion's capacity for harm when his father, a Pentecostal faith healer, died of a treatable skin cancer because the church did not believe in going to doctors. After a stint in the military, Mr. Thomas, who is gay, became ordained in the United Church of Christ, one of the first denominations to affirm marriage equality, and took up his duties in Nashville last year. Together with Jennifer Strickland, a licensed therapist, he is setting up a Recovering from Religious Trauma Syndrome group at the church.\\n\\nPastor Thomas says that releasing feelings of shame and unworthiness takes time and the support of a loving community. He adds, however, that being ostracized by religion can be a blessing in disguise if it pushes one to develop a more authentic personal faith.\\n\\nI'm grateful to the religious community that I grew up in because the challenges that they presented have brought me to the place I am today, he said. I'm also thankful for my sexual orientation because it has opened me to deeper ways of being in relationship to God.\\n\\nEven after people leave religions where they have suffered abuse, they can still harbor the emotional conviction that they are basically sinful and wrong, says Marlene Winell, a human development expert who coined the term religious trauma syndrome in a series of articles in 2011.\\n\\nDr. Winell was raised by missionary parents in Taiwan whose religion, she says, taught her that she was never good enough as a child. She struggled for years to figure out how to enjoy life, whose pleasures she had been made to feel guilty about.\\n\\nDr. Winell's group, Journey Free, runs retreats where people suffering from religious trauma share personal stories and engage in nurturing exercises like the baby wrap, in which participants are swaddled in a blanket and rocked by the others who read statements like I love you and you are welcome to the world."}

This was not an easy thing to do, given the setting.\\n\\nMs. Ingraham, 30, and Mr. Koster, 33, were youth leaders at Oak Hill Ranch, a therapeutic program for high-risk children. The demands of the job didn't allow much time for adult interaction, let alone a flirtation. But Ms. Ingraham did her best to let Mr. Koster know she was interested. There was the time they were out walking children around the ranch and she stepped on a wasp's nest: I was getting attacked by wasps and he was sweeping them off my legs and I was like, 'Adam, you are amazing,' Ms. Ingraham said.

After that, I finally got that she had been trying to hang out with me, he said.\\n\\nThey started dating in 2017; by April of that year, they were a couple, splitting their time between his house in Morinville and hers in St. Albert."}
{"original": "One person who is not laughing is Brown's protagonist, Alice Hale, the 21st-century newlywed who has recently left a once-promising career in public relations and moved from Manhattan to a sleepy New York suburb. In the basement of her new house is a box left by the previous owner that's filled with magazines from the 1950s plus a dusty, circa-1930s copy of Cookbook for the Modern Housewife. The collection offers a trove of anachronistic recipes and rules, but mostly, the box is a portal to another world, one that makes Alice feel a little less lonely in her new directionless life. At the other end of the portal is Nellie Murdoch, a Betty Draper type whose life is spent tending to her spectacular garden, baking cakes for Tupperware parties and keeping up appearances while living with her philandering, physically abusive husband.\\n\\nImage The first chapter of Karma Brown's Recipes for a Perfect wife begins with a quote from Oscar Wilde: You seem to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. Credit... Jenna Davis\\n\\nRight from the beginning, as their broker gives Alice and her husband, Nate, a tour of the 1940s house in fictional Greenville, Alice feels uneasy. Everything it stands for makes her feel nauseous. All she wants is to be back in her cramped apartment eating takeout. Nate has a different reaction altogether. The house is the logical next step in the narrative he's already written for them: wedding, apartment, suburbs, family. He wins, yes, because, like the other men who populate this book, he walks through the world expecting life would give him whatever he wanted simply because he asked for it. But also because he's the one bankrolling their life now, which sets up a new, prickly dynamic for Alice, making her feel like less of a partner.\\n\\nOnce they move in, this dynamic infuses every part of their marriage, right down to the night she makes a mess of the kitchen and Nate doesn't lift a finger to help, something that never would've happened in their old life when they were both working, i.e. equal partners. Before she knows it, the resentment begins to fester and Alice starts taking her lead from 1950s Nellie — whose first lie to her husband coincided with the first time she discovered another woman's lipstick stain on his shirt collar — misleading Nate about everything from birth control to the humiliating career scandal that drove Alice to leave her job.\\n\\nThough many of the darker scenarios in Brown's novel don't elicit the heavy emotions they're meant to, and the 1950s references can feel gratuitous more than textured (housewives cooking while listening to Hound Dog; doctors casually prescribing Thalidomide and recommending cigarettes to pregnant women), it's easy to keep turning the pages as we toggle back and forth between Alice and Nellie, who — breaking news — has a far more complicated life than a stack of Ladies' Home Journals would lead Alice to believe.\\n\\nWhen a neighbor hands Alice a bundle of unsent letters written by Nellie to Nellie's mother, the mystery begins in earnest, and it turns out Nellie has a lot more to teach Alice about being a wife and a woman than how to bake a good batch of cookies. The most important? Take those trappings you resent so much — cooking, gardening, bearing children — embrace them, then wield them like weapons."}

{"original": "SIGNALS\\n\\nBy Tim Gautreaux\\n\\n363 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95.\\n\\nGrowing up on the prairies, I formed a vision of the American South based almost exclusively on James Dickey's Deliverance — first the 1970 novel and later the 1972 movie, Burt Reynolds heading deep into rural Georgia with three buddies to battle a landscape so bloody and beautiful it seemed an honor just to be there even as they tried desperately to escape. But it was another Dickey book, the sweet love letter to literature Metaphor as Pure Adventure, that taught me the pleasures of writing. One begins with the sensible world, which in its entirety is a gift, and a gift also in each of its parts, he proclaims. But there is a second gift that you give yourself, based on the world's great gift. . . . those pictures of the world inside one's head; pictures made of the real world but pictures that one owns, that one infuses with one's own personality. They are fragments of the world that live not with the world's life but with ours.\\n\\nNot long after he wrote that passage, Dickey started teaching poetry at the University of South Carolina. A young Tim Gautreaux was his student, and even the quiet, profound title of Gautreaux's dissertation, Night-Wide River, shows he was listening. Now, nearly 50 years and six books later, Gautreaux's latest story collection, Signals, affirms that he is Dickey's true heir.\\n\\nGautreaux's stories all begin in the relatively humble territory of realistic fiction. He describes his method, simply, as follows: I try to imagine a normal, average man, with a old boring job, and give him a problem. Gautreaux has been called the cartographer of the Louisiana back roads, but he also loves machines more than anyone I've read: gas stoves, trains, typewriters, sewing machines, pipes, pianos, church bells. It's one of the chief pleasures of his work — finding out how things function and how to fix them. (Or not: A reader's heart breaks with Gautreaux's when something is declared past fixin'.)\\n\\nBut the real thrill of this collection is its inevitable march into poetry, what Dickey called a magical arena. Gautreaux delivers a reliable, generous, surprising profusion of metaphors in each of these 21 stories. In one, a garage full of junk is slowly revealed as a stand-in for the mysteries of marriage. In another, a windshield breaks into a million diamonds, and the man recovering from the crash feels his mind come back to him changed, like a book dropped in the ocean and washed up on shore, all there, but slightly warped."}

She was 93.\\n\\nHer daughter, Jenny Wilson, said the cause was most likely complications of two recent strokes.\\n\\nMs. Wilson did not plan her elaborate constructions, which hinted at Surrealism and Modernism. She did not explain their meaning (if they had any — she left that up to the observer). And she did not say why she chose particular items and arranged them as she did in boxes and other containers.\\n\\nIt's just trial and error, she said in a short biographical film made in 2011 for the Cleveland Arts Prize, which she won in 1993. She added, I don't have anything in my head that I want them to say, but it's entirely what happens when they get together that makes the story, so the story is brand new to me."}

Scorsese and Lebowitz collaborated previously on the feature-length documentary Public Speaking, about her life and career as a writer and raconteur.

Almost overnight, crack began devastating Black communities across America, raising alarm in the media and giving a few Reagan-era politicians new ways to terrify their constituents.

In the chilling four-part docu-series Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer, some of the people involved in hunting down this criminal — eventually identified as Richard Ramirez — talk about the stress of the pursuit, and how difficult it was to catch a man whose pattern of behavior defied logic.

The show's creative team (led by The Simpsons and Futurama creator Matt Groening) clearly have fun riffing on the trappings of sword-and-sorcery sagas; but all the while they've been making a pretty good one of their own, with a story that gets more involving with each new batch of episodes."}

And if men are struggling more the farther we move from those traditional norms, is the answer to continue denying and suppressing a boy's essential nature?\\n\\nHis answer is no:\\n\\nMale children are falling behind in school not because schools indulge their risk-taking and adventurousness but often because they relentlessly suppress boys and sometimes punish boys' essential nature, from the opening bell to the close of the day.\\n\\nHe concludes:\\n\\nWe do our sons no favors when we tell them that they don't have to answer that voice inside them that tells them to be strong, to be brave, and to lead. We do them no favors when we let them abandon the quest to become a grown man when that quest gets hard. Yes, we do them no favors when we're not sensitive to those boys who don't conform to traditional masculinity, but when it comes to the crisis besetting our young men, traditional masculinity isn't the problem; it can be part of the cure.\\n\\nFrom a more academic vantage point, Steven Pinker, a professor of psychology at Harvard, replied to my inquiry with a detailed critique of the A.P.A. guidelines.\\n\\nThe report is blinkered by two dogmas. One is the doctrine of the blank slate that rejects biological and genetic factors, Pinker wrote, adding that\\n\\nThe word testosterone appears nowhere in the report, and the possibility that men and women's personalities differ for biological reasons is unsayable and unthinkable.\\n\\nThe other dogma, Pinker argued,\\n\\nis that repressing emotions is bad and expressing them is good — a folk theory with roots in romanticism, Freudian psychoanalysis, and Hollywood, but which is contradicted by a large literature showing that people with greater self-control, particularly those who repress anger rather than venting, lead healthier lives: they get better grades, have fewer eating disorders, drink less, have fewer psychosomatic aches and pains, are less depressed, anxious, phobic, and paranoid, have higher self-esteem, are more conscientious, have better relationships with their families, have more stable friendships, are less likely to have sex they regretted, are less likely to imagine themselves cheating in a monogamous relationship.\\n\\nIn Pinker's view, the A.P.A. guidelines fail to recognize that\\n\\na huge and centuries-long change in Western history, starting from the Middle Ages, was a Civilizing Process in which the ideal of manhood changed from a macho willingness to retaliate violently to an insult to the ability to exert self-control, dignity, reserve, and duty. It's the culture of the gentleman, the man of dignity and quiet strength, the mensch. The romantic 1960s ethic of self-expression and escape from inhibitions weakened that ethic, and the A.P.A. report seems to be trying to administer the coup de grâce.\\n\\nPinker suggested rather that\\n\\nOne could argue that what today's men need is more encouragement to enhance one side of the masculine virtues — the dignity, responsibility, self-control, and self-reliance — while inhibiting others, such as machismo, violence, and drive for dominance.\\n\\nThere is a major difference between the two parties regarding the basic nature versus nurture issue that plays such a prominent role in the debate about men. As my Times colleague Claire Cain Miller reported in December, data from Pew shows a partisan divide over whether\\n\\ngender differences were the result of biology (and thus unlikely to change) or societal norms. More than half of Republicans said biology determined differences in how men and women parented, expressed feelings or spent their free time. About two-thirds of Democrats described society as the primary driver of these differences.\\n\\nI asked some of those involved in preparing the A.P.A. guidelines for their response to criticisms of the report, including Pinker's.\\n\\nRyan A. McKelley, a professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, who participated in some of the research but not in issuing the guidelines, wrote that there was no intent to reject biological determinants. Instead, it was just beyond the scope of those particular guidelines.\\n\\nMcKelley noted that he keeps seeing 'testosterone is missing' show up in critiques of the guidelines, but psychologists don't measure or manipulate testosterone levels in patients.\\n\\nSimilarly, he continued,\\n\\nIf I treat someone for major depressive disorder, it doesn't matter to me as a clinician what percentage of their depression might have genetic determinants. I can't change their genes.\\n\\nMcKelley rejected\\n\\nthe implication that the goal is to eliminate male characteristics. The real implication is that rigid adherence to extreme expression of a few select masculine norms is related to poorer health outcomes.\\n\\nIn fact, he argued, the guidelines specifically encourage a kind of competitiveness, citing a section that reads,\\n\\nActive play between fathers and children has a functional element correlated with several positive child outcomes, such as competitiveness without aggression, cooperation that buffers anxiety, healthy experimentation, social competence, peer acceptance and popularity, and a sense of autonomy.\\n\\nMcKelley said he\\n\\nwould love to have someone argue that competitiveness without aggression is somehow undesirable. That sounds exactly like redirecting traits toward more productive activity and behavior.\\n\\nEdward M. Adams, past president of Division 51 on Men and Masculinities of the American Psychological Association, emailed that the guidelines\\n\\nespouse positive manhood to include living in cooperation, respect, appreciation, courage, and fearlessness about being fully human. We do not see negativity, shame, unwarranted violence and aggression, gender domination, or hate and prejudice as ways to promote a better quality of life for any one of us.\\n\\nAdams noted that the guidelines are\\n\\na living document and will undoubtedly evolve over time. What is important is that we are grappling with the impact of destructive expectations that may thwart positive development and diminish the physical and emotional health of men and boys.\\n\\nThere is a strikingly different approach to the debate over masculinity in a different branch of academic inquiry. As David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., wrote in response to my query:\\n\\nThe greatest adverse shock to the psychosocial welfare of U.S. men has not stemmed from dysfunctional notions of masculinity (not that these are above reproach) nor from #MeToo (which was long overdue) but from deep secular labor market forces — both technological and trade-induced — that have over nearly four decades reduced the demand for skilled blue collar work.\\n\\nThe effects of these economic changes, Autor wrote, have been devastating:\\n\\nThese forces have dramatically eroded the earnings power, employment stability, social stature, and marriage market value of non-college men. The ensuing dysfunction touches not just in earnings and employment but also male idleness, dysfunctional and destructive behavior (e.g., drug and alcohol abuse), and the erosion of two-parent families, which, research suggests, facilitate children in becoming successful adults.\\n\\nIn a December 2018 paper, When Work Disappears: Manufacturing Decline and the Falling Marriage Market Value of Men, Autor, David Dorn, an economist at the University of Zurich, and Gordon Hanson, an economist at the University of California-San Diego, argue that adverse trade shocks, like a surge of imports from China, differentially reduce employment and earnings of young adult males, reduce marriage and fertility, heighten male idleness and premature mortality, and raise the share of mothers who are unwed and the share of children living in below-poverty, single-headed households."}
{"original": "But the most important contrast is in the comic's discussion of his own infidelity. Until Tamborine, Rock was known as a social commentator who mostly kept his private life at a distance. But addressing his divorce and his responsibility for the failure of his marriage, Rock made the most vulnerable, introspective comedy of his career. Burnham was clearly drawn to this aspect of the set and focused on it. This material, including jokes about marriage, divorce and sex, takes up about half of the special, as opposed to around a third of the extended version.\\n\\nWhen Rock confessed his mistakes, Burnham moved into a rare close-up. And he stayed on the star's face, with no cutaway shots, as Rock talked about cheating on his wife. When the crowd chuckled, Rock looked grave, emphasizing that he wasn't proud. He said he knew what people were thinking: What is wrong with men?\\n\\nOn this line, Burnham did something dramatic: He shrank the frame even more, moving in on Rock like a microscope, so close to him that it obscured part of his head. It's an aggressive move, and one that both underlines the question of what is wrong with men and broadens it, giving this personal story a new weight, especially since it came out just months after the Harvey Weinstein exposé and inevitably evokes the #MeToo movement.\\n\\nA year later, Kevin Hart released a special, Irresponsible, in which he also discussed cheating on his wife. He was more oblique, briefer in his contrition, and the special cut away from him after a joke to show the crowd laughing. Whereas Burnham kept the audience out of it, Irresponsible took a more ingratiating route, with a shot that indicated it was OK to laugh before keeping things moving.\\n\\nRock's extended version remains tougher-minded but moves closer to this posture. He removes the extreme close-up, which, along with its role in drawing attention to the material, is something of a signature Burnham shot. He used it at the start of his direction of Jerrod Carmichael's game-changing special 8 — whose filmic aesthetic inspired Rock to hire him. In place of that touch, Rock adds a new shot, a mouse-eye view of the star from the front of the stage partly obscured by what appears to be a member of the audience. This new angle looks up at a performer, in awe."}
{"original": "CHAPTER ONE\\n\\nNight Train\\n\\n\\n\\nBy MARTIN AMIS\\n\\n\\n\\nHarmony Books\\n\\nRead the Review\\n\\nI am a police. That may sound like an unusual statement--or an unusual construction. But it's a parlance we have. Among ourselves, we would never say I am a policeman or I am a policewoman or I am a police officer. We would just say I am a police. I am a police. I am a police and my name is Detective Mike Hoolihan. And I am a woman, also.\\n\\nWhat I am setting out here is an account of the worst case I have ever handled. The worst case--for me, that is. When you're a police, worst is an elastic concept. You can't really get a fix on worst. The boundaries are pushed out every other day. Worst? we'll ask. There's no such thing as worst. But for Detective Mike Hoolihan this was the worst case.\\n\\nDowntown, at CID, with its three thousand sworn, there are many departments and subdepartments, sections and units, whose names are always changing: Organized Crime, Major Crimes, Crimes Against Persons, Sex Offenses, Auto Theft, Check and Fraud, Special Investigations, Asset Forfeiture, Intelligence, Narcotics, Kidnapping, Burglary, Robbery--and Homicide. There is a glass door marked Vice. There is no glass door marked Sin. The city is the offense. We are the defense. That's the general idea.\\n\\nHere is my personal ten-card. At the age of eighteen I enrolled for a master's in Criminal Justice at Pete Brown. But what I really wanted was the streets. And I couldn't wait. I took tests for state trooper, for border patrol, and even for state corrections officer. I passed them all. I also took the police test, and I passed that, too. I quit Pete and enrolled at the Academy.\\n\\nI started out as a beat cop in the Southern. I was part of the Neighborhood Stabilization Unit in the Forty-Four. We walked foot patrol and did radio runs. Then for five years I was in the Senior Citizens Robbery Unit. Going proactive--decoy and entrapment--was my ticket to plainclothes. Later, another test, and downtown, with my shield. I'm now in Asset Forfeiture, but for eight years I was in Homicide. I worked murders. I was a murder police.\\n\\nA few words about my appearance. The physique I inherited from my mother. Way ahead of her time, she had the look now associated with highly politicized feminists. Ma could have played the male villain in a postnuclear road movie. I copped her voice, too: It has been further deepened by three decades of nicotine abuse. My features I inherited from my father. They are rural rather than urban--flat, undecided. The hair is dyed blonde. I was born and raised in this city, out in Moon Park. But all that went to pieces, when I was ten, and thereafter I was raised by the state. I don't know where my parents are. I'm five-ten and I go 180.\\n\\nSome say you can't top the adrenaline (and the dirty cash) of Narcotics, and all agree that Kidnapping is a million laughs (if murder in America is largely black on black, then kidnapping is largely gang on gang), and Sex Offenses has its followers, and Vice has its votaries, and Intelligence means what it says (Intelligence runs deep, and brings in the deep-sea malefactors), but everyone is quietly aware that Homicide is the daddy. Homicide is the Show.\\n\\nIn this second-echelon American city, mildly famed for its Jap-financed Babel Tower, its harbors and marinas, its university, its futuristically enlightened corporations (computer software, aerospace, pharmaceuticals), its high unemployment, and its catastrophic inner-city taxpayer flight, a homicide police works maybe a dozen murders per year. Sometimes you're a primary investigator on the case, sometimes a secondary. I worked one hundred murders. My clearance rate was just above average. I could read a crime scene, and, more than once, I was described as an exceptional interrogator. My paperwork was outstanding. When I came to CID from the Southern everybody expected my reports to be district quality. But they were downtown quality, right from the start. And I sought to improve still further and gave it a hundred percent. One time I did a very, very competent job, collating two rival accounts of a hot-potato homicide in the Seventy-Three: One witness/suspect versus another witness/suspect. Compared to what you guys give me to read, pronounced Detective Sergeant Henrik Overmars, brandishing my report at the whole squad, this is fucking oratory. It's goddamn Cicero versus Robespierre. I did the work as best I could until I entered my own end-zone and couldn't do it anymore. In my time, I have come in on the aftermath of maybe a thousand suspicious deaths, most of which turned out to be suicides or accidentals or plain unattendeds. So I've seen them all: Jumpers, stumpers, dumpers, dunkers, bleeders, floaters, poppers, bursters. I have seen the bodies of bludgeoned one-year-olds. I have seen the bodies of gang-raped nonagenarians. I have seen bodies left dead so long that your only shot at a t.o.d. is to weigh the maggots. But of all the bodies I have ever seen, none has stayed with me, in my gut, like the body of Jennifer Rockwell.\\n\\nI say all this because I am part of the story I am going to tell, and I feel the need to give some idea of where I'm coming from.\\n\\nAs of today--April second--I consider the case Solved. It's closed. It's made. It's down. But yet the solution only points toward further complexity. I have taken a good firm knot and reduced it to a mess of loose ends. This evening I meet with Paulie No. I will ask him two questions. He will give me two answers. And then it's a wrap. This case is the worst case. I wonder: Is it just me? But I know I'm right. It's all true. It's the case. It's the case. Paulie No, as we say, is a state cutter. He cuts for the state. He dissects people's bodies and tells you how come they died.\\n\\nAllow me to apologize in advance for the bad language, the diseased sarcasm, and the bigotry. All police are racist. It's part of our job. New York police hate Puerto Ricans, Miami police hate Cubans, Houston police hate Mexicans, San Diego police hate Native Americans, and Portland police hate Eskimos. Here we hate pretty well everybody who's non-Irish. Or nonpolice. Anyone can become a police--Jews, blacks, Asians, women--and once you're there you're a member of a race called police, which is obliged to hate every other race.\\n\\nThese papers and transcripts were put together piecemeal over a period of four weeks. I apologize also for any inconsistencies in the tenses (hard to avoid, when writing about the recently dead) and for the informalities in the dialogue presentation. And I guess I apologize for the outcome. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\\n\\nFor me the thing began on the night of March fourth and then evolved day by day and that's how I'm going to tell this part of it.\\n\\nMarch 4\\n\\nThat evening I was alone. My guy Tobe was out of town, attending some kind of computer convention. I hadn't even started on dinner: I was sitting there with my Discuss Group biography open on the couch, next to the ashtray. It was 20:15. I remember the time because I had just been startled out of a nod by the night train, which came through early, as it always does on Sundays. The night train, which shakes the floor I walk on. And keeps my rent way down.\\n\\nThe phone rang. It was Johnny Mac, a.k.a. Detective Sergeant John Macatitch. My colleague in Homicide, who has since made squad supervisor. A great guy and a hell of a detective.\\n\\nMike? he said. I'm going to have to call in a big one.\\n\\nAnd I said, Well, let's hear it.\\n\\nThis is a bad one, Mike. I want you to ride a note for me.\\n\\nNote meant n.o.d.--notification of death. In other words, he wanted me to go tell somebody that somebody close had died. That somebody they loved had died: This was already clear, from his voice. And died suddenly. And violently. I considered. I could have said, I don't do that anymore (though Asset Forfeiture, in fact, is hardly corpse-free). And then we might have had one of those bullshit TV conversations, with him saying You got to help me out and Mike, I'm begging you, and me saying Forget it and No way and Dream on, pal, until everyone is bored blind and I finally come across. I mean, why say no when you have to say yes? For things to proceed. So I just said, again: Well, let's hear it.\\n\\nColonel Tom's daughter killed herself tonight.\\n\\nJennifer? And it just came out. I said: You're fucking me.\\n\\nI wish I was fucking you, Mike. Really. This is as bad as it gets.\\n\\nHow?\\n\\n.22 in the mouth.\\n\\nI waited.\\n\\nMike, I want you to go notify Colonel Tom. And Miriam. This hour.\\n\\nI lit another cigarette. I don't drink anymore but man do I smoke. I said, I've known Jennifer Rockwell since she was eight years old.\\n\\nYeah, Mike. You see? If not you, who?\\n\\nOkay. But you're going to have to take me by the scene.\\n\\nIn the bathroom I applied makeup. Like someone doing a chore. Wiping down a counter. With my mouth meanly clenched. I used to be something, I guess, but now I'm just another big blonde old broad.\\n\\nWithout thinking about it I found I had brought along my notebook, my flashlight, my rubber gloves, and my .38 snub.\\n\\nIn police work you soon get to be familiar with what we call the yeah, right suicide. Where you go in the door, see the body, look around the room, and say, Yeah, right. This was definitely not a yeah-right suicide. I have known Jennifer Rockwell since she was eight years old. She was a favorite of mine. But she was also a favorite of everybody else's. And I watched her grow into a kind of embarrassment of perfection.\\n\\nBrilliant, beautiful. Yeah, I'm thinking: To-die-for brilliant. Drop-dead beautiful. And not intimidating--or only as intimidating as the brilliant-beautiful can't help being, no matter how accessible they seem. She had it all and she had it all, and then she had some more. Her dad's a cop. Her considerably older brothers are cops--both with Chicago PD, Area Six. Jennifer was not a cop. She was an astrophysicist, here at Mount Lee. Guys? She combed them out of her hair, and played the field at CSU. But for the last--Christ, I don't know--seven or eight years, it must be, she was shacked up with another bigbrain and dreamboat: Trader. Professor Trader Faulkner. This was definitely not a yeah-right suicide. This was a no-wrong suicide.\\n\\nJohnny Mac and myself pulled up in the unmarked. Whitman Avenue. Detached and semidetached residences on a wide tree-lined street: An academic dormitory on the edge of the Twenty-Seven. I climbed out in my stretch pants and my low pumps.\\n\\nSo the radio cars and the beat cops were there, and the science crew and the medical examiners were there, and Tony Silvera and Oltan O'Boye were there--inside. And some neighbors. But them you look right through. These uniformed figures were churning under the dome lights. And I knew they swayed to sudden priorities. It was like in the Southern when you keyed the mike and said there was an officer down. Down, in some cases, meaning fucked up forever, in a cross-alley after a chase, on a warehouse floor, or reeling alone around a vanished drug corner with both his hands over his eyes. When somebody close to the murder police starts crafting overtime for the murder police, then special rules apply. This is racial. This is an attack on every last one of us.\\n\\nI badged my way through the tunnel of uniforms around the front door, making the landlady as my best witness or last-to-see. There was a fat full moon reflecting the sun on to my back. Not even Italian police are sentimental about full moons. You're looking at a workload increase of twenty-five to thirty-five percent. A full moon on a Friday night and you're talking a two-hour backup in the emergency room and long lines trailing in and out of Trauma.\\n\\nAt the door to Jennifer's apartment I was met by Silvera. Silvera. He and myself have worked many cases. We have stood together, like this, in many a stricken home. But not quite like this.\\n\\nJesus, Mike.\\n\\nWhere is she?\\n\\nBedroom.\\n\\nYou through? Wait, don't tell me. I'm going in.\\n\\nThe bedroom led off the living room. And I knew where to go. Because I had been to this residence before, maybe a dozen times in half as many years--to drop something off for Colonel Tom, to give Jennifer a ride to a ballgame or a beach party or a function at the Dep Comm's. Her, and once or twice Trader, too. It was like that, a functional kind of friendship, but with good chats in the car. And as I crossed the living room and leaned on the bedroom door I flashed a memory of a couple of summers back, a party Overmars threw after his new deck was done, when I caught Jennifer's eye as she was smiling up from the glass of white wine she'd been nursing all night. (Everyone else apart from me, of course, was completely swacked.) I thought then that here was somebody who had a real talent for happiness. A lot of gratitude in her. I'd need a megaton of scotch to make me burn like that but she looked lovestruck on half a glass of white.\\n\\nI went in and closed the door behind me.\\n\\nThis is how you do it. You kind of wheel around slowly into the scene. Periphery first. Body last. I mean, I knew where she was. My radar went to the bed but she had done it on a chair. In the corner, to my right. Otherwise: Curtains half-drawn against the moonlight, orderly dressing table, tousled sheets, and a faint smell of lust. At her feet, an old black-stained pillowcase and a squirt can of 303.\\n\\nI have said that I am used to being around dead bodies. But I took a full hot flush when I saw Jennifer Rockwell, glazed naked on the chair, her mouth open, her eyes still moist, wearing an expression of childish surprise. The surprise light not heavy, as if she had come across something she'd lost and no longer expected to find. And not quite naked. Oh my. She'd done it with a towel turbaned around her head, like you do to dry your hair. But now of course the towel was wet through and solid red and looked as though it weighed more than any living woman could carry.\\n\\nNo, I didn't touch her. I just made my notes and drew my stick-figure sketch, with professional care--like I was back in the rotation. The .22 lay upside down and almost on its side, propped against the chair leg. Before I left the room I turned off the light for a second with a gloved hand and there were her eyes still moist in the moonlight. Crime scenes you look at like cartoon puzzles in the newspapers. Spot the difference. And something was wrong. Jennifer's body was beautiful--you wouldn't dare pray for a body like that--but something was wrong with it. It was dead.\\n\\nSilvera went in to bag the weapon. Then the crime-lab techs would get her prints and measure distances and take many photographs. And then the ME would come and roll her. And then pronounce her.\\n\\nThe jury is still out on women police. On whether they can take it. Or for how long. On the other hand, maybe it's me: Maybe I'm just another fuckoff. New York PD, for instance, is now fifteen percent female. And all over the country women detectives continue to do outstanding work, celebrated work. But I'm thinking that these must be some very, very exceptional ladies. Many times, when I was in Homicide, I said to myself, Walk away, girl. Ain't nobody stopping you. Just walk away. Murders are men's work. Men commit them, men clean up after them, men solve them, men try them. Because men like violence. Women really don't figure that much, except as victims, and among the bereaved, of course, and as witnesses. Ten or twelve years back, during the arms buildup toward the end of Reagan's first term, when the nuclear thing was on everyone's mind, it seemed to me that the ultimate homicide was coming and one day I'd get the dispatcher's call alerting me to five billion dead: All of them, except you and me. In full consciousness and broad daylight men sat at desks drawing up contingency plans to murder everybody. I kept saying out loud: Where are the women? Where were the women? I'll tell you: They were witnesses. Those straggly chicks in their tents on Greenham Common, England, making the military crazy with their presence and their stares--they were witnesses. Naturally, the nuclear arrangement, the nuclear machine, was strictly men only. Murder is a man thing.\\n\\nBut if there's one aspect of homicide work that women do about a thousand times better than men it's riding a note. Women are good at that--at breaking the news. Men fuck it up because of the way they always handle emotion. They always have to act the n.o.d., so they come on like a preacher or a town crier, or all numb and hypnotized like someone reading off a list of commodity futures or bowling scores. Then halfway through it hits them what they're doing and you can tell they're close to losing it. I've seen beat cops burst out laughing in the face of some poor little schnook whose wife just walked under a Mack truck. At such moments, men realize that they're impostors, and then anything can happen. Whereas I would say that women feel the true weight of the thing immediately and after that it's a difficult event but not an unnatural one. Sometimes, of course, they crack up laughing--I mean the supposedly bereaved. You're just getting into your my-sad-duty routine and they're waking up the neighbors at three in the morning to pop a party.\\n\\nWell, that wasn't going to happen tonight.\\n\\nThe Rockwells' residence is in the northwestern suburbs, out to Blackthorn: Twenty minutes. I had Johnny Macatitch stay in the car while I went around the back way like I normally would when paying a call. I was coming by the side of the house and I paused. To step on my cigarette. To breathe. And I could see them, in through the leaded windows and past the potted plants of the kitchen, Miriam and Colonel Tom, dancing. Dancing the twist, slow, and without a whole lot of bend in the knees, to the lecherous saxophone frying like the dinner in the pan. They clinked glasses. Red wine. Up above the moon throbbed full, and the clouds it raced through seemed to be the moon's clouds rather than our clouds. Yes, an unforgettably beautiful night. And that beauty was part of this story. As if staged for my benefit, like the picture framed by the kitchen window: A forty-year marriage that still had fucking in it. Under a night so sweet it looked like day.\\n\\nWhen you're bringing news of the kind I was bringing there are physical ramifications. The body feels concentrated. The body feels important. It has power, because it brings powerful truth. Say what you like about this news, but it's the truth. It's the truth. It is the case.\\n\\nI rapped on the half-glass back door.\\n\\nColonel Tom turned: Pleased to see me. Not even a little frown of inconvenience, like maybe I was going to take the shine off his evening. But the instant he opened the door I could feel my face collapsing. And I knew what he thought. He thought I was back on it. I mean the booze and all.\\n\\nMike. Jesus, Mike, are you okay?\\n\\nI said, Colonel Tom? Miriam? But Miriam was already falling away and fading from my sight. Falling away at thirty-two feet per second squared. You lost your daughter on this day. You lost your Jennifer.\\n\\nHe looked like he was still trying to smile his way past it. The smile now starting to plead. They had David one year, Yehoshua the next. And then, a decade and a half later: Jennifer.\\n\\nYes she's gone, I said. By her own hand.\\n\\nThis is nuts.\\n\\nColonel Tom, you know I love you and I'd never lie to you. But it seems your baby girl took her own life, sir. Yes she did. Yes she did.\\n\\nThey fetched their coats and we drove downtown. Miriam stayed in the car with Johnny Mac. Colonel Tom made the ID leaning on a freezer door in the ME's office on Battery and Jeff.\\n\\nOltan O'Boye would be riding east, to campus. Taking the news to Trader Faulkner.\\n\\nMarch 5\\n\\nI woke up this morning and Jennifer was standing at the end of my bed. She was waiting for my eyes to open. I looked, and she was gone.\\n\\nThe ghost of a dead person must divide into many ghosts--to begin with. It is labor-intensive--to begin with. Because there are many bedrooms to visit, many sleepers to stand over.\\n\\nSome sleepers--maybe just two or three--the dead will never leave.\\n\\nMarch 6\\n\\nTuesdays I'm working the midnights. So Tuesdays I generally put in an afternoon at the Leadbetter. Attired in a taupe pants suit, I sit in my own office eighteen floors above where Wilmot deadends into Grainge. I am part-time security consultant here and I will go half-time or better when my EoD finally gets to be the mandatory twenty-five behind me. That date--my Entrance on Duty--is September 7, 1974. Retirement is already sniffing me up to see if I'm ripe.\\n\\nThe front desk called to say I had a visitor: Colonel Rockwell. Frankly, I was surprised that he was up and around. My understanding was that the boys were down from Chicago and the phone was off the hook. The Rockwells were digging in.\\n\\nI put aside the CSSS layout I'd been staring at and I did my face. Too, I buzzed Linda, asking her to greet the elevator and bring the Colonel right on in.\\n\\nHe entered.\\n\\nHey, Colonel Tom.\\n\\nI stepped forward but he seemed to take a pass on the hug I was offering him and he kept his chin down as we slid off his coat. The head staying low when he sat in the leather chair. I went back of my desk and said,\\n\\nHow goes it with you, Colonel Tom? My dear.\\n\\nHe shrugged. He exhaled slowly. He looked up. And I saw what you seldom see in the grief-struck. Panic. A primitive panic, a low-IQ panic, in the eyes--it makes you consider the meaning of the word hare-brained. And it made me panic. I thought: He's in a nightmare and now I am too. What do I do if he starts screaming? Start screaming? Should everybody start screaming?\\n\\nHow is Miriam?\\n\\nVery quiet, he said, after a while.\\n\\nI waited. Take your time, Colonel, I said. I thought it might be a good idea to do something null and soothing, like maybe get to some bills. Say as much as you want or as little as you want.\\n\\nTom Rockwell was Squad Supervisor during much of my time in Homicide. That was before he climbed into his personal express elevator and pushed the button marked Penthouse. In the space of ten years he made lieutenant as Shift Commander, then captain in charge of Crimes Against Persons, then full colonel as head of CID. He's brass now: He isn't a police, he's a politician, juggling stats and budgets and PR. He could make Dep Comm for Operations. Christ, he could make Mayor. It's all head-doctoring and kissing ass, he once said to me. You know what I am? I'm not a cop. I'm a communicator. But now Colonel Tom, the communicator, just sat there, very quietly.\\n\\nMike. There's something went on here.\\n\\nAgain I waited.\\n\\nSomething's wrong.\\n\\nI feel that too, I said.\\n\\nThe diplomatic response--but his eyes leveled in.\\n\\nWhat's your read on it, Mike? Not as a friend. As a police.\\n\\nAs a police? As a police I have to say that it looks like a suicide, Colonel Tom. But it could have been an accident. There was the rag there, and the 303. You think maybe she was cleaning it and...\\n\\nHe flinched. And of course I understood. Yeah. What was she doing with the .22 in her mouth? Maybe tasting it. Tasting death. And then she--\\n\\nIt's Trader, he said. It has to be Trader.\\n\\nWell, this demanded some time to settle. Okay: Now: It is sometimes true that an apparent suicide will, on inspection, come back a homicide. But that inspection takes about two seconds. It is ten o'clock on a Saturday night, in Destry or Oxville. Some jig has just blown his chick to bits with a shotgun. But a couple of spikes later he hatches a brilliant scheme: He'll make it look like she did it. So he gives the weapon a wipe and props her up on the bed or wherever. He might even muster the initiative to scrawl out a note, in his own fair hand. We used to have one of these notes tacked to the squadroom noticeboard. It read: Good By Crule Whirld. Well this is some sad shit, Marvis, you say when you get there, responding to Marvis's call. What happened? And Marvis says, She was depress. Discreetly, Marvis leaves the room. He's done his bit. What more can a man do? Now it's our turn. You glance at the corpse: There's no burn or shell wadding in the wound and the blood spatter is on the wrong pillow. And the wrong wall. You follow Marvis into the kitchen and he's standing there with a glassine bag in one hand and a hot spoon in the other. Homicide. Heroin. Nice, Marvis. Come on. Downtown. Because you're a murdering piece of shit. And a degenerate motherfucker. That's why. A homicide come dressed to the ball as a suicide: This you expect from a braindead jackboy in the Seventy-Seven. But from Trader Faulkner, Associate Professor of Philosophy of Science at CSU? Please. The smart murder just never happens. That's all bullshit. That's all so...pathetic. The Professor did it. Oh, sure. Murder is dumb and then even dumber. Only two things will make you any good at it: Luck and practice. If you're dealing with the reasonably young and healthy, and if the means is violent, then the homicide/suicide gray area is TV, is bullshit, is ketchup. Make no mistake, we would see it if it was there--because we want suicides to be homicides. We would infinitely prefer it. A made homicide means overtime, a clearance stat, and high fives in the squadroom. And a suicide is no damn use to anyone.\\n\\nThis isn't me, I thought. This isn't me, sitting here. I'm not around.\\n\\nTrader?\\n\\nTrader. He was there, Mike. He was the last to see. I'm not saying he...But it's Trader. Trader owns her. It's Trader.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nWho else?\\n\\nI sat back, away from this. But then he went on, saying in his tethered voice,\\n\\nCorrect me if I'm wrong. Did you ever meet anybody happier than Jennifer? Did you ever hear about anybody happier than Jennifer? More stable? She was, she was sunny.\\n\\nNo you're not wrong, Colonel Tom. But the minute you really go into someone. You and I both know that there's always enough pain.\\n\\nThere wasn't any--\\n\\nHere his voice gave a kind of hiccup of fright. And I thought he must be imagining her last moments. It took him a few swallows, and then he continued:\\n\\nPain. Why was she naked, Mike? Jennifer. Miss Modest. Who never even owned a bikini. With her figure.\\n\\nExcuse me, sir, is the case being worked? Is Silvera on it? What?\\n\\nI stetted it, Mike. It's pending. Because I'm going to ask you to do something for me.\\n\\nTV, etcetera, has had a terrible effect on perpetrators. It has given them style. And TV has ruined American juries for ever. And American lawyers. But TV has also fucked up us police. No profession has been so massively fictionalized. I had a bunch of great lines ready. Like: I was quit when you came in here. I'm twice as quit now. But this was Colonel Tom I was talking to. So I spoke the plain truth.\\n\\nYou saved my life. I'd do anything for you. You know that.\\n\\nHe reached down for his briefcase. From it he removed a folder. Jennifer Rockwell. H97143. He held it out toward me, saying,\\n\\nBring me something I can live with. Because I can't live with this.\\n\\nNow he let me look at him. The panic had left his eyes. As for what remained, well, I've seen it a thousand times. The skin is matte, containing not a watt of light. The stare goes nowhere into the world. It cannot penetrate. Seated on the other side of the desk, I was already way out of range.\\n\\nIt's a little fucked up, ain't it, Colonel Tom?\\n\\nYeah, it's a little fucked up. But it's the way we're going to do this.\\n\\nI leaned back and said experimentally, I keep trying to think it through. You're sitting there kind of idling around with it--with the weapon. Cleaning it. Toying with it. Then a perverse thought. An infantile thought. I mean, that's how an intelligent infant finds out about something: It puts it in its mouth. You put it in your mouth. You--\\n\\nIt wasn't an accident, Mike, he said, standing. That's precluded by the evidence. Expect a package this time tomorrow.\\n\\nHe nodded at me. This package, his nod seemed to say, was going to straighten me out.\\n\\nWhat is it, Colonel Tom?\\n\\nSomething for your VCR.\\n\\nAnd I thought, Oh, Jesus. Don't tell me. The young lovers in their designer dungeon. I could just see it. The young lovers, in their customized correctional facility--Trader in his Batman suit, and Jennifer shackled to her rack, wearing nothing but feathers and tar.\\n\\nBut Colonel Tom soon put my mind at rest.\\n\\nIt's the autopsy, he said.\\n\\n(C) 1997 Martin Amis All Rights Reserved ISBN: 0-609-60128-8"}

{"original": "August 27, 1974 OBITUARY Daring Lindbergh Attained the Unattainable With Historic Flight Across Atlantic By ALDEN WHITMAN In Paris at 10:22 P.M. on May 21, 1927, Charles Augustus Lindbergh, a one-time Central Minnesota farm boy, became an international celebrity. A fame enveloped the 25-year-old American that was to last him for the remainder of his life, transforming him in a frenzied instant from an obscure aviator into a historical figure. The consequences of this fame were to exhilarate him, to involve him in profound grief, to engage him in fierce controversy, to turn him into an embittered fugitive from the public, to accentuate his individualism to the point where he became a loner, to give him a special sense of his own importance, to allow him to play an enormous role in the growth of commercial aviation as well as to be a figure in missile and space technology, to give him influence in military affairs, and to raise a significant voice for conservation, a concern that marked his older years. All these things were touched off when a former stunt flier and airmail pilot touched down the wheels of his small and delicate monoplane, the Spirit of St. Louis, on the tarmac of LeBourget 33 1/2 hours after having lifted the craft off Roosevelt Field on Long Island. Thousands--no one knows how many--trampled through fences and over guards to surround the silvery plane and to acclaim, in a wild outburst of emotion, the first man to fly the Atlantic solo nonstop from the United States to Europe--a feat that was equivalent in the public mind then to the first human step on the moon 42 years later. Icarus had at last succeeded, a daring man alone had attained the unattainable. What enhanced the fear for many was that Lindbergh was a tall, handsome bachelor with a becoming smile, an errant lock of blond hair over his forehead and a pleasing outward modesty and guilelessness. He was the flawless El Cid, the gleaming Galahad, Frank Merriwell in the flesh. The delirium that engulfed Paris swirled out over the civilized world. Banner headlines heralded the event. Medals galore were bestowed on Lindbergh. He was gushed over, adulated, worshiped, feted in France, Belgium and Britain. President Calvin Coolidge sent the cruiser Memphis, flagship of the United States European Fleet, to bring him and the Spirit of St. Louis back to the United States and later awarded him the Medal of Honor, previously reserved only for military heroes. And already a captain in the United States Officers Reserve Corps, Lindbergh was jumped to a full colonel. As the cruiser steamed up Chesapeake Bay, she was met by four destroyers, two Army blimps and 40 airplanes from the Army, Navy and Marine Corps. Debarking at Washington in a civilian's blue serge suit, Lindbergh was glorified by the President, who said that the trans- Atlantic flight was the same story of valor and victory by a son of the people that shines through every page of American history. The panoplied Washington reception, which was topped by an award--the first in the nation's history--of the Distinguished Flying Cross, was followed by an even noisier outpouring in New York, where four million people spilled into the streets. Ticker tape and confetti rained on the Broadway parade, and the day was climaxed by a banquet for 4,000 guest. We measure heroes as we do ships, by their displacement, the bewhiskered Charles Evans Hughes told the multitude. Colonel Lindbergh has displaced everything. And then there were triumphal parades and receptions, seemingly endless, in other cities. Lindbergh eventually flew the Spirit of St. Louis to every state in the Union. Everywhere he went a throng collected. Even a supposedly private visit to Orville Wright, co-inventor of the airplane, was noised about and crowds appeared. Lindbergh, at one point, was so filled up with listening to this hero guff that I was ready to shout murder. What the parades, the pandemonium, the oratory, the hero worship obscured was that Lindbergh's epic flight was a most minutely planned venture by a professional flier with 2,000 air hours amassed over five years. Why shouldn't I fly from New York to Paris? he had asked himself in September, 1926. I have more than four years of aviation behind me. I've barnstormed over half of the 48 states. I've flown my mail through the worst of nights. There had been two previous Atlantic flights--both in 1919, the first when one of three Navy craft flew from Newfoundland to the Azores; and the second when John Alcock and Arthur Brown made it from Newfoundland to Ireland. But no one had made the crossing alone, or from continent to continent. Once he conceived the notion of the flight, Lindbergh, with characteristic energy, began to elaborate the details. He helped design the plane to his specifications, calculating every ounce that went into it. He laid out his route. Every foreseeable circumstance was checked out. Two elements could not be figured: the weather and his ability to stay awake. With the weather he took a calculated risk. Fighting off sleep proved a problem, and only his indomitable determination overcame that, although he conceded there were moments of touch-and-go. One of the attractions for the Paris flight was a $25,000 prize, for which there were several competitors, among them Clarence Chamberlin and Adm. Richard E. Byrd. Lindbergh, though, was confident he could be first and be successful. He was motivated, he told this writer in later years, by a desire to improve his standing as a pilot as well as by an eagerness to win the prize. And although there was great interest in him before take-off time (his hope and that of his rivals to fly the Atlantic had excited wide newspaper coverage), Lindbergh had not calculated the response to his achievement, the degree to which he would be lionized or the extent to which he would be regarded as public property, especially by reporters and photographers, whom he came quickly to detest. 'Extraordinary Situation' The situation I encountered was extraordinary in the extreme, and often fantastic, he recalled, and cited, as an example, a woman who wanted to rent the hotel room I was leaving so she could take a bath in the same tub. Overwhelmed, without precedents to guide him, pressed by dizzying demands on his time, Lindbergh was happy to accept an invitation from Harry Guggenheim, a very rich and very conservative financier who was connected with the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics, to escape for a while to his Long Island estate. The invitation was at the suggestion of Dwight Morrow, the Morgan banker, who told Mr. Guggenheim, Harry, almost everyone in the country is after this young fellow, trying to exploit him. Isn't there something you and the fund can do, to save him from the wolves? At Falaise, the Guggenheim castle, which was perhaps the most opulent private home he had stayed in, the aviator was able to catch his breath for three weeks and rewrite the ghostwritten manuscript that became the book We. He also retained Henry Breckinridge, a conservative Wall Street lawyer, to help handle his affairs. Many of his new associates held conservative views, which his father, a neo-Populist Republican, spent 20 years fighting. Lindbergh was not conceived of then as a possible political figure, but rather as a nice young man, perhaps a little unpolished socially, who deserved the best that could be provided. His new friends were considerate of his strong individualism. They did not impose flattery, they were respectful and, above all, helpful. The income from We and from his flight articles in The New York Times made him a millionaire--a considerable eminence for a man accustomed to thinking hard before he spent $5. His friends helped him invest his fortune. And after Lindbergh made his goodwill flights around the country and to Latin America in the Spirit of St. Louis, his friends saw to it that he got a job in keeping with his interest in aviation and his status. The position was as an adviser in both Pan American World Airways and the predecessor of Trans World Airlines in laying out transatlantic, transcontinental and Caribbean air routes for the commercial aviation that his Paris flight had done so much to popularize. The conservative views that Lindbergh later articulated, the remarks about Jews that proved so startling when he was opposing American entry into World War II, his adverse opinion of the Soviet Union, his belief in Western civilization--these were all a reflection of a world view prevalent among his friends, which he absorbed over the years. An engineer and aviator of genius, he was, however, not an intellectual, nor a consistent reader, nor a social analyst. The assumption of this elitism accounted for his conviction that America should lead the world in the development of flight, that a conflict between English and German groups of nations would [be] a fratricidal war, that race was a valid judgmental concept and that to accomplish an objective one should deal with the top people. It also accounted for what many people thought was his anti-Semitism. Lindbergh did not regard himself as an anti-Semite. Indeed, he was shocked a couple of years ago when this writer put the question to him. Good God, no, he responded, citing his fondness for Jews he had known or dealt with. Nor did he condone the Nazi treatment of German Jews, much less Hitler's genocidal policies. On the other hand, he accepted as fact that American Jewish groups were among those promoting United States involvement in World War II. He voiced these views in a speech in Des Moines, Iowa, on Sept. 11, 1941. After asserting that those groups responsible for seeking American entanglement in European affairs were the British, the Jewish and the Roosevelt Administration, he went on to say: It is not difficult to understand why Jewish people desire the overthrow of Nazi Germany. The persecution they suffered in Germany would be sufficient to make bitter enemies of any race. No person with a sense of the dignity of mankind can condone the persecution the Jewish race suffered in Germany. But no person of honesty and vision can look on their prowar policy here today without seeing the dangers involved in such a policy, both for us and for them. Instead of agitating for war, the Jewish groups in this country should be opposing it in every possible way, for they will be among the first to feel its consequences. Tolerance is a virtue that depends upon peace and strength. A few far-sighted Jewish people realize this and stand opposed to intervention. But the majority still do not. Their greatest danger to their country lies in their large ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio and our government. The speech evoked a nationwide outcry. Lindbergh, it was said, had not only impugned the patriotism of American Jews, but also had used the word race, a word many Jews considered both pejorative and inaccurate. Lindbergh never withdrew his remarks, which he considered statements of obvious fact. The violence of the reaction to my naming these groups was significant and extremely interesting, he said 25 years later. In hindsight, I would not change my action. Lindbergh's attitude toward the Jews was matched by an adamantine stubbornness on other matters. These together sometimes cast him in an unfavorable public light. One example of his unwillingness to concede that he might have acted unwisely involved the Service Cross of the German Eagle, a civilian medal that was awarded him in 1938 by Hermann Goering, the Nazi leader, at the direction of Hitler. The presentation, a surprise to Lindbergh, was made at a stag dinner in the home of the American Ambassador to Berlin and was, he was told, in recognition of his services to aviation, especially his 1927 flight. The award was reported briefly in the newspapers and stirred little criticism. However, the night of the award Mrs. Lindbergh told her husband that it was the albatross, and she urged him to return it. Lindbergh took the position then and later that to do so would affront the Ambassador and Goering, as well, who was technically his host in Germany. Although he never wore the medal (he gave it to the Lindbergh collection of the Missouri Historical Society in St. Louis, along with other awards and trophies), it became an issue when he opposed American war involvement. It led, among other things, to his being called a Fascist sympathizer, particularly when he declined a suggestion in 1942 to repudiate it; and the medal plagued his reputation for the rest of his life. He disdained the criticism, however, saying: Personally, I am not at all concerned about any damage that may have been done to my reputation by the presentation of the medal. I felt the throwing back of the medal was like taking part in a child's spitting contest. If I must fight, I'll fight; but I prefer not to spit at my enemy beforehand. Also, I felt Goering had given me the medal with good intent and in friendship. Regardless of how much I disagreed with him about other things, or later on, I did not want to throw it back in his face. Nonetheless, Lindbergh, in his later years, was defensive in reciting the medal episode and sensitive in having it known that his wife was among his critics. Like most people, Lindbergh was a bundle of unresolved contradictions. Stubborn, proud, unable to see how Jews might be offended by obvious facts, blind to the villainies of Hitlerism, he was, in his relationships with his few close friends, a considerate, delightful, sensitive, helpful, unpretentious person who did not obtrude his social and political views, nor make agreeing with them a condition of steadfast friendship. Although he was the object of much flattery and one who succumbed to some of it, he did not like a fuss made over him. He sometimes sounded pompous in print, but he was not in person. Indeed, he was a man of genuinely simple tastes who was happier in a sleeping bag than in a luxury hotel, who preferred eating wild boar with his fingers in the jungle to dining in expensive restaurants, who found more inner satisfaction with primitive than with sophisticated people and who was more at ease in knockabout attire than in street dress. Lindbergh's life, like his personality, was full of shadows and enigmas. Born Feb. 4, 1902, in Detroit, he was the son of C. A. Lindbergh, a prosperous Little Falls, Minn., lawyer and land speculator, and his second wife, Evangeline Lodge Land. The elder Lindbergh's first wife had died, leaving him two daughters. Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr. was born in Detroit because his mother's uncle was a physician there. He was returned to Little Falls six weeks later and lived in that small town, the center of a farming and timbering community, with few interruptions until he was 18. His paternal antecedents were Swedes, who changed their name from Mansons to Lindbergh when they emigrated from Sweden in 1860. They had a history of independence and vigor. The Lands, of Irish and English background, arrived in the United States shortly after 1812. Lindbergh's maternal grandfather was C. H. Land, a dentist and inventor. Both Dr. Land and C. A. Lindbergh were strong advocates of free inquiry and individual initiative, and both impressed on young Charles the merits of personal independence. Lindbergh's youth was spent close to nature. His deep feeling for it was encouraged by his father, and these early attitudes surfaced toward the end of his life when he devoted much of his fantastic energies to the cause of conservation. Also early in life, he showed a marked aptitude for mechanical contrivances. When he was 8 or 9, he worked out an ingenious and complicated system for getting ice from the icehouse into the icebox. Charles's world was jolted when his father was elected to the House of Representatives, where he served from 1907 to 1917. He went to Washington, his first venture into a metropolis, and disliked it. About that time, his mother and father ceased living together, although for appearance's sake there was no legal separation and both parents took care to give the child a sense of security. Apart from saying that the separation was a tragic situation for his parents, Lindbergh shut his lips about the situation and shied from talking about the psychic hurts that he bore. He was equally taciturn on other personal matters. The future aviator's interest in flying was sparked in 1908 or '09, when, one day, he heard a buzzing in the sky and climbed out of a dormer window onto the roof of his home to witness a frail biplane skimming through the clouds. The Fun of Flying Afterward, I remember lying in the grass and looking up at the clouds and thinking how much fun it would be to fly up there among those clouds, he recalled in later years, adding: I didn't think of the hazards--I was just interested in getting up there in the clouds. But he was torn for a time by a strong yearning to go to Alaska, a land pictured as wild frontier and the source of mythic Gold Rush tales. For him Alaska was also the scene of Robert W. Service's verse, some of which he memorized so thoroughly that he could recite it faultlessly in old age. Although Lindbergh Sr. led an active and exciting political life as a maverick Republican who battled (and helped to overthrow) the entrenched Establishment in the House, led an assault on the money trust and voted against American entry into World War I, his son was bored by politics and all the speeches. The issue that his father espoused in Congress and later as a Farmer-Laborite supporter of Robert LaFollette failed, so the son said, to make any impressions on him. His mother, too, eschewed political thinking. In World War I, Lindbergh operated the family farm, leaving it in the fall of 1920 to study engineering at the University of Wisconsin. His grades were poor and he left after a year and a half, but not before learning how to shoot quarters out of the outstretched fingers of his friend at 50 feet with a rifle. From Wisconsin, he motorcycled to the Nebraska Aircraft Corporation in Lincoln, which was then producing an airplane and giving flying lessons to promote the product. I can still smell the odor of dope [cellulose acetate or nitrate] that permeated each breath, he said years later in recalling his first close-up view of an aircraft. Lindbergh took his first flight April 9, 1922. In succeeding months he learned to fly, to wing- walk and to parachute. Of equal importance, he absorbed all there was to know about the planes of that day and the various styles of flying. And he made friends with fliers who passed through Lincoln and with Harlan A. (Bud) Gurney, with whom, among others, he barnstormed over the Midwest. Called Slim by his friends because of his lithe, gangling body and 6-foot-2 1/2-inch height, Lindbergh was billed to the public as Daredevil Lindbergh for his stunt feats. However, he did not solo until April, 1923, when he purchased his first plane, a Jenny, in Georgia. Shortly afterward he began to earn his living as a flier by taking up passengers in various towns at $5 a ride. It was all seat-of-the-pants flying and Lindbergh gloried in it; but he gave it up to enlist in the Army in March, 1924, so he could attend the Army flying school at Brooks Field, San Antonio, Tex. For the first time, he found some joy in textbooks and classes. Chief Pilot on Mail Run Indeed, he was graduated as the top man in his class, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army Air Service Reserve in March, 1925. He was by this time an experienced flier. He spent some time as an air circus stunt flier at county fairs and the like before being hired by the Robertson Aircraft Company of St. Louis as the chief pilot on the mail run to Chicago. He made the first run in April, 1926. It was the only paycheck job in the normal sense of the word that he ever held. Meantime, he had made a further commitment to the military by joining the Missouri National Guard, where he taught other pilots and became a first lieutenant. On one of his flights to Chicago in September, 1926, he was musing about the possibilities of long-distance trips, and he startled himself by thinking I could fly nonstop between New York and Paris. In many ways, Lindbergh's life was a series of responses to imperatives. When he became convinced that he ought to do something--he ought to oppose entry into World War II, he ought to speak out for conservation--he reacted with vigor and dispatch. And virtually immediately he began to plan the details of the trip--getting financial backing, getting a specially designed plane, mapping the route, seeking to eliminate any chance of failure. Ultimately, he persuaded a group of St. Louis businessmen to put up $15,000, which was one reason why the plane was called the Spirit of St. Louis. After many racking incidents, the Ryan Company, with Lindbergh's help, designed and built a craft tailored for him and the Wright Company built an engine of 223 horsepower to accommodate the plane. For several years after the Paris flight, Lindbergh lived in the glare of publicity and popping camera flashbulbs. The public would not let him alone. I recall steeping out of a building on Wall Street, and having almost everyone on the street turn and follow me, he said. He was regarded as a sort of oracle, and his opinion was solicited on every conceivable subject. He was, moreover, linked falsely in the press with a number of girls. His interest, however, was in Anne Spencer Morrow, the beautiful blue-eyed daughter of Dwight Morrow, then Ambassador to Mexico. The couple met in Mexico City at Christmastime in 1927, when Miss Morrow, then a Smith student, went there for the holidays. They were married in a private ceremony in the Morrow home in New Jersey on May 27, 1929. The marriage was union of opposites. Sensitive, retiring, a poet, Mrs. Lindbergh wanted nothing so much as a life of peace and quiet. Seldom coddling her, her husband proved hyperactive, happy as a nomad who was rarely at home for long periods. Yet despite some moments of tension, the marriage was an enduring and affectionate one. For a while Mrs. Lindbergh accompanied her husband on many of his trips--to the Caribbean, where he was laying out air routes; to Europe and to Asia. He had taught her to fly, and she learned to navigate and to operate a Morse Code radio. North to the Orient is her chronicle of one of these flights. Their first child, Charles Augustus 3d, was born June 24, 1930. Twenty months later, when Mrs. Lindbergh was pregnant with her second child, the baby was kidnapped from his nursery crib in his parent's home in Hopewell, N. J. The date was March 1, 1932. On May 12 the baby's body was found in a shallow grave not far from the house. In between, there was a bizarre hunt for the child that included payment of a $50,000 ransom at a cemetery in the Bronx and a cast of characters that ranged from Dr. John F. (Jafsie) Condon, a school principal, to Gaston B. Means, a swindler. There were false leads and sensations galore, through all of which Lindbergh bore himself with great public stoicism. His private emotions were never disclosed, and about the only references that he made in later years to the kidnapping and murder were fleeting mentions of that New Jersey business. If public attention glared on Lindbergh during the hunt for his son, it positively poured down on him with the arrest and trial of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a Bronx carpenter, in 1934. The trial, which Lindbergh attended daily, was reported with diligence and sensationalism. Lindbergh received up to 100,000 letters a week, and the Hopewell estate, which he had long since left, was overrun with curiosity seekers, one of whom dug up and lugged off the earth where the baby was found buried. A Move to England After a six-week trial, in which a web of circumstantial evidence was women about Hauptmann, he was found guilty and executed. Although there were doubts (Hauptmann, the German-born father of a son about the age of Lindbergh's son, denied he was guilty), Lindbergh was satisfied that Hauptmann did the thing. Meantime, there were new threats to kidnap Lindbergh's second son, Jon, and the family was living an abnormal existence. Lindbergh was telling friends that Americans exhibited a morbid curiosity over crimes and murder trials and lacked respect for law, or the rights of others. Against this background, Lindbergh took his family to England to seek a safe, secluded residence away from the tremendous public hysteria that surrounded him in the United States. One result of the case was passage of the so-called Lindbergh law, which made kidnapping a Federal crime. Part of the statute was ruled unconstitutional in 1967. Before departing, Lindbergh completed a scientific project on which he had been working with dedication and enthusiasm since 1930. It was the design and building of a tissue-perfusion apparatus at Rockefeller Institute (now University) in New York. He was introduced to the project by Dr. Alexis Carrel, who had won the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1912 for development of blood vessel transplant procedures. The French-born Carrel was interested in the thirties in living organs outside the body, and the problem was to devise an instrument to perfuse these organs and keep them alive. For me, Lindbergh recalled, that began an association with an extraordinarily great man. To me, his true greatness lay in the unlimited penetration, curiosity and scope of his mind, in his fearlessness of opinion, in his deep concerns about the trends of modern civilization and their effect on his fellow man. In addition to perfecting a pump--an important breakthrough in its time--Lindbergh invented a quick way of separating serum from whole blood by means of a centrifuge. The Lindbergh- Carrel friendship lasted for 14 years, until the scientist's death in 1944. A brilliant investigator, Carrel tinkered with philosophy and other matters; and his thoughts in these areas were sometimes quirky. He believed, for example, in extrasensory perception. He also spoke against industrial civilization and suggested that we ought to try to produce a certain number of individuals above the mental stature we observe in the best. He said, moreover, that only the elite make the progress of the masses possible. Some of these notions rubbed off on Lindbergh and were reflected in his little-known book, Of Flight and Life, in which he inveighed against scientific materialism. In this 1948 book, he said, I believe the values we are creating and the standards we are now following will lead to the end of our civilization, and that if we do not control our science by a higher moral force, it will destroy us with its materialistic values. In his plea for the recognition of metaphysical values, Lindbergh wrote: To progress, even to survive, we must learn to apply the truth of God to the actions and relationships of men, to the direction of our science. We must learn from the sermons of Christ, the wisdom of Laotzu, the teachings of Buddha. But Lindbergh, in this book, also espoused a doctrine of American superiority in the world. For Americans, the doctrine of universal equality is a doctrine of death, he wrote. If we ever become an equal people among other peoples of the world, our civilization will fall. When Lindbergh went abroad to live, first in Britain and then in France, he was 33 years old. He was immediately treated with courtesy and respect--and given the privacy he so much desired. His new friends were in the upper reaches of British society and Tory politics. Moreover, as a distinguished aviator, he was invited to visit airplane factories in France by the French Air Ministry. He was also invited by the German Government to inspect the Luftwaffe and warplane factories in the Reich. He received red-carpet treatment, visited many factories and was told repeatedly that the Nazis were eager to create an air force second to none. He visited Germany several times before 1938 and was increasingly impressed with the quality of the air force. It seemed to him all the more fearsome by comparison with the air arm in Britain, France and the Soviet Union. By 1939 he had concluded that the power of the Luftwaffe was overwhelming, and that the air forces of other European countries were comparatively insignificant. In off-the- record conversations with the leaders of these countries, the Soviet Union excepted, he sought to warn them of the perils they were facing. Neither then nor later did Lindbergh, according to his journals, believe that German air power would be the decisive factor in a war so much as it would be an essential element. And he sought to impress on France, Britain and the United States the need to bestir themselves. Lindbergh and his family returned to the United States in 1939 shortly before World War II broke out. He felt he ought to do all he could to prevent American involvement. Not a pacifist nor an isolationist, he was a noninterventionist. My opposition to World War II resulted from the growing conviction that such a war would probably devastate Europe, kill millions of men and possibly result in the end of Western civilization, he told this writer a few years ago, adding: Under the circumstances of prewar Europe, I concluded that Germany could not be defeated without the active intervention of the United States. I doubted that Germany could be defeated even with American intervention. Obviously this depended a great deal on the relationship between Germany and Russia. But if Germany were defeated, it seemed to me almost certain that Russia would be the real victor and that a Stalin-dominated Europe would be even worse than a Hitler-dominated Europe. I felt that the wisest policy for Western powers would be to arm, stay neutral and let Germany and Russia clash--and thereafter to feel their way according to changing circumstances. I still think this would have been the wisest policy. Lindbergh made his first antiwar speech--a radio talk--on Sept. 17, 1939. It was arranged by Fulton Lewis, a well-known conservative commentator. In the months that followed, he made other radio speeches and worded actively with other antiwar personalities in public and private life, including Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana; Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia; former President Herbert Hoover; Senator William Borah of Idaho; Henry Ford; Merwin K. Hart, an avowed right-winger; William Castle, a diplomat; Dean Carl Ackerman of the Columbia Journalism School; Theodore Roosevelt Jr.; and James E. Van Zandt, head of the American Legion. Lindbergh spoke and worked under his own auspices until April, 1941, when he joined the national board of the America First Committee, the country's principal antiwar group. Although its membership was heterogeneous, its effective leadership rested with Robert E. Wood, board chairman of Sears, Roebuck & Co., and Robert R. McCormick, publisher of The Chicago Tribune. Both were archconservatives and zealous haters of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. America First was strongest in the Midwest, the traditional seat of the nation's isolationist attitudes; but it was also a powerful force in New York and Boston. Popular support for its antiwar objectives was widespread, and Lindbergh epitomized that support. He rallied millions to the cause with such effectiveness that Roosevelt considered him a major threat. The President vented his anger at a news conference in April, 1941. Roosevelt was asked why he did not call Lindbergh, an Army officer, into uniform. The reason, he replied, was that Lindbergh was a defeatist, and he went on to compare him with Representative Clement L. Vallandigham, a Civil War Congressman from Ohio, the chief spokesman of a group called the Copperheads, who said the North could never win. Roosevelt's attack was perhaps set off by a Lindbergh magazine article that declared, While our leaders have shouted for peace, they have consistently directed us toward war. 'Insult From Roosevelt' Considering his honor impugned, Lindbergh resigned his commission. If I did not tender my resignation, he said in the published version of his Wartime Journals, I would lose something in my own character that means even more to me than my commission in the Air Corps. No one else would know it, but I would. And if I take this insult from Roosevelt, more, and worse, will probably be forthcoming. Thirty years later Lindbergh still felt wronged by the President, and professed not to see that he himself had questioned Roosevelt's integrity. With Pearl Harbor, America First collapsed and Lindbergh sought to join the armed forces. Now that we are at war I want to contribute as best I can to my country's war effort, he wrote. It is vital for us to carry on this was as intelligently, as constructively, and as successfully as we can, and I want to do my part. His bid to soldier was rebuffed, however, an action for which he blamed Roosevelt personally. Lindbergh, then 39, joined the Ford Motor Company as a consultant, working at the Willow Run plant in Michigan, which was producing bombers. Later he was a consultant to the United Aircraft Corporation, attached chiefly to its Vought-Sikorsky Division in Stratford, Conn. Vought was producing the Navy Corsair F4U. As part of his job, he traveled to the Pacific war area in 1944 to study the Corsair under service conditions, and, as a civilian, flew 50 missions against the Japanese. The flier had at least one very close brush with death in a dogfight near Biak Island. He described this and other episodes in The Wartime Journals, and they constitute the best writing in the book. After the war, Lindbergh went to Germany for the Naval Technical Mission in Europe to study developments in Nazi aircraft and missiles. He had been interested in rocketry since 1929, when he sought out Dr. Robert Goddard, then an obscure physics professor at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. (Goddard, who had been ridiculed for his ideas, has since been recognized as a space flight pioneer.) Lindbergh was always proud of his association with Goddard and of having raised money to fund his experiments. For 16 years until his death in 1945, Goddard, also a loner, received Lindbergh's help and encouragement; and Goddard's basic rocketry patents were used in the development of United States missiles after the war. The aviator's crucial assistance to Goddard did not become well known until Goddard's biography was published in 1963, a book for which Lindbergh wrote an introduction. For more than 15 years after the war Lindbergh virtually disappeared from the news. He was a member of Army Ordnance's CHORE project at the University of Chicago; he was consultant to the Secretary of the Air Force; he took part in the reorganization of the Strategic Air Command; and he was a member of scientific ballistic-missile committees of the Air Force and the Defense Department. In 1954, he was commissioned a brigadier general in the Air Force Reserve. Much of the aviator's work in these years dealt with security-classified projects; but it is believed that he was active in rocketry and space flight programs, where his technical expertise was valuable. He enjoyed top-secret clearance, and spoke of his tasks as having to do with security. In this period, Lindbergh completed his autobiographical account of his 1927 flight, which had been written in bits and pieces in various parts of the world over 14 years. The Spirit of St. Louis, published in 1953, won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1954 and was made into a movie three years later, with James Stewart as the lead. The book was intended to supersede We, which, written in haste, had never satisfied the aviator as an accurate account of his flight. Starting sometime after the war, he rejoined Pan American as a consultant for the nominal fee of $600 a month. The job, which eventually led to his working on the design specifications for the Boeing 747, allowed him great freedom to travel and to develop any interest he chose. And travel he did, seemingly having no settled abode. In Africa, in 1964, he found an interest that was to occupy his last years and to bring him out of his public reticence and reclusiveness. The issue was conservation. Lying under an acacia tree with the sounds of the dawn around me, he recalled, I realized more clearly the facts that man should never overlook: that the construction of an airplane, for instance, is simple when compared to the evolutionary achievement of a bird; that airplanes depend on an advanced civilization, and that where civilization is most advanced few birds exist. I realized that if I had to choose, I would rather have birds than airplanes. He concluded, he said, that I ought to do something. Concern for Environment That imperative, which unfolded slowly, led him to activity in conservation organizations, to having a large hand in saving the humpback and the blue whales, to concern for endangered species and to public advocacy of steps to save the world's environment. He made his first public speech in 1968--the first since 1941--to the Alaska Legislature. The following year he granted what amounted to his first newspaper interview in 35 years. This was to The New York Times and this writer, the occasion being his conservation activity in the Philippines. There was anther interview in 1970, again in the Philippines, but centering on his concern for primitive peoples. And again in 1971, he took this writer with him on a long American conservation tour, which was also a journey backward in time to his boyhood home in Minnesota. Lindbergh said that he had unveiled himself because he thought the cause of conservation so urgent. I have had enough publicity for 15 lives, he said, and I seek no more of it, but where I can accomplish a purpose I will do things I otherwise abhor. There was no doubt that his leadership was effective. Even though he was talking to a generation born long after his Paris flight, his person and his name evoked a tangible response. He did not pretend to be an expert, but had a singular ability to stir response and activity, to enunciate general principles and to cheer people on. It did not appear to matter that he had published his bulky Wartime Journals in 1970 to general critical dispraise. What seemed to count was that he was Charles Augustus Lindbergh, the hero still of 1927, whose smile was engaging, whose words were straightforward, whose manner was simple and whose message was forceful. This was, perhaps, the ultimate enigma of his life; for beneath his outer coating was a man who kept more to himself (and perhaps to his wife) than he ever gave to the public."}
{"original": "So why not have the argument? Is Woody Allen a great filmmaker? On what evidence might that conclusion rest? The accumulated body of critical opinion is helpful, partly because it shows that there has never been consensus. Mr. Allen had a great champion in Vincent Canby, The New York Times chief film critic from 1969 to 1993 — an appreciative note from the director was read at Canby's memorial service at the Museum of Modern Art in 2000 — and also his share of skeptics, among them Pauline Kael of The New Yorker, who ran hot and cold on his films.\\n\\nA look at the archive of reviews, and a sampling of his prolific body of work, reveals that his reputation as a major artist — as something more than a comedian or an observer of the social mores of New Yorkers, a prisoner of his own mannerism and preoccupations — rests on the movies he made in the mid-1980s and early 1990s, the years of his involvement with Mia Farrow.\\n\\nThis isn't to say that his only interesting work belongs to this period, or that his movies from The Purple Rose of Cairo through Husbands and Wives can be watched today without queasiness or qualm. On the contrary, Ms. Farrow's presence in most of them — and the glimpses of her household, including some of her children — make it impossible not to think about Mr. Allen's personal life, and challenges the notion that it can be easily separated from his work.\\n\\nHannah and Her Sisters, Crimes and Misdemeanors and Husbands and Wives in particular draw on the nearness of that life to create a sense of intimacy and warmth even amid the harsh, cynical elements of some of their plots. In those films, Mr. Allen and Ms. Farrow enact scenarios of romantic failure, either splitting up or missing the chance to connect. They are often playing the smartest characters on screen, but also the saddest and least sympathetic, occupying a reality that is drabber and less dramatic than that of the more reckless souls with whom their fates are entwined.\\n\\nThink of Michael Caine in Hannah (1986), a sympathetic sinner animated by lust, envy and pride, and one of a gallery of semi-suitable suitors — along with Max von Sydow's imperious artist and Mr. Allen's spiritually anguished television writer — who surround the title characters. (It is worth noting that Mr. Allen's character undergoes an epiphany while seeing Duck Soup, perhaps a signal of resurgent Marxism.) And those women, played by Barbara Hershey and Dianne Wiest as well as Ms. Farrow, are examples of the kind of complex, serious women who would eventually disappear from Mr. Allen's films, replaced by romantic foils and melodramatic fantasies.\\n\\nAnother Woman (1988), starring Gena Rowlands as a professor and Ms. Farrow as a patient seeing an analyst in the adjacent apartment, is perhaps Mr. Allen's most sustained and successful effort at imagining women who function independently from a man like him (though Ian Holm shows up playing a version of that). You can say that Mr. Allen borrowed a lot from Ingmar Bergman — in this period the Bergman influence is overt and unavoidable — but also that his empathy and curiosity were engaged as never before."}
{"original": "This interview was conducted by the editorial board of The New York Times, which will announce its Democratic primary endorsement on Jan. 19.\\n\\nFor noteworthy dialogues on...\\n\\nAndrew Yang's message is remarkably similar to Elizabeth Warren's and Bernie Sanders's — the American economy is not working for enough Americans, and it's going to require structural change to do better. Where Mr. Yang differs — beyond his almost complete lack of government or political experience — is in his prescriptions, including his signature Freedom Dividend.\\n\\nMr. Yang previously ran a successful test prep company and created the nonprofit Venture for America, which he argues is a strength, offering him fresh perspective and critical distance from the workings of Washington.\\n\\nIn an interview on Dec. 4, it was clear that Mr. Yang has done his homework, traveling across the country and listening closely. He really seemed to have an almost emotional sense of what people have been going through and what the problems are, a board member [Related: What Is an Editorial Board?] said afterward. His portrait of the fundamental economic problems were more moving than Bernie's, and Bernie has been selling this for 30 years.\\n\\nHe articulated a vision for the future of work, education and technology for the nation. The board also delved into Mr. Yang's approach to foreign policy and military intervention, and learned of his fascination with aliens and fear of flying vacuum cleaners.\\n\\nHere is a transcript, with annotations in blue, of the 90-minute discussion, which was filmed for a special episode of The Weekly, The Times's TV show on FX and Hulu. The transcript is unedited. [Related: Learn more about The Choice, or meet the editorial board members]\\n\\nKathleen Kingsbury: Wonderful. Thank you. Yeah. So I have a serious question to ask you, but first we wanted to ask, were you wearing a helmet while you were biking here?\\n\\nMr. Yang biked to the Times from his Manhattan home. More New York City cyclists died biking in 2019 than in any other year since 2000; Gothamist counts 29 deaths.\\n\\nI was wearing a helmet. I have a staffer with the helmet as proof.\\n\\nJesse Wegman: Is the inside of the helmet warm?\\n\\nMy team then had me take the helmet off and then tried to make my hair look good. So that's why I didn't show up with the helmet.\\n\\nKK: It looks sharp.\\n\\nI commented to one of my team members, I feel like running for president is at least a glimpse into what it's like to be a professional woman because I feel like I care about my appearance more now than I ever did. And there are people that are always like looking after ——\\n\\nHe's right, of course. Women in politics have long been subjected to much closer scrutiny than men; in 1917, the first female member of Congress, Jeannette Rankin, took office and The Washington Post ran an article headlined: Congresswoman Rankin Real Girl; Likes Nice Gowns and Tidy Hair.\\n\\nWatch a special endorsement episode of The Weekly This video excerpt has been edited by The Weekly.\\n\\nBrent Staples: Scrutinizing you.\\n\\nScrutinizing, looking after it, because I'm just like, What? My hair? Who cares? No one. And then people are like, No, no, and they have to put time in, smooth it out.\\n\\nKK: So let's get into it. We have about 90 minutes together. In your assessment, what are the policy breakdowns that lead to Americans still being hungry today?\\n\\nWow, I love this question. There are many causes of poverty, and the fact that we're not able to put food into people's houses and on their tables is a structural problem. My campaign's based upon the premise that we're going through this profound economic transformation, the fourth industrial revolution. And one of the major problems is that we still pretend we're in the economy of the '70s or '80s.\\n\\nMr. Yang is not the first to label this period the fourth industrial revolution — the term was made popular by Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, at its annual meeting in Davos in 2016. Mr. Schwab's book of the same name argues that the fourth industrial revolution is transforming every sector of the economy and industry through new technologies that merge the physical, digital and biological realms.\\n\\nIn the '70s or '80s, your labor and overall productivity were more or less in lock step. And we still pretend that if someone wakes up in the morning and says, Hey, I need to put food on the table, he can go out to his main street, he can sell his time for money at some hourly rate, and then he'll be able to make a good enough living so he can feed his family, raise kids and the rest of it. That has become progressively less true over the last 40 years, unfortunately, where wages have stagnated while productivity has gone up and up, and that's going to accelerate because of the convergence of capital and technology now, in unprecedented ways.\\n\\nStarting in 1979, productivity and pay sharply diverged — productivity rose nearly 70 percent, while typical hourly pay essentially stagnated, according to the Economic Policy Institute.\\n\\nEspecially for people who are at the lower end of the skills ladder, which is most Americans. Only 33 percent of Americans will graduate from college, 42 percent if you include two-year degrees.\\n\\nSo you're looking at a nation of high school graduates. And what do high school graduates do for a living? The top five occupational categories are retail and administrative, which includes call center work, retail, food service and food preparation, transportation, primarily truck driving, and attendant supportive jobs and manufacturing still. We all know that we have gutted many of these industries, and their labor bases have shrunk.\\n\\nSo for a high school graduate in America to get by, if you have one health problem or car breakdown, it can take a very tenuous financial situation and send it in a downward spiral. Then how do you put food on the table? In theory, there are nonprofits and food pantries that would see to this, but we all know that they're dramatically underresourced relative to the need. And so when you look at the causes of food poverty, to me the best solution is instead of trying to create organizations that will put food into people's hands, which we should do obviously, we should just put money into Americans' hands and then they would be able to procure food to provide for themselves and their families.\\n\\nMr. Yang's candidacy has centered on the idea of his Freedom Dividend, essentially universal basic income — which has a long history, drawing support from Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King Jr. and Friedrich von Hayek, but also a controversial one. (Later annotations will look at why.)\\n\\nKK: So I assume you're referring to [your] universal basic income plan. Your campaign platform, you have tons and tons of proposals, everything from U.B.I. to universal daylight saving time. Plans don't really mean anything unless you have priorities. What would you do immediately when you enter office? What would be first on your agenda? What would you want to accomplish in the first 100 days?\\n\\nMr. Yang has prided himself on injecting the race with new thinking through proposals like yearlong daylight saving time. Daylight saving time was instituted during World War I for energy-efficiency purposes. Mr. Yang argues that extending it year-round would decrease traffic accidents, increase economic activity and lower crime.\\n\\nTo me, the economic imbalances are causing many of our other problems. If you look up and down the line, health problems, poor educational attainment and results, even political polarization, they stem from the fact that we have this pervasive financial insecurity where 78 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Almost half can't afford an unexpected $400 or $500 bill. If you can't pay next month's rent, it's very hard to worry about climate change. I come and talk to you and say, Hey, we need to fight climate change. And you look up and say like, I'm worried about next month. Next year, next decade has to wait in line.\\n\\nThe statistic that 78 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck was reported in a 2017 study by the human capital management firm CareerBuilder. Read the study here.\\n\\nAnd that's probably a generous response. Some of the responses would be worse than that. So if you get the boot off people's throats, then you can start making progress on our health, on our educational outcomes, on our political polarization.\\n\\nEveryone knows my flagship proposal is this Freedom Dividend of $1,000 a month for every American adult, which is not a new idea. And it's not my idea. Thomas Paine was for it at the founding of the country. Martin Luther King fought for it and was fighting for it when he was assassinated. So after I'm the nominee and I defeat Donald Trump, everyone will know that I'm in the White House because of the Freedom Dividend.\\n\\nDemocrats and progressives will be so thrilled to have defeated Donald Trump, they will love the fact that we're going to put buying power into families' hands, make children stronger and healthier. But here's the great thing: The Republicans will look up and say, Wait a minute, do I hate the Freedom Dividend? And they look up, and they notice only one state's had a dividend for almost 40 years, and it's Alaska, a deep red conservative state, that was passed by a Republican governor.\\n\\nSince 1982, Alaska has been giving every resident an annual check from its $66.3 billion permanent fund, which gets at least 25 percent of the state's mineral royalties every year. The results of the experiment have been mixed — crippling poverty is low, but unemployment rates are among the highest in the country, and the fund's value fluctuates with oil prices.\\n\\nThe reason I am drawing, in some polls, 10 percent or more of Donald Trump voters to my campaign is that Republicans and conservatives do not hate economic buying power in citizens' hands. What they hate is a giant bureaucracy making everyone's decisions. So you ask what my main priority will be as president, it will be to get the Freedom Dividend across the finish line and get buying power into Americans' hands, which will then lead us to be able to solve many other problems much more quickly.\\n\\nMr. Yang's argument that he is pulling 10 percent or more of Trump supporters was not rated favorably on PolitiFact — the 10 percent figure comes from a July YouGov poll, and subsequent polls found the number to be lower.\\n\\nWatch a special endorsement episode of The Weekly This video excerpt has been edited by The Weekly.\\n\\nKK: Have you spoken to Republican lawmakers about the Freedom Dividend?\\n\\nI haven't sat down with a lot of sitting senators and congressmen and women, but I've talked to literally thousands of people who supported Donald Trump in the last election who say they are now supporting me. I've talked to many folks who are Republicans who say they are, at least, sympathetic to my message, in large part because they understand the numbers. When I talked to 70 C.E.O.s here in New York City, not that far from here, it was a fancy bank office, most of them were Republicans. I said, How many of you are looking at replacing your back-office clerical workers with artificial intelligence and software? Guess how many hands went up out of 70. All of them. The truth is, you should fire any C.E.O. who was not looking to make that happen, because their incentives are all tied to the bottom-line profitability of their firm. And most of them were Republicans. So they understand the need for what I am proposing.\\n\\nJamie Dimon, who is a Democrat but is a numbers person, has looked at the numbers and said, we should declare a national emergency around the fact that the economy is not working for most Americans. And he's proposing a negative income tax, which is a close cousin to the Freedom Dividend that I'm championing.\\n\\nUnlike universal basic income, a system that would provide some cash to every person regardless of income level, a negative income tax system would give cash to people below a certain income threshold. Milton Friedman made the case for the tax as a poverty alleviation tool in his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom.\\n\\nSo this is not a left or a right idea, this is bipartisan. And many Republicans will see that this is going to be a huge win for their constituents, for rural areas, for red states on the interior. We don't need 80 percent of Congress to pass it, we just need a majority.\\n\\nKK: I want to move on to some other questions, but I actually have one last for you, which is why run as a Democratic versus a Republican if you have such bipartisan issues?\\n\\nI've been a registered Democrat since the Clinton years; I was an Obama appointee. I had a fund-raiser for John Kerry. It wasn't a great fund-raiser because I was kind of young; it wasn't one of those fancy ones where you generate tens of thousands.\\n\\nKK: How much money did you raise?\\n\\nI want to say we raised maybe $5,000, and I was quite pleased. It was at a lounge.\\n\\nKK: With inflation, though, it would be higher, right?\\n\\nWell, thank you for saying so. Yeah, in 2019 dollars it must be at least $6,000. I've been a Democrat for years and years, and if you look at my alignment on the vast majority of issues, they're lock step with the Democratic Party. So it was very natural for me to run as a Democrat. I've ruled out completely any third-party bid because that would in my mind increase the chances of Donald Trump winning, and the mission is to defeat Donald Trump and help move the country forward.\\n\\nMr. Yang, a former technology executive and entrepreneur, has distinguished himself from Senator Sanders and the far left of the Democratic Party in making the case for a more humane capitalist system, what he calls human-centered capitalism.\\n\\nKK: O.K. Moving onto a perhaps slightly less serious topic.\\n\\nIn hindsight, this was not an accurate assessment of the next question.\\n\\nI like it already.\\n\\nAisha Harris: Back in September, you actually spoke out on behalf of the comedian Shane Gillis, who had been hired on SNL and then was quickly fired after some racist comments were stirred up that he had made in the past on one of his podcasts. And you said you didn't want to be judged for something you had done 25 years ago. But Gillis's comments were maybe a year ago. So I'm curious as to, in your mind, how long of a period of time should it be before someone faces some sort of consequences for something they've done in the past?\\n\\nMr. Gillis was hired by Saturday Night Live last September, then dropped days later after clips surfaced showing him using slurs and language offensive toward Asian and L.G.B.T.Q. people, including one specifically about Mr. Yang. Mr. Yang later said the comedian should have had the chance to keep his job and explained: As a society, we have become unduly punitive and vindictive about people making statements that some find offensive or distasteful.\\n\\nSo when I heard that Shane Gillis had called me Jew chink — I think was the slur — my reaction was the same reaction anyone would have, which was like, who the heck is this guy, and he sounds like a total jackass. Well, my wife actually had heard about it independently and was also like, Who the heck is this guy? And so then I sat down and started to figure out who Shane Gillis was, what he did for a living, and then I sat down and watched some of his comedy to try and get some context.\\n\\nAfter watching his comedy, I felt that he wasn't a malignant racist and that his slur toward me was just very, very bad comedy run amok. Which did not strike me as a fireable offense, and I realized that if I was the individual who was actually directly slurred, and I did not feel that he should lose his job over it, then I should probably share that sentiment with other people.\\n\\nParticularly because I think we've become unduly vindictive and punitive toward statements that people find objectionable. A friend of mine said something, he said, If the online universe descends on someone, and they lose their job, the online universe moves on a week later, but that person still does not have a job a week later. That the impact on the individual lasts much, much longer than the rancor. So I shared this.\\n\\nThe comment about I wouldn't want to be judged for something 25 years ago was about something completely independent. I think I'd seen something where Joe Biden was being called out for something he'd said 25 years ago, when I said I wouldn't want to be called out for some misstatement I'd made 25 years ago. And then I joked, good thing no one cared about what I was doing 25 years ago, because I was at that point a 20-year-old man, and the internet didn't really have full documentation of how I spent those years.\\n\\nMr. Yang was asked on CNN's The Van Jones Show about cancel culture and whether Americans have gone too far in the direction of a lack of grace or a lack of forgiveness. He responded: I'm new to politics, but I certainly would hate to be judged by something I did 25 years ago.\\n\\nSo the Shane Gillis opinion was not based upon the timeline, it was just based upon my reaction as a person, and the person that was directly named. I certainly think there should be consequences for one's statements and actions, and I certainly think that obviously he made the statements within the year, and that if you did have some sort of time frame when you would want to overlook something, it would be much longer than a year.\\n\\nMr. Yang's comments, on Mr. Gillis and on judgment more broadly, contribute to a growing conversation among political and cultural figures about the merits and downsides of cancel culture. Former President Obama, for example, spoke out about the prevalence of call-out culture during an interview in October, arguing that criticizing people on social media for not being woke enough is not activism and not bringing about change.\\n\\nAH: But do you think, I mean, he never truly apologized. He just said, I'm sorry you're offended. And while you may not have felt that way, there were other jokes he made about just Asian-Americans and Asian people in general, and there were other people who were obviously affected by this. So I mean, what kind of consequences do you think someone who makes those kinds of statements and who doesn't show any sort of remorse for it, should they face? If not firing, what should happen? What would the steps be?\\n\\nMr. Gillis issued what some saw as a non-apology, writing on Twitter that he is a comedian who pushes boundaries and his intention is never to hurt. He added, I'm happy to apologize to anyone who's actually offended by anything I've said.\\n\\nWell, in this case, what's interesting is it's up to the employer, and it was NBC and Saturday Night Live. Even as I made the statement saying I didn't think he should be fired, I thought he probably would be fired. Because if you're NBC and SNL, you look up and say, what is my upside for keeping this guy? He's not exactly a huge moneymaker, he hasn't worked a day on the set. Like, that's not a really powerful set of incentives. And so I thought they probably would fire him. I'd suggest that the extent there are consequences for people's misstatements, they should be somewhere commensurate to the level of power and influence they have and the harm that they're doing. In Shane Gillis's case, he was a comedian. I'd never heard of the guy before.\\n\\nAH: I mean, I don't think most people had.\\n\\nNo, certainly not before the statements had taken place, and in terms of consequences, I would suggest that someone like Shane had probably paid a price in many ways. Like, aside from being fired, there are many circles that, if he shows up in, he'd be labeled very, very negatively. He reached out to me personally, and I had a conversation with him. The conversation with him made me feel more confident that I'd done the right thing. Because I think in many cases we're trying to follow up on a sense of shame and humiliation that the person might already feel.\\n\\nAfter Mr. Gillis was fired, Mr. Yang tweeted that the comedian had reached out to him. Looks like we will be sitting down together soon, Mr. Yang wrote. Neither the comedian nor the candidate appears to have spoken publicly about the content of the meeting.\\n\\nKK: I think we have some questions around economics.\\n\\nBinyamin Appelbaum: Yes. After every invention basically since the plow, people have found new uses for the time saved by new technologies. You've argued that this time, this won't happen quickly enough. Why will this time be different? What gives you the confidence that we're confronting something new in all of human history?\\n\\nMr. Yang has argued that his Freedom Dividend is one answer to the needs of the millions who will lose their jobs to automation.\\n\\nThe numbers. So keep in mind, I didn't just wake up and say, Hey, technology is changing the world. I spent seven years working in Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis, Baltimore and other cities that have been blasted by the waves of automation.\\n\\nThis work was through Mr. Yang's nonprofit, Venture for America. More on that in a bit.\\n\\nDetroit is a city of 680,000 people. Its peak population was 1.7 million. If you look this direction, you can see a thriving neighborhood, and then you turn 90 degrees and you see abandoned buildings as far as the eye can see. If we were adapting, you would see not multidecade low rates of interstate migration, which we have right now. You would not be seeing 80 percent of the country have multidecade low levels of business formation, which we have right now. You would not be seeing historic lows of business formation among young people, which we have right now. You would not see labor force participation at 62.9 percent, a multidecade low which we have right now. You would not see record-high levels of drug overdoses and suicides to the point that America's life expectancy has declined for three years in a row, which we have right now.\\n\\nMr. Yang argues that the automation of manufacturing jobs — especially in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri and Iowa — helped breed the discontent and economic desperation that led to Mr. Trump's election.\\n\\nAndrew Yang in the spin room after the Democratic debate in Detroit. Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times\\n\\nBA: But we also have record low unemployment, and when you mention labor force participation, some people think a big factor there is that the government already is giving people too much money.\\n\\nLabor force participation — the share of Americans either employed or actively looking for work — declined precipitously from the late 1990s, dropping to 62.7 percent in 2014 (its lowest rate since the Carter administration). Critics of President Obama liked to argue that this was because of government handouts. But there's a counterargument to be found in demographic trends — the Congressional Budget Office estimates that a sizable portion of the decline in labor-force participation is a result of the aging of the work force.\\n\\nWell, the labor force participation rate has declined precipitously, so I don't buy that somehow the government started giving people more money over the last number of years. And the headline unemployment rate, and I'm sure you know this, it doesn't measure underemployment, 40 to 44 percent of recent college graduates are now doing a job that does not require a college degree. It does not measure the fact that 94 percent of new jobs in the economy are temp, gig or contract jobs that do not have health care benefits and can disappear at any moment. It doesn't include the fact that you might be doing two or three jobs to make ends meet.\\n\\nA 2016 study from the economists Lawrence Katz at Harvard and Alan Krueger at Princeton found that 94 percent of net job growth between 2005 and 2015 was alternative work, including independent contractors, freelancers and temps.\\n\\nUber is literally advertising to schoolteachers saying, Hey, we've figured out schoolteachers make really good Uber drivers. And if you look at that situation, the headline unemployment rate says, Check, this person is employed. Heck, this person might be employed twice. The headline unemployment rate when Donald Trump was running for president, he castigated it as fake news, and then he got into office and all the sudden it became real news. He was right the first time. The number is almost intentionally designed to obscure any of the difficulties in the labor market. If I drop out of the labor market, I no longer count. I actually help the number.\\n\\nRight now we have three flagship numbers we're beating the American people over the head with, telling them that things are going great. No. 1, the headline unemployment rate. No. 2, gross domestic product, which is obviously putting up record highs even as our life expectancy is declining. And No. 3, corporate profits and shareholder value. Stock market prices correspond to the fortunes of the top 20 percent of Americans, many of the people, obviously, who live here in Manhattan. The bottom 80 percent of Americans own 8 percent of stock market value. The bottom 50 percent own essentially zero.\\n\\nThe American cities with the highest number of high-net-worth individuals are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington. California has the most number of people on the Forbes list of wealthiest Americans.\\n\\nIf these are your measurements, then of course you're going to think things are going in one direction, while your way of life disintegrates. Even the inventor of G.D.P., Simon Kuznets, said 100 years ago, this is a terrible measurement of national well-being, and we should never use it as that.\\n\\nIf you run an organization, imagine having an organization that has the wrong measurements. How is that organization going to fare over time? That is where we are in the United States of America right now. We're riding a century-old measurement off a cliff, while our way of life deteriorates underneath our feet. If you looked at levels of anxiety, stress, mental health, depression, suicides, drug overdoses, you would see that we're in a mental health recession or depression, we're in a wellness or life expectancy recession or depression, and the corporate profits are going to keep on going up, because in the 21st-century economy, companies can do very, very well while not hiring a lot of people, not treating them as full-time employees, and they don't need to care what happens in their own backyard because they sell everywhere.\\n\\nGross domestic product is a measure of a country's entire economic output. Its inventor worried that it might be mistaken as a measure of citizens' well-being. Mr. Yang's campaign has proposed that America measure its economic prosperity with a different index that accounts for human and not just monetary factors, including inequality and quality of life.\\n\\nBA: But you're not proposing to fix any of that. People don't just work to make money; they do work for a sense of self-worth. They work so that they can develop skills, they work so they have the possibility of earning more money someday. You're proposing to replace a portion of the income they may have lost, but not any of those other things. Why is that a solution?\\n\\nI love work, and the numbers also clearly show that people need work. Men in particular, without work, they volunteer less than employed men. So think about that for a second. They have higher rates of substance abuse, their health deteriorates, all these social ills accompany. Of course, we need to create jobs in as many communities as possible.\\n\\nHarmful effects of unemployment are felt by men and women, but men are more likely to experience negative health effects including depression and increased risk of suicide.\\n\\nThe question is, what is the means to creating those jobs? What I'm suggesting is that if you were to put $12,000 a year into the hands of every American adult … Let's say there's a town in Missouri of 10,000 people. Let's say after I'm president, their disposable income goes up by $10 million a month. Where is that money going to go? It's going to go into car repairs, day care expenses, Little League sign-ups, the occasional night out.\\n\\nIf you were a person in that town in Missouri and you wanted to start a bakery, before the dividend, it's a dumb idea. Post-dividend, it might be a great idea. You can hire someone to help staff the bakery, you know if the bakery fails, you're going to survive because you have this income that you can rely upon. This is the most stable and secure way to create jobs that actually reflect our community's needs and values. What are the other alternatives? For the government to come in and say, Hey, we're going to designate five people to clean up this park forever. We're going to designate 10 people to make our people stronger forever, regardless of whether or not they're ——\\n\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the federal government commissioned a series of experiments to look at how guaranteed income effects labor participation. Researchers discovered that a program like U.B.I. doesn't have the drastic effect on work that some might predict; households overall reduce their workload by roughly 13 percent, according to a paper in the Canadian Public Policy journal.\\n\\nBA: So a Republican would say that alternative is to let markets work. Is that what makes you a Democrat — you don't think the market will create enough jobs for Americans?\\n\\nOh, I think the market will work beautifully toward what it's designed to do. The market is designed for maximal capital efficiency, and it is doing a phenomenal job. That's why you see the returns on capital outstripping the returns on labor at historic levels. The market is not designed to maximize human well-being.\\n\\nAnd again, all you have to do to look at it is to say, stock market prices and G.D.P. record highs, life expectancy declining. Like, that sums it up. You know? You don't need any clearer divergence than that.\\n\\nMr. Trump likes to say that the economy has reached historic highs under his administration. However, life expectancy has been falling and other measures of well-being have declined, including rising rates of depression diagnosis.\\n\\nWhat I'm suggesting is we actually make capitalism's goals align with ours, as human beings, as parents, as Americans. Instead of maximizing these capital efficiency measurements, we should be maximizing our own health and life expectancy, our children's education and success rates, our mental health and freedom from substance abuse, our environmental sustainability. Then we can line up the power of the markets with how we are doing. But the markets do not care one whit about us and our children.\\n\\nBA: I want to ask you about the — Oh, sorry, go ahead.\\n\\nKK: Oh, sorry, I just wanted to ask you, you know, there are some people who would suggest that a better use of money, instead of giving a Freedom Dividend, would be to dramatically overhaul America's high schools and start teaching people different skills instead of trying to continue the race against A.I. Why isn't that a path? Why couldn't we instead change how we do education in this country?\\n\\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's Future of Education and Skills 2030 project is exploring the ways education systems internationally need to change to prepare students for a rapidly automating economy.\\n\\nWe should definitely do that, in a very big and dramatic way. And I have proposals to help move us toward a better model of high school education. Only 6 percent of American high school students are in technical, trade or apprenticeship tracks. In Germany, that's 59 percent. Think about that gulf. Meanwhile, there are millions of those trade and middle-scale jobs that are left unfilled. Why is this?\\n\\nOne, it's a lot easier and cheaper for us to throw kids into a classroom with textbooks and a teacher and say, You're going to go to college, than it is to try and train them in skills that are going to give them a secure livelihood. Number two, we have fetishized college and stigmatized anything that's not college. We've beaten Americans over the head, pretended everyone's going to college and say, It's going to work for you. And the Democrats are guilty of this. That's why they're yelling, Free college, free college. Meanwhile, again, only 33 percent of Americans are going to go to college, and that is a relatively stable number.\\n\\nThe question of whether to prioritize free public college has divided the Democratic candidates. Senators Warren and Sanders say that four-year public colleges should be free, and Senator Cory Booker signed on to legislation that could make it debt-free. Senator Amy Klobuchar previously criticized the idea of free college for all, but then signed on to a version of a free-college proposal. Mr. Yang, though, has said he supports forgiving more student loan debt but thinks the Freedom Dividend is a better solution to inequality than free college.\\n\\nKK: But access to college is still a civil rights issue in this country.\\n\\nPresident Obama referred to education as the civil rights issue of our time, as did former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. Indeed, the gap between education outcomes for black and white students has barely budged in recent decades, according to research from the Brookings Institution.\\n\\nIt very much is. But if you were to apply resources, you would want to apply resources in ways that don't necessarily advantage the top third of your population by educational attainment exclusively. You would be trying to build more paths with the other two-thirds, which investing in trades and apprenticeships would do, and you would try and provide for the people who are the weakest and most vulnerable in the job market, which are not going to be the people that are attending college.\\n\\nMost American laborers work in the services sector, according to Pew Research — in July 2019, 107.8 million people worked in private service-providing industries including trade, transportation and utilities.\\n\\nOur economy is breaking down on all levels. Again, if you are fortunate enough to graduate from college today, you're in the top third of the population, you're graduating with tens of thousands in school loans very, very often, and there's a 40 to 44 percent chance you're going to do a job that does not require your college degree. That's if you're one of the winners in our society today. I spent seven years working with, frankly, some of the top educational products in our country. I saw that even the winners are not winning right now. And so imagine if you're a nonwinner, what this looks like.\\n\\nBS: Would you dilate what you're talking — seven years doing what?\\n\\nI started and ran a national nonprofit called Venture for America that recruited enterprising college graduates to help grow businesses in Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, New Orleans, Birmingham, Baltimore, and nine other American cities. We helped create several thousand jobs. I'm very, very proud of that. But I realize that the jobs we were creating were only going to apply for a small slice of the population. And these jobs were pouring water into a bathtub that has a giant hole ripped in the bottom. I'm running for president to let America know that it is not our imagination, the water is rushing out of the bathtub. Immigrants have nothing to do with it. It's the fact that we're going through the greatest economic transformation.\\n\\nMr. Yang founded Venture for America, a fellowship program for recent college graduates, in 2011, with the goal of creating 100,000 new jobs in the country's most underresourced cities. As of 2019, the nonprofit has created around 3,500 jobs.\\n\\nBA: Just before we move on, maybe I can ask one more question.\\n\\nOf course, sure.\\n\\nBA: Your proposal is oddly regressive. On the benefits side you're proposing that people will have to choose between this benefit and their existing federal benefits while someone like me just all the sudden gets a new check in their mailbox every month. On the funding side you're relying on a VAT, which is an inherently regressive funding mechanism. You've proposed some offsets, but I still don't understand why you don't just embrace a progressive approach to taxation. Either raise top rates or a wealth tax. If there are people who need help, why aren't you trying to help them as much as possible?\\n\\nA VAT (value-added tax) is a tax on consumption, so the burden disproportionately falls on low-income households, who spend a larger portion of their income.\\n\\nI'm for a more progressive tax structure. It's clear that the people at the top of the income chain are not paying enough. I don't think a wealth tax will work. I like the spirit of a wealth tax, but if you look at other countries' experience, Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, very sophisticated developed countries, they tried a wealth tax and they wound up repealing it because it had massive compliance problems, and it did not generate anywhere near the revenue that was projected.\\n\\nSo if you cannot learn from the experiences of other countries, what can you learn from? We have to take a policy that actually works, and what those countries and every other developed country have determined works, is a value added tax. Because a value added tax is impossible to game your way out of. If you're a trillion-dollar technology company — you know, I was just in New Hampshire campaigning yesterday, and you know what I say to them? I say to everyone around the country, Amazon, a trillion-dollar technology company sucking up $20 billion in business every year, closing 30 percent of your stores and malls, paying zero in taxes, how do you feel about that? You know? And they are angry. They say, how the heck can Amazon be paying zero in taxes? And I was like, I know. And it's up to you, the people of New Hampshire, to change it. So if you look at other countries ——\\n\\nIn 1990, 12 European countries had some form of a wealth tax, while today only three have kept the policy — Norway, Spain and Switzerland. Reports by the O.E.C.D. and others have found that the tax led to an exodus of the wealthy and didn't raise as much revenue as anticipated.\\n\\nBA: But that doesn't make our tax code more progressive.\\n\\nSo if you look at other countries, they have a value-added tax and then they take those resources and put them to work toward various social programs in ways to balance out the inequality. Now, another thing I love about the value-added tax is you can either reduce it or exempt things like diapers, toilet paper, eggs, milk, things that Americans consume just to make ends meet, and you can dial it up on things like artificial intelligence, yachts, luxury watches. There are ways that you can make it so that it falls more heavily on people that would barely notice. And we're taking the resources plus an additional hundreds of billions of dollars and putting it directly into the hands of working Americans. This would increase the buying power of literally 90 percent of Americans.\\n\\nBA: But just to be clear, it's still not a progressive tax. There's no model that says that you can use these kinds of exclusions and exemptions to make that progressive. You can make it less regressive. You're still fundamentally proposing a nonprogressive means of revenue raising.\\n\\nA progressive tax is one in which the rate increases with income, while a regressive tax increases inversely with income.\\n\\nIn a vacuum, you're 100 percent correct. But it's failing to account for the fact that we're taking that money, and then some, and putting it directly into the hands of the American consumer.\\n\\nBA: But that just brings us to the other side of it, where what you're proposing is not to give as much more money to the people who need it the most. You're saying, if you get food stamps, the amount by which your government benefits increase will be less than for me or you.\\n\\nA working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that U.B.I. could redirect spending to more affluent and middle-income families, therefore leaving low-income families worse off; a U.B.I. large enough to direct more funds to low-income households would be extremely costly. Read the paper here.\\n\\nLet's say I'm on food stamps, and I've got a 15-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. I'm concerned about their future, very, very deeply. And then Andrew Yang becomes president, and I find out that my 15-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month starting at age 18 for the rest of his life, and my 12-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month for the rest of her life. I'm going to say, wow. That's actually the biggest value gain I've ever even heard of in history. My kid will have a financial literacy class in high school, the first semester of their senior year. It is impossible to teach financial literacy to someone who does not have money. So the kids will actually learn about what to do with the money before they start getting the money.\\n\\nOther candidates have taken a different approach to creating a nest egg for low-income youth — Senator Booker, for example, favors baby bonds, which would provide every infant with a savings account that the government would contribute to annually depending on family income.\\n\\nThis is a game changer for Americans in any circumstance. And I am not for reducing or curtailing any of these social programs. For me, we're trying to lay a foundation that works for all Americans, and then we need to keep building on top of it. So if there are people that post-Freedom Dividend need additional programs and assistance, I'm all for it.\\n\\nKK: I want to ask you, you were the C.E.O. of Manhattan Prep. How does test prep — doesn't that contribute to income inequality in the United States?\\n\\nMr. Yang was the C.E.O. of a boutique test prep company that was purchased by Kaplan in 2009. The company flourished during the 2008 financial collapse, becoming the country's foremost preparatory company for the GMAT as more people flocked to business school.\\n\\nYeah, it does. It's one reason why I think we need to de-emphasize — excuse me.\\n\\nKK: Take your time.\\n\\nNot at all. We originated the SAT during World War II as a way to determine which kids we did not want to send to the front lines. Now we treat our kids like every year is wartime. I've talked to parents and teachers around the country, and I've said, we need to de-emphasize these standardized tests. They are a terrible measurement of human value, certainly have nothing to do with character. At this point, as you said, they are more likely to test your parents' socioeconomic status than anything else.\\n\\nThe SAT was first administered in 1926 and evolved out of a test used for admission to Princeton University and Cooper Union. It was inspired by military experiments with I.Q. testing.\\n\\nSo we need to have better, more holistic ways of measuring how our kids are doing educationally, and we need to empower teachers and let teachers do their jobs. Because if you are a teacher and you're teaching to the test, you end up making decisions in the classroom that you know are not right for the students.\\n\\nKK: Actually, I also want to ask you about your time at Manhattan Prep. Your colleague Kimberly Watkins told City Council in September that she had faced both gender harassment and pay inequity under your leadership there. Could you respond to those allegations?\\n\\nI believe your reporters then talked to maybe half a dozen or more of Kim's contemporaries at the organization and found out that those allegations were completely groundless, which they were.\\n\\nIn an essay published by the Gotham Gazette, Kimberly Watkins alleged that Mr. Yang fired her from Manhattan Prep because he did not think she would continue working as hard after getting married. Mr. Yang appeared on The View shortly after and said there was zero truth to Ms. Watkins's account. After publication, Ms. Watkins reached out to the editorial board, noting the question contained an error — she testified before a New York City hearing on pay equity, but, as she wroteto us , I have on multiple occasions drawn contrast to 'pay equity,' with what I experienced, which concerns long term economic stability. The reality that my economic future was destroyed by Yang, right after my marriage, after an unblemished six-year commitment to this company, has been the focus of my story, not pay inequity…Yang's response [also] grossly overstates the investigative process and draws a false conclusion.\\n\\nNick Fox: Can I clarify one point on taxation? Are you proposing any new or increased taxes on the wealthiest Americans or corporations, or is it strictly the VAT?\\n\\nIf you look at our proposals, we have a tax on financial transactions, which would obviously end up falling most heavily on the wealthiest Americans and the wealthiest companies. We have a carbon tax, which tends to fall most heavily on the wealthiest industries, which are emitting a lot. The value-added tax would obviously be enormously generative from people who benefit from society and consume the most. I'm for trying to restore our income tax levels to previous levels to be more progressive.\\n\\nA Times evaluation of Mr. Yang's tax plan by N. Gregory Mankiw, professor of economics at Harvard, found that Mr. Yang's tax plan would target the affluent who spend their money lavishly while incentivizing people to save.\\n\\nMichelle Cottle: Now, I think it's clear that people are responding to you in part because you have this big vision, but Washington has a problem achieving even kind of modest ——\\n\\nMr. Yang has a fervent online following that calls itself the Yang Gang.\\n\\nYeah, we noticed.\\n\\nMC: So, and we are currently enjoying a businessmen president who has no experience in government or the military. What is your argument to people, that we should trust you with no experience in government and the military, in the same position, and that you will do a better job dealing with the peculiarities of Washington.\\n\\nMany of Mr. Yang's supporters say they are drawn to his perspective as a political outsider; in The Wall Street Journal, some say they previously supported Senator Sanders but now look for a candidate who offers an even fresher non-Washington perspective.\\n\\nWell, it sounds like you've been there.\\n\\nMC: Quite a lot.\\n\\nDid you come up for this?\\n\\nMC: Yeah, I'm based out of ——\\n\\nOh, man. Well, thank you for making the trip. Then you know. First, any person who says they're going to run government like a business does not know what they're talking about, because they are two completely different things.\\n\\nIn a business you can say, Hey, we're going to go this way, and people generally have to do what you're saying. In government it's much more analogous to my role as the founder of a national nonprofit, where you have hundreds or even thousands of stakeholders, and you have to try and generate energy around a vision. Let people see that it's in their self-interest or the self-interest of the people that they represent to get on board with your vision. And that you're willing to compromise and work with them. That is the way I would lead as president.\\n\\nMr. Yang told Vox's Recode that one of the reasons he quit Venture for America, the nonprofit he created, was because he realized it couldn't achieve the change he wanted at the necessary scale. For instance, it had fallen short of the 100,000 jobs he set out for it to create.\\n\\nDonald Trump does not speak for every non-politician or nonmilitary officer. But there is a deep need, and you've seen this, because you spent time in D.C., the D.C. establishment will not generate big solutions.\\n\\nOne of the reasons why Donald Trump is our president is that millions of Americans feel like our government is unresponsive to our needs and the needs in our communities. They've been casting about for some sort of change agent for years. And it's not just Donald Trump's victory; it was Bernie Sanders outsized success. In some ways, it was even Obama's victory in 2008. If you remember that campaign, it was oh, hope, change. It was not, get the most experienced person in the seat as possible, because we are decades behind the curve in addressing the problems and challenges that are tearing us apart. Now ——\\n\\nMr. Yang has frequently said that automation contributed heavily to Mr. Trump's win, because voters feel disaffected and worry that the futures of their jobs and industries are in jeopardy.\\n\\nKK: Do you feel like President Obama achieved the change that he had promised in the 2008 campaign?\\n\\nI think that he did a lot of great things and he did a lot of what he could, but to the extent that there was a missed opportunity, it was in the wake of the financial crisis. And it's very hard to Monday morning quarterback a team when they literally felt like the economy itself was at stake, but we should have done much more to recapitalize homeowners as opposed to the banks. We could have kept many more people in their homes. We could've kept many of these communities ——\\n\\nA critique of President Obama's financial policies by Matt Stoller, of the Open Markets Institute, argues that the Obama administration let banking executives off the hook for their role in the financial crisis and enabled nine million foreclosures.\\n\\nBS: Without a doubt.\\n\\n—— more strong and more whole. There's a saying, I think it was actually, and maybe in this … no, it was an earlier administration, but a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. There was a crisis. There was a massive opportunity to help rebalance our economy, but we instead recapitalized the banks to the tune of $4 trillion. And what I say to Americans around the country, I say, Hey, do you remember voting for the $4 trillion bailout of Wall Street? And it gets this laugh. But then they answer, Wait, we did that? And it's, Of course we didn't vote for that.\\n\\nA crisis is a terrible thing to waste is a quote attributed to the Stanford economist Paul Romer. He made the comment at a meeting in 2004, referring to the competition America faces from the rising education levels around the globe. Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's chief of staff, later echoed the statement after President Obama's election.\\n\\nSo, that to me was the biggest missed opportunity in the Obama administration, and it happened very, very early on. I wish that they owned and reflected a little bit on the fact that maybe they could have done some things differently at that stage, because we're still angry. This country is still angry. I was so shocked by what happened in the financial crisis, I quit my job and started a national nonprofit and ran it for seven years. I had — my wife was pregnant. I mean, what happened to this country then is still tearing us apart.\\n\\nMr. Yang started Venture for America in 2011, shortly after selling his test prep company to Kaplan. He said that he saw, in the wake of the financial crisis, how certain communities were rapidly losing jobs and wanted to create new work opportunities in those underserved areas.\\n\\nLauren Kelley: Mr. Yang, can you say who is on your short list for running mate?\\n\\nI love this question.\\n\\nLK: So do we.\\n\\nWell, one of the joys of running for president is you get to know incredible people on the trail, including some of the other contenders. I'm on the record saying I would prefer to have a female running mate. I think teams run better if you have men and women leaders at the highest possible levels. I joke, but it's mostly true, that if you get too many men alone for too long, we kind of become morons. So we need to keep that from happening at the highest levels.\\n\\nMr. Yang confirmed this summer that he would like his running mate to be a woman.\\n\\nMC: He has my vote. All right. [LAUGHTER]\\n\\nBut at the same time, in order to have someone at that level of relationship, you need to have as much trust as possible and I'm still developing that kind of relationship with some of the other, not just candidates, but also people who could be running mates that are not currently running.\\n\\nMr. Yang has scored internet points with some tweets paying tribute to former 2020 Democratic rivals, for example by tweeting I miss Beto.\\n\\nLK: So no names yet.\\n\\nNo names yet, no.\\n\\nKK: Do you feel like you need to have a running mate who has operated in Washington before or who has previous government experience?\\n\\nAlmost certainly, yes. And you saw it a little bit with Barack Obama where he tapped Joe Biden in part because Joe had very deep relationships on Capitol Hill. If you had another outsider like me, we'd still be trying to figure out who to call. So, you need to have folks who have deep relationships on Capitol Hill from day one.\\n\\nLK: Speaking of women, I wanted to ask you about reproductive rights as well. You told some of our colleagues in the newsroom that you would consider some executive actions to protect reproductive rights, but I haven't seen any details about what actions you're considering. Do you have any details to share with us about that?\\n\\nWell, I'm all about trying to improve the reality on the ground, to the extent that we can actually put resources and funds to work in communities to make sure that women have access to reproductive rights in clinics. Certainly any way we can make sure that there aren't any obstacles to the funding of Planned Parenthood clinics around the country. I would take those actions immediately. A lot of the legislative actions, you need a bit more time and a bit more buy-in from Congress, but at the Supreme Court level, I would consider appointing more justices if it was necessary to safeguard women's reproductive rights.\\n\\nMr. Yang has argued that more legislative oversight on reproductive issues should come from physicians rather than politicians. He tweeted: I personally don't think male legislators should be weighing in on women's reproductive rights and freedoms.\\n\\nKK: You mean, you would in addition to the nine that we already have?\\n\\nIn addition to the nine we already have. I believe that — so if you look at the Constitution, there is nothing there that stipulates the number of Supreme Court justices. We've had fewer than nine, we've had more than nine. I think that appointing new justices would be helpful on several levels. It would help depoliticize the process, at least marginally, because if you have 17 justices and one steps down, then it's not as much of an earthquake. Well, right now we we're hinging our laws on the health of an octogenarian. It would literally be rational for us to all just to follow Ruth Bader Ginsburg around and just scrub any door knob she touches. You know what I mean?\\n\\nJustice Bader Ginsburg has had a series of health scares in recent years, including surgery for lung cancer and radiation treatment. She also had surgery for early-stage pancreatic cancer in 2009.\\n\\nJW: You remember what happened the last time a president tried to do this, right?\\n\\nYeah. And I think in some ways, there's some positive lessons to be drawn from that time, because there were some significant accomplishments during that era.\\n\\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt tried to advance a court-packing strategy to ensure favorable rulings on New Deal legislation. He wanted to appoint up to six additional justices, one for every justice older than 70 years. The plan was unpopular in Congress and among the Supreme Court's justices.\\n\\nKK: So, can you give us some names of people you would nominate to the Supreme Court?\\n\\nThat's a fun exercise, too. I haven't gotten into the judicial appointment shortlist yet, but safeguarding women's reproductive rights would be one clear criteria. Because women's reproductive rights are fundamental human rights in my mind.\\n\\nI think it's actually unfortunate that I get asked about those sorts of questions, in the sense that I feel like men should leave the room and let women decide what to do with your bodies. I have a feeling I know what you would decide, and then we could come back and say, Hey, what did you decide? I also think that if men got pregnant, this would be a very, very different conversation. And we'd have a completely different approach to these issues. So, I don't have a short list of Supreme Court justice appointees, but safeguarding women's reproductive rights and having an evolving sense of the law would be very important.\\n\\nWe need to modernize the court. Lifetime appointments might have made sense at one point a long time ago, but when the Constitution was drafted, people did not live as long. And also, people stepped down from the Supreme Court for any of a range of reasons. They did not wait until they were at death's door. This is not a way to run a 21st-century society.\\n\\nWe should have 18-year term limits, increase the number of justices, make it so it's predictable that you lose an election, the other party might get one or two justices, and then we don't need to literally be monitoring the health of our justices. Or, the most ridiculous thing is you're literally looking at the age of the person you're appointing being, Ooh, this person will be there for 30, 40 years. What kind of system do you want where you're having a society decide 30 years ago what women's rights are today? Doesn't make any sense.\\n\\nJW: Are you concerned that you wouldn't be triggering a sort of a war of — a back and forth between Republicans and Democrats, who were continuing to add justices to the bench with each new administration to satisfy their own policy priorities?\\n\\nIf you have term limits, it is bipartisan. Because ——\\n\\nJW: Right, but you're talking about expanding the court, too, and if you expand the court, as you say correctly, that it's a federal law, there's nothing in the Constitution about the number of justices. You expand it to 13, the next Republican who comes in, who is furious about women having too many reproductive rights, will expand it to 17 to overturn the rulings you just got. So, how doesn't that just become — doesn't devolve into ——\\n\\nCourt packing isn't a violation of any part of the Constitution, but it is widely debated with critics pointing out that it would trigger severe political backlash.\\n\\nBS: An arms race.\\n\\nWell, I would suggest that one side has been acting as if it is an arms race. And so, in that environment, it's only appropriate to respond in a way that you think would help move the country and our legal system in the right direction. Can I talk — oh.\\n\\nJeneen Interlandi: Oh no, go ahead.\\n\\nJW: I just wanted to tie together the question — a question from Lauren and a question from Michelle, and ask you about Washington, both with regard to Supreme Court confirmation process and your agenda more generally. You said at the very beginning of our conversation, in response to Katie, that you don't need a — you were talking about various [cross talk].\\n\\nYeah, you said you don't need 80 percent of Congress, you need a majority. And I would push back and say neither of those is correct. You need 60 percent of the Senate currently. The question is, how do you plan to get things done, even if you had a Democratic majority in the Senate? Which I think is right now less than an even chance. How do you propose getting your agenda through Congress when the filibuster is in place?\\n\\nTo your earlier concern, I think we should examine the filibuster. I think that gridlock is bad for anyone trying to get anything done and solve problems. This might be controversial in this room, but I am for the restoration of earmarks, because it helped make legislation possible. That if I was a congressperson in a district, and there was a bill being passed, it's, Hey, at least I can get some pork for my local museum. And that's a very small price to pay for a functional legislature. So, getting past the filibuster to me is one possible necessity, and the restoration of earmarks could be another.\\n\\nEarmarking allows Congress to appropriate discretionary funds for specific projects. Mr. Yang supports them because he feels they allow representatives to generate revenue for their constituents to offset costs their area might experience from a given piece of legislation.\\n\\nJW: And let me just, one last follow-up on that. If Democrats don't take back the Senate, how do you feel with the Supreme Court — how do you, I mean, put aside expanding the number of justices, how do you even get a justice onto the court in the first place?\\n\\nIt's obviously much harder. I'm all about trying to maximize the possible. And so, if we don't get a majority — I expect the Democrats will win a slight majority in the Senate. I'm very optimistic that way, but we're going to get done what we can get done with the branch of the government we have control of. And I will say too, I believe that we can get some things done that are traditionally bipartisan, regardless of who has control of the Senate. To me, I cannot believe that we did not get infrastructure done during the first couple of years of the Trump administration. I thought at least he would build some bridges and roads, and I was even willing to accept the Trump name on those bridges and roads if it got some bridges and roads built. I was, At least we're going to get this.\\n\\nThe editorial board recently called for the Trump administration to break the impasse on funding for the proposed rail tunnel under the Hudson River in an editorial titled: Build the Donald J. Trump Tunnel. The vital infrastructure project has stalled because of political infighting.\\n\\nKK: We've called for that, too.\\n\\nReally? So, we have to get done what we can get done. And if we have to focus on things that are traditionally bipartisan, I'd be excited to lead with that. I mean, I'd be much more excited to lead with a much bigger agenda to balance out this economy, to work for people. And I will say that's bipartisan, too. When I go around to Americans around the country, if you were to go to a room of Republicans and say, Hey, how do you feel about Amazon paying zero in taxes? They're not excited about that. They feel like this economy is rigged against them and their families, and they're generally correct, and that is bipartisan.\\n\\nJI: You've proposed legalizing gambling at the federal level, regulating it.\\n\\nKK: Online.\\n\\nJI: Yeah, online gambling.\\n\\nJust online poker.\\n\\nJI: Yes. Regulating it heavily and using the revenue to treat gambling addiction. Can you talk through that? You say on your website that you think gambling addiction doesn't get nearly enough attention, and it is a really important issue. How does legalizing gambling, even if you use the revenue, not make that problem worse?\\n\\nAny American who wants to gamble online on a poker site can do so from any state in the country right now. If it's illegal in your state, you just end up using an offshore betting site, which is shady, has problems, but it's not going to ease your gambling addiction at all. So the question is, do we want Americans, in the vast majority of the country, on offshore betting sites, dealing with shady characters and generating no revenue and still being addicted? Or would we prefer that they do business with American firms, where we do have better regulations, we know they're not getting cheated, we know they're not getting exploited, and you generate tax revenue that you can use to treat gambling addiction.\\n\\nMr. Yang's campaign estimates that federally regulating the U.S. online poker market could raise $2.2 billion just in its first year. The campaign also argues that federal regulation would make it easier to combat money laundering.\\n\\nJI: So, what steps would you take to take that money and create a gambling addiction treatment program or system? So, what exactly would you do to get from A to B?\\n\\nI mean, you could make it so it's analogous to what happened in the tobacco industry, where there's a certain level of revenue that gets set aside and then you have various public service announcements.\\n\\nPresident Obama signed into law the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in 2009, which gave the Food and Drug Administration authority to fully regulate the sale of tobacco products.\\n\\nJI: In that system, a lot of that money didn't actually go to treating tobacco-related health problems. A lot of it went to shoring up state budgets, and some of them even went to the tobacco industry actually, so I don't know if that's the best model.\\n\\nIn 2007 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that states direct 14 percent of funds from tobacco taxes and the national settlement toward antismoking campaigns, but most states have funneled it toward other areas, from agriculture to literacy.\\n\\nOh, you might not want to push the money to the states and then have them determine how to use it in their budgets. You could empower a national program or an agency to help administer it at the federal level, if you didn't trust the states to actually use it in the right way.\\n\\nJI: I actually really quickly want to go back to a question that Binya was asking you. You said, you gave us the example of parents with two kids and you're on food stamps and you're worried about your kids' future. And at the end of that explanation, you said that you are not for curtailing social supports, but isn't your plan such that, that mother, aside from what the kids would get in the future, that mother would have to choose between the food stamps and the actual U.B.I., right? Is that correct?\\n\\nThat is correct. But when I've dug into it, very, very few Americans are getting $1,000 in food stamps. And most of the people who are on government assistance live in fear of losing that assistance because there are various requirements that tend to come with it. And when, if you ask them, say, Hey, would you prefer $1,000 unconditional that you can rely upon, they actually think that's too good to be true.\\n\\nJI: Sure. But to Binya's point, it's still a trade-off. So, if I'm on food stamps, I'm getting less of a benefit than, say, Jesse, who's not on food stamps.\\n\\nWell to me, playing the relative benefit game, I mean of course in any large scale national program, it's you can't calibrate it precisely to everyone's individual situation. To me the test is more, is that person going to be better off tomorrow than they are today?\\n\\nKK: So I want to move on. We have some more personal questions for you.\\n\\nReally?\\n\\nKK: I think Mara's going to kick you off.\\n\\nMG: So, if you become president, what government secret are you most excited to learn about?\\n\\nDefinitely aliens, of course.\\n\\nKK: O.K.\\n\\nThat'd be my first question if I got in there, I'd be, All right, let me see them. Let's see what we've been hiding all of these years.\\n\\nKK: And, who has broken your heart?\\n\\nWow, these questions are really fun. Who's broken my heart?\\n\\nBS: Don't be tactical now.\\n\\nThis is — I mean, this is going to make me very sad to say, but I feel like I had an arc or a relationship with President Obama, where it was inspirational when he won. I was celebrating with my wife in the streets. And then over the years I began to feel like we'd missed a great opportunity. So, I'd say there was some heartbreak attached to that. And I worked with the president afterward, and I still admire him a great deal, but I think we could have done a lot more, and I don't think opportunities like that come along very often.\\n\\nThe Obama administration named Mr. Yang a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship in 2015 and a Champion of Change in 2012.\\n\\nKK: For millions of Americans, church and religion are the centers of their communities. Do you believe in God? Do you go to church regularly? Who are your spiritual advisers?\\n\\nI grew up in an entirely secular household. My parents did not talk about God in the house, but I had this instinctive belief in a higher power. I had many Christian relatives. I went to church over holidays growing up quite often. And then I married my wife, Evelyn, who's Christian. And so, we're raising our kids in a Christian church. I go to church when I'm home, which is not very often unfortunately nowadays. I enjoy it. My faith is still very much a journey, but I'm unreservedly thrilled about the impact it has on my wife, my boys, my family, my community.\\n\\nMr. Yang was raised in New York; his parents immigrated from Taiwan.\\n\\nBS: Which denomination?\\n\\nIt's a progressive Protestant church. We primarily go upstate, where we have a house in a town called New Paltz. They've got a rainbow flag up front. It's a very welcoming community.\\n\\nMr. Yang and his family began attending Sunday services at the Reformed Church of New Paltz after they purchased a home nearby in 2015.\\n\\nMG: Actually just a quick follow-up. When was the last time you rode the subway?\\n\\nI rode the subway maybe six weeks ago or so. It's become much more of a pain in the neck now that I actually get recognized. I confess that that's been the biggest adjustment in running for president. Because I was, No, I'm not going to get recognized on the street. Of course, keep in mind, when I started my run I was completely anonymous. I mean none of you had ever heard of me. And also there is, and this is not to make too much of it, but there's also this invisible Asian man thing. That you feel like all you have to do is just not want to be seen and then you disappear, and that doesn't work anymore.\\n\\nWhen I'm on the subway, people will look at me and then look at me. And then eventually someone will inch over and say, Hey, you running for president? And then I'll say, Yes, I am. They'll say, Yeah, yeah, I like you. Thousand bucks a month, something like that. And then they want to take pictures. And then as soon as someone breaks the seal, then it's safe for everyone to do it. And so, then I'll be — and then there's this uncomfortable period in this subway car after you've taken the pictures with him, you're still sitting there. And so then they're, So, where are you going? Or, how's Bernie? Or whatever the questions are. And so, I have not been riding the subway lately, but I've ridden the subway an awful lot over the years. Now my preferred mode of transportation is the bike, because if someone recognizes me, it's generally too late.\\n\\nKK: I thought you were going to say it's a lot harder to ride the subway now because of the breakdowns of New York infrastructure.\\n\\nIn 2017, Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York's subway and pledged $1 billion for improvements. The editorial board has repeatedly called for action to make the subways workable for this paper's millions of readers.\\n\\nThat too. I mean, it's rough. But I mean, New York's going through — I just want to bring some things to you from experience. Like yeah, the infrastructure breaking down. I mean, we're coasting on the investments made decades ago and they're starting to fall apart. But also what you all do in terms of journalism — I've been campaigning around the country and over 1,200 local papers have gone out of business because the local establishments that used to advertise are gone. All of their classified revenue went off to Craigslist and democracy works much less if you don't have local journalism.\\n\\nA report released by PEN America in November found that more than 1,800 local print outlets have closed since 2004, and at least 200 counties have no newspaper.\\n\\nThis, to me, is an emblem of what's gone wrong in American life. Where the market is all knowing and all powerful, and if the market decides that local journalism has zero value, then it has zero value. And that is not the way forward for us. We need to make our own independent determination of our own value as people, of the value of local journalism, of the value of arts, of the value of volunteering, of caregiving, of — like all the most important things in American life. And so you, in many ways, you're like the guardians of this incredible journalistic tradition, and it's like a unique privilege because the people who've pursued the same vocation in other parts of the country are just seeing it disappear.\\n\\nKK: Do you believe in government subsidies for journalism?\\n\\nYes. I have three major pro-journalism proposals on my website, including federally funding journalists for every congressional district, billions of dollars in grants to help transition local journalism. Matching grants, so you're not like saying, Hey, we're going to do this. But matching grants to help transition them to cooperative models of ownership to nonprofit and philanthropic models.\\n\\nOne criticism of government subsidized journalism is that it could stifle the media's capacity to serve as a watchdog.\\n\\nYou can build it around the town library, because a lot of them have this bulletin board that serves as the skeleton of a local paper when the local paper has gone out of business. A lot of these papers would be able to get by if they did not have to generate stock market level returns for hedge fund owners and private equity owners. If you had a cooperative model and it's made a certain amount of money, spent a certain amount of money, ran as a nonprofit, you could restore and sustain local journalism and thousands of communities, but it will not happen without government support. It just won't.\\n\\nKK: Think you might be overly optimistic. Maybe we'll move on to foreign policy, if you don't mind?\\n\\nSure. Yeah.\\n\\nAlex Kingsbury: Another thing the country's invested in quite a lot is the military, and as commander in chief, you'd be in charge of that. Can you tell me how many aircraft carriers the United States Navy has?\\n\\nOh my gosh.\\n\\nAK: Whether or not the Navy is big enough to meet its commitments with the Chinese and the South China Sea? What's going on in the Persian Gulf? What do you think?\\n\\nI think the number of aircraft carriers is either seven or nine. I confess to not knowing precisely. In terms of our investment, we're spending $650 billion plus on our military. Certainly more than any other country, but I think more than the next four countries combined, and we have to examine, at this stage, whether that $650 billion is making us safer and more secure.\\n\\nThe correct answer is 11.\\n\\nWhat are the true threats of the 21st century? Climate change is number one, and then cybersecurity and A.I., loose nuclear material, military drones in the hands of nonstate actors. It's very hard to secure a location from something the size of a flying vacuum cleaner. That's very, very difficult. So we're entering an era where it's going to be much easier to be offensive than defensive, and you don't need massive levels of resources to cause significant levels of damage. To me, a new aircraft carrier does not make our elections any more secure from Russian hacking, which is the most direct threat to our democracy upcoming in this cycle. We're spending money on the threats of the 20th century, and we need to try and modernize our approach as quickly as possible.\\n\\nAK: The president at the moment is at a NATO summit, or he might've left ——\\n\\nI saw the headlines about how people were making fun of him. I was like, Oh man, this is really — we really have to put an end to this administration.\\n\\nMr. Trump canceled a planned news conference at a NATO gathering in December after a video circulated that showed world leaders including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Emmanuel Macron of France in what appeared to be a conversation mocking Mr. Trump.\\n\\nAK: But one of his priorities has been to get our European allies to spend more money on their own defense. And I wonder if you think that that's a worthwhile goal and how you might go about it, if you agree that that's something that should be a priority for the United States.\\n\\nTo me, one of the worst things you can do in a relationship is if you have this longstanding understanding or a friendship or partnership, and then you try and change the understanding at a particular point in time and do it unilaterally.\\n\\nWe need to let our historic allies know that our commitments are good, and that if we want to make a change, we want to do it in a way that's not pulling the rug out from under you but actually consultative. If we want other people to invest more, then we have to try and sit down with them and drive them to do so without questioning our commitment to NATO wholesale. But to me, trying to nickel-and-dime our relationships with our historic allies is not the best way forward. I think it was James Mattis that said that if you invest more in diplomacy, you have to invest less in ammunition, which should be the goal. So we need to make sure our partnerships and alliances are actually strong, stable and secure, and then we can put pressure on Russia and China with more of a global consensus, and maintain the international world order that's benefited us for decades that now is falling apart because Donald Trump is so erratic and unreliable, even with the people we've been allies with for decades.\\n\\nIn response to announcements about Mr. Trump's planned cuts to State Department funding, retired generals wrote a letter to lawmakers citing Secretary of Defense James Mattis's 2013 comment, If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately.\\n\\nAK: Speaking of allies, should Ukraine be invited to join NATO? I know that Ukraine's received sort of undue influence on this election, but going forward?\\n\\nI mean, that's not solely an American decision. NATO expansion is something that is fraught and elevates tensions with Russia in particular. I think we should explore it. I'm sympathetic, but it's not a decision we can make alone.\\n\\nA recent poll found that roughly 50 percent of the Ukrainian population favors joining NATO, though Hungary's foreign minister recently said his country would block Ukrainian membership unless Ukraine changed a policy restricting its citizens' use of minority languages.\\n\\nKK: Do you think — speaking of allies, do you think Turkey is still an ally to the United States, and do you think the U.S. should have nuclear weapons there?\\n\\nThis is what's so tough right now is that countries are trying to figure out what are the benefits of being an ally of the United States and doing what we want them to do, and then what are the costs. Unfortunately that calculation is going against us more and more. Turkey's relationship with the U.S. has been stronger than our relationship with many other countries in that region. I think we should invest in that relationship if we're going to be able to accomplish any of our goals there. And that includes, to me, being a little bit more accommodating about behaviors that we might find objectionable or troubling from them than we might from another country.\\n\\nSerge Schmemann: Yeah. And staying with relationships and alliances, President Trump has reversed several key policies the United States has had toward Israel. He's moved the embassy to Jerusalem, he's recognized sovereignty over the Golan Heights, et cetera, et cetera. Would you reverse those?\\n\\nHistorically, we've endorsed a two-state solution, which has always struck me as the best way forward, and I think it's really unfortunate that Donald Trump has moved us away from that to the extent that he has. I would try to move us back in that direction.\\n\\nMr. Yang has frequently reiterated his commitment to a two-state solution but has not released any detailed plans about how he would advance an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan or address Mr. Trump's policies in the region. He told the Council on Foreign Relations, I don't want to prescribe the specifics of a two-state solution, as the Israeli and Palestinian people both need to be leading any conversation, and I look forward to engaging with all stakeholders.\\n\\nSS: O.K. Again, about your responsibilities as president. One of the heaviest ones would be waging war. When you look back on the conflicts into which recent presidents have put us, would you support this? Is this something you would have done in Syria, in Libya, in Kosovo? Would you have sent troops there?\\n\\nSo I have a three-part test for sending troops into harm's way. Number one, it needs to advance a vital American interest or avert a humanitarian catastrophe. Number two, it has to have a clearly defined timeline where we can look troops in the eyes and say, It's going to take this long and you're going to be able to accomplish our mission and then you're going to be able to come home. And not some boardroom self-delusion, like you actually believe that you're going to get it done and then be able to bring them home in that time frame. And number three, we're not going in alone; there are allies joining us in the mission. If those three things are in place, then I would consider sending our troops into harm's way.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, I think we have become overly aggressive and optimistic about what we can accomplish in various foreign theaters. I've signed a pledge to end the forever wars because I don't believe it's the will of the American people for us to be in a constant state of armed conflict in foreign theaters for years and even decades at a time. Our Constitution says that it's in Congress's hands to declare war, but Congress has completely ceded this authority through the A.U.M.F. [Authorization for Use of Military Force] and then just said, Hey, executive branch, you can do what you want. And now they want nothing to do with it, and that is not the will of the American people, and it's not the will of the Constitution. So we should repeal the A.U.M.F. and say, Look, Congress, if we want to authorize armed conflict, it should be on you and it should be the will of the people.\\n\\nCommon Defense's End the Forever War pledge advocates for an expedient conclusion to the global war on terror and American military involvement in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, and Mr. Yang became the fourth candidate to sign on, in May, following Senators Sanders and Warren (and former Senator Mike Gravel).\\n\\nSS: Concretely, would you have sent troops, say, to Syria?\\n\\nNo. I'd have to look at the facts at the time that that decision was being made.\\n\\nJames Dao: Can I pose a future hypothetical? If the Chinese government were to flood Hong Kong with military troops after you were president and impose a violent crackdown, similar to, say, Tiananmen Square in 1989, what would you do?\\n\\nI have family in Hong Kong. I spent a semester there in college, and so when I see those streets wracked with riots and violence, I actually remember being on those streets. And so it's incredibly jarring, and it's an extraordinary situation because of Hong Kong's status as this semiautonomous region that's being reintegrated back into China.\\n\\nOur best path forward with China is to try and have them continue to show restraint, but also see that the costs to human rights abuse is not just in Hong Kong, but with their ethnic minorities and the Muslim population of Uighurs, that the costs are higher than their perceived benefits of maintaining social order and stability. In order to have those costs feel real to the Chinese, we can't just moralize and say, Hey, do the right thing. Because at this point they're looking at us and saying like, Keep your opinions and value statements to yourselves.\\n\\nWe have to be working toward China's second main priority, which is maintaining robust economic growth. So there are two goals. There are two primary goals that are sometimes in tension, of maintaining social order and maintaining robust economic growth. And the best way we can try and contain their behavior in Hong Kong is to say, Look, the economic costs are going to be very, very high. And the best way we can do that is to build global consensus around certain norms and behaviors.\\n\\nAt the last debate, I proposed a world data organization, because to me, China's in position to leapfrog us in artificial intelligence. They're investing tens of billions in a way that our government is not. It's a national effort. And they've now separated their technology ecosystem from the West's and they're trying to sell their software and operating systems to other countries with very limited success right now, but this parallel tech universe, to me, is something that we can actually use to bring China back to the table.\\n\\nThat's why something like world data organization is so vital. When they had to join the W.T.O. [World Trade Organization], they realized this was going to be vital to their economic growth, so they're going to have to make some decisions and compromises in order to join the world order. We can create an analogous situation for data and technology and then use that to try and curb some of their worst abuses and behaviors. Now, is this going to happen in time to help Hong Kong? I certainly hope so. I mean, I certainly hope that they don't flood the streets of Hong Kong with troops any time in the next number of days or weeks.\\n\\nMr. Yang has been critical of China's increasingly authoritarian behavior and told the Council on Foreign Relations the United States must in reply demonstrate a model for democratic capitalism.\\n\\nKK: And do you think President Xi is a dictator?\\n\\nI think he meets just about every conventional definition of dictator. Yes.\\n\\nCharlie Warzel: You were talking about data and that's a good segue into some of the — I mean, you're probably the candidate who sort of runs on understanding the internet better than anyone right now. And I'm curious first about this worldwide data organization. For someone like China, wouldn't it actually be better for them to sort of hoard that data and hoard that information and keep that closed system?\\n\\nMr. Yang has proposed what he describes as a W.T.O. for data and has argued that data ownership should be made a property right. Some argue that such an organization could enable more partnership among countries in setting standards for artificial intelligence and data.\\n\\nSo this is the carrot and the stick. So imagine if you had data standards that were endorsed by the U.S., the E.U., and Japan, and it had certain technology protocols associated with it. Then China said, Hey, I don't want to adhere to that. Because like you said, they like to hoard data, and one of the reasons why they're in position to leapfrog us is they have more data than we do and they have essentially nonexistent privacy rights or regulations. They have complete surveillance. That's one reason why they've banned masks in Hong Kong, so that their surveillance technology can pick up who the protesters are. So China has its own vast hoard of data.\\n\\nThere has been a continuing controversy over Hong Kong's law banning masks to target anti-government protesters. One court ruling found it unconstitutional, but a later ruling temporarily reinstated it.\\n\\nBut for them the challenge is not even what's happening internally. The challenge is whether or not they can get developing countries on board with their technology standards to be able to roll them out internationally. So if you're a third party, let's say you're a developing country in Africa or Latin America, then you have a choice essentially between the global standard and the Chinese standard. And if you're the Chinese, you do not want a standard that only you are using over time, because that's going to curb your economic upside to all of the software that you're building. One of the reasons why our tech companies are so successful is that they export it to virtually the entire rest of the world, and China does not want to be in the opposite position.\\n\\nCW: I'm curious, then, focusing on the U.S., a couple of months ago the general counsel for the N.S.A. wrote an Op-Ed for us and was worried about this big challenge of the government not being able to acquire the tech talent. That Silicon Valley is actually so much more attractive, so much more interesting there. And that when you're looking at 5G technology, quantum computing, technology, A.I., not having engineers in that space and sort of outsourcing that to the private sector is potentially incredibly dangerous. Like how do you actually make people want to come and bring that engineering talent to the federal government, rather than ——\\n\\nKK: Especially given your proposal for Department of the Attention Economy.\\n\\nWell, the Department of the Attention Economy would likely be based in Silicon Valley, and it'd be run by a guy named Tristan Harris, who's a design ethicist. He started Time Well Spent. So I don't think it's necessarily the case that you need to try and bring everyone into the cubicles in D.C. to get the rules ——\\n\\nMr. Yang has been the most vocal of all candidates about privacy issues. Tristan Harris, whom he has alluded to in discussing the Department of the Attention Economy, spent three years as a Google design ethicist. He left to found the Center for Humane Technology, a nonprofit that seeks to address the digital attention crisis.\\n\\nKK: I meant more make people want to work for government? And I think that's your question, right?\\n\\nCW: Yeah. Rather than, you know, a big exit or something like that. Sexy start-up.\\n\\nSo the clearest emblem of this is NASA and space travel where we all watched the Apollo 13 movies and we've seen the armies of research scientists helping launch these missions. Now where those research scientists? They're all at Space X and Blue Origin and they're there working for the tech guys who are putting billions into it. It's going to be very, very difficult to somehow reverse essentially decades of talent migration into the private sector. And if you're a talented kid out of Stanford, why would you work for the federal government? It's like if you're working in the private sector, you feel like you're going to go faster, you're certainly going to get paid more. You're going to be working with smarter people and you idolize Elon Musk, like who the heck, you know?\\n\\nKK: Yeah, that's literally our question.\\n\\nAY: Yeah. And I will say on a personal level, I spent seven years recruiting some of our top educational products to Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis. So I have seen that essentially the tide has turned in the direction it's gone and we should not be relying upon the government as the primary employer of a lot of this tech talent. We have to face facts and say, at this point, most of the intellectual capital is being attracted to these private firms and we need to instead try and support and work with the private firms.\\n\\nThrough Venture for America, Mr. Yang created opportunities for college graduates in under-resourced American cities — but almost half of V.F.A. alumni left the cities they were placed in through the fellowship.\\n\\nCW: Well, what about when it comes to like the N.S.A. and the technology they have and the surveillance? You don't want Google doing surveillance of people here and abroad?\\n\\nBS: Any more than they already are.\\n\\nCW: More than they already are. Right.\\n\\nMore than they already are.\\n\\nCW: But doing it in a national security sense. Or do you?\\n\\nI mean, the question is what trade-offs you're willing to make, really. The N.S.A. is going to be able to recruit the tech talent that he can recruit and you want to try and ramp that up. So one thing ——\\n\\nCW: They're worried about it.\\n\\nThey should be, I mean clearly. Because if you spend time on these campuses, you know where they're going. So one thing you can do that's very, very fast and immediate is you can become much more flexible in terms of compensation and a type of work environment.\\n\\nSo if you had, for example, a rule that said, Look, the government is allowed to match whatever salary a private sector employee is being offered, then you'd have more success. If you said, Look, you don't need to move to Washington, D.C., and sit in the thing that was built decades ago, that's like solace, and you have this giant parking lot and you just feel miserable being there for like a day, let alone a career.\\n\\nMr. Yang has said most Americans don't want to work for the federal government and argued that his Freedom Dividend would therefore be more effective than a program like a federal jobs guarantee.\\n\\nIt seems like a nice place to work. Then you might have greater success. We also saw this happen even with the rollout of healthcare.gov. Remember this? It's like they had the consultant and then they totally botched it and then they needed to bring in the ——\\n\\nBS: Remember The New Yorker cartoon?\\n\\nHm?\\n\\nBS: The New Yorker cartoon. They had a secretary with like a floppy disk. With her glasses pulled down and her fingers crossed.\\n\\nSee The New Yorker satirizing the Affordable Care Act rollout here.\\n\\nAnd it's not just the leading edge N.S.A.-type stuff. If you look around congressional offices or the I.R.S., they're all using technology from the '90s or whatever it is. I had a whiz kid who said he got yelled at for writing a script in a congressional office that automated a task. They were like, No, we just wanted you to do it manually forever. So there needs to be a massive modernization effort. Not just in terms of how we recruit tech talent at the highest levels, but how we function even in the basics.\\n\\nCW: Sort of pivoting off of that, you said that Senator Warren's taking sort of a 20th-century antitrust framework to big tech. What does a 21st-century framework look like in that?\\n\\nThe 21st-century framework. First, you don't use price as your primary determinant of whether or not there are antitrust problems, because the tech companies would say, What? We would never gouge anyone. It's free. We're underselling everyone. So that you have to get rid of, and that's not something she's advocating, but what she is advocating, which I find to be a bit backward looking, is thinking that competition is the answer in these spaces. And competition misses the point in one way and another way.\\n\\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation, like Mr. Yang, has argued that the country's approach to antitrust regulation is outmoded. In early 2019, the Federal Trade Commission created a new task force focused on monitoring competition in technology markets, which the foundation celebrated as a step toward modernizing antitrust.\\n\\nLet me explain. I'm a parent. I've got — how many of you all are parents? So if your kids are like my kids, they are mesmerized by any screen that is nearby. I regularly challenge my kids. I say, What's more important? People or screens? And they know the right answer's people. And then if they say screens, then I hold them upside down by their ankles until they say, People, people. And the people that are most diligent about screen time are the tech folks in Silicon Valley. You go there, and all of a sudden there's not a screen to be had because they know that we have the smartest engineers in the country turning supercomputers into dopamine delivery devices for kids, because that's how they make their millions of dollars.\\n\\nSo if that's your problem and you break Facebook into Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, does that somehow make the kids stronger or healthier? No. If anything, it actually ratchets up the incentives to try and further their engagement.\\n\\nSo if that's your problem, you have to go and try and solve it directly by getting into the guts of the apps and say, What are the design choices you made? Let's calibrate them so they actually balance our kids' health and not just your financial returns. So that's one way she's missing the point.\\n\\nThe other way is that many of these competitive markets end up very quickly accelerating toward one or two winners and saying, I'm going to break you up. Does not solve that problem. I joke that it would be cruel and unusual punishment to say you have to use the fourth-best navigation app. Like what is that? Apple Maps. We all hate Apple Maps, right? If you use that thing, you're like, Oh. You curse the gods until you figure out how to get Google Maps going. So going up and saying, Look, you're the winner in the space. We're going to break you up, it doesn't revive Main Street businesses, and it doesn't actually end up solving the competition problem.\\n\\nIf you want to solve the hyperacquisition problem, which is a problem, then you have to go in and say, Look, you have to not acquire businesses that are in your space with these criteria. That would be a legitimate stance to take, because right now the business model in Silicon Valley is not to try and outcompete the behemoth. It's just to get bought by them. If you get to a point where they'll offer you $1 billion and you win, your investors win, you're rich and then these get folded in, and it doesn't even matter what they do with your business at that point.\\n\\nOver the past five years, 90 percent of A.I. start-ups in Silicon Valley were acquired by major companies, according to TechCrunch.\\n\\nBA: You've expressed profound distrust of market forces. You just compared the major tech companies to drug dealers, and you want the N.S.A. to outsource national security work to them?\\n\\nI do not want the N.S.A. to outsource national security work to them. I want them to try and fight fire with fire and actually recruit using some of the same methods, and I want the N.S.A. to try and work with them to the extent that they're realistic, and they know that Google is going to be innovating in ways that the N.S.A. will not be able to do.\\n\\nCW: Going back though, my question is, there's an issue of power here. I mean, sure. You might not want to. You might not be able to address the problems of Facebook if you break it up from Instagram, and I understand that, and there's still going to be addictive products, but there's an issue of the consolidation of actual power, the ability to buy those companies, to make those acquisitions. Just simply the leverage that Mark Zuckerberg can use to have a meeting with Donald Trump that they won't tell us about, I mean, how do you — if you don't break them up, how do you get rid of that conglomeration of power?\\n\\nNF: I mean, is there still a role for 20th-century antitrust?\\n\\nYes. All of this is a prelude to say that, should some of the tech companies be asked to divest parts of their businesses? One hundred percent yes. Like Amazon should not be selling its own house brand to its advantage to other goods. These companies do have excessive power and influence. At this point you could argue they control our democracy.\\n\\nSo, and I know The New York Times, I mean you've had your issues with Facebook and the rest of it, and they made a change and then all sorts of things happen.\\n\\nListening to the tape, we have no idea what this means.\\n\\nSo, right now, the government is like this flopping appendage behind a lot of this stuff. I mean, honestly. The Office of Technology Assessment was eliminated in 1995. So our legislature is literally 24 years behind the curve on technology, and they don't understand. They're totally outgunned. They don't know what's going on.\\n\\nSo you definitely need to bring the tech companies to heel and say, Look, here are the list of problems we're concerned about. But the solution to the abuse of power is not to say like, Hey, we're just going to try and keep anyone in the country from having the ability to do wrong. What you have to do is you have to figure out what the abuses you're concerned about are, and then actually address them directly.\\n\\nCW: Who else besides you that you're running against understands the internet?\\n\\nI haven't hung out with enough of them to know, but I'm confident I understand the internet better than the [cross talk]——\\n\\nCW: What's your gut feeling? Who gets it?\\n\\nI'm going to say I do not have confidence that any of my opponents ge"}

{"original": "Aftershocks is thematically structured like an earthquake, including the rumbling foreshocks and the shuddering ground after an upheaval. The narrative swings back and forth in time, from Owusu's earliest memories to a week she spent in her room a decade ago, when she was 28, barely moving from a blue rocking chair she had pulled off the street and hauled up to her Manhattan apartment. I have written for meaning rather than order, she says in a prefatory note. She keeps returning to her chosen metaphor, looking for the fault lines, closing in on the epicenter. The softer the soil, the stronger the shaking, she writes.\\n\\n[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of January. See the full list. ]\\n\\nHer seven days in the blue chair were occasioned by her stepmother telling her that her father hadn't died of brain cancer, as Owusu had believed, but of AIDS. Owusu had idolized her father; she calls him her Baba-Mama, the parent who believed in her, who loved her. He died just before she turned 14; she remembers him slipping in and out of delirium, crying out for his own mother in his sleep. They were living in Rome at the time, because her father happened to be stationed there. But Ghana, which she visited, didn't feel like home to her either. The ancestral mourning rituals that his family forced her to endure made her feel even more alienated.\\n\\nImage Nadia Owusu, whose new memoir is Aftershocks. Credit... Beowulf Sheehan\\n\\nIt wasn't supposed to be that way. Owusu was raised to feel as if she could live anywhere. I know how my parents believed their love and the birth of their daughters to be a part of something important, she writes, a movement fueled by borderless love. Her father's family lamented his decision to marry a white woman. Any river loses its identity when entering the sea, they said. The marriage failed; Owusu had to struggle to piece together who she was, where she belonged, whom she loved. Was her father's family right?\\n\\nThey were and they weren't. Aftershocks knits together the author's own experiences with the histories of some of the places she has lived. She has seen poverty and suffering and civil wars, but always at a remove, while ensconced in the privileged bubble of expat life. She was in high school in Kampala, Uganda, when there was a string of grenade attacks in the city, but she doesn't remember feeling worried. What was the worst we could imagine while watching 'Melrose Place?' she writes. Her view of herself is exacting and remorseless. I did not fear for my life because I knew my life would be protected over the lives of others."}
{"original": "To call Grand Horizons one of the brightest shows to hit Broadway in years is not to tout its intelligence, which flickers. Rather, I mean that it is blindingly lit, no doubt in deference to the theatrical wisdom that defines comedy as what dies in the dark.\\n\\nAnd, boy, does Grand Horizons want to sell itself as comedy. Not witty comedy with its verbal arabesques, nor intellectual comedy with its Paris Review name-checks, nor meta-comedy with its scrambled plotlines — but the vanilla kind that once dominated commercial theater. It's not entirely meant as praise to say that this Second Stage production is a big-laugh, blue-joke, bourgeois lark of the type Neil Simon mastered until the times mastered him and the genre petered out.\\n\\nThere's a reason it did, and perhaps what the playwright Bess Wohl is attempting in Grand Horizons, which opened on Thursday at the Helen Hayes Theater, is a last-ditch act of reclamation: a boulevard comedy for a cul-de-sac age.\\n\\nShe has certainly furnished the play with all the original equipment. For starters, there's the zingy premise: Over dinner one night, Nancy, a retired librarian approaching 80, turns to Bill, her husband of 50 years, and calmly announces that she wants a divorce. All right, he answers, continuing to eat as the audience roars."}

And that's before the title card.\\n\\nRebounding from this mortifyingly dumb opening proves less difficult for Stuart than for the movie, directed by Archie Borders.

{"original": "THE DOCTORS BLACKWELL\\n\\nHow Two Pioneering Sisters Brought Medicine to Women and Women to Medicine\\n\\nBy Janice P. Nimura\\n\\nIn 1849, when Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman doctor in America, the medical profession was neither well established nor well respected nor well paid. Germ theory was more than a decade away, and in hospitals for the poor, surgeons in blood-caked aprons went from handling corpses to delivering babies without washing their hands. In wealthy homes, physicians coasted on charisma and connections as much as skill. At all levels of society, doctors had little more to rely on than purgatives, laudanum and lancets. What kind of woman would fight to join their ranks?\\n\\nIn her richly detailed and propulsive biography of Elizabeth and her sister Emily Blackwell, Janice P. Nimura considers and discards a couple of possible origin stories. The most narratively appealing is 17-year-old Elizabeth's experience caring for her father on his deathbed, in which it is tempting to discern … the germ of her medical future. Tempting, but too easy. No single story convincingly explains why a young woman enthralled by literature and philosophy should plummet into the earthy business of bodies.\\n\\nNor is the answer easy to detect in her personality. It was not a caring instinct that drove her — I have no turn for benevolencies, she wrote to her brother Henry in 1855 — or a curious one, to advance medical science beyond leeches, mercury and prayer. And while she was roused by the Transcendentalist Margaret Fuller's exhortation to let them be sea-captains, if you will, she was no feminist foremother: She did not believe in suffrage and rejected the fellowship of the burgeoning women's movement. She denounced women as petty, trifling, priest-ridden, gossiping, stupid, inane, and desperately in need of leadership from a superior being like herself. More than anything, Elizabeth Blackwell became a doctor to show the world that she alone could do it."}

{"original": "¿Quieres quedarte con tu burbuja pandémica?\\n\\nEntre las muchas lecciones aprendidas en 2020, el poder de un grupo de amigos de confianza puede ser el más duradero. Este verano, casi la mitad de los estadounidenses dijeron que habían formado una burbuja social: un grupo selecto de amigos para ayudarles a enfrentar la vida pandémica.\\n\\nHizo falta una pandemia para enseñarnos lo que muchas culturas han sabido desde siempre: que los círculos de amistad pueden darnos vidas más saludables y felices. Dan Buettner, becario y autor de National Geographic, ha estudiado los hábitos de las personas que viven en zonas azules, que son áreas alrededor del mundo donde la gente vive mucho más tiempo que el promedio. Ha descubierto sistemáticamente que las culturas con una larga esperanza de vida valoran los lazos sociales fuertes. En Okinawa, Japón, por ejemplo, donde la esperanza de vida promedio de las mujeres es de alrededor de 90 años, las personas forman una especie de red social durante la infancia llamada moai: un grupo de cinco amigos que ofrecen apoyo social, logístico, emocional e incluso financiero para toda la vida. Los miembros de cada moai también parecen influir en los comportamientos de salud de los demás durante toda la vida.\\n\\nBuettner ha trabajado en varias ciudades para tratar de replicar el efecto moai. En Nápoles, Florida, por ejemplo, encontró a 110 personas que querían mejorar sus hábitos alimenticios, y comenzó agrupándolos por vecindario. (Si viven demasiado lejos, no se reunirán, dijo). Luego les hizo preguntas sobre intereses y valores compartidos, como si una persona veía Fox News o CNN, si le gustaban las vacaciones en la playa o las caminatas, si iba a la iglesia o si le gustaba la música country. Las personas con intereses compartidos que vivían cerca unas de otras formaron moais de cinco o seis personas, y luego planearon cinco cenas en la que cada uno llevaba un tipo de comida."}
{"original": "That was just what worried me: the possibility of past-its-prime ham. (Mr. Lithgow has never been uncomfortable with the grand style.) Stories by Heart seemed to be the kind of quick and cheap show that a theater company, in this case the Roundabout, mounts when there's a hole in its schedule or budget. (The production, directed by Daniel Sullivan, is luxurious only in Kenneth Posner's lighting.) Besides, who needs the equivalent of a bedtime fairy tale on Broadway when you can have your phone read you Moby-Dick on the subway?\\n\\nThough golden enough for any nostalgist, Stories by Heart is neither soporific nor cute. For starters, the two stories that Mr. Lithgow recites — Haircut in the first act and P. G. Wodehouse's Uncle Fred Flits By in the second — are superb, outlandish and, in very different ways, hair-raising.\\n\\nYou wouldn't guess that from the opening of Haircut, in which a professionally logorrheic barber entertains a new customer with tales of life in his two-bit town. There's this practical joker, you see, and this gal who won't give him the time of day and this doctor she likes and so on. But the story soon asserts itself, or rather insinuates itself, as a scathing indictment of good-old-boy-ism: the barely civilized tradition of men playing tricks on one another and arranging nasty traps (including marriage) for women.\\n\\nThat's all in the Lardner, but Mr. Lithgow adds another emotional channel by showing us how the barber, himself a good old boy, is implicated in the nastiness he pretends only to describe.

{"original": "But I also noticed times when I mistook benevolence for selfishness, times when my motive was all about avoiding a difficult, but necessary, conversation. I struggled greatly to be honest with my husband about how I had developed intense feelings for another man. Once I finally spilled the truth, it opened up a conversation about our very different expectations of marriage — mine turned out to be very high, even though I hadn't fully acknowledged it. We navigated our way around unhelpful emotions like blame and found each other again, ultimately coming out stronger. But I never would have understood who I was inside my marriage without the conversations my honesty forced.\\n\\n3. We have to be more honest with children than ever before.\\n\\nResearch from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology showed that when adults don't give children the whole truth, children work to fill in the gaps — and are then less likely to trust the adult. Victoria Talwar, a psychology professor at McGill University, has found that as children grow, they develop increasing confusion around truth and lies, especially when parents tell them lying is wrong, but then proceed to lie in front of them.\\n\\nThere's also this: Telling kids the difficult or awkward truth is a great chance to impart values. I learned this from the sex educator Amy Lang, author of Birds + Bees + Your Kids. So when my very curious middle-schooler asked me if a certain slang term meant oral sex, instead of changing the topic or squirming out of answering, I was able to say, Yes, and … oral sex is a way that people like to be sexual without worrying about getting pregnant. It's part of a healthy sex life. But it's definitely not for kids. It's for later.\\n\\nWith so much information at our kids' disposal — my kids are now 11 and 9 and fully understand how to use the internet — it's absolutely not the time to abdicate on talking about the uncomfortable truths, whether it's sex and consent, racism, gun violence or suicide. Changing the topic is no longer an option for me as a parent in 2020.\\n\\n4. We lie at work to protect our identity.\\n\\nKeith Leavitt, an ethics researcher and associate professor at Oregon State University, has found that workplace lies are often related to protecting our identity, whether we define ourselves through our achievements, through the roles in which we serve others, or through belonging to a group. We tend to tell three kinds of lies at work: lies that protect my own accomplishment, lies that protect someone I'm close to, and lies that protect my company, Dr. Leavitt says.\\n\\nWhen people feel pigeonholed by the way they define themselves — to the point that it's the only way they can see themselves — they often use deception to double down on that identity. Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced founder of Theranos, is an extreme example; a less serious example might be the professor who quickly changes the station to NPR before a colleague gets into the car. The challenge, Dr. Leavitt says, is to be able to pivot to another identity when you feel threatened. The star saleswoman who failed to win the contract, for example, could remember that she is also a mentor.\\n\\n5. The biggest lies we tell are to ourselves.\\n\\nZoe Chance, a professor in Yale University's school of management, has shown that even when people do well on a test because they were allowed to cheat, they still see themselves as responsible for their success. People in her experiment who were allowed to cheat on a test in which an answer key was accidentally made visible kept predicting they would do well on future tests that didn't contain an answer key. It took them doing poorly on two more tests before they finally realized they probably weren't going to do so great without the answer key they had on the first test."}
{"original": "I was the first girl, and nobody believed me, Ms. Hawkins said. And after that it continued to happen, again and again and again.\\n\\nEpisode one details the threats and harassment rained down upon the women who spoke out in the original documentary. The parents of one young woman, Faith Rodgers, said they had to move out of fear for their safety. A Kelly associate threatened to release a compromising video of Ms. Rodgers with Mr. Kelly, and she had a seizure from the stress. Another woman, Jerhonda Pace, said strangers, presumably Mr. Kelly's fans, threatened to beat her up in a parking lot when she was out with her children. She has since moved out of Illinois.\\n\\n[A timeline of the accusations against R. Kelly.]\\n\\nMr. Kelly's brothers discuss their childhood in Chicago, including how Mr. Kelly was sexually abused by a family member and a family acquaintance.\\n\\nIn episode two, Ms. Hawkins shares her story on camera for the first time. Mr. Kelly used to call her the cable girl, because she hooked him up: She connected him to other young girls whom he had sex with, all of them, she said, between the ages of 14 and 16. He was 25 at the time. Eventually, Mr. Kelly began having sex with her, too. She later sued him and settled for $250,000. As part of the settlement, she signed a nondisclosure agreement, the first in a series of confidentiality agreements with women that kept his conduct a secret, and allowed it to continue.\\n\\nOn Thursday night, audiences were also introduced to some of Mr. Kelly's former employees, including Lindsey Perryman-Dunn. She said that she did not believe the waves of allegations against him, even though she had seen the videotape at the center of his 2008 child pornography trial and believed it showed him having sex with an underage girl.\\n\\nOne of Mr. Kelly's brothers, Carey Kelly, said Mr. Kelly offered him a car, a record deal and $50,000 to say that it was Carey Kelly on the tape. He refused."}

As residents look to move on, they cite a Chinese saying that warns against forgetting the pain after a scar heals.\\n\\nTo many in this central Chinese city, the saying sums up a temptation to let go of the bad memories while reveling in the recovery. To families grieving in the shadows, it means the danger of hastily forgetting without a public reckoning for the lives needlessly lost.\\n\\nA year ago when Wuhan shut down, it offered the world a forewarning about the dangers of the virus. Now, it heralds a post-pandemic world where the relief at unmasked faces, joyous get-togethers and daily commutes conceals the emotional aftershocks.\\n\\nIn Wuhan, residents savor ordinary pleasures that a year ago became forbidden hazards, like strolling along the historic Jianghan shopping street.

{"original": "As she travels the stage in an introductory zigzag, greeting her friends and family with upper body gestures, her feet sing with youthful brilliance — small sideways jumps (pas de chat) and incisive pointwork. After the first 10 seconds, her energy changes to even higher spirits and bigger contrasts. In one repeated phrase (13 seconds to 24 seconds), her torso leans forward as she gives special emphasis to one small step (petit développé); then another step (a turning relevé grand développé) opens her body up more expansively; and there follows a bigger, quicker jump.\\n\\nWhat does all this tell us? That Aurora's native language is classical ballet. Her parents express themselves in mime alone, but she speaks pure dance (like her fairy godmothers in the ballet's Prologue), and she possesses full command of its vocabulary and resources. Here she is all outward impulsiveness, but during the ballet, she changes gear and mood, again and again.\\n\\nFor dancers, this entrance is famously challenging: Aurora's opening rush of vivacity must change pace and scale as she meets the suitors and dances with them the famous, ceremonious Rose Adagio. (Since the 1940s, this has featured a series of exposed balances on point that add to the adagio's high-wire nature, but the whole number is, above all, a multifaceted courtship drama — which Aurora, having not yet met Prince Right, leaves unresolved.)\\n\\nMany ballerinas have found the whole role elusive. Who is Aurora? She scarcely expresses any personal emotion; others control her destiny; she begins happy and she ends happy, with a hundred years of zzz in between."}

He'd become far too neglectful and indifferent for a young woman who expected, well, more.\\n\\nHer mother, who had gotten married at 14 to a stranger twice her age, couldn't understand the fuss. She'd stuck with her husband for five decades until he died, and was appalled that young women these days didn't do the same.\\n\\nBut for Ms. Amadou, who married at 16, simply having a husband was not enough. She never wanted to depend on a man in the first place. So, on a busy morning in Maradi, Niger, she sat in front of a judge at a crowded Islamic court on the sidewalk and asked for what young women across the region are seeking like never before: a divorce.\\n\\nFor centuries, women have been expected to endure bad marriages in many conservative pockets of West Africa. Divorce happened, but most often the husbands were the ones casting off their partners. Tradition has bound women so tightly that spouses are sometimes chosen for babies in the womb."}
{"original": "[MUSIC PLAYING] When you walk in the room, do you have sway?\\n\\narchived recording (noel king) — your local member station. You can keep the conversation going with us on social media. I'm Noel King.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nEnjoying the NPR?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nYes, I was listening, the last minutes of NPR this morning.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nOh, well, I always know that NPR sound. I don't have an NPR voice, unfortunately. Here in the small village of San Juan. You know, they're always somewhere beautiful and calm.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nThat's right, and they speak very quietly.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nThey do and slowly.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nThat's right. Yes.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nThat's not me. Sorry. You got the wrong gal here. Bryan Cranston was a working actor for decades before he got his big break, starring as Walter White in Breaking Bad. It was a career-defining role but also a potential trap. Where do you go after you play Heisenberg?\\n\\narchived recording (bryan cranston) Say my name. archived recording Heisenberg. archived recording (bryan cranston) You're goddamn right.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nIn Bryan Cranston's case, you go on to play even more powerful men. He was Lyndon Baines Johnson in Broadway's All The Way, and he was Howard Beale in Network. He won the Tony for both roles. And these days, he's New Orleans judge Michael Desiato in the Showtime series Your Honor. His character's son has just accidentally killed a kid on a motorcycle — but not just any kid on a motorcycle.\\n\\narchived recording (bryan cranston) The boy you hit this morning is Jimmy Baxter's son. That's who you killed. Jimmy Baxter is the head of the most vicious crime family in the history of this city. Do you understand what that means?\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nCranston's character has to decide, does he stand by his principles and send his child to certain death in prison, or does he abuse this position of power to save his son? Bryan Cranston, welcome.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nThank you, good to be here.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nIn Breaking Bad, you play a law-abiding chemistry teacher who decides to cook meth to provide for his family. In Your Honor, you play an incredibly upstanding judge, and you subvert the law to save your son. The shift to subversion was rather quick for this judge.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nWhat's interesting to me about the differences is that in Breaking Bad, Walter White methodically planned his next move in life, even though he was given only two years to live. But he designed his future, as short as it may have been. In this story, Michael Desiato has no time. He needs to make a decision impulsively that will alter the course of his life for who knows how long. So he doesn't have the luxury of time to look back and think, well, wait a minute. If I make this decision now, what's it going to do? What are the repercussions down the road?\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nRight. He's portrayed as such a good guy, and you begin by liking him. But I have to say, I already dislike him because some of the corners you're cutting and how quickly he went right into criminality, really, just so easily — and sloppily, by the way.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nLet me turn the tables on you a little bit, all right?\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nAll right, you turn the table. Turn them away. Lazy Susan me, as I like to say.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nYeah, that's it. What would you do if you felt that your child was under mortal threat? Would you voluntarily become a criminal?\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nI had that discussion last night. I have two teen sons, and I thought, I would turn him in.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nNow, wait a second.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nOK, I know. I know. I feel terrible. I know, to the mobster.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nBut if you knew your son was very likely going to be killed in prison, would you still do that?\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nIt was very difficult, but I'd have to say yes. I'm a terrible mother.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nNo, first of all, it's also easy to do it in a hypothetical situation. But in my character's case, he fully intended to do the right thing, as you saw. And it was that impulsive moment, when he saw that mobster, to alter the course of his life by making that decision.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nAll right, what would you do? Let me lazy Susan you back.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nI would do the same thing.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nProtect your child?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nAbsolutely.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nThere's no question. If I felt, in my heart of hearts, that by doing the right thing, it would put my child in mortal danger and the threat is very real, I wouldn't put them in it.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nI think the damage to your kid is worse, like the guilt that I put on the kid. I don't know. It's a really interesting thing that it draws you into. I've read that you step into and out of character really fast, and I was noticing that, watching you in this role and then LBJ, especially. And I saw you on Broadway in Network, and you were wonderful. Can you talk about how you step in and out of your character? Because a lot of your characters turn dark rather fast and then out of it, into charm.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nI am attracted to characters that are somewhat damaged, I suppose. Those are the most interesting, dramatic characters that I see, as long as you get a sense that they have some level of humanity. Otherwise, they're unrelatable. You could play a really dastardly character, a vicious killer, but you still need to find threads of humanity to where the audience understands or believes that part of you. That makes it more devastating, to me, about a human being gone wrong.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nYou describe vulnerability as a power, like holding a grenade. And you also talked about crying on stage in Daytona when you were in your 20s. Can you tell that story?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nI was in Daytona Beach at the Daytona Playhouse. I walked in because I had some extra time. I was traveling at the time. And I was on a motorcycle, and I had to stay for the winter. So I walked in and said, do you need some help backstage — assistant stage manager or props or something? And the person said, Well, have you acted before? I said, Yeah. And he goes, OK, you're in the show. Apparently, the Kralahome in The King and I had just dropped out, and I was instantly cast as the king's right-hand man. And I had body paint on me every day, and I had this purple eye shadow that stretched the eyes, very politically incorrect. So a friend of mine said, you could put a little thin layer of Vaseline on your eyelids before the makeup, and then the makeup comes off easy. Otherwise, you're left with a pink tint, and you're walking around town all day with pink eyeshadow. And so I said, oh, OK. So I put a layer of Vaseline on, but I didn't know how much. Apparently, I put on too much. So near the end of the play, just as the king is dying — spoiler alert for anybody who didn't see King and I — just as the king is dying and the Kralahome, my character, is hunched over him and distraught about his king dying, I couldn't help it anymore. The Vaseline has melted so much, to a degree it got into my eyes and created a faucet of tears. Tears are pouring down my face. I could hear the audience going, oh.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nActing, acting.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nAbsolutely. It was unbelievable. And I remember how irritated my eyes were. But yet, it was a physical manifestation of the irritation. So that was that. But it also taught me, like, wow, at the right time, if that can happen, how dramatically appealing it can be.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nWhat's the power you have when you are playing a role? How do you think about that?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nWhat I realized early on, when you're in school and someone humiliates themselves or trips and falls or is embarrassed publicly, your age doesn't permit you to be mature enough to really embrace that person. Instead, you want to distance yourself and laugh and like, oh, I'm glad I'm not that idiot who just fell down or whatever. But once people mature — and I think that's college and above — and you see someone in a vulnerable situation or embarrassed or humiliated, the great thing about human beings is that they don't feel they want to point the finger. They don't want to separate. What they feel is they want to embrace that person. They want to protect that person. And it's a really lovely human trait. Well, if you can understand that and put that layer of vulnerability in your characters, that will happen to an audience, viscerally, when they sense that. They will emotionally wrap their arms around the character. And so I look for those opportunities to develop sympathies from the audience by way of vulnerability.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nSo they lean in?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nYeah, they lean into it, as opposed to distance themselves.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nIs that different when you're on stage, versus in a TV series?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nYou approach the character the same way, as far as developmental qualities. You have to be insatiably curious and enjoy the research. You have to have talent to be able to bring it out. You have to use your imagination to string together any elements of a character that you have not had personal experience with. And the last part, the fourth part, is that you must be willing and able to open up the cavity of your own emotions to pull out what is appropriate, and that is to make yourself look good, bad. It's rage. It's public or physical vulnerability. Like in Breaking Bad, I wanted the character to be soft and pudgy and overweight, so I wanted the love handles to spill out over my underwear. I wanted that. I needed the audience to feel sorry for this guy, that he's gone to seed, that he's lost his desire and his hope and his drive. And that's the whole point of the story is that he gets that back once he makes his decision to do his evil deeds. So he transforms his body and his look and his attitude and his ability to intimidate and his level of confidence, and all those things completely change.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nRight, soft to heart.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nYeah, so that was by design. As far as working on stage compared to film, the work itself is very different. In a play, you go through a beginning, middle, and end every single performance. Whereas in film and television, you do bits and pieces. You might have a day where it's emotional, and then the next seven days, it's not. So it's much more tiring for me to do a play on a long run than it is to do film. You have moments when you can shut down and relax and rest.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nSo do you have trouble turning it off? I don't mean going home and doing an LBJ accent. But you ever catch yourself acting the role of Bryan Cranston with your family or friends?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nI suppose you do it, only if you're really troubled, if you're having difficulty getting a character to move into you and your soul and your being. That's a hard way to describe it. But basically, for an actor, when you start developing a character, it's outside of yourself. And the more research, the more thought, the more attention you put on that, the more you start to understand how he thinks and feels. And then you're inviting that character into yourself. And then almost like through osmosis, it comes in. And from that point on, you think and feel and act based on the filter of that character. Well, if it's frustrating for you and it's not coming, it's not coming, which happens at times, yeah, I could see you going home and living with it and barking at the dog or whatever.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nYeah. What's been the most difficult character for you to do that, of the most recent ones?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nI guess the most difficult to date was LBJ. I went down to the LBJ library a couple of times and spent countless hours just trying to absorb the sense of him visually, vocally. There's copious amounts of books about him, which were all very helpful and endless. So you could just get completely absorbed, and I did. I got completely absorbed in developing the character that by the time I got to the ART in Harvard to do the out-of-town part of it, I was not prepared for the massive amount of dialogue that I was saying. I was so into developing the character that we did the table read, and I read through it, and I went, oh my god, I haven't started memorizing any of this. And I was panicked. I was really panicked that I wouldn't get it.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nYou have a stack ranking of how you decide what roles to take and to turn down, correct? You have a list of how you —\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nI do.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nA numerical system?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nI do. I give everything a numerical rating. So I actually transfer my emotions into a kind of mathematical equation, which helps me look at it from a more objective viewpoint. Because if you stay subjective to it and emotional to it, it's hard to make a decision because you might be swayed by the emotions.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nRight, right. So you have numbers?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nI do.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nLike, 1 to 10?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nNo, I give a numerical value to — Number one is the story. I give it from one to five on the value of just the story. Did it move me? Was it important? Did it resonate? Did it stay with me? From there, I go to the written word, which I separate from the story. Because you can have a great story, and you read it, and it's like, oh, I don't think the writer really got it. So I have to give that a separate rating. And the third thing is the character because I truly believe that it's the story and the power of the written word first that inspires a character. And I say this with all great respect to Meryl. I say, if you gave Meryl Streep C-level material, she could get it to a B. Her ability is unbelievable.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nI saw her in Prom, and I'm like, she's still fantastic, and this is very light.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nLet me ask you, then, so I can get it with a big role. So LBJ, all the others, this recent one and Your Honor and Breaking Bad, those are all top numbers, I'm assuming. But I want you to explain how you scored these roles, if you don't mind, if you'll indulge me — Rear Admiral Lyle Haggerty in Contagion, ramrod straight — by the way, prescient.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nYeah, very prescient. The story was very good. Scott Burns wrote a really terrific script, so that got high marks. The character itself wasn't as high a mark for me. But then the fourth category, the director, was very high, Steven Soderbergh. So all of a sudden, the collective, cumulative score was very high.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nAll right, I'm going to give you the harder one, Ned in Why Him? And I saw Why Him?. I don't why I watch all of James Franco's movies, but I do. I cannot explain it to you.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nThis was an interesting one. It didn't make the cut. It didn't make it. I turned it down twice.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nThis is a father whose daughter marries a billionaire.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nI only watched it because I deal with billionaires all the time covering tech, and I know that billionaire, those wacky billionaires.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nSo you have a situation where the premise of the story is that a father doesn't like his daughter's boyfriend, and that's it. It's so thin.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nFather of the Bride, whatever.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nYeah, it was too thin. And I thought, well, this is not right. But I knew that I needed to do and wanted to do a comedy. I was doing drama after drama after drama. And my whole structure of my approach to the career, long term, is to keep twisting and turning — do comedy, do drama, do stage, do film, do adult theme, do a children's show, whatever. So I knew I needed to do comedy, and it was time to do a big studio comedy, where I'm one of the two stars. But this was just so thin. I thought, I don't know. So I actually called Paul Rudd, and I said, Paul, the premise is so thin. He goes, This is the way those comedies are. When you get on the set, they rely heavily on improvisation. You get these people together, and you start improving and improving and improving. And they cull the story out of that. And he said, I think you'll have a great time. And I can honestly say, I don't think I've had a better time on any film set than Why Him? in my career. It was hilarious.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nI'll bet. I'll bet, actually. I thought you were just going to say, I needed to buy a second home, or something.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nNo, it was about that, and I was glad I did it.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nSo you came to success relatively late. You were 43 when Malcolm in the Middle started — I really enjoyed Malcolm in the Middle — 51 when Breaking Bad came out. How is that, coming to the success at your age? You've been in tons of movies and a character actor before that, but how do you look at the trajectory of your career?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nI was a working actor since the time I was 25. I made a living as my career. That's the professional achievement I'm most proud of is that I crossed a threshold — somehow, some way — when I got a job in New York City, moved from LA to New York to be on a soap opera for two years.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nWas it Loving?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nYeah. I don't know why, but it just made me feel that, oh, I could do this, and I belong. And anything beyond making a living, to me, was gravy. I still feel that way.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nWere you a bad guy and then became a good guy or good guy who became a bad guy, or what was your character?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nNo, in soap operas, they pretty much were white hat, black hat.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nYes, they are, but they sometimes shift when their twin shows up or their —\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nOh, that but that's another person. That's another person. A twin, the evil twin — it has to be another person.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nSo were you good or bad? Were you good? I didn't watch Loving, I'll be honest with you.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nOf course, good. Yeah.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nYou were the good, and you stayed good. Never amnesia or brain surgery that caused you to —\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nIn fact, I had to fight it a little bit. One scene where Patricia Kalember, who played my girlfriend, was cheating on me.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nOh, that's a shock.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nYes, terrible. And I visited my mom, and she was saying, Do you want some coffee? I go, No. You sure you don't want coffee? I said, No. You know, I snapped at her. And they stopped the tape, and they said, no, no, no, you shouldn't do that. You're good. You're nice. I go, yeah, but he just broke up. Snapping at someone you love is real and honest.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nOh, no, no.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nIt was tough to fight those battles.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nYou moved into a color when they want black and white in that situation.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nYeah.

You'll be able to catch up on Sway episodes you may have missed, like my conversation with actor and director Marielle Heller, and you'll get new ones delivered directly to you. More with Bryan Cranston after this break. [MUSIC PLAYING] Cranston grew up in a show-biz family. His mother quit radio acting to raise him and his siblings. His father had small parts on lots of TV shows but never quite made it. So did your father's trajectory influence your career?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nMy father's dubious acting career did influence, to the point where I wasn't going to be an actor. I was going to be a police officer, going into college. But it was an acting class in college that changed my mind back to acting because I felt I had an ability. But I think because of my father's struggles as a professional actor, I didn't set my sights on being a star. My dad needed to be a star, and anything less than that was failure. And so he experienced failure.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nWell, thinking of this, you once said Walter White was going to be the first line in your obituary, and I think you're probably right — maybe not, who knows yet. Do you worry about that all? Because you've gone on to do other things, obviously.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nNo, no. I'm not a worrier by nature, so I don't focus on any of that. It's just a reality. I'm very proud of Breaking Bad, of course, and it changed the trajectory of my career. And so I'm exceedingly happy that I did it. And what a great series. No, if that is the pinnacle of my career, as far as what the critics and the audiences know, then I'm perfectly happy with it.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nWhat would you think the greatest strength of Walter White is? Because I'd love to go through some of your recent characters like that.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nI think his power was determination. He's faced with the idea of his demise within two years. He has a son with special needs. He as a child on the way and a wife, and he has no means of supporting them. When he's on his way out, his body will diminish. His wife will have to wipe his drool and empty his bedpan. His children will only know him as that skinny, sickly man in the other bedroom, and then he's gone. And that's just not what he wants. So his determination to change the text of his life was what drove him. And then what he discovers, purely accidentally, is that he's really good at it, and his ego came in and took control. You played the clip where he says, Say my name — and you're goddamn right. He's now fully embraced with that new persona. It was dormant within him, apparently, and that had awakened.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nIt's an interesting dichotomy because I want to talk about Lyndon Johnson, then, in All The Way because he was blocked everywhere he went. It was different groups pulling at him at all sides. So what was your approach to figuring out his power?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nWell, he had tremendous goals and ambition to do right, to do good, to leave a legacy. Conversely, he also suffered from deep depression and tremendous insecurities, and so he would swing widely — all the way up, We're going to do this, nothing can be stopped to I can't do this, I'm going to go home. And his Lady Bird was absolutely essential to his success. Without her, I do not believe he would have been as prolific in his work and accomplishments as he was.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nI found him to be a very sympathetic character, which I did not expect. I think that's the part I was surprised by because he's such a cartoon character of kind of a bully, but he really isn't, in a lot of ways.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nBut remember, the sympathetic part is that he has this tremendous ambition to do good, to be a righteous man, and remember what you talked about, his deep insecurities. Well, doesn't bullying come from insecurity, really? So that's where that stems from, his fear of failing and oh my god, I'm going to be known as the worst president. It drives him to force his will upon people and give him what was called the Johnson treatment.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nNow, Howard Beale is very different. I saw you in Network. I loved it. I was not sitting on the stage. My mother was sitting on the stage for one of the performances — she loved. He's a newscaster who famously said, I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore. It was a very famous movie. He threatens to kill himself on live TV. Tell me about Howard Beale's relationship to power because he's powerless at the beginning of the show, really. I mean, he's been this newscaster, in a traditional sense, and has to shift.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nI think we all make compromises. Certainly, in journalism, social graces force you to adjust. You're at a holiday dinner table, and what you feel is the direct opposite of what this person's saying. Do you open your mouth? Well, maybe. Sometimes restraint is the better part of valor, and you pick and choose when to fight your battles. Howard Beale has been toeing the line for a long, long time. And it got to a point where it became intolerable, and he had a breaking point and then realized, I just don't care anymore. And he decides, to hell with it, I'm going to say exactly what I feel when I feel it. When I think it, I'll say it with no filter. And it has a resonance to Donald Trump's reign in some ways. And in other ways, Howard Beale had a lot more content.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nTell me about the resonance because there's a lot of prescience in that play, too, of where we are today, where cable has gone and where news has gone. Explain what you meant by close to Donald Trump and yet not.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nDonald Trump tapped into that. He did tap into that. Some people felt it was the right thing to do, to say, and they followed him by the millions, as we find out. However, when you look at it and assess it — and I think history will be accurate in this — they will realize that there was emptiness to Donald Trump's words. There was impulse to it but not strategy. There was hyperbole without wisdom. And I think that's what will be his legacy. Whereas Howard Beale spewed emotional frustration and intellectual thought and then let the chips fall where they may, and I think that's the difference.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nWould you like to play Donald Trump?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nI mean, as of right now, no. He's too much in the public eye. Every single talk show host does an impersonation of him. He is ubiquitous to the point of overkill, and that's not good for an actor to take on a character that's so indelible. I was once offered to do the Scarecrow, a play version of The Wizard of Oz. And I thought, oh my gosh, that'll be exciting. How fun will that be? Until I thought about it and realized, wait a second, that character is so specific and indelible in the minds of everyone who's ever watched Wizard of Oz. If I didn't do an impersonation of Ray Bolger doing the Scarecrow, I'd be booed because people would go, oh, that's not the Scarecrow. So it didn't leave any room for the actor to carve out my impression or my sensibility of where the Scarecrow could be. You had to stand in line and march exactly to the drumbeat of what that movie role did. So then I realized, oh, no, that's a trap. I don't want to do that role. And I think the same thing is right now for Trump until 10 years from now. If you ask me that five to 10 years from now, hopefully when he's no longer in the public eye —\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nThen is there any other public figure you'd like to play?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nI'm not sure. There are certain goals that I have. I want to do a Broadway musical. I want to do a one-man show at some point. But it has to be the right character, the right story for me to get excited about doing that and putting that work in.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nA musical? You're going Hugh Jackman on us here? What do you want to do? What musical would you like to do?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nI can assure you that Bryan Cranston will never be a Hugh Jackman. He's phenomenal. No, because I don't consider myself a singer. I'm not trained in that area. But I think I've been a moth to the flame on a lot of the things that I've done in my career. Anything that kind of scares me, I'm attracted to. And being on stage and singing is a fearful position to be in.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nThe Scarecrow role still is there, you know. You could redefine it. We've forgotten about Ray Bolger.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\n(SINGING) I would while away the hours, conversing with the flowers, consulting with the rain.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nOh wait, you can sing. What are you talking about?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\n[WHISTLING] Oh, in the comfort of my own home. It's like a shower singer, you know.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nYeah, all right. Tell me how Broadway is going to come out of the pandemic, if you're talking about a musical. It's closed down. And how will it be different?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nWell, the one thing I know for sure is that human beings love being told a story. And whether you're two or 102, you want to be told a story. You want to be taken away.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nDo you think there'll be fewer theaters? Obviously, the economics have been hit incredibly hard. Would it be a different experience?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nWell, I don't know if the experience will be different. I think writers would then write with the knowledge of COVID and what that's done to us in current times. Actors have to feel comfortable in that intimacy on stage. And maybe even more importantly is that audiences need to feel comfortable in sitting shoulder to shoulder again with strangers and 1,000 people in an auditorium and watch stories.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nI have a feeling people will forget that and then be right back there after a while, once everyone's vaccinated and the pandemic has ended or is close to ending.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nWell, I hope so.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nI'm curious if producers be less willing to take chances on risky plays. That's where I see the thing. And a friend of mine just told me they thought that there'd be more frivolity and sort of vapid fluff because playing it safe and fun. After this era of both Trump and the pandemic and all this partisanship, they might play it safe with revivals and shows based on pop music and lighter fare.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nThat's probably a good assessment. I think that's probably right. And then, as you said, people will forget, and they'll come back in. And then they will demand more weighty storytelling.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nYeah, I think that might happen. We might see a lot of La Cage aux Folles or something like that. But you would be good in that. You would be very good, if you want to sing and dance.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nI'm right at the age for a revival of La Cage.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nLa Cage, you would be good.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nI loved that play. It was a great play.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nHow do you see TV changing in the next decade? And what are you worried about, and what are you looking forward to?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nI'm a little worried that there's going to be too much content. And by having too much content, the bar of high-end storytelling will be dropped because they need more product on these platforms. Yeah, they'll just say, that's good. Bring it in. We need it, we need it, we need it. Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on. On the other side, that kind of thirst for product gives unproven writers or new writers a chance to shine. And there will be exceptional writers that will come out of that. And like my experience on a soap opera, they will say, well, I'm doing this kid's series on Disney+. And it's not tremendously challenging, but man, it started my career. I think what you'll see is the further erosion of broadcast television and the platform scenario, that when you turn on a television, it'll all be just platform. It'll be like, you have to go to Warner Media. And then you go, oh, let's go to HBO.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nRight. How do you look at the controversy right now? I just interviewed Jason Kilar. It caused quite a stir. What are messages you're getting from your agents?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nYou know, just being in touch with it and having my own television production company for seven years now and realizing that it's shifting and adjusting. And the business will always shift and adjust. I hope that we don't see the end of movie theaters. They're on life support right now, understandably, and I don't want that to go away. I don't want it to only be the big superhero movies are in the theaters and everything else is on your home screens. That experience of witnessing a story being told in a cinematic way and you're in a room with a bunch of strangers is really rewarding, and I hope that comes back in the movie theaters and on Broadway.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nI take sort of an opposite side because I think it's a little romantic on Hollywood executives' part because they make more money doing that, also. And it's also sort of a faint because most consumers really do like watching limited series. They like binging. They like their home things. Consumers seem to be saying a different thing. If anything this technology has taught us is they will get what they want when they want it and where they want it. Is that a problem for you, from a creative point of view?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nNo, I don't think so. If you look at what's happened, the reason that home viewing has exploded, not just because of COVID —\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nNo, it was before that.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\n— exacerbated because of COVID —\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nAccelerated.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nYeah, there you go. You have the technology caught up. The screens are phenomenally clear and beautiful. They're much cheaper. And the sound in the scale of it — you're watching from your living room — it's almost the same scale as if you were in the theater.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nWould it offend you to know I watched the LBJ — though I had seen it on stage — on my iPhone in bed, the whole thing.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nOuch.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nIt was fantastic.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nOuch.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nWhy ouch? Bryan, come on, why?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nBecause you are then hyper-focusing on a very small screen.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nYou were up in my grill. I loved it, the whole thing in the dark. It was fantastic.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nYou millennials, I tell you, you are so —\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nI'm not a millennial. I'm older than you. I think I might be older than you, or very close. I am no millennial. I'm millennial thinking is what I am.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nThat's what you are.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nThat's what I am. I had a very profound experience watching it. It was mostly because everyone was asleep, and I didn't want to make noise. I watched your other one on the big screen in my home, which was great, and with a great sound system.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nOK, well, good.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nBut do you think it's going to affect Hollywood itself? Because these streamers are where things are going.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nWell, it already has. Everything is going to go streaming. The studios know that. The networks know that.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nDoes that affect your income, this idea of Netflix started it by paying people up front and then moving on?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nPersonally, I don't really focus on making money. I have more money than I ever thought I would have. It's certainly not what motivates me to work. But I don't want to sound flippant because money is important, and it's great. I have been very, very poor in my life, and it's not as good as being wealthy.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nYeah, yeah, true, fair.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nSo I have agents and lawyers who look out for that. They're incentivized to do well by me, and that's great. But I certainly don't make my decisions based on financial considerations.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nBut in Hollywood in general, everything will have to be renegotiated, every single contract?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nYeah, when you're talking about box-office bonuses and what's reported. Yeah, that's all shifted now. So now, negotiations, going into that, would have to be an exceptional upfront money or some other matrix, some other way of —\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nSubscription matrix.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nI guess, yeah, something. But the platforms don't want to reveal those numbers.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nNo, and sometimes they have other motivations Amazon is to get Prime bigger. Google is not yet into this, but Apple wants to sell more phones.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nWell, and speaking directly, I was told that subscriptions for Showtime has really risen a lot because of Your Honor.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nShould you get a vig?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nA little vig, a little taste?\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nYeah, a little taste.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nA little slice? Come on. No, I'm happy for that, and I know Showtime is happy for that.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nYou need a vig, just so you know. You need a vig. I will give you a word, rundle. Do you know that?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nA runde?\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nA recurring revenue bundle. You're part of a recurring revenue bundle, which is a rundle. It also sounds like an Amish practice before marriage, but it's not.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nThat's like a cleaned-up version of West Side Story. Let's get into a rundle.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nOh, you could be on that.\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\n[WHISTLING]\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nNice, nice. You're good with the whistles. All right, last question, then. You articulate a lot of characters who are middle aged, unhappy. Like you talked about, you represent people who have been frustrated, which is happening in this country, which is an interesting juxtaposition. Do you have any advice to them?\\n\\nbryan cranston\\n\\nKeep moving. Be kind. My mother-in-law said that to us once, and I thought, that's a great aspect of life. Keep moving and be kind. That kind of says it all.\\n\\nkara swisher\\n\\nAll right, perfect. That's a perfect way to end. Mr, Cranston, thank you so much for doing this. It was a really fascinating conversation.\\n\\nbryan cranston"}

Bruning\\n\\nI'm amazed that Eddie Rickenbacker and Charles Lindbergh, who appear in Race of Aces, are stalwarts of my own aviation-heavy cultural literacy — yet the flying ace Dick Bong, the all-American hero at its heart, is new to me, and I suspect he will be to other readers, too. In his new book, John R. Bruning corrects this oversight. Whether he's putting you in the middle of an intense air battle in searing heat and mosquito clouds, or taking you to watch a young aviator gamely repeat his marriage vows four times in a single day to accommodate the hungry media and an adoring public, Bruning celebrates a handful of larger-than-life World War II fighter pilots and brings them to our attention once again.\\n\\nThe plot of Bruning's epic is straightforward. In 1942, Gen. George Kenney, the newly minted commander of the Fifth Air Force in New Guinea, found himself stuck with possibly the worst command position of the war. At the end of a long supply chain, plagued by weird tropical bugs and diseases, his fighter pilots were taking a beating from the airborne Japanese. A visit from the famous World War I ace Eddie Rickenbacker gave Kenney the inspiration he needed to raise morale: He challenged his young aviators to beat Rickenbacker's record of shooting down 26 enemy aircraft. Rickenbacker and Kenney each agreed to stand the winning pilot a case of Scotch, and the race was on."}

Elite hospitals have vaccinated workers who were supposed to wait. This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nChicago classrooms are reopening Monday, but will most teachers show up? A playground at an elementary school in Chicago, where schools reopen Monday. Credit... Taylor Glascock for The New York Times Across the country, many big cities like New York have struggled to resume even limited in-person instruction, while a number, including Los Angeles, have simply given up on the idea, choosing to stick with all-remote education into the spring. Few places have seen as much acrimony over the issue as Chicago, whose public school system is the nation's third-largest. Now, with 6,000 prekindergarten and special education students preparing to return to the city's public school buildings on Monday for the first time since March, a question looms: How many of their teachers will be there to greet them? Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago has argued that giving parents the option of sending their children to school in person is critical to preventing some of the city's mostly poor and Black and Latino students from falling permanently behind. But the teachers' union has fiercely resisted the plan, arguing that schools are not safe while the coronavirus is surging. Over the past week, fewer than 60 percent of the roughly 2,000 teachers who were expected to return to their buildings to prepare for the arrival of students actually showed up. Janice K. Jackson, the chief executive of the school system that serves about 350,000 students, said on Friday that she was optimistic that most teachers would go to work on Monday. She warned that any who stayed home without permission would not be paid, raising the prospect of a heightened clash with the union, which has suggested it may strike if teachers are not permitted to stay home if they want to. This is probably the most contentious and unpleasant reopening, in terms of how the different sides are interacting with each other, said Emily Oster, an economics professor at Brown University who has collected data on coronavirus cases in schools and has argued that reopening schools is safe under many circumstances. Interviews with parents and officials in Chicago indicate that many families are torn between concerns that their children are losing out educationally and fears that they will bring the virus home. Katrina Adams, who lives on the South Side, said she wanted to send her oldest daughter, who is in the fourth grade, back to school, but said she didn't think the district was ready to open. Ms. Adams said her views had not been influenced by the teachers' union, but she acknowledged feeling unsettled by many teachers' concerns about in-school transmission of the coronavirus. If they don't feel safe coming back, most definitely that's an alert, to a parent or anyone, she said.\\n\\nLawmakers may have been exposed to the coronavirus while sheltering during the Capitol riot, a doctor says. Members of the House of Representatives leaving the floor on Wednesday. Credit... J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press While sheltering in a secure location as a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday, House lawmakers may have been exposed to someone who was infected with the coronavirus, Congress's Office of the Attending Physician said on Sunday. In an email sent to lawmakers, Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician, said that while the time in this room was several hours for some and briefer for others, during that period, individuals may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infection. He told lawmakers to obtain a P.C.R. test as a precaution and continue taking preventive steps against the spread of the virus. Congress has long struggled to stem the spread of the virus within its ranks, with mixed guidance and a delayed testing regimen. Dozens of lawmakers, staff members and reporters took shelter in the secure room on Wednesday, but a handful of Republicans refused to wear masks, one person there said, even as Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester, Democrat of Delaware, tried to pass out masks. Before the mob breached the Capitol, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, overseeing the certification of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory and debate over a Republican effort to subvert those results in certain states, admonished Republicans for having too many people on the floor and for some objectors refusing to wear masks as they spoke. As the 117th Congress reconvened a week ago, multiple lawmakers tested positive for the coronavirus after taking their oath. Late Wednesday, one Republican, Representative Jake LaTurner of Kansas, received positive test results after voting on the House floor to overturn Arizona's results and did not return for a second vote early Thursday. It was unclear where Mr. LaTurner was sheltering in place as the mob tried to break into the House chamber, but in a statement issued shortly before 3 a.m. on Thursday, his office said he was not experiencing symptoms. Because lawmakers qualified for early access to the coronavirus vaccine, many have received at least one shot of a two-dose vaccine, with some receiving both doses. Some congressional aides have been authorized to receive the two-dose vaccine.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nThe U.S. vaccine rollout needs to 'hit the reset,' an ex-F.D.A. chief says. Health workers prepared doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for mass inoculations at the Arizona State Fairgrounds in Phoenix this month. Credit... Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times Warning that vaccines are the only backstop the country has against fast-spreading new variants of the coronavirus, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said Sunday that federal and state leaders need to hit the reset and adopt a new strategy to get far more shots into arms as soon as possible. Speaking on Face the Nation on CBS News, Dr. Gottlieb said the 40 million doses currently available could go a long way toward protecting the nation's 50 million residents who are 65 and older in particular. I think we need to take an all-of-the-above approach and push it out through different channels, Dr. Gottlieb said, including the big-box stores, including federal sites that the Biden administration is talking about standing up. We need to try everything right now to create multiple distribution points. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 22.1 million doses had been sent to states as of Friday but only about 6.7 million people had received the first of two necessary doses. That data lags the most recent allocations by at least a few days. The vaccination rate picked up considerably last week, after the holiday period ended, and a number of governors announced plans to allow a broader swath of citizens to get shots. But states that expand the availability of the inoculations — announcing that people over 70, for example, can now get the vaccine — are finding demand so intense that online registration portals quickly overload and crash, call lines get flooded and available supply is exhausted in a matter of hours. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced Friday that he would release almost all available vaccine immediately after taking office on Jan. 20, rather than conserving half of it to ensure everyone who gets a first dose will also get a second a few weeks later. Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican, said on Sunday that whether doses should be conserved was a really interesting debate, because of concerns over whether production can be stepped up to get second shots to people in time. I just want to make sure we get as many out as fast as possible, without endangering people with regard to the second dose, he said on CNN's State of the Union. The Biden team is to announce this week a plan for ramping up the vaccination rate, including setting up vaccination sites run by the federal government in places like sports stadiums and high school gymnasiums. But Dr. Gottlieb said pharmacies, too, needed to quickly start offering the vaccine to their customers. Federal officials said last week that they would accelerate the start of a program in which some 40,000 pharmacy locations will give vaccines to people in high-risk groups, such as the elderly and frontline workers. Only a few thousand will be involved at the start, though. A lot of senior citizens aren't going to want to go to a stadium to get an inoculation, Dr. Gottlieb said. They're going to want to go to a local pharmacy or doctor's office. So we need to provide more opportunity for people to get vaccinated where they're comfortable getting it.\\n\\nElite hospitals have vaccinated workers who were supposed to wait. Frontline workers waited in line to receive the Covid-19 vaccine at a hospital in Arlington, Va., last month. Credit... Michael A. McCoy for The New York Times At leading research hospitals in the United States, administrators and young graduate students have been inoculated with some of the earliest supplies of coronavirus vaccines, in a contradiction of federal and state guidelines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued recommendations intended to ensure that the nation's vaccines first reach those at highest risk: health care workers who interact with Covid-19 patients, and residents and staff members at nursing homes, followed by people 75 and older and certain essential workers. Each state has established its own version of the guidelines, but with the rollout proceeding at a glacial pace, pressure has been growing for a more flexible approach. Officials at the C.D.C. and the Food and Drug Administration have recently suggested that it might be wiser to simply loosen the criteria and distribute the vaccine as widely as possible. But a handful of the nation's most prestigious academic hospitals have already taken the notion much further. A 20-something who works on computers. A young researcher who studies cancer. Technicians in basic research labs. These are some of the thousands of people who have been immunized against the coronavirus at hospitals affiliated with Columbia University, New York University, Harvard and Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, even as millions of frontline workers and older Americans are waiting their turns. Some of the institutions were among the first recipients of the limited supplies in the United States. The C.D.C. never intended to include workers who don't interact with patients, like administrators and graduate students, in the first tier of priority vaccinations, said Dr. Stanley Perlman, an immunologist at the University of Iowa and a member of the committee that issued the recommendations. This all got so confusing, he said. In retrospect, I think it probably needed to be a little more exact on what we were thinking, because we were never thinking about hospital administrators.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nA coronavirus infection at an air traffic control center near Washington causes delays. The Washington Air Traffic Control Center in Leesburg, Va., in 2001. Credit... Paul Hosefros/The New York Times Delays were reported at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport after an air traffic control center that serves the area reported a coronavirus infection and closed for cleaning on Sunday, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center, located in Leesburg, Va., was closed from 11:45 a.m. to 1:45 p.m. for cleaning. It is one of 20 such centers in the United States, which generally provide service to aircraft while they are en route, as opposed to airport control towers, which handle takeoffs and landings. While the center was closed, the controllers worked from an alternate location, the F.A.A. said, and airplanes were routed around the airspace or handled by underlying facilities. Reagan airport attributed delays of more than 45 minutes to the Washington Center's closure but no others in the region did. The delays appear to have been resolved by midafternoon. There have been at least 13 prior reported cases at the center, according to the F.A.A. It was not immediately clear if any of those had resulted in closures of the facility. Other air route traffic control centers have similarly closed for cleaning after infections were discovered over the past few months, resulting in widespread delays. In December, the one in Memphis was closed for cleaning after an employee tested positive, resulting in slight delays. In early January, the one serving Jacksonville was closed for a few hours, causing delays and flight cancellations. Last month, the center that serves the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport closed for several hours after an employee tested positive. The F.A.A. declared a ground stop, halting all departing flights. The closure caused ripples of delays and diverted flights across the country.\\n\\nIn Florida's vaccine free-for-all, one state site is closing Monday for a football game. Frontline health care workers and people 65 and older waited in line outside the East County Regional Library in Lehigh Acres, Fla., last month. Credit... Octavio Jones for The New York Times The state of Florida's coronavirus testing and vaccination site at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens — the recent scene of long lines of people awaiting vaccination — will be shut down for much of Monday to make way for the College Football Playoff national championship game. No testing will be done on Monday, and vaccinations will end at noon, the Florida Division of Emergency Management announced on Sunday. The pandemic is in an alarming new upward spiral in Florida, with nearly 20,000 new cases of the virus reported there on Friday and more than 15,000 on Saturday. But the state's well-intended effort to throw open the doors of the vaccine program to everyone 65 and older has led to long lines, confusion and disappointment. The temporary closure of the Hard Rock Stadium site to accommodate a football game seemed likely to complicate things further for Miamians. Experts say Florida is an example of what happens when officials attempt to distribute a vaccine that is still in very limited supply to a broad spectrum of the population. In a state with about 4.4 million people 65 and older, more than 402,000 doses had been administered as of Friday, according to federal data, the fourth-highest total in the nation. But Florida has used only about 30 percent of the vaccine doses it has received, a smaller proportion than 29 other states. How do you do something this huge and roll it out? said Dr. Leslie M. Beitsch, the chairman of the behavioral sciences and social medicine department at Florida State University. It's not in any way surprising — to anyone who followed it closely, for sure — that there would be halting kind of progress and missteps getting something of this magnitude underway initially, whether we're talking about Florida or the entire country. With states and counties left by the federal government to sort out logistics largely by themselves, the rollout has gone anything but smoothly. In Florida, images of seniors camped on sidewalks overnight in Fort Myers and Daytona Beach for first-come, first-served vaccines drew national attention. Health department offices that tried to offer scheduled appointments saw their phone systems and websites crash; at least one now accepts requests only by mail. Each of our 67 counties seems to be taking a slightly different pathway — and that's remarkable, because we have a single department of health that is supposed to cover the entire state, Dr. Beitsch said.

For example, visitors are invited to lay a virtual chrysanthemum at a wall of martyrs that includes Li Wenliang, the ophthalmologist at a Wuhan hospital whose death from the virus led to nationwide mourning. But missing from his brief biography is a crucial fact: that Dr. Li was reprimanded by the government for warning colleagues about the virus. China has spent much of the past year trying to spin a narrative of the coronavirus pandemic as an undisputed victory led by the ruling Communist Party. As life in the city, and most of the country, has returned to normal, the state-run news media has largely ignored the government's missteps. Instead, the media cites China's response as proof of the superiority of the country's authoritarian system, especially compared with that of the United States and other democracies, which are still struggling to contain raging outbreaks And now, as the Jan. 23 anniversary of Wuhan's lockdown nears, the government has deployed an army of censors to scrub the internet of critical coverage of the Wuhan outbreak. A recent propaganda directive explicitly banned coverage of the anniversary of the outbreak, according to journalists at state-run news outlets who were briefed on the order. Instead, propaganda agencies have pushed feel-good videos and adulatory articles that depict Wuhan as a city reborn. The government underscored its message to the media last month when it sentenced Zhang Zhan, a 37-year-old citizen journalist who documented Wuhan's ordeal, to four years in prison. She is the first person known to have faced trial for chronicling China's outbreak.

You've got to worry — is there a breaking point? said the director for emergency services in one Georgia county. Credit... Dustin Chambers for The New York Times As the coronavirus has surged through the winter, some ambulance crews have struggled to keep pace with the number of patients requiring emergency care, and staffing and bed shortages at hospitals have led to hours of waiting to unload patients. Ambulance crews have been transporting the relentless tide of Covid-19 patients as the post-holiday surge accelerated: The United States reported 300,594 new cases on Friday and more than 4,100 deaths on Thursday, both single-day records. Hospitalizations remained at near-record levels, with 130,777 patients on Saturday, according to the Covid Tracking Project, while the nation's vaccine rollout is off to a slow start. In the Augusta, Ga., area, all three major hospitals were out of beds last week, said Steven Vincent, the vice president of Gold Cross EMS in Augusta. Waiting until a bed is available can sometimes take hours, he said, so ambulance crews have often opt to continue driving to other hospitals or trauma centers many miles away. Some hospitals have erected medical tents outside so that emergency medical service crews can split up, one member waiting with the patient and while the ambulance leaves to answer another call. Right now, our hospitals are completely full, Mr. Vincent said. We're trying to get creative, because it is rough right now. The intensity has taken an emotional and physical toll on the emergency medical workers, he said. They are stressed, they are overworked. It's been a struggle, no doubt about it. In Habersham County, in the state's northeast, the average number of calls per day for emergency medical service crews has been far higher than usual, said Chad Black, the director for emergency services for the county and the board chairman of the Georgia E.M.S. Association. About every other call is related to Covid, he said, and ambulances have had to wait upward of two hours to unload patients. The county has had staffing problems for years, he said, a complication aggravated when employees contract the virus and must isolate. Some days, ambulances are at 50 percent staffing, Mr. Black said. They know when they come in, in the morning, that there's a great chance they're going to be up for 24 straight hours, Mr. Black said about the ambulance workers. You've got to worry — is there a breaking point? And in the Atlanta area, Mr. Black said, emergency crews are often hospital shopping — calling multiple facilities in the metro area and driving around until one agrees to admit their patient. In Arizona, which has a higher rate of new cases per capita than any other state, according to a New York Times database, E.M.S. workers worry about being exposed to the virus, then bringing it home to their families and getting severe symptoms, said Brian Moore, the central region director of the Arizona Ambulance Association. This whole thing has put a lot of fear in folks who are on the front lines, Mr. Moore said. Emergency medical service dilemmas are particularly acute in Los Angeles County, where understaffed hospitals are overwhelmed and a Covid-related death happens every eight minutes. The nation's most populous county has urged ambulance crews not to take people they cannot resuscitate to hospitals. The county's memo on the matter reflected a relatively small change from its previous policy, which already discouraged emergency personnel from transporting most people whose heartbeats could not be restored. But after the memo gained widespread attention, medics felt compelled to post on social media to try to quell anxieties that they believed were unfounded. Kari Dickerson, a paramedic in Kentucky who tweets as @MedicTrommasher, said the memo had particularly alarmed people of color, who have been disproportionately harmed by the pandemic. She said she worried that her fellow workers could face wrenching situations whenever they broke the news that someone had died, perhaps causing families to wonder: Did they do this on purpose, did they not work as hard as they would have for somebody that looks like them? An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the day the United States reported its single-day record for Covid-19 deaths. It was Thursday.

Osservatore Romano, via EPA/Shutterstock Pope Francis's personal physician, Dr. Fabrizio Soccorsi, died on Saturday as a result of the coronavirus, the Vatican said. Dr. Soccorsi, 78, had been in hospitalized at the Gemelli Hospital in Rome and was being treated for cancer, but died because of complications from Covid-19, according to Vatican News, the Vatican's online news portal. Francis selected Dr. Soccorsi to be his personal physician in 2015. Dr. Soccorsi specialized in internal medicine, and served for a time as the chairman of the hepatology department at the San Camillo Hospital in Rome. He also taught immunology at the Rome and Lazio Region Medical School. The Vatican newspaper, l'Osservatore Romano, wrote in an obituary published on Saturday that Dr. Soccorsi had been profoundly affected, by the premature death of his daughter, Cristiana, in June 2017. Social distancing measures and other pandemic safety protocols were imposed in Vatican City in March. Since then, several senior church figures, including cardinals, have tested positive for the virus. In all, twenty-seven residents of Vatican City, out of a total population of roughly 800, have tested positive, according to a New York Times database. In a television interview scheduled for broadcast in Italy Sunday evening, the pope said he would be vaccinated as soon as this week, and he called on everyone to get vaccinated when possible, calling it an ethical choice to do so.\\n\\nHow the National University of Singapore has kept the coronavirus off campus. Students and staff at the National University of Singapore move within their designated zones on campus in November. Universities in Singapore have avoided coronavirus cases in part by using technology. Credit... Ore Huiying for The New York Times Every day, Tan Eng Chye, the president of the National University of Singapore, scans his online dashboard to see how crowded the cafeterias are. If the real-time map shows that one cafeteria is too packed, he has administrators send out an advisory to avoid it and to remind students that there are campus-run food delivery services, free of charge. Following the government's lead, universities in Singapore, a semi-authoritarian city-state of almost six million people, have taken a top-down approach to managing the coronavirus. The result: Since the start of the pandemic last year, not one person has been found to have contracted the virus at any of Singapore's three major universities. While Singapore's universities have benefited from a generally low caseload in its broader population, their experience and stringent measures stand in stark contrast to many campuses across the United States. A number of American universities experienced an explosion in cases almost as soon as students returned last fall. The National University of Singapore, or N.U.S., describes its strategy as containment, decongestion and contact tracing. The university has harnessed technology to enforce social distancing measures, assigned students to different zones on campus and imposed tough penalties for flouting the rules. Like some American colleges, it is testing people extensively and even sifting through sewage for traces of the virus. The goal, Professor Tan said, is to make sure there are no infections among the students, faculty and staff members at N.U.S.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nCovid-19 has deepened the challenges of adopting through the foster care system. Floyd Scott at home in The Dalles, Ore., where he lives with his adoptive family along with his siblings, Mesha and Jermain. Credit... Michael Hanson for The New York Times The last step in the long journey to adopt a child through the foster care system is the courtroom finalization. It's traditionally provided an important opportunity for loved ones to gather and pose for pictures as a judge blesses the creation of a new forever family with a smack of the gavel. But, like so many other things in the Covid-19 era, this tradition has gone virtual. We finalized our adoption over the phone, said Celeste Scott, who last May adopted her three youngest children — who were 4, 5 and 6 when they first came to live with her in the spring of 2019. It was kind of anticlimactic. Still, Scott, of The Dalles, Ore., knows she is fortunate to have finalized the adoptions at all. If she lived elsewhere in the country, she could very well still be waiting. The pandemic has created new challenges in the foster care system and worsened old ones — creating delays in placements and adoptions and forcing some older youth to exit the system amid a public health and economic crisis. The child welfare system is extremely complex and can vary widely by state, and even by county, said Celeste Bodner, executive director and founder of FosterClub, an advocacy organization for foster youth. Each of these systems is navigating the pandemic on its own, meaning the experience of a child in one county can be completely different from the one right next to it. Soon after the pandemic took hold, for instance, Florida's child welfare system began conducting the bulk of the work certifying foster parents and placing children in their homes remotely. In New York, the system ground to a halt. For a long while, the courts here were just not doing anything virtually, said Shantell Lewis, a recruiter with the Wendy's Wonderful Kids program, which focuses on finding placements for older foster youth, at a Brooklyn nonprofit called MercyFirst. Though New York has more recently allowed work to be conducted virtually, the state has a considerable backlog. Many child welfare professionals are also concerned about older youth emancipating from foster care, when local governments are no longer bound to provide financial assistance. This abrupt transition into adulthood, between 18 and 21 depending on the state, in the very best of times represents a significant challenge for roughly 20,000 young people each year. But today, those aging out of foster care are aging in to a country gripped by an ongoing pandemic and crippled economy. When a young person ages out of the system, we have in many ways already failed them, said Rita Soronen, president and chief executive of the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption. But this is even more true right now — there's nothing like a crisis to show how truly vulnerable this group of young people are as they transition to adulthood.\\n\\nThe pandemic has reshaped a heated market for sperm donations. Yael Helin, a biological analyst at the Seattle Sperm Bank, returning sperm samples to deep storage after preparing some for shipment. Credit... Grant Hindsley for The New York Times Sperm banks are running low on supplies because of an overwhelming demand for pandemic babies, so women are trying something unconventional: joining unregulated Facebook groups to find donors. People are fed up with sperm banks, said Kyle Gordy, 29, who lives in Malibu, Calif. He invests in real estate but spends most of his time donating his sperm, free (except for the cost of travel), to women. He also runs a nearly 11,000-member private Facebook group, Sperm Donation USA, which helps women connect with a roster of hundreds of approved donors. His donor sperm has sired 35 children, with five more on the way, he said. There have always been infertile straight couples in need of donor sperm, but with the legalization of gay marriage and the rise of elective single motherhood, the market has expanded over the last decade. About 20 percent of sperm bank clients are heterosexual couples, 60 percent are gay women, and 20 percent are single moms by choice, the banks said. To meet this demand, men provided sperm at a steady rate for years, some banks said. But the coronavirus changed things. Existing donors were scared to go in. New donor sign-ups stopped for months during lockdown and never really bounced back at some banks. Several banks said that they had a lot of old frozen sperm in storage, but that it could last only so long. The reason I know this at all is simple enough: I am 32 years old, partnered to a woman, stuck at home and in the market for the finest sperm I can get.\\n\\nThe allure of hooking up has not been quashed by the pandemic. A couple in Barcelona. At a time when social norms around physical touch and closeness have been altered, those looking to hook up are having to rewrite the rules. Credit... Nacho Doce/Reuters If you're in a relationship (or haven't been out much since March), it may be news to you that despite a raging pandemic, people are meeting up, cuddling, making out and having sex with new partners, often weighing their emotional and physical needs against safety concerns. Some have gone about their private lives quietly, out of fear that those in their social circles — especially established couples — would judge their choices. Others have been more conspicuous when hooking up. In November, New York sheriffs broke up an 80-person party at a sex club in Queens. That same month, a swingers' convention in New Orleans led to 41 people testing positive for the coronavirus. Going on dates has involved a mental calculus not unlike the kind applied to other social interactions in the Covid-19 era: Will I feel safe? What is the likelihood of infection? How many people could this hurt? But hookups have been viewed with particular scrutiny. Even pre-pandemic, there was a lot of stigma around sexuality and sex in general, said Dr. Oni Blackstock, the former assistant commissioner at the New York City Department of Health's Bureau of H.I.V. With the pandemic, there's another layer of expectations and judgment. It took Alison Stevenson eight months to find a pandemic friend with benefits. Along the way, she had an intense, short-lived texting relationship that ended when the man on the other end told her he was getting back together with his ex. Then came two disappointing outdoor dates, including one with a guy who made fun of her for asking him to keep his mask on. I needed a 'situationship,' said Ms. Stevenson, a 31-year-old comedian and writer in Los Angeles. A person I can rely on and trust to hang out with once a week. The effort could mean setting boundaries and conditions from the outset, like regular testing (keep in mind that tests can show false negatives, especially if the amount of the virus in the body is too small to be detected, and that whoever is taking the test could be infected while waiting for results), quarantining before meeting and sticking to a single partner. As they negotiate, people are finding that the key to dating now is what it's always been: trust. And ultimately for many single people, hooking up has been worth the increased risk of contracting the virus. Everything I enjoy doing has been taken away from me, said Emmy Nicholson, a 26-year-old publicist in Brooklyn. But there's one thing they can't take away, and that's having sex.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story"}

In 1958, in an application for a Guggenheim grant, he proposed that he illustrate Dante's Inferno in 34 drawings, one for each canto.\\n\\nHe was passed over for the grant, but he did complete the series of drawings, as the MoMA show will attest. They're among his best works, combining freely sketched passages with images from newspapers and magazines; they translate a 14th-century epic into a language of his own devising. The Inferno drawings represent, among other things, a triumph over Rauschenberg's dyslexia, signaling his love of literature. I had a book of Botticelli's wonderful illustrations of the 'Inferno,' Mr. Johns noted recently, referring to the years when he lived a flight below Rauschenberg in a loft building on Front Street.

Mr. Atlas is designing the video portion of the show, including a nine-channel installation to commemorate 9 Evenings, a series of quixotic performances that Rauschenberg spearheaded in 1966 with his engineer-friend Billy Kluver, in the hope of forming a brave new alliance between art and technology.\\n\\nBob was so out there, recalled Susan Weil, a native Manhattanite who met him in Paris as an art student at the Académie Julian in the summer after she finished high school.

{"original": "Season 3, Episode 4: 'The Hour and the Day'\\n\\nTrue Detective has fallen off the wagon.\\n\\nFor the first two episodes of Season 3, the show had been taking a conservative, back-to-basics approach to the procedural that seemed like a correction to the indulgences of the previous season, which got lost in the tangled psychology of four lead characters who were the same brand of edgy.\\n\\nThose two episodes, directed by the genre wizard Jeremy Saulnier (Green Room, Blue Ruin), evoked the poverty and fear of its small-town Arkansas backdrop, but they also did the unglamorous work of moving the story forward. Two kids were abducted. One is dead. The other is still missing. The urgency of that situation should be the engine that moves True Detective forward, even in the two later timelines, when the cold case has once more become hot.\\n\\nBut now it has run completely aground. Developments in the case are so slow-moving and diffuse that it's hard to keep track of them, and most of them are probably red herrings anyway. Dead ends are to be expected in the middle of an eight-hour whodunit, but that doesn't absolve the series's creator, Nic Pizzolatto, from the responsibility to keep plugging away. It's not just the detectives in The Hour and the Day who are losing their sense of direction — it's as if the show itself had unscrewed the cap on a bottle of Jack Daniels and gone for a swim. Maybe it will wake from its stupor and start working the case again, but for now it's passed out on the couch. And it's dreaming about the Viet Cong.\\n\\nThis week's episode was Pizzolatto's inauspicious debut as director, though the problems here are mostly with the script, which is credited to him and David Milch, the trailblazing showrunner of Deadwood and NYPD Blue. It's impossible to say how much influence Milch wielded, but many of Pizzolatto's weaknesses are on display here: grossly overwritten dialogue, a leaden understanding of domestic relationships and a tendency to brood alongside his characters."}

{"original": "BACK TALK\\n\\nStories\\n\\nBy Danielle Lazarin\\n\\n240 pp. Penguin Books. Paper, $16.\\n\\nIn an essay called On Pandering, which appeared in Tin House magazine in 2015, the novelist Claire Vaye Watkins wrote about the struggle to establish herself as a woman artist in the face of the patriarchy. It was, in part, a discussion of the way men, both well-intentioned and not, had consciously and subconsciously asserted their authority, but it was also an acknowledgment of her own complicity, her desire to pander to the male gaze. The essay was challenging, provocative and ultimately chilling in a the call is coming from inside the house sort of way. It put internalized misogyny on full display. It also became part of a larger conversation about divestment — from maleness, from whiteness, from straightness and thinness and cisgenderness — and how we might reconsider our assumptions about whose perspectives are worthy of literary treatment.\\n\\nAt the time, Watkins was accused of, among other things, a distinctly heteronormative frame of reference, of presuming that only straight women writers were capable of being ensnared in the blithely wielded cross hairs of men. But the truth is, all women writers find themselves turning the crystal tumbler of their experience against men's light. (Men, on the other hand, just get to write about the light, and are applauded for it.) And so the question remains, grows ever larger: How do writers divest themselves from the pressures of the dominant culture while also addressing the burdensome weight of that dominant culture?\\n\\nThe majority of the protagonists in Back Talk, Danielle Lazarin's debut story collection, seemingly heterosexual women and girls, are caught in this very quandary. The stories drift around and over certain characters — an American woman going to college in Paris, the members of a troubled family — some connected in a common fictional universe and others simply echoes of one another, like the characters in Lucia Berlin's short fiction. The younger women are learning, however obliquely, to line themselves up with men, to put themselves in the context of a man's world. The older women are trying to extract themselves from that world and discovering how obscenely difficult this can be.\\n\\nIn American Men in Paris I Did Not Love, the story's very structure is defined by its male characters. The narrator has forgotten how to be around other women and instead moves through a series of relationships — some sexual, some not — in which she is almost comically uninvested. These men are insufferable: They smirk, they lecture, they play jokes they think are funny, they push boundaries. They use her, to paraphrase Virginia Woolf, as a mirror, enjoying the way she distorts their reflection in pleasant ways. She silently judges them, she dodges their moves. But only rarely does a radical impulse rise up: And for once I don't care whether the professor likes me, if I'm pleasant or easy to teach, whether my work is any good. But the impulse quickly fades. I am not beautiful, but I am pretty enough, she remarks. That year, and for years after, I hold on to the pretty parts, to the appearance of being open. If only I had allowed myself to look mean in those photos."}

The title song of a 1962 album was The New Frontier, echoing President John F. Kennedy's own phrase and alluding to his inaugural address with the lyrics Let the word go forth from this day on/A new generation has been born.\\n\\nAbout the same time, the trio had an unlikely hit with the kind of material it had avoided: Mr. Seeger's antiwar song Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\\n\\nBut by then the trio was on the verge of being supplanted as the face of folk by a new generation of harder-edged singers like Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs and Joan Baez, and by hipper ones like Peter, Paul and Mary.

{"original": "Every tearoom that Sugimoto creates is formally named, and the one in this apartment is called Ukitsubo, which means floating inner garden, a reference to the 11th-century novel The Tale of Genji, which is set within the wealthy, refined Heian court. One of Sugimoto's original ideas was to create an indoor garden. But that was impossible in a tower, and so instead, he chose to place the two bonsai trees in a rectangular garden in the dining room, a 10½-foot-long slab of Komatsu stone between them. If the windows offer a lightness, a moment to pause in time and drift into infinity, then the two bonsai, whose dense, visible surface roots (nebari, which are considered a balance to the tree's sinuous branches) return you to earth.\\n\\nSugimoto also insisted on using as many premodern materials and techniques as possible. The lustrous smoky black square tiles that blanket the hallway are clay, handmade by a ceramist in Nara, near Kyoto, whose ancestors made the tiles for the centuries-old Todaiji temple. They are intended to be used on roofs, but Sugimoto prefers them for the floor because of the particular way they reflect the light. The walls are covered in soft-white Japanese shikkui plaster, which was carefully applied by trained craftsmen — though it is smooth to the touch, their strokes glint unevenly in the natural light. The kitchen cabinets are entirely covered in long metal sheets hammered by hand. Nearly all the apartment floors are clad in splendid planks of unfinished cedar (the notable exception is the master bedroom, whose floors are laid with chestnut, the wood hand-scooped to lend it a dappled effect; Sugimoto calls the sensation of walking on it a free foot massage).\\n\\nSUGIMOTO IS NOT a licensed architect, though he doesn't really care for labels. As he wrote in the chapbook he created about the apartment for his personal collection: Recently, architecture is getting closer to art while art is becoming more architectural; seldom, however, does one hear of them coming together in a beautiful or harmonious manner. Architecture's sense of inferiority to art and art's own jealousy of architecture are inextricably entangled. His first foray into architectural work was restoring the medieval Go'o Shinto Shrine on the island of Naoshima, in 1996. He subsequently opened an architecture practice in Japan under the name New Material Research Laboratory with Tomoyuki Sakakida, a trained architect. New Material has completed a number of noteworthy buildings, including the Enoura Observatory, which is part of the Odawara Art Foundation that Sugimoto founded in 2009 on the coastline of the Kanagawa Prefecture, just south of Tokyo. Enoura's cantilevered main gallery with glass walls is elegantly oriented to glimpse the sun as it rises from the east. The firm's name, however, is cheekily disingenuous; Sugimoto is fond of repurposing ancient materials. In the Manhattan apartment, the dining room floors are planks of Yakusugi — cedar from Yakushima island that is more than a thousand years old. (It is now illegal to harvest the forests of Yakushima; the wood he used had been in storage for some time.) For centuries, the wind ripped across the island, causing the growth rings of the trees to bend and swirl into mesmerizing shapes. Several of the stones placed around the house — one as a decorative end piece to a hallway, another as a step to the tearoom — are from centuries-old Japanese gardens, now vanished. Sugimoto has long admired the patina of unfinished cedar in Nara's temples, where the wood's color has transformed over time from tawny yellow to a mossy gray. After 1,200 years, beautiful, he remarked. It gets darkened. The surface is still beautiful. He pauses. But whether this building survives 100 years ... He didn't need to finish that thought. We both knew none of us would be here to find out."}

{"original": "PARK CITY, Utah — A runaway bride, wildly rambunctious women and two quietly resolute girls — the Sundance Film Festival is one movie celebration where the so-called second sex consistently comes out on top. Now in its 36th year, the festival has long made room for female filmmakers even when there weren't all that many. In 1985, its inaugural year, it presented 85 movies, 10 from female directors, about half non-Americans like Lina Wertmüller, one of the few such filmmakers on anyone's radar back then. Of this year's 128 features, nearly half are from women. (The festival ends Sunday.)\\n\\nThese numbers are impressive; the movies even more so. At some events, female filmmakers sometimes seem to have been invited simply to check a box, a practice that, however well-intentioned, inevitably suggests that women are second-class talent. This year's Sundance, by contrast, underscores that when women receive real opportunities — serious money and institutional support — the pool of work expands, bringing new stories, styles and worldviews. For the 2020 edition, you didn't need to dig to find female talent, make excuses for substandard work or politely yawn through another worthy endeavor. It was right on the screen, blissful and unbound.\\n\\nIn the case of the very different documentaries Time and Saudi Runaway, the desire to make movies isn't simply about having a say — getting the chance to pick up a camera and share your vision with the world freely — it is also a matter of life itself. Each documentary centers on an extraordinarily gutsy woman who put her everyday existence on camera, detailing her days and nights in intimate, pointillist detail much like a diarist. Each woman subsequently handed over what she had shot to a female director, who then shaped the material, turning self-expression into collective vision."}
{"original": "This interview was conducted by the editorial board of The New York Times, which will announce its Democratic primary endorsement on Jan. 19.\\n\\nFor noteworthy dialogues on...\\n\\nAndrew Yang's message is remarkably similar to Elizabeth Warren's and Bernie Sanders's — the American economy is not working for enough Americans, and it's going to require structural change to do better. Where Mr. Yang differs — beyond his almost complete lack of government or political experience — is in his prescriptions, including his signature Freedom Dividend.\\n\\nMr. Yang previously ran a successful test prep company and created the nonprofit Venture for America, which he argues is a strength, offering him fresh perspective and critical distance from the workings of Washington.\\n\\nIn an interview on Dec. 4, it was clear that Mr. Yang has done his homework, traveling across the country and listening closely. He really seemed to have an almost emotional sense of what people have been going through and what the problems are, a board member [Related: What Is an Editorial Board?] said afterward. His portrait of the fundamental economic problems were more moving than Bernie's, and Bernie has been selling this for 30 years.\\n\\nHe articulated a vision for the future of work, education and technology for the nation.

The transcript is unedited. [Related: Learn more about The Choice, or meet the editorial board members]\\n\\nKathleen Kingsbury: Wonderful. Thank you. Yeah. So I have a serious question to ask you, but first we wanted to ask, were you wearing a helmet while you were biking here?\\n\\nMr. Yang biked to the Times from his Manhattan home. More New York City cyclists died biking in 2019 than in any other year since 2000; Gothamist counts 29 deaths.\\n\\nI was wearing a helmet. I have a staffer with the helmet as proof.\\n\\nJesse Wegman: Is the inside of the helmet warm?\\n\\nMy team then had me take the helmet off and then tried to make my hair look good. So that's why I didn't show up with the helmet.\\n\\nKK: It looks sharp.\\n\\nI commented to one of my team members, I feel like running for president is at least a glimpse into what it's like to be a professional woman because I feel like I care about my appearance more now than I ever did. And there are people that are always like looking after ——\\n\\nHe's right, of course. Women in politics have long been subjected to much closer scrutiny than men; in 1917, the first female member of Congress, Jeannette Rankin, took office and The Washington Post ran an article headlined: Congresswoman Rankin Real Girl; Likes Nice Gowns and Tidy Hair.\\n\\nWatch a special endorsement episode of The Weekly This video excerpt has been edited by The Weekly.\\n\\nBrent Staples: Scrutinizing you.\\n\\nScrutinizing, looking after it, because I'm just like, What? My hair? Who cares? No one. And then people are like, No, no, and they have to put time in, smooth it out.\\n\\nKK: So let's get into it. We have about 90 minutes together. In your assessment, what are the policy breakdowns that lead to Americans still being hungry today?\\n\\nWow, I love this question. There are many causes of poverty, and the fact that we're not able to put food into people's houses and on their tables is a structural problem. My campaign's based upon the premise that we're going through this profound economic transformation, the fourth industrial revolution. And one of the major problems is that we still pretend we're in the economy of the '70s or '80s.\\n\\nMr. Yang is not the first to label this period the fourth industrial revolution — the term was made popular by Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, at its annual meeting in Davos in 2016. Mr. Schwab's book of the same name argues that the fourth industrial revolution is transforming every sector of the economy and industry through new technologies that merge the physical, digital and biological realms.\\n\\nIn the '70s or '80s, your labor and overall productivity were more or less in lock step. And we still pretend that if someone wakes up in the morning and says, Hey, I need to put food on the table, he can go out to his main street, he can sell his time for money at some hourly rate, and then he'll be able to make a good enough living so he can feed his family, raise kids and the rest of it. That has become progressively less true over the last 40 years, unfortunately, where wages have stagnated while productivity has gone up and up, and that's going to accelerate because of the convergence of capital and technology now, in unprecedented ways.\\n\\nStarting in 1979, productivity and pay sharply diverged — productivity rose nearly 70 percent, while typical hourly pay essentially stagnated, according to the Economic Policy Institute.\\n\\nEspecially for people who are at the lower end of the skills ladder, which is most Americans. Only 33 percent of Americans will graduate from college, 42 percent if you include two-year degrees.\\n\\nSo you're looking at a nation of high school graduates. And what do high school graduates do for a living? The top five occupational categories are retail and administrative, which includes call center work, retail, food service and food preparation, transportation, primarily truck driving, and attendant supportive jobs and manufacturing still. We all know that we have gutted many of these industries, and their labor bases have shrunk.\\n\\nSo for a high school graduate in America to get by, if you have one health problem or car breakdown, it can take a very tenuous financial situation and send it in a downward spiral. Then how do you put food on the table? In theory, there are nonprofits and food pantries that would see to this, but we all know that they're dramatically underresourced relative to the need. And so when you look at the causes of food poverty, to me the best solution is instead of trying to create organizations that will put food into people's hands, which we should do obviously, we should just put money into Americans' hands and then they would be able to procure food to provide for themselves and their families.\\n\\nMr. Yang's candidacy has centered on the idea of his Freedom Dividend, essentially universal basic income — which has a long history, drawing support from Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King Jr. and Friedrich von Hayek, but also a controversial one. (Later annotations will look at why.)\\n\\nKK: So I assume you're referring to [your] universal basic income plan. Your campaign platform, you have tons and tons of proposals, everything from U.B.I. to universal daylight saving time. Plans don't really mean anything unless you have priorities. What would you do immediately when you enter office? What would be first on your agenda? What would you want to accomplish in the first 100 days?\\n\\nMr. Yang has prided himself on injecting the race with new thinking through proposals like yearlong daylight saving time. Daylight saving time was instituted during World War I for energy-efficiency purposes. Mr. Yang argues that extending it year-round would decrease traffic accidents, increase economic activity and lower crime.\\n\\nTo me, the economic imbalances are causing many of our other problems. If you look up and down the line, health problems, poor educational attainment and results, even political polarization, they stem from the fact that we have this pervasive financial insecurity where 78 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Almost half can't afford an unexpected $400 or $500 bill. If you can't pay next month's rent, it's very hard to worry about climate change. I come and talk to you and say, Hey, we need to fight climate change. And you look up and say like, I'm worried about next month. Next year, next decade has to wait in line.\\n\\nThe statistic that 78 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck was reported in a 2017 study by the human capital management firm CareerBuilder. Read the study here.\\n\\nAnd that's probably a generous response. Some of the responses would be worse than that. So if you get the boot off people's throats, then you can start making progress on our health, on our educational outcomes, on our political polarization.\\n\\nEveryone knows my flagship proposal is this Freedom Dividend of $1,000 a month for every American adult, which is not a new idea. And it's not my idea. Thomas Paine was for it at the founding of the country. Martin Luther King fought for it and was fighting for it when he was assassinated. So after I'm the nominee and I defeat Donald Trump, everyone will know that I'm in the White House because of the Freedom Dividend.\\n\\nDemocrats and progressives will be so thrilled to have defeated Donald Trump, they will love the fact that we're going to put buying power into families' hands, make children stronger and healthier. But here's the great thing: The Republicans will look up and say, Wait a minute, do I hate the Freedom Dividend? And they look up, and they notice only one state's had a dividend for almost 40 years, and it's Alaska, a deep red conservative state, that was passed by a Republican governor.\\n\\nSince 1982, Alaska has been giving every resident an annual check from its $66.3 billion permanent fund, which gets at least 25 percent of the state's mineral royalties every year. The results of the experiment have been mixed — crippling poverty is low, but unemployment rates are among the highest in the country, and the fund's value fluctuates with oil prices.\\n\\nThe reason I am drawing, in some polls, 10 percent or more of Donald Trump voters to my campaign is that Republicans and conservatives do not hate economic buying power in citizens' hands. What they hate is a giant bureaucracy making everyone's decisions. So you ask what my main priority will be as president, it will be to get the Freedom Dividend across the finish line and get buying power into Americans' hands, which will then lead us to be able to solve many other problems much more quickly.\\n\\nMr. Yang's argument that he is pulling 10 percent or more of Trump supporters was not rated favorably on PolitiFact — the 10 percent figure comes from a July YouGov poll, and subsequent polls found the number to be lower.\\n\\nWatch a special endorsement episode of The Weekly This video excerpt has been edited by The Weekly.\\n\\nKK: Have you spoken to Republican lawmakers about the Freedom Dividend?\\n\\nI haven't sat down with a lot of sitting senators and congressmen and women, but I've talked to literally thousands of people who supported Donald Trump in the last election who say they are now supporting me. I've talked to many folks who are Republicans who say they are, at least, sympathetic to my message, in large part because they understand the numbers. When I talked to 70 C.E.O.s here in New York City, not that far from here, it was a fancy bank office, most of them were Republicans. I said, How many of you are looking at replacing your back-office clerical workers with artificial intelligence and software? Guess how many hands went up out of 70. All of them. The truth is, you should fire any C.E.O. who was not looking to make that happen, because their incentives are all tied to the bottom-line profitability of their firm. And most of them were Republicans. So they understand the need for what I am proposing.\\n\\nJamie Dimon, who is a Democrat but is a numbers person, has looked at the numbers and said, we should declare a national emergency around the fact that the economy is not working for most Americans. And he's proposing a negative income tax, which is a close cousin to the Freedom Dividend that I'm championing.\\n\\nUnlike universal basic income, a system that would provide some cash to every person regardless of income level, a negative income tax system would give cash to people below a certain income threshold. Milton Friedman made the case for the tax as a poverty alleviation tool in his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom.\\n\\nSo this is not a left or a right idea, this is bipartisan. And many Republicans will see that this is going to be a huge win for their constituents, for rural areas, for red states on the interior. We don't need 80 percent of Congress to pass it, we just need a majority.\\n\\nKK: I want to move on to some other questions, but I actually have one last for you, which is why run as a Democratic versus a Republican if you have such bipartisan issues?\\n\\nI've been a registered Democrat since the Clinton years; I was an Obama appointee. I had a fund-raiser for John Kerry. It wasn't a great fund-raiser because I was kind of young; it wasn't one of those fancy ones where you generate tens of thousands.\\n\\nKK: How much money did you raise?\\n\\nI want to say we raised maybe $5,000, and I was quite pleased. It was at a lounge.\\n\\nKK: With inflation, though, it would be higher, right?\\n\\nWell, thank you for saying so. Yeah, in 2019 dollars it must be at least $6,000. I've been a Democrat for years and years, and if you look at my alignment on the vast majority of issues, they're lock step with the Democratic Party. So it was very natural for me to run as a Democrat. I've ruled out completely any third-party bid because that would in my mind increase the chances of Donald Trump winning, and the mission is to defeat Donald Trump and help move the country forward.\\n\\nMr. Yang, a former technology executive and entrepreneur, has distinguished himself from Senator Sanders and the far left of the Democratic Party in making the case for a more humane capitalist system, what he calls human-centered capitalism.\\n\\nKK: O.K. Moving onto a perhaps slightly less serious topic.\\n\\nIn hindsight, this was not an accurate assessment of the next question.\\n\\nI like it already.\\n\\nAisha Harris: Back in September, you actually spoke out on behalf of the comedian Shane Gillis, who had been hired on SNL and then was quickly fired after some racist comments were stirred up that he had made in the past on one of his podcasts. And you said you didn't want to be judged for something you had done 25 years ago. But Gillis's comments were maybe a year ago. So I'm curious as to, in your mind, how long of a period of time should it be before someone faces some sort of consequences for something they've done in the past?\\n\\nMr. Gillis was hired by Saturday Night Live last September, then dropped days later after clips surfaced showing him using slurs and language offensive toward Asian and L.G.B.T.Q. people, including one specifically about Mr. Yang. Mr. Yang later said the comedian should have had the chance to keep his job and explained: As a society, we have become unduly punitive and vindictive about people making statements that some find offensive or distasteful.\\n\\nSo when I heard that Shane Gillis had called me Jew chink — I think was the slur — my reaction was the same reaction anyone would have, which was like, who the heck is this guy, and he sounds like a total jackass. Well, my wife actually had heard about it independently and was also like, Who the heck is this guy? And so then I sat down and started to figure out who Shane Gillis was, what he did for a living, and then I sat down and watched some of his comedy to try and get some context.\\n\\nAfter watching his comedy, I felt that he wasn't a malignant racist and that his slur toward me was just very, very bad comedy run amok. Which did not strike me as a fireable offense, and I realized that if I was the individual who was actually directly slurred, and I did not feel that he should lose his job over it, then I should probably share that sentiment with other people.\\n\\nParticularly because I think we've become unduly vindictive and punitive toward statements that people find objectionable. A friend of mine said something, he said, If the online universe descends on someone, and they lose their job, the online universe moves on a week later, but that person still does not have a job a week later. That the impact on the individual lasts much, much longer than the rancor. So I shared this.\\n\\nThe comment about I wouldn't want to be judged for something 25 years ago was about something completely independent. I think I'd seen something where Joe Biden was being called out for something he'd said 25 years ago, when I said I wouldn't want to be called out for some misstatement I'd made 25 years ago. And then I joked, good thing no one cared about what I was doing 25 years ago, because I was at that point a 20-year-old man, and the internet didn't really have full documentation of how I spent those years.\\n\\nMr. Yang was asked on CNN's The Van Jones Show about cancel culture and whether Americans have gone too far in the direction of a lack of grace or a lack of forgiveness. He responded: I'm new to politics, but I certainly would hate to be judged by something I did 25 years ago.\\n\\nSo the Shane Gillis opinion was not based upon the timeline, it was just based upon my reaction as a person, and the person that was directly named. I certainly think there should be consequences for one's statements and actions, and I certainly think that obviously he made the statements within the year, and that if you did have some sort of time frame when you would want to overlook something, it would be much longer than a year.\\n\\nMr. Yang's comments, on Mr. Gillis and on judgment more broadly, contribute to a growing conversation among political and cultural figures about the merits and downsides of cancel culture. Former President Obama, for example, spoke out about the prevalence of call-out culture during an interview in October, arguing that criticizing people on social media for not being woke enough is not activism and not bringing about change.\\n\\nAH: But do you think, I mean, he never truly apologized. He just said, I'm sorry you're offended. And while you may not have felt that way, there were other jokes he made about just Asian-Americans and Asian people in general, and there were other people who were obviously affected by this. So I mean, what kind of consequences do you think someone who makes those kinds of statements and who doesn't show any sort of remorse for it, should they face? If not firing, what should happen? What would the steps be?\\n\\nMr. Gillis issued what some saw as a non-apology, writing on Twitter that he is a comedian who pushes boundaries and his intention is never to hurt. He added, I'm happy to apologize to anyone who's actually offended by anything I've said.\\n\\nWell, in this case, what's interesting is it's up to the employer, and it was NBC and Saturday Night Live. Even as I made the statement saying I didn't think he should be fired, I thought he probably would be fired. Because if you're NBC and SNL, you look up and say, what is my upside for keeping this guy? He's not exactly a huge moneymaker, he hasn't worked a day on the set. Like, that's not a really powerful set of incentives. And so I thought they probably would fire him. I'd suggest that the extent there are consequences for people's misstatements, they should be somewhere commensurate to the level of power and influence they have and the harm that they're doing. In Shane Gillis's case, he was a comedian. I'd never heard of the guy before.\\n\\nAH: I mean, I don't think most people had.\\n\\nNo, certainly not before the statements had taken place, and in terms of consequences, I would suggest that someone like Shane had probably paid a price in many ways. Like, aside from being fired, there are many circles that, if he shows up in, he'd be labeled very, very negatively. He reached out to me personally, and I had a conversation with him. The conversation with him made me feel more confident that I'd done the right thing. Because I think in many cases we're trying to follow up on a sense of shame and humiliation that the person might already feel.\\n\\nAfter Mr. Gillis was fired, Mr. Yang tweeted that the comedian had reached out to him. Looks like we will be sitting down together soon, Mr. Yang wrote. Neither the comedian nor the candidate appears to have spoken publicly about the content of the meeting.\\n\\nKK: I think we have some questions around economics.\\n\\nBinyamin Appelbaum: Yes. After every invention basically since the plow, people have found new uses for the time saved by new technologies. You've argued that this time, this won't happen quickly enough. Why will this time be different? What gives you the confidence that we're confronting something new in all of human history?\\n\\nMr. Yang has argued that his Freedom Dividend is one answer to the needs of the millions who will lose their jobs to automation.\\n\\nThe numbers. So keep in mind, I didn't just wake up and say, Hey, technology is changing the world. I spent seven years working in Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis, Baltimore and other cities that have been blasted by the waves of automation.\\n\\nThis work was through Mr. Yang's nonprofit, Venture for America. More on that in a bit.\\n\\nDetroit is a city of 680,000 people. Its peak population was 1.7 million. If you look this direction, you can see a thriving neighborhood, and then you turn 90 degrees and you see abandoned buildings as far as the eye can see. If we were adapting, you would see not multidecade low rates of interstate migration, which we have right now. You would not be seeing 80 percent of the country have multidecade low levels of business formation, which we have right now. You would not be seeing historic lows of business formation among young people, which we have right now. You would not see labor force participation at 62.9 percent, a multidecade low which we have right now. You would not see record-high levels of drug overdoses and suicides to the point that America's life expectancy has declined for three years in a row, which we have right now.\\n\\nMr. Yang argues that the automation of manufacturing jobs — especially in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri and Iowa — helped breed the discontent and economic desperation that led to Mr. Trump's election.\\n\\nAndrew Yang in the spin room after the Democratic debate in Detroit. Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times\\n\\nBA: But we also have record low unemployment, and when you mention labor force participation, some people think a big factor there is that the government already is giving people too much money.\\n\\nLabor force participation — the share of Americans either employed or actively looking for work — declined precipitously from the late 1990s, dropping to 62.7 percent in 2014 (its lowest rate since the Carter administration). Critics of President Obama liked to argue that this was because of government handouts. But there's a counterargument to be found in demographic trends — the Congressional Budget Office estimates that a sizable portion of the decline in labor-force participation is a result of the aging of the work force.\\n\\nWell, the labor force participation rate has declined precipitously, so I don't buy that somehow the government started giving people more money over the last number of years. And the headline unemployment rate, and I'm sure you know this, it doesn't measure underemployment, 40 to 44 percent of recent college graduates are now doing a job that does not require a college degree. It does not measure the fact that 94 percent of new jobs in the economy are temp, gig or contract jobs that do not have health care benefits and can disappear at any moment. It doesn't include the fact that you might be doing two or three jobs to make ends meet.\\n\\nA 2016 study from the economists Lawrence Katz at Harvard and Alan Krueger at Princeton found that 94 percent of net job growth between 2005 and 2015 was alternative work, including independent contractors, freelancers and temps.\\n\\nUber is literally advertising to schoolteachers saying, Hey, we've figured out schoolteachers make really good Uber drivers. And if you look at that situation, the headline unemployment rate says, Check, this person is employed. Heck, this person might be employed twice. The headline unemployment rate when Donald Trump was running for president, he castigated it as fake news, and then he got into office and all the sudden it became real news. He was right the first time. The number is almost intentionally designed to obscure any of the difficulties in the labor market. If I drop out of the labor market, I no longer count. I actually help the number.\\n\\nRight now we have three flagship numbers we're beating the American people over the head with, telling them that things are going great. No. 1, the headline unemployment rate. No. 2, gross domestic product, which is obviously putting up record highs even as our life expectancy is declining. And No. 3, corporate profits and shareholder value. Stock market prices correspond to the fortunes of the top 20 percent of Americans, many of the people, obviously, who live here in Manhattan. The bottom 80 percent of Americans own 8 percent of stock market value. The bottom 50 percent own essentially zero.\\n\\nThe American cities with the highest number of high-net-worth individuals are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington. California has the most number of people on the Forbes list of wealthiest Americans.\\n\\nIf these are your measurements, then of course you're going to think things are going in one direction, while your way of life disintegrates. Even the inventor of G.D.P., Simon Kuznets, said 100 years ago, this is a terrible measurement of national well-being, and we should never use it as that.\\n\\nIf you run an organization, imagine having an organization that has the wrong measurements. How is that organization going to fare over time? That is where we are in the United States of America right now. We're riding a century-old measurement off a cliff, while our way of life deteriorates underneath our feet. If you looked at levels of anxiety, stress, mental health, depression, suicides, drug overdoses, you would see that we're in a mental health recession or depression, we're in a wellness or life expectancy recession or depression, and the corporate profits are going to keep on going up, because in the 21st-century economy, companies can do very, very well while not hiring a lot of people, not treating them as full-time employees, and they don't need to care what happens in their own backyard because they sell everywhere.\\n\\nGross domestic product is a measure of a country's entire economic output. Its inventor worried that it might be mistaken as a measure of citizens' well-being. Mr. Yang's campaign has proposed that America measure its economic prosperity with a different index that accounts for human and not just monetary factors, including inequality and quality of life.\\n\\nBA: But you're not proposing to fix any of that. People don't just work to make money; they do work for a sense of self-worth. They work so that they can develop skills, they work so they have the possibility of earning more money someday. You're proposing to replace a portion of the income they may have lost, but not any of those other things. Why is that a solution?\\n\\nI love work, and the numbers also clearly show that people need work. Men in particular, without work, they volunteer less than employed men. So think about that for a second. They have higher rates of substance abuse, their health deteriorates, all these social ills accompany. Of course, we need to create jobs in as many communities as possible.\\n\\nHarmful effects of unemployment are felt by men and women, but men are more likely to experience negative health effects including depression and increased risk of suicide.\\n\\nThe question is, what is the means to creating those jobs? What I'm suggesting is that if you were to put $12,000 a year into the hands of every American adult … Let's say there's a town in Missouri of 10,000 people. Let's say after I'm president, their disposable income goes up by $10 million a month. Where is that money going to go? It's going to go into car repairs, day care expenses, Little League sign-ups, the occasional night out.\\n\\nIf you were a person in that town in Missouri and you wanted to start a bakery, before the dividend, it's a dumb idea. Post-dividend, it might be a great idea. You can hire someone to help staff the bakery, you know if the bakery fails, you're going to survive because you have this income that you can rely upon. This is the most stable and secure way to create jobs that actually reflect our community's needs and values. What are the other alternatives? For the government to come in and say, Hey, we're going to designate five people to clean up this park forever. We're going to designate 10 people to make our people stronger forever, regardless of whether or not they're ——\\n\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the federal government commissioned a series of experiments to look at how guaranteed income effects labor participation. Researchers discovered that a program like U.B.I. doesn't have the drastic effect on work that some might predict; households overall reduce their workload by roughly 13 percent, according to a paper in the Canadian Public Policy journal.\\n\\nBA: So a Republican would say that alternative is to let markets work. Is that what makes you a Democrat — you don't think the market will create enough jobs for Americans?\\n\\nOh, I think the market will work beautifully toward what it's designed to do. The market is designed for maximal capital efficiency, and it is doing a phenomenal job. That's why you see the returns on capital outstripping the returns on labor at historic levels. The market is not designed to maximize human well-being.\\n\\nAnd again, all you have to do to look at it is to say, stock market prices and G.D.P. record highs, life expectancy declining. Like, that sums it up. You know? You don't need any clearer divergence than that.\\n\\nMr. Trump likes to say that the economy has reached historic highs under his administration. However, life expectancy has been falling and other measures of well-being have declined, including rising rates of depression diagnosis.\\n\\nWhat I'm suggesting is we actually make capitalism's goals align with ours, as human beings, as parents, as Americans. Instead of maximizing these capital efficiency measurements, we should be maximizing our own health and life expectancy, our children's education and success rates, our mental health and freedom from substance abuse, our environmental sustainability. Then we can line up the power of the markets with how we are doing. But the markets do not care one whit about us and our children.\\n\\nBA: I want to ask you about the — Oh, sorry, go ahead.\\n\\nKK: Oh, sorry, I just wanted to ask you, you know, there are some people who would suggest that a better use of money, instead of giving a Freedom Dividend, would be to dramatically overhaul America's high schools and start teaching people different skills instead of trying to continue the race against A.I. Why isn't that a path? Why couldn't we instead change how we do education in this country?\\n\\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's Future of Education and Skills 2030 project is exploring the ways education systems internationally need to change to prepare students for a rapidly automating economy.\\n\\nWe should definitely do that, in a very big and dramatic way. And I have proposals to help move us toward a better model of high school education. Only 6 percent of American high school students are in technical, trade or apprenticeship tracks. In Germany, that's 59 percent. Think about that gulf. Meanwhile, there are millions of those trade and middle-scale jobs that are left unfilled. Why is this?\\n\\nOne, it's a lot easier and cheaper for us to throw kids into a classroom with textbooks and a teacher and say, You're going to go to college, than it is to try and train them in skills that are going to give them a secure livelihood. Number two, we have fetishized college and stigmatized anything that's not college. We've beaten Americans over the head, pretended everyone's going to college and say, It's going to work for you. And the Democrats are guilty of this. That's why they're yelling, Free college, free college. Meanwhile, again, only 33 percent of Americans are going to go to college, and that is a relatively stable number.\\n\\nThe question of whether to prioritize free public college has divided the Democratic candidates. Senators Warren and Sanders say that four-year public colleges should be free, and Senator Cory Booker signed on to legislation that could make it debt-free. Senator Amy Klobuchar previously criticized the idea of free college for all, but then signed on to a version of a free-college proposal. Mr. Yang, though, has said he supports forgiving more student loan debt but thinks the Freedom Dividend is a better solution to inequality than free college.\\n\\nKK: But access to college is still a civil rights issue in this country.\\n\\nPresident Obama referred to education as the civil rights issue of our time, as did former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. Indeed, the gap between education outcomes for black and white students has barely budged in recent decades, according to research from the Brookings Institution.\\n\\nIt very much is. But if you were to apply resources, you would want to apply resources in ways that don't necessarily advantage the top third of your population by educational attainment exclusively. You would be trying to build more paths with the other two-thirds, which investing in trades and apprenticeships would do, and you would try and provide for the people who are the weakest and most vulnerable in the job market, which are not going to be the people that are attending college.\\n\\nMost American laborers work in the services sector, according to Pew Research — in July 2019, 107.8 million people worked in private service-providing industries including trade, transportation and utilities.\\n\\nOur economy is breaking down on all levels. Again, if you are fortunate enough to graduate from college today, you're in the top third of the population, you're graduating with tens of thousands in school loans very, very often, and there's a 40 to 44 percent chance you're going to do a job that does not require your college degree. That's if you're one of the winners in our society today. I spent seven years working with, frankly, some of the top educational products in our country. I saw that even the winners are not winning right now. And so imagine if you're a nonwinner, what this looks like.\\n\\nBS: Would you dilate what you're talking — seven years doing what?\\n\\nI started and ran a national nonprofit called Venture for America that recruited enterprising college graduates to help grow businesses in Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, New Orleans, Birmingham, Baltimore, and nine other American cities. We helped create several thousand jobs. I'm very, very proud of that. But I realize that the jobs we were creating were only going to apply for a small slice of the population. And these jobs were pouring water into a bathtub that has a giant hole ripped in the bottom. I'm running for president to let America know that it is not our imagination, the water is rushing out of the bathtub. Immigrants have nothing to do with it. It's the fact that we're going through the greatest economic transformation.\\n\\nMr. Yang founded Venture for America, a fellowship program for recent college graduates, in 2011, with the goal of creating 100,000 new jobs in the country's most underresourced cities. As of 2019, the nonprofit has created around 3,500 jobs.\\n\\nBA: Just before we move on, maybe I can ask one more question.\\n\\nOf course, sure.\\n\\nBA: Your proposal is oddly regressive. On the benefits side you're proposing that people will have to choose between this benefit and their existing federal benefits while someone like me just all the sudden gets a new check in their mailbox every month. On the funding side you're relying on a VAT, which is an inherently regressive funding mechanism. You've proposed some offsets, but I still don't understand why you don't just embrace a progressive approach to taxation. Either raise top rates or a wealth tax. If there are people who need help, why aren't you trying to help them as much as possible?\\n\\nA VAT (value-added tax) is a tax on consumption, so the burden disproportionately falls on low-income households, who spend a larger portion of their income.\\n\\nI'm for a more progressive tax structure. It's clear that the people at the top of the income chain are not paying enough. I don't think a wealth tax will work. I like the spirit of a wealth tax, but if you look at other countries' experience, Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, very sophisticated developed countries, they tried a wealth tax and they wound up repealing it because it had massive compliance problems, and it did not generate anywhere near the revenue that was projected.\\n\\nSo if you cannot learn from the experiences of other countries, what can you learn from? We have to take a policy that actually works, and what those countries and every other developed country have determined works, is a value added tax. Because a value added tax is impossible to game your way out of. If you're a trillion-dollar technology company — you know, I was just in New Hampshire campaigning yesterday, and you know what I say to them? I say to everyone around the country, Amazon, a trillion-dollar technology company sucking up $20 billion in business every year, closing 30 percent of your stores and malls, paying zero in taxes, how do you feel about that? You know? And they are angry. They say, how the heck can Amazon be paying zero in taxes? And I was like, I know. And it's up to you, the people of New Hampshire, to change it. So if you look at other countries ——\\n\\nIn 1990, 12 European countries had some form of a wealth tax, while today only three have kept the policy — Norway, Spain and Switzerland. Reports by the O.E.C.D. and others have found that the tax led to an exodus of the wealthy and didn't raise as much revenue as anticipated.\\n\\nBA: But that doesn't make our tax code more progressive.\\n\\nSo if you look at other countries, they have a value-added tax and then they take those resources and put them to work toward various social programs in ways to balance out the inequality. Now, another thing I love about the value-added tax is you can either reduce it or exempt things like diapers, toilet paper, eggs, milk, things that Americans consume just to make ends meet, and you can dial it up on things like artificial intelligence, yachts, luxury watches. There are ways that you can make it so that it falls more heavily on people that would barely notice. And we're taking the resources plus an additional hundreds of billions of dollars and putting it directly into the hands of working Americans. This would increase the buying power of literally 90 percent of Americans.\\n\\nBA: But just to be clear, it's still not a progressive tax. There's no model that says that you can use these kinds of exclusions and exemptions to make that progressive. You can make it less regressive. You're still fundamentally proposing a nonprogressive means of revenue raising.\\n\\nA progressive tax is one in which the rate increases with income, while a regressive tax increases inversely with income.\\n\\nIn a vacuum, you're 100 percent correct. But it's failing to account for the fact that we're taking that money, and then some, and putting it directly into the hands of the American consumer.\\n\\nBA: But that just brings us to the other side of it, where what you're proposing is not to give as much more money to the people who need it the most. You're saying, if you get food stamps, the amount by which your government benefits increase will be less than for me or you.\\n\\nA working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that U.B.I. could redirect spending to more affluent and middle-income families, therefore leaving low-income families worse off; a U.B.I. large enough to direct more funds to low-income households would be extremely costly. Read the paper here.\\n\\nLet's say I'm on food stamps, and I've got a 15-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. I'm concerned about their future, very, very deeply. And then Andrew Yang becomes president, and I find out that my 15-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month starting at age 18 for the rest of his life, and my 12-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month for the rest of her life. I'm going to say, wow. That's actually the biggest value gain I've ever even heard of in history. My kid will have a financial literacy class in high school, the first semester of their senior year. It is impossible to teach financial literacy to someone who does not have money. So the kids will actually learn about what to do with the money before they start getting the money.\\n\\nOther candidates have taken a different approach to creating a nest egg for low-income youth — Senator Booker, for example, favors baby bonds, which would provide every infant with a savings account that the government would contribute to annually depending on family income.\\n\\nThis is a game changer for Americans in any circumstance. And I am not for reducing or curtailing any of these social programs. For me, we're trying to lay a foundation that works for all Americans, and then we need to keep building on top of it. So if there are people that post-Freedom Dividend need additional programs and assistance, I'm all for it.\\n\\nKK: I want to ask you, you were the C.E.O. of Manhattan Prep. How does test prep — doesn't that contribute to income inequality in the United States?\\n\\nMr. Yang was the C.E.O. of a boutique test prep company that was purchased by Kaplan in 2009. The company flourished during the 2008 financial collapse, becoming the country's foremost preparatory company for the GMAT as more people flocked to business school.\\n\\nYeah, it does. It's one reason why I think we need to de-emphasize — excuse me.\\n\\nKK: Take your time.\\n\\nNot at all. We originated the SAT during World War II as a way to determine which kids we did not want to send to the front lines. Now we treat our kids like every year is wartime. I've talked to parents and teachers around the country, and I've said, we need to de-emphasize these standardized tests. They are a terrible measurement of human value, certainly have nothing to do with character. At this point, as you said, they are more likely to test your parents' socioeconomic status than anything else.\\n\\nThe SAT was first administered in 1926 and evolved out of a test used for admission to Princeton University and Cooper Union. It was inspired by military experiments with I.Q. testing.\\n\\nSo we need to have better, more holistic ways of measuring how our kids are doing educationally, and we need to empower teachers and let teachers do their jobs. Because if you are a teacher and you're teaching to the test, you end up making decisions in the classroom that you know are not right for the students.\\n\\nKK: Actually, I also want to ask you about your time at Manhattan Prep. Your colleague Kimberly Watkins told City Council in September that she had faced both gender harassment and pay inequity under your leadership there. Could you respond to those allegations?\\n\\nI believe your reporters then talked to maybe half a dozen or more of Kim's contemporaries at the organization and found out that those allegations were completely groundless, which they were.\\n\\nIn an essay published by the Gotham Gazette, Kimberly Watkins alleged that Mr. Yang fired her from Manhattan Prep because he did not think she would continue working as hard after getting married. Mr. Yang appeared on The View shortly after and said there was zero truth to Ms. Watkins's account. After publication, Ms. Watkins reached out to the editorial board, noting the question contained an error — she testified before a New York City hearing on pay equity, but, as she wroteto us , I have on multiple occasions drawn contrast to 'pay equity,' with what I experienced, which concerns long term economic stability. The reality that my economic future was destroyed by Yang, right after my marriage, after an unblemished six-year commitment to this company, has been the focus of my story, not pay inequity…Yang's response [also] grossly overstates the investigative process and draws a false conclusion.\\n\\nNick Fox: Can I clarify one point on taxation? Are you proposing any new or increased taxes on the wealthiest Americans or corporations, or is it strictly the VAT?\\n\\nIf you look at our proposals, we have a tax on financial transactions, which would obviously end up falling most heavily on the wealthiest Americans and the wealthiest companies. We have a carbon tax, which tends to fall most heavily on the wealthiest industries, which are emitting a lot. The value-added tax would obviously be enormously generative from people who benefit from society and consume the most. I'm for trying to restore our income tax levels to previous levels to be more progressive.\\n\\nA Times evaluation of Mr. Yang's tax plan by N. Gregory Mankiw, professor of economics at Harvard, found that Mr. Yang's tax plan would target the affluent who spend their money lavishly while incentivizing people to save.\\n\\nMichelle Cottle: Now, I think it's clear that people are responding to you in part because you have this big vision, but Washington has a problem achieving even kind of modest ——\\n\\nMr. Yang has a fervent online following that calls itself the Yang Gang.\\n\\nYeah, we noticed.\\n\\nMC: So, and we are currently enjoying a businessmen president who has no experience in government or the military. What is your argument to people, that we should trust you with no experience in government and the military, in the same position, and that you will do a better job dealing with the peculiarities of Washington.\\n\\nMany of Mr. Yang's supporters say they are drawn to his perspective as a political outsider; in The Wall Street Journal, some say they previously supported Senator Sanders but now look for a candidate who offers an even fresher non-Washington perspective.\\n\\nWell, it sounds like you've been there.\\n\\nMC: Quite a lot.\\n\\nDid you come up for this?\\n\\nMC: Yeah, I'm based out of ——\\n\\nOh, man. Well, thank you for making the trip. Then you know. First, any person who says they're going to run government like a business does not know what they're talking about, because they are two completely different things.\\n\\nIn a business you can say, Hey, we're going to go this way, and people generally have to do what you're saying. In government it's much more analogous to my role as the founder of a national nonprofit, where you have hundreds or even thousands of stakeholders, and you have to try and generate energy around a vision. Let people see that it's in their self-interest or the self-interest of the people that they represent to get on board with your vision. And that you're willing to compromise and work with them. That is the way I would lead as president.\\n\\nMr. Yang told Vox's Recode that one of the reasons he quit Venture for America, the nonprofit he created, was because he realized it couldn't achieve the change he wanted at the necessary scale. For instance, it had fallen short of the 100,000 jobs he set out for it to create.\\n\\nDonald Trump does not speak for every non-politician or nonmilitary officer. But there is a deep need, and you've seen this, because you spent time in D.C., the D.C. establishment will not generate big solutions.\\n\\nOne of the reasons why Donald Trump is our president is that millions of Americans feel like our government is unresponsive to our needs and the needs in our communities. They've been casting about for some sort of change agent for years. And it's not just Donald Trump's victory; it was Bernie Sanders outsized success. In some ways, it was even Obama's victory in 2008. If you remember that campaign, it was oh, hope, change. It was not, get the most experienced person in the seat as possible, because we are decades behind the curve in addressing the problems and challenges that are tearing us apart. Now ——\\n\\nMr. Yang has frequently said that automation contributed heavily to Mr. Trump's win, because voters feel disaffected and worry that the futures of their jobs and industries are in jeopardy.\\n\\nKK: Do you feel like President Obama achieved the change that he had promised in the 2008 campaign?\\n\\nI think that he did a lot of great things and he did a lot of what he could, but to the extent that there was a missed opportunity, it was in the wake of the financial crisis. And it's very hard to Monday morning quarterback a team when they literally felt like the economy itself was at stake, but we should have done much more to recapitalize homeowners as opposed to the banks. We could have kept many more people in their homes. We could've kept many of these communities ——\\n\\nA critique of President Obama's financial policies by Matt Stoller, of the Open Markets Institute, argues that the Obama administration let banking executives off the hook for their role in the financial crisis and enabled nine million foreclosures.\\n\\nBS: Without a doubt.\\n\\n—— more strong and more whole. There's a saying, I think it was actually, and maybe in this … no, it was an earlier administration, but a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. There was a crisis. There was a massive opportunity to help rebalance our economy, but we instead recapitalized the banks to the tune of $4 trillion. And what I say to Americans around the country, I say, Hey, do you remember voting for the $4 trillion bailout of Wall Street? And it gets this laugh. But then they answer, Wait, we did that? And it's, Of course we didn't vote for that.\\n\\nA crisis is a terrible thing to waste is a quote attributed to the Stanford economist Paul Romer. He made the comment at a meeting in 2004, referring to the competition America faces from the rising education levels around the globe. Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's chief of staff, later echoed the statement after President Obama's election.\\n\\nSo, that to me was the biggest missed opportunity in the Obama administration, and it happened very, very early on. I wish that they owned and reflected a little bit on the fact that maybe they could have done some things differently at that stage, because we're still angry. This country is still angry. I was so shocked by what happened in the financial crisis, I quit my job and started a national nonprofit and ran it for seven years. I had — my wife was pregnant. I mean, what happened to this country then is still tearing us apart.\\n\\nMr. Yang started Venture for America in 2011, shortly after selling his test prep company to Kaplan. He said that he saw, in the wake of the financial crisis, how certain communities were rapidly losing jobs and wanted to create new work opportunities in those underserved areas.\\n\\nLauren Kelley: Mr. Yang, can you say who is on your short list for running mate?\\n\\nI love this question.\\n\\nLK: So do we.\\n\\nWell, one of the joys of running for president is you get to know incredible people on the trail, including some of the other contenders. I'm on the record saying I would prefer to have a female running mate. I think teams run better if you have men and women leaders at the highest possible levels. I joke, but it's mostly true, that if you get too many men alone for too long, we kind of become morons. So we need to keep that from happening at the highest levels.\\n\\nMr. Yang confirmed this summer that he would like his running mate to be a woman.\\n\\nMC: He has my vote. All right. [LAUGHTER]\\n\\nBut at the same time, in order to have someone at that level of relationship, you need to have as much trust as possible and I'm still developing that kind of relationship with some of the other, not just candidates, but also people who could be running mates that are not currently running.\\n\\nMr. Yang has scored internet points with some tweets paying tribute to former 2020 Democratic rivals, for example by tweeting I miss Beto.\\n\\nLK: So no names yet.\\n\\nNo names yet, no.\\n\\nKK: Do you feel like you need to have a running mate who has operated in Washington before or who has previous government experience?\\n\\nAlmost certainly, yes. And you saw it a little bit with Barack Obama where he tapped Joe Biden in part because Joe had very deep relationships on Capitol Hill. If you had another outsider like me, we'd still be trying to figure out who to call. So, you need to have folks who have deep relationships on Capitol Hill from day one.\\n\\nLK: Speaking of women, I wanted to ask you about reproductive rights as well. You told some of our colleagues in the newsroom that you would consider some executive actions to protect reproductive rights, but I haven't seen any details about what actions you're considering. Do you have any details to share with us about that?\\n\\nWell, I'm all about trying to improve the reality on the ground, to the extent that we can actually put resources and funds to work in communities to make sure that women have access to reproductive rights in clinics. Certainly any way we can make sure that there aren't any obstacles to the funding of Planned Parenthood clinics around the country. I would take those actions immediately. A lot of the legislative actions, you need a bit more time and a bit more buy-in from Congress, but at the Supreme Court level, I would consider appointing more justices if it was necessary to safeguard women's reproductive rights.\\n\\nMr. Yang has argued that more legislative oversight on reproductive issues should come from physicians rather than politicians. He tweeted: I personally don't think male legislators should be weighing in on women's reproductive rights and freedoms.\\n\\nKK: You mean, you would in addition to the nine that we already have?\\n\\nIn addition to the nine we already have. I believe that — so if you look at the Constitution, there is nothing there that stipulates the number of Supreme Court justices. We've had fewer than nine, we've had more than nine. I think that appointing new justices would be helpful on several levels. It would help depoliticize the process, at least marginally, because if you have 17 justices and one steps down, then it's not as much of an earthquake. Well, right now we we're hinging our laws on the health of an octogenarian. It would literally be rational for us to all just to follow Ruth Bader Ginsburg around and just scrub any door knob she touches. You know what I mean?\\n\\nJustice Bader Ginsburg has had a series of health scares in recent years, including surgery for lung cancer and radiation treatment. She also had surgery for early-stage pancreatic cancer in 2009.\\n\\nJW: You remember what happened the last time a president tried to do this, right?\\n\\nYeah. And I think in some ways, there's some positive lessons to be drawn from that time, because there were some significant accomplishments during that era.\\n\\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt tried to advance a court-packing strategy to ensure favorable rulings on New Deal legislation. He wanted to appoint up to six additional justices, one for every justice older than 70 years. The plan was unpopular in Congress and among the Supreme Court's justices.\\n\\nKK: So, can you give us some names of people you would nominate to the Supreme Court?\\n\\nThat's a fun exercise, too. I haven't gotten into the judicial appointment shortlist yet, but safeguarding women's reproductive rights would be one clear criteria. Because women's reproductive rights are fundamental human rights in my mind.\\n\\nI think it's actually unfortunate that I get asked about those sorts of questions, in the sense that I feel like men should leave the room and let women decide what to do with your bodies. I have a feeling I know what you would decide, and then we could come back and say, Hey, what did you decide? I also think that if men got pregnant, this would be a very, very different conversation. And we'd have a completely different approach to these issues. So, I don't have a short list of Supreme Court justice appointees, but safeguarding women's reproductive rights and having an evolving sense of the law would be very important.\\n\\nWe need to modernize the court. Lifetime appointments might have made sense at one point a long time ago, but when the Constitution was drafted, people did not live as long. And also, people stepped down from the Supreme Court for any of a range of reasons. They did not wait until they were at death's door. This is not a way to run a 21st-century society.\\n\\nWe should have 18-year term limits, increase the number of justices, make it so it's predictable that you lose an election, the other party might get one or two justices, and then we don't need to literally be monitoring the health of our justices. Or, the most ridiculous thing is you're literally looking at the age of the person you're appointing being, Ooh, this person will be there for 30, 40 years. What kind of system do you want where you're having a society decide 30 years ago what women's rights are today? Doesn't make any sense.\\n\\nJW: Are you concerned that you wouldn't be triggering a sort of a war of — a back and forth between Republicans and Democrats, who were continuing to add justices to the bench with each new administration to satisfy their own policy priorities?\\n\\nIf you have term limits, it is bipartisan. Because ——\\n\\nJW: Right, but you're talking about expanding the court, too, and if you expand the court, as you say correctly, that it's a federal law, there's nothing in the Constitution about the number of justices. You expand it to 13, the next Republican who comes in, who is furious about women having too many reproductive rights, will expand it to 17 to overturn the rulings you just got. So, how doesn't that just become — doesn't devolve into ——\\n\\nCourt packing isn't a violation of any part of the Constitution, but it is widely debated with critics pointing out that it would trigger severe political backlash.\\n\\nBS: An arms race.\\n\\nWell, I would suggest that one side has been acting as if it is an arms race. And so, in that environment, it's only appropriate to respond in a way that you think would help move the country and our legal system in the right direction. Can I talk — oh.\\n\\nJeneen Interlandi: Oh no, go ahead.\\n\\nJW: I just wanted to tie together the question — a question from Lauren and a question from Michelle, and ask you about Washington, both with regard to Supreme Court confirmation process and your agenda more generally. You said at the very beginning of our conversation, in response to Katie, that you don't need a — you were talking about various [cross talk].\\n\\nYeah, you said you don't need 80 percent of Congress, you need a majority. And I would push back and say neither of those is correct. You need 60 percent of the Senate currently. The question is, how do you plan to get things done, even if you had a Democratic majority in the Senate? Which I think is right now less than an even chance. How do you propose getting your agenda through Congress when the filibuster is in place?\\n\\nTo your earlier concern, I think we should examine the filibuster. I think that gridlock is bad for anyone trying to get anything done and solve problems. This might be controversial in this room, but I am for the restoration of earmarks, because it helped make legislation possible. That if I was a congressperson in a district, and there was a bill being passed, it's, Hey, at least I can get some pork for my local museum. And that's a very small price to pay for a functional legislature. So, getting past the filibuster to me is one possible necessity, and the restoration of earmarks could be another.\\n\\nEarmarking allows Congress to appropriate discretionary funds for specific projects. Mr. Yang supports them because he feels they allow representatives to generate revenue for their constituents to offset costs their area might experience from a given piece of legislation.\\n\\nJW: And let me just, one last follow-up on that. If Democrats don't take back the Senate, how do you feel with the Supreme Court — how do you, I mean, put aside expanding the number of justices, how do you even get a justice onto the court in the first place?\\n\\nIt's obviously much harder. I'm all about trying to maximize the possible. And so, if we don't get a majority — I expect the Democrats will win a slight majority in the Senate. I'm very optimistic that way, but we're going to get done what we can get done with the branch of the government we have control of. And I will say too, I believe that we can get some things done that are traditionally bipartisan, regardless of who has control of the Senate. To me, I cannot believe that we did not get infrastructure done during the first couple of years of the Trump administration. I thought at least he would build some bridges and roads, and I was even willing to accept the Trump name on those bridges and roads if it got some bridges and roads built. I was, At least we're going to get this.\\n\\nThe editorial board recently called for the Trump administration to break the impasse on funding for the proposed rail tunnel under the Hudson River in an editorial titled: Build the Donald J. Trump Tunnel. The vital infrastructure project has stalled because of political infighting.\\n\\nKK: We've called for that, too.\\n\\nReally? So, we have to get done what we can get done. And if we have to focus on things that are traditionally bipartisan, I'd be excited to lead with that. I mean, I'd be much more excited to lead with a much bigger agenda to balance out this economy, to work for people. And I will say that's bipartisan, too. When I go around to Americans around the country, if you were to go to a room of Republicans and say, Hey, how do you feel about Amazon paying zero in taxes? They're not excited about that. They feel like this economy is rigged against them and their families, and they're generally correct, and that is bipartisan.\\n\\nJI: You've proposed legalizing gambling at the federal level, regulating it.\\n\\nKK: Online.\\n\\nJI: Yeah, online gambling.\\n\\nJust online poker.\\n\\nJI: Yes. Regulating it heavily and using the revenue to treat gambling addiction. Can you talk through that? You say on your website that you think gambling addiction doesn't get nearly enough attention, and it is a really important issue. How does legalizing gambling, even if you use the revenue, not make that problem worse?\\n\\nAny American who wants to gamble online on a poker site can do so from any state in the country right now. If it's illegal in your state, you just end up using an offshore betting site, which is shady, has problems, but it's not going to ease your gambling addiction at all. So the question is, do we want Americans, in the vast majority of the country, on offshore betting sites, dealing with shady characters and generating no revenue and still being addicted? Or would we prefer that they do business with American firms, where we do have better regulations, we know they're not getting cheated, we know they're not getting exploited, and you generate tax revenue that you can use to treat gambling addiction.\\n\\nMr. Yang's campaign estimates that federally regulating the U.S. online poker market could raise $2.2 billion just in its first year. The campaign also argues that federal regulation would make it easier to combat money laundering.\\n\\nJI: So, what steps would you take to take that money and create a gambling addiction treatment program or system? So, what exactly would you do to get from A to B?\\n\\nI mean, you could make it so it's analogous to what happened in the tobacco industry, where there's a certain level of revenue that gets set aside and then you have various public service announcements.\\n\\nPresident Obama signed into law the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in 2009, which gave the Food and Drug Administration authority to fully regulate the sale of tobacco products.\\n\\nJI: In that system, a lot of that money didn't actually go to treating tobacco-related health problems. A lot of it went to shoring up state budgets, and some of them even went to the tobacco industry actually, so I don't know if that's the best model.\\n\\nIn 2007 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that states direct 14 percent of funds from tobacco taxes and the national settlement toward antismoking campaigns, but most states have funneled it toward other areas, from agriculture to literacy.\\n\\nOh, you might not want to push the money to the states and then have them determine how to use it in their budgets. You could empower a national program or an agency to help administer it at the federal level, if you didn't trust the states to actually use it in the right way.\\n\\nJI: I actually really quickly want to go back to a question that Binya was asking you. You said, you gave us the example of parents with two kids and you're on food stamps and you're worried about your kids' future. And at the end of that explanation, you said that you are not for curtailing social supports, but isn't your plan such that, that mother, aside from what the kids would get in the future, that mother would have to choose between the food stamps and the actual U.B.I., right? Is that correct?\\n\\nThat is correct. But when I've dug into it, very, very few Americans are getting $1,000 in food stamps. And most of the people who are on government assistance live in fear of losing that assistance because there are various requirements that tend to come with it. And when, if you ask them, say, Hey, would you prefer $1,000 unconditional that you can rely upon, they actually think that's too good to be true.\\n\\nJI: Sure. But to Binya's point, it's still a trade-off. So, if I'm on food stamps, I'm getting less of a benefit than, say, Jesse, who's not on food stamps.\\n\\nWell to me, playing the relative benefit game, I mean of course in any large scale national program, it's you can't calibrate it precisely to everyone's individual situation. To me the test is more, is that person going to be better off tomorrow than they are today?\\n\\nKK: So I want to move on. We have some more personal questions for you.\\n\\nReally?\\n\\nKK: I think Mara's going to kick you off.\\n\\nMG: So, if you become president, what government secret are you most excited to learn about?\\n\\nDefinitely aliens, of course.\\n\\nKK: O.K.\\n\\nThat'd be my first question if I got in there, I'd be, All right, let me see them. Let's see what we've been hiding all of these years.\\n\\nKK: And, who has broken your heart?\\n\\nWow, these questions are really fun. Who's broken my heart?\\n\\nBS: Don't be tactical now.\\n\\nThis is — I mean, this is going to make me very sad to say, but I feel like I had an arc or a relationship with President Obama, where it was inspirational when he won. I was celebrating with my wife in the streets. And then over the years I began to feel like we'd missed a great opportunity. So, I'd say there was some heartbreak attached to that. And I worked with the president afterward, and I still admire him a great deal, but I think we could have done a lot more, and I don't think opportunities like that come along very often.\\n\\nThe Obama administration named Mr. Yang a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship in 2015 and a Champion of Change in 2012.\\n\\nKK: For millions of Americans, church and religion are the centers of their communities. Do you believe in God? Do you go to church regularly? Who are your spiritual advisers?\\n\\nI grew up in an entirely secular household. My parents did not talk about God in the house, but I had this instinctive belief in a higher power. I had many Christian relatives. I went to church over holidays growing up quite often. And then I married my wife, Evelyn, who's Christian. And so, we're raising our kids in a Christian church. I go to church when I'm home, which is not very often unfortunately nowadays. I enjoy it. My faith is still very much a journey, but I'm unreservedly thrilled about the impact it has on my wife, my boys, my family, my community.\\n\\nMr. Yang was raised in New York; his parents immigrated from Taiwan.\\n\\nBS: Which denomination?\\n\\nIt's a progressive Protestant church. We primarily go upstate, where we have a house in a town called New Paltz. They've got a rainbow flag up front. It's a very welcoming community.\\n\\nMr. Yang and his family began attending Sunday services at the Reformed Church of New Paltz after they purchased a home nearby in 2015.\\n\\nMG: Actually just a quick follow-up. When was the last time you rode the subway?\\n\\nI rode the subway maybe six weeks ago or so. It's become much more of a pain in the neck now that I actually get recognized. I confess that that's been the biggest adjustment in running for president. Because I was, No, I'm not going to get recognized on the street. Of course, keep in mind, when I started my run I was completely anonymous. I mean none of you had ever heard of me. And also there is, and this is not to make too much of it, but there's also this invisible Asian man thing. That you feel like all you have to do is just not want to be seen and then you disappear, and that doesn't work anymore.\\n\\nWhen I'm on the subway, people will look at me and then look at me. And then eventually someone will inch over and say, Hey, you running for president? And then I'll say, Yes, I am. They'll say, Yeah, yeah, I like you. Thousand bucks a month, something like that. And then they want to take pictures. And then as soon as someone breaks the seal, then it's safe for everyone to do it. And so, then I'll be — and then there's this uncomfortable period in this subway car after you've taken the pictures with him, you're still sitting there. And so then they're, So, where are you going? Or, how's Bernie? Or whatever the questions are. And so, I have not been riding the subway lately, but I've ridden the subway an awful lot over the years. Now my preferred mode of transportation is the bike, because if someone recognizes me, it's generally too late.\\n\\nKK: I thought you were going to say it's a lot harder to ride the subway now because of the breakdowns of New York infrastructure.\\n\\nIn 2017, Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York's subway and pledged $1 billion for improvements. The editorial board has repeatedly called for action to make the subways workable for this paper's millions of readers.\\n\\nThat too. I mean, it's rough. But I mean, New York's going through — I just want to bring some things to you from experience. Like yeah, the infrastructure breaking down. I mean, we're coasting on the investments made decades ago and they're starting to fall apart. But also what you all do in terms of journalism — I've been campaigning around the country and over 1,200 local papers have gone out of business because the local establishments that used to advertise are gone. All of their classified revenue went off to Craigslist and democracy works much less if you don't have local journalism.\\n\\nA report released by PEN America in November found that more than 1,800 local print outlets have closed since 2004, and at least 200 counties have no newspaper.\\n\\nThis, to me, is an emblem of what's gone wrong in American life. Where the market is all knowing and all powerful, and if the market decides that local journalism has zero value, then it has zero value. And that is not the way forward for us. We need to make our own independent determination of our own value as people, of the value of local journalism, of the value of arts, of the value of volunteering, of caregiving, of — like all the most important things in American life. And so you, in many ways, you're like the guardians of this incredible journalistic tradition, and it's like a unique privilege because the people who've pursued the same vocation in other parts of the country are just seeing it disappear.\\n\\nKK: Do you believe in government subsidies for journalism?\\n\\nYes. I have three major pro-journalism proposals on my website, including federally funding journalists for every congressional district, billions of dollars in grants to help transition local journalism. Matching grants, so you're not like saying, Hey, we're going to do this. But matching grants to help transition them to cooperative models of ownership to nonprofit and philanthropic models.\\n\\nOne criticism of government subsidized journalism is that it could stifle the media's capacity to serve as a watchdog.\\n\\nYou can build it around the town library, because a lot of them have this bulletin board that serves as the skeleton of a local paper when the local paper has gone out of business. A lot of these papers would be able to get by if they did not have to generate stock market level returns for hedge fund owners and private equity owners. If you had a cooperative model and it's made a certain amount of money, spent a certain amount of money, ran as a nonprofit, you could restore and sustain local journalism and thousands of communities, but it will not happen without government support. It just won't.\\n\\nKK: Think you might be overly optimistic. Maybe we'll move on to foreign policy, if you don't mind?\\n\\nSure. Yeah.\\n\\nAlex Kingsbury: Another thing the country's invested in quite a lot is the military, and as commander in chief, you'd be in charge of that. Can you tell me how many aircraft carriers the United States Navy has?\\n\\nOh my gosh.\\n\\nAK: Whether or not the Navy is big enough to meet its commitments with the Chinese and the South China Sea? What's going on in the Persian Gulf? What do you think?\\n\\nI think the number of aircraft carriers is either seven or nine. I confess to not knowing precisely. In terms of our investment, we're spending $650 billion plus on our military. Certainly more than any other country, but I think more than the next four countries combined, and we have to examine, at this stage, whether that $650 billion is making us safer and more secure.\\n\\nThe correct answer is 11.\\n\\nWhat are the true threats of the 21st century? Climate change is number one, and then cybersecurity and A.I., loose nuclear material, military drones in the hands of nonstate actors. It's very hard to secure a location from something the size of a flying vacuum cleaner. That's very, very difficult. So we're entering an era where it's going to be much easier to be offensive than defensive, and you don't need massive levels of resources to cause significant levels of damage. To me, a new aircraft carrier does not make our elections any more secure from Russian hacking, which is the most direct threat to our democracy upcoming in this cycle. We're spending money on the threats of the 20th century, and we need to try and modernize our approach as quickly as possible.\\n\\nAK: The president at the moment is at a NATO summit, or he might've left ——\\n\\nI saw the headlines about how people were making fun of him. I was like, Oh man, this is really — we really have to put an end to this administration.\\n\\nMr. Trump canceled a planned news conference at a NATO gathering in December after a video circulated that showed world leaders including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Emmanuel Macron of France in what appeared to be a conversation mocking Mr. Trump.\\n\\nAK: But one of his priorities has been to get our European allies to spend more money on their own defense. And I wonder if you think that that's a worthwhile goal and how you might go about it, if you agree that that's something that should be a priority for the United States.\\n\\nTo me, one of the worst things you can do in a relationship is if you have this longstanding understanding or a friendship or partnership, and then you try and change the understanding at a particular point in time and do it unilaterally.\\n\\nWe need to let our historic allies know that our commitments are good, and that if we want to make a change, we want to do it in a way that's not pulling the rug out from under you but actually consultative. If we want other people to invest more, then we have to try and sit down with them and drive them to do so without questioning our commitment to NATO wholesale. But to me, trying to nickel-and-dime our relationships with our historic allies is not the best way forward. I think it was James Mattis that said that if you invest more in diplomacy, you have to invest less in ammunition, which should be the goal. So we need to make sure our partnerships and alliances are actually strong, stable and secure, and then we can put pressure on Russia and China with more of a global consensus, and maintain the international world order that's benefited us for decades that now is falling apart because Donald Trump is so erratic and unreliable, even with the people we've been allies with for decades.\\n\\nIn response to announcements about Mr. Trump's planned cuts to State Department funding, retired generals wrote a letter to lawmakers citing Secretary of Defense James Mattis's 2013 comment, If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately.\\n\\nAK: Speaking of allies, should Ukraine be invited to join NATO? I know that Ukraine's received sort of undue influence on this election, but going forward?\\n\\nI mean, that's not solely an American decision. NATO expansion is something that is fraught and elevates tensions with Russia in particular. I think we should explore it. I'm sympathetic, but it's not a decision we can make alone.\\n\\nA recent poll found that roughly 50 percent of the Ukrainian population favors joining NATO, though Hungary's foreign minister recently said his country would block Ukrainian membership unless Ukraine changed a policy restricting its citizens' use of minority languages.\\n\\nKK: Do you think — speaking of allies, do you think Turkey is still an ally to the United States, and do you think the U.S. should have nuclear weapons there?\\n\\nThis is what's so tough right now is that countries are trying to figure out what are the benefits of being an ally of the United States and doing what we want them to do, and then what are the costs. Unfortunately that calculation is going against us more and more. Turkey's relationship with the U.S. has been stronger than our relationship with many other countries in that region. I think we should invest in that relationship if we're going to be able to accomplish any of our goals there. And that includes, to me, being a little bit more accommodating about behaviors that we might find objectionable or troubling from them than we might from another country.\\n\\nSerge Schmemann: Yeah. And staying with relationships and alliances, President Trump has reversed several key policies the United States has had toward Israel. He's moved the embassy to Jerusalem, he's recognized sovereignty over the Golan Heights, et cetera, et cetera. Would you reverse those?\\n\\nHistorically, we've endorsed a two-state solution, which has always struck me as the best way forward, and I think it's really unfortunate that Donald Trump has moved us away from that to the extent that he has. I would try to move us back in that direction.\\n\\nMr. Yang has frequently reiterated his commitment to a two-state solution but has not released any detailed plans about how he would advance an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan or address Mr. Trump's policies in the region. He told the Council on Foreign Relations, I don't want to prescribe the specifics of a two-state solution, as the Israeli and Palestinian people both need to be leading any conversation, and I look forward to engaging with all stakeholders.\\n\\nSS: O.K. Again, about your responsibilities as president. One of the heaviest ones would be waging war. When you look back on the conflicts into which recent presidents have put us, would you support this? Is this something you would have done in Syria, in Libya, in Kosovo? Would you have sent troops there?\\n\\nSo I have a three-part test for sending troops into harm's way. Number one, it needs to advance a vital American interest or avert a humanitarian catastrophe. Number two, it has to have a clearly defined timeline where we can look troops in the eyes and say, It's going to take this long and you're going to be able to accomplish our mission and then you're going to be able to come home. And not some boardroom self-delusion, like you actually believe that you're going to get it done and then be able to bring them home in that time frame. And number three, we're not going in alone; there are allies joining us in the mission. If those three things are in place, then I would consider sending our troops into harm's way.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, I think we have become overly aggressive and optimistic about what we can accomplish in various foreign theaters. I've signed a pledge to end the forever wars because I don't believe it's the will of the American people for us to be in a constant state of armed conflict in foreign theaters for years and even decades at a time. Our Constitution says that it's in Congress's hands to declare war, but Congress has completely ceded this authority through the A.U.M.F. [Authorization for Use of Military Force] and then just said, Hey, executive branch, you can do what you want. And now they want nothing to do with it, and that is not the will of the American people, and it's not the will of the Constitution. So we should repeal the A.U.M.F. and say, Look, Congress, if we want to authorize armed conflict, it should be on you and it should be the will of the people.\\n\\nCommon Defense's End the Forever War pledge advocates for an expedient conclusion to the global war on terror and American military involvement in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, and Mr. Yang became the fourth candidate to sign on, in May, following Senators Sanders and Warren (and former Senator Mike Gravel).\\n\\nSS: Concretely, would you have sent troops, say, to Syria?\\n\\nNo. I'd have to look at the facts at the time that that decision was being made.\\n\\nJames Dao: Can I pose a future hypothetical? If the Chinese government were to flood Hong Kong with military troops after you were president and impose a violent crackdown, similar to, say, Tiananmen Square in 1989, what would you do?\\n\\nI have family in Hong Kong. I spent a semester there in college, and so when I see those streets wracked with riots and violence, I actually remember being on those streets. And so it's incredibly jarring, and it's an extraordinary situation because of Hong Kong's status as this semiautonomous region that's being reintegrated back into China.\\n\\nOur best path forward with China is to try and have them continue to show restraint, but also see that the costs to human rights abuse is not just in Hong Kong, but with their ethnic minorities and the Muslim population of Uighurs, that the costs are higher than their perceived benefits of maintaining social order and stability. In order to have those costs feel real to the Chinese, we can't just moralize and say, Hey, do the right thing. Because at this point they're looking at us and saying like, Keep your opinions and value statements to yourselves.\\n\\nWe have to be working toward China's second main priority, which is maintaining robust economic growth. So there are two goals. There are two primary goals that are sometimes in tension, of maintaining social order and maintaining robust economic growth. And the best way we can try and contain their behavior in Hong Kong is to say, Look, the economic costs are going to be very, very high. And the best way we can do that is to build global consensus around certain norms and behaviors.\\n\\nAt the last debate, I proposed a world data organization, because to me, China's in position to leapfrog us in artificial intelligence. They're investing tens of billions in a way that our government is not. It's a national effort. And they've now separated their technology ecosystem from the West's and they're trying to sell their software and operating systems to other countries with very limited success right now, but this parallel tech universe, to me, is something that we can actually use to bring China back to the table.\\n\\nThat's why something like world data organization is so vital. When they had to join the W.T.O. [World Trade Organization], they realized this was going to be vital to their economic growth, so they're going to have to make some decisions and compromises in order to join the world order. We can create an analogous situation for data and technology and then use that to try and curb some of their worst abuses and behaviors. Now, is this going to happen in time to help Hong Kong? I certainly hope so. I mean, I certainly hope that they don't flood the streets of Hong Kong with troops any time in the next number of days or weeks.\\n\\nMr. Yang has been critical of China's increasingly authoritarian behavior and told the Council on Foreign Relations the United States must in reply demonstrate a model for democratic capitalism.\\n\\nKK: And do you think President Xi is a dictator?\\n\\nI think he meets just about every conventional definition of dictator. Yes.\\n\\nCharlie Warzel: You were talking about data and that's a good segue into some of the — I mean, you're probably the candidate who sort of runs on understanding the internet better than anyone right now. And I'm curious first about this worldwide data organization. For someone like China, wouldn't it actually be better for them to sort of hoard that data and hoard that information and keep that closed system?\\n\\nMr. Yang has proposed what he describes as a W.T.O. for data and has argued that data ownership should be made a property right. Some argue that such an organization could enable more partnership among countries in setting standards for artificial intelligence and data.\\n\\nSo this is the carrot and the stick. So imagine if you had data standards that were endorsed by the U.S., the E.U., and Japan, and it had certain technology protocols associated with it. Then China said, Hey, I don't want to adhere to that. Because like you said, they like to hoard data, and one of the reasons why they're in position to leapfrog us is they have more data than we do and they have essentially nonexistent privacy rights or regulations. They have complete surveillance. That's one reason why they've banned masks in Hong Kong, so that their surveillance technology can pick up who the protesters are. So China has its own vast hoard of data.\\n\\nThere has been a continuing controversy over Hong Kong's law banning masks to target anti-government protesters. One court ruling found it unconstitutional, but a later ruling temporarily reinstated it.\\n\\nBut for them the challenge is not even what's happening internally. The challenge is whether or not they can get developing countries on board with their technology standards to be able to roll them out internationally. So if you're a third party, let's say you're a developing country in Africa or Latin America, then you have a choice essentially between the global standard and the Chinese standard. And if you're the Chinese, you do not want a standard that only you are using over time, because that's going to curb your economic upside to all of the software that you're building. One of the reasons why our tech companies are so successful is that they export it to virtually the entire rest of the world, and China does not want to be in the opposite position.\\n\\nCW: I'm curious, then, focusing on the U.S., a couple of months ago the general counsel for the N.S.A. wrote an Op-Ed for us and was worried about this big challenge of the government not being able to acquire the tech talent. That Silicon Valley is actually so much more attractive, so much more interesting there. And that when you're looking at 5G technology, quantum computing, technology, A.I., not having engineers in that space and sort of outsourcing that to the private sector is potentially incredibly dangerous. Like how do you actually make people want to come and bring that engineering talent to the federal government, rather than ——\\n\\nKK: Especially given your proposal for Department of the Attention Economy.\\n\\nWell, the Department of the Attention Economy would likely be based in Silicon Valley, and it'd be run by a guy named Tristan Harris, who's a design ethicist. He started Time Well Spent. So I don't think it's necessarily the case that you need to try and bring everyone into the cubicles in D.C. to get the rules ——\\n\\nMr. Yang has been the most vocal of all candidates about privacy issues. Tristan Harris, whom he has alluded to in discussing the Department of the Attention Economy, spent three years as a Google design ethicist. He left to found the Center for Humane Technology, a nonprofit that seeks to address the digital attention crisis.\\n\\nKK: I meant more make people want to work for government? And I think that's your question, right?\\n\\nCW: Yeah. Rather than, you know, a big exit or something like that. Sexy start-up.\\n\\nSo the clearest emblem of this is NASA and space travel where we all watched the Apollo 13 movies and we've seen the armies of research scientists helping launch these missions. Now where those research scientists? They're all at Space X and Blue Origin and they're there working for the tech guys who are putting billions into it. It's going to be very, very difficult to somehow reverse essentially decades of talent migration into the private sector. And if you're a talented kid out of Stanford, why would you work for the federal government? It's like if you're working in the private sector, you feel like you're going to go faster, you're certainly going to get paid more. You're going to be working with smarter people and you idolize Elon Musk, like who the heck, you know?\\n\\nKK: Yeah, that's literally our question.\\n\\nAY: Yeah. And I will say on a personal level, I spent seven years recruiting some of our top educational products to Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis. So I have seen that essentially the tide has turned in the direction it's gone and we should not be relying upon the government as the primary employer of a lot of this tech talent. We have to face facts and say, at this point, most of the intellectual capital is being attracted to these private firms and we need to instead try and support and work with the private firms.\\n\\nThrough Venture for America, Mr. Yang created opportunities for college graduates in under-resourced American cities — but almost half of V.F.A. alumni left the cities they were placed in through the fellowship.\\n\\nCW: Well, what about when it comes to like the N.S.A. and the technology they have and the surveillance? You don't want Google doing surveillance of people here and abroad?\\n\\nBS: Any more than they already are.\\n\\nCW: More than they already are. Right.\\n\\nMore than they already are.\\n\\nCW: But doing it in a national security sense. Or do you?\\n\\nI mean, the question is what trade-offs you're willing to make, really. The N.S.A. is going to be able to recruit the tech talent that he can recruit and you want to try and ramp that up. So one thing ——\\n\\nCW: They're worried about it.\\n\\nThey should be, I mean clearly. Because if you spend time on these campuses, you know where they're going. So one thing you can do that's very, very fast and immediate is you can become much more flexible in terms of compensation and a type of work environment.\\n\\nSo if you had, for example, a rule that said, Look, the government is allowed to match whatever salary a private sector employee is being offered, then you'd have more success. If you said, Look, you don't need to move to Washington, D.C., and sit in the thing that was built decades ago, that's like solace, and you have this giant parking lot and you just feel miserable being there for like a day, let alone a career.\\n\\nMr. Yang has said most Americans don't want to work for the federal government and argued that his Freedom Dividend would therefore be more effective than a program like a federal jobs guarantee.\\n\\nIt seems like a nice place to work. Then you might have greater success. We also saw this happen even with the rollout of healthcare.gov. Remember this? It's like they had the consultant and then they totally botched it and then they needed to bring in the ——\\n\\nBS: Remember The New Yorker cartoon?\\n\\nHm?\\n\\nBS: The New Yorker cartoon. They had a secretary with like a floppy disk. With her glasses pulled down and her fingers crossed.\\n\\nSee The New Yorker satirizing the Affordable Care Act rollout here.\\n\\nAnd it's not just the leading edge N.S.A.-type stuff. If you look around congressional offices or the I.R.S., they're all using technology from the '90s or whatever it is. I had a whiz kid who said he got yelled at for writing a script in a congressional office that automated a task. They were like, No, we just wanted you to do it manually forever. So there needs to be a massive modernization effort. Not just in terms of how we recruit tech talent at the highest levels, but how we function even in the basics.\\n\\nCW: Sort of pivoting off of that, you said that Senator Warren's taking sort of a 20th-century antitrust framework to big tech. What does a 21st-century framework look like in that?\\n\\nThe 21st-century framework. First, you don't use price as your primary determinant of whether or not there are antitrust problems, because the tech companies would say, What? We would never gouge anyone. It's free. We're underselling everyone. So that you have to get rid of, and that's not something she's advocating, but what she is advocating, which I find to be a bit backward looking, is thinking that competition is the answer in these spaces. And competition misses the point in one way and another way.\\n\\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation, like Mr. Yang, has argued that the country's approach to antitrust regulation is outmoded. In early 2019, the Federal Trade Commission created a new task force focused on monitoring competition in technology markets, which the foundation celebrated as a step toward modernizing antitrust.\\n\\nLet me explain. I'm a parent. I've got — how many of you all are parents? So if your kids are like my kids, they are mesmerized by any screen that is nearby. I regularly challenge my kids. I say, What's more important? People or screens? And they know the right answer's people. And then if they say screens, then I hold them upside down by their ankles until they say, People, people. And the people that are most diligent about screen time are the tech folks in Silicon Valley. You go there, and all of a sudden there's not a screen to be had because they know that we have the smartest engineers in the country turning supercomputers into dopamine delivery devices for kids, because that's how they make their millions of dollars.\\n\\nSo if that's your problem and you break Facebook into Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, does that somehow make the kids stronger or healthier? No. If anything, it actually ratchets up the incentives to try and further their engagement.\\n\\nSo if that's your problem, you have to go and try and solve it directly by getting into the guts of the apps and say, What are the design choices you made? Let's calibrate them so they actually balance our kids' health and not just your financial returns. So that's one way she's missing the point.\\n\\nThe other way is that many of these competitive markets end up very quickly accelerating toward one or two winners and saying, I'm going to break you up. Does not solve that problem. I joke that it would be cruel and unusual punishment to say you have to use the fourth-best navigation app. Like what is that? Apple Maps. We all hate Apple Maps, right? If you use that thing, you're like, Oh. You curse the gods until you figure out how to get Google Maps going. So going up and saying, Look, you're the winner in the space. We're going to break you up, it doesn't revive Main Street businesses, and it doesn't actually end up solving the competition problem.\\n\\nIf you want to solve the hyperacquisition problem, which is a problem, then you have to go in and say, Look, you have to not acquire businesses that are in your space with these criteria. That would be a legitimate stance to take, because right now the business model in Silicon Valley is not to try and outcompete the behemoth. It's just to get bought by them. If you get to a point where they'll offer you $1 billion and you win, your investors win, you're rich and then these get folded in, and it doesn't even matter what they do with your business at that point.\\n\\nOver the past five years, 90 percent of A.I. start-ups in Silicon Valley were acquired by major companies, according to TechCrunch.\\n\\nBA: You've expressed profound distrust of market forces. You just compared the major tech companies to drug dealers, and you want the N.S.A. to outsource national security work to them?\\n\\nI do not want the N.S.A. to outsource national security work to them. I want them to try and fight fire with fire and actually recruit using some of the same methods, and I want the N.S.A. to try and work with them to the extent that they're realistic, and they know that Google is going to be innovating in ways that the N.S.A. will not be able to do.\\n\\nCW: Going back though, my question is, there's an issue of power here. I mean, sure. You might not want to. You might not be able to address the problems of Facebook if you break it up from Instagram, and I understand that, and there's still going to be addictive products, but there's an issue of the consolidation of actual power, the ability to buy those companies, to make those acquisitions. Just simply the leverage that Mark Zuckerberg can use to have a meeting with Donald Trump that they won't tell us about, I mean, how do you — if you don't break them up, how do you get rid of that conglomeration of power?\\n\\nNF: I mean, is there still a role for 20th-century antitrust?\\n\\nYes. All of this is a prelude to say that, should some of the tech companies be asked to divest parts of their businesses? One hundred percent yes. Like Amazon should not be selling its own house brand to its advantage to other goods. These companies do have excessive power and influence. At this point you could argue they control our democracy.\\n\\nSo, and I know The New York Times, I mean you've had your issues with Facebook and the rest of it, and they made a change and then all sorts of things happen.\\n\\nListening to the tape, we have no idea what this means.\\n\\nSo, right now, the government is like this flopping appendage behind a lot of this stuff. I mean, honestly. The Office of Technology Assessment was eliminated in 1995. So our legislature is literally 24 years behind the curve on technology, and they don't understand. They're totally outgunned. They don't know what's going on.\\n\\nSo you definitely need to bring the tech companies to heel and say, Look, here are the list of problems we're concerned about. But the solution to the abuse of power is not to say like, Hey, we're just going to try and keep anyone in the country from having the ability to do wrong. What you have to do is you have to figure out what the abuses you're concerned about are, and then actually address them directly.\\n\\nCW: Who else besides you that you're running against understands the internet?\\n\\nI haven't hung out with enough of them to know, but I'm confident I understand the internet better than the [cross talk]——\\n\\nCW: What's your gut feeling? Who gets it?\\n\\nI'm going to say I do not have confidence that any of my opponents ge"}

{"original": "NEW DELHI — The most ubiquitous man in Bollywood is under tremendous pressure to utter three simple words: I am gay.\\n\\nIf these three words have acquired the force of absolution, it is because Karan Johar is by miles the most famous Indian ever to almost be openly gay. Since he burst onto the scene in the late 1990s, this 44-year-old director-producer has reached vast audiences with his movies. His name is a byword for family entertainment, his films by his own admission synonymous with popcorn, bubble gum and frivolity. All the stars are his friends, and the brightest of them appear on his immensely popular talk show Koffee With Karan. He has some 10 million followers on Twitter and almost three million on Instagram.\\n\\nAs a young protégé of his told me, He is Bollywood.\\n\\nAn ocean of innuendo has always surrounded Mr. Johar's sexuality. He has done more than anybody to introduce the idea of homosexuality into the Indian home. It would seem no closet door was better primed to spring open than his. And yet when he tries the latch, he finds it sticks. The only time I'm tight-lipped is when I'm asked about my sexuality, he writes in his recently published memoir, An Unsuitable Boy. It's the only part of me I feel I've caged.\\n\\nWhat makes Mr. Johar's case so much of a piece with this particular moment in India is that while he has been circumspect on his sexual orientation, he has, both in his life and his work, been breathtakingly explicit about sex: In 2013, he gave the Indian screen a smoldering gay kiss in Bombay Talkies; two years later, as roast master in a comic event that millions saw on YouTube, he joked before a live audience, with his mother present, of being the recipient of anal sex; in his new book, that same curious mixture of reticence and candor pervades. Mr. Johar will not use the male pronoun, but he writes openly and often movingly about everything from the pain of unreciprocated love to the aridity of having to pay for sex."}
{"original": "As the poet Bill Berkson once wrote, Martha Diamond, who is known for her indelible New York cityscapes rendered in thick, gestural brush strokes and bold, contrasting colors, builds edifices that bring citified chaos into focus as character, condensing the rush and stabilizing it as an emblem. Next week sees the opening of a new show, at Magenta Plains gallery on Manhattan's Lower East Side, that explores the depths of Diamond's affinity for these structures. Culled from pieces completed in the '80s, a pivotal decade for the artist that culminated in her work appearing in the 1989 Whitney Biennial, the six large-scale oil paintings to go on view share a palette of muted grays, midnight blues, glowing yellows and burnt scarlets — shades encountered on a lonely stroll at night, or thanks to a peek through the blinds after dark. (A number of preparatory studies on Masonite will also be on display.) Having lived and worked on the Bowery since 1969, Diamond indeed draws on scenes from her own walks through the city, depicting grids of buttery windows (as in Moonlight/City View #2, 1981) or stacks of green fence screens on identical balconies (Untitled 11, 1987). She also paints with her nondominant hand, which gives her canvases their intimate, figurative quality. They brood, slump and occasionally menace, and yet they're also solitary and anonymous — in other words, the works themselves are true city dwellers. More than a particular place, says Olivia Smith, the gallery's director, they represent a memory of something that we all recognize. For this New Yorker, whose city has felt all but unrecognizable these past 10 months, it's a welcomed remembrance. Martha Diamond: 1980-1989 is on view from Jan. 13 through Feb. 17 at Magenta Plains, 94 Allen Street, New York City, magentaplains.com."}

{"original": "Given the wide range of student experiences, I wasn't sure how the students would receive a course on women writers.

But I have come to reconsider that assumption. I need to be a feminist so I can do general world-saving, said one student, slightly joking about the world-saving but dead serious about the feminism.\\n\\nOver and over during the semester, I heard you, too? as students discovered points of connection that bridged their distinct cultural experiences. We all found common cause with Sor Juana, a 17th-century nun from what is now Mexico, who avoided marriage and motherhood by taking religious vows, thus freeing her to write and study. A student from Pakistan remarked wryly that Sor Juana had the right idea because once she became a nun, people probably stopped introducing her to eligible bachelors.\\n\\nIf you don't get married, asked a student from the Philippines, won't you have to move home and take care of your parents? That comment elicited murmurs of recognition and a discussion about the difficulties of resisting something we're told is natural, such as the assumption that women are always caregivers. None of these students come from a country known for progressive gender politics, which may be precisely why they see the value in a feminist perspective: It helps them think about what needs to be changed — and how. Without ignoring the specifics of their experiences, they found the commonalities in being told to be the neck, or to find a boyfriend, or to forgo graduate school.\\n\\nOccasionally during class, I would comment that it took courage to have conversations about, for instance, the role that religion played in shaping expectations for appropriate female behavior.

Vanity Fair called him a Little Lord Fauntleroy for his unapologetic willingness to enjoy his own good fortune and looks, and New York Magazine once referred to Mr. Brant and his older brother, Peter Brant II, as NYC's Most Beautiful Teenage Brothers; their social omnipresence seemed to invite a certain kind of hyperbole."}

He was also a strong defender of affirmative action programs and other measures to address historic discrimination.\\n\\nIn 1976, Mr. Jones helped persuade Alabama officials, including Gov. George C.

{"original": "Although they were equal partners in running the company and were aligned in what Mr. Black refers to as their core values — if you lead with kindness, he said, you're not going to kick someone in the shins afterward — they fell flat romantically. Despite couples therapy and intimate getaways, Ms. Griffin-Black said, it got to be too much and we realized we couldn't 'have it all' together. They divorced in 2007.\\n\\nHere's where things get interesting. For one thing, the couple's relationship continued to flourish after they split: As co-chief executives, they continued to spend every day in each other's presence, doing all of the things that married couples commit to: parenting, splitting finances, meaningfully communicating, confessing, forgiving, even occasionally touching. For another, and here's the really curious part, EO Products took off in unexpected ways. Whereas the usual story line would suggest that a divorce in such a situation would spell professional disaster — Michael Funk says that in his 40-something years he's rarely seen it work — EO not only survived the Blacks' very conscious uncoupling but gathered steam. The line expanded and popped up in retail stores like Walgreens, CVS, Walmart and Target without any compromises made to transparency about its ingredients. What I admire about EO is their commitment to using essential oils in spite of their being more expensive, Ms. Quimby of Burt's Bees said. They're willing to go for that level of quality.\\n\\n'We're a Package Deal at This Point'\\n\\nAs Brad and Susan led me on a walking tour of their offices, which they moved into in 2012 and, later on, their manufacturing facility, their rapport seemed warm and relaxed, both with their employees and each other. Their work space is an open floor plan, painted white, with skylights, windows and plants scattered about. No one has an office except for Mr. Black, Ms. Griffin-Black, and the head of human resources. The couple's own offices, across the hall from each other, are unprepossessing to the point of minimalism — equipped with a standing desk (for Ms. Griffin-Black) and a stool (for Mr. Black), couches and various personal items, such as travel photos and Buddhist memorabilia."}

{"original": "MY LAST LOVE STORY\\n\\nBy Falguni Kothari\\n\\n293 pp. Graydon House. Paper, $15.99.\\n\\nImage\\n\\nKothari's novel plays out a dark fantasy. The narrator, Simeen, has a husband who is terminally ill. When an old friend moves in with the couple to help out, a flame is rekindled between wife and friend. In the hands of another novelist, the husband's illness could function as a simple narrative device, moving him offstage at the convenient moment and allowing Simeen's romance with their friend, Zayaan, to proceed blamelessly. But Kothari takes the story in an unexpected direction, forcing her characters to contemplate the idea of sustained romantic commitment outside the boundaries of monogamous love instead.\\n\\nAt one point, Simeen wonders why it's unacceptable for three people to openly love each other. It's an interesting thought, one that poses a fresh conceptual question about marriage and love. But the power dynamics among the characters aren't sufficiently developed to dramatize that question convincingly. As for the status of her husband, Nirveen, in the triangle, Simeen says: He'd say, 'Jump.' We'd ask, 'How high?' He was dying. We were not. It was that simple. Was it? Such simplicity, even if plausible, forecloses on some of the complexity that could help bring the novel to life.\\n\\nOUR LADY OF THE PRAIRIE\\n\\nBy Thisbe Nissen\\n\\n357 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $25.\\n\\nImage\\n\\nWhile most marriage stories are concerned with the first flush of wedded life, Nissen's new novel, set during the 2004 Bush-Kerry election, skips straight to the end. From the moment I saw Lucius Bocelli, the first sentence reads, I wanted to go to bed with him. One problem: The narrator, 50-year-old Phillipa Maakestad, is already married. Since its origins, the novel has been a form well suited to adultery narratives, but despite Phillipa's insistence that she and Lucius are destined for each other — Lucius and I collided like a force of nature — their affair takes up relatively little space in the book and feels curiously secondary. In fact, the driving passion of this novel is not love or desire, but hatred: Phillipa's powerful loathing for her elderly mother-in-law, Bernadette.\\n\\nPhillipa is infuriated by the older woman's refusal to divulge anything about her early life or ancestry, speculating that she is a Nazi in hiding, living in fear of being ushered to the gallows at Nuremberg. Later, over the course of a 60-page dream sequence, she imagines Bernadette as a teenager in occupied France, subjected to graphic sexual brutality by a Nazi soldier. The novel can't seem to decide whether this episode is a parable or a revenge fantasy, revealing something that runs much deeper and darker than mere extramarital passion."}

Jesse Jackson was not qualified to be on a national ticket.\\n\\nI think it's too soon for us to have a black president, but even if it weren't, I don't think he should be it, she told Vanity Fair. He's sleazy. The nomination went to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, who lost to Vice President George Bush.\\n\\nSome of her politicking was of the shoe-leather, door-to-door variety. In Mr. Carter's 1976 campaign, she was part of the peanut brigade of volunteers that traveled to contested states. She did the same thing in later elections, including 2004, when she was 84, supporting Senator John Kerry's bid to unseat President George W. Bush. She opposed the tax breaks — a substantial one in her case — that Mr. Bush had given rich people like her.\\n\\nIt's tainted money, she said. I don't want it.\\n\\nIn a 2011 interview with Atlanta magazine, which noted that she had a cardboard cutout of President Barack Obama in her living room, she credited her father for her lifelong affiliation with the Democratic Party.

Baby Anne was born last winter.)\\n\\nAnne attended Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., spent a year in Paris and graduated from Finch College in Manhattan, which closed in 1976.

{"original": "That autism explodes the conventional American nuclear family narrative makes it irresistible as a metaphor for the stresses of life under late-stage capitalism. In Helen Schulman's A Day at the Beach (2007), a wealthy Manhattan couple navigate the worst day of their lives: the 9/11 disaster, which causes them to flee their swank downtown home (to the Hamptons) and strains their marriage — already at the breaking point owing to a son who shows clear signs of autism. In Gary Shteyngart's Lake Success (2018), a son's autism diagnosis similarly destroys an elite Manhattan family's dreams. The high-living protagonist leaves the scene of an altercation with his wife and nanny over his son and heads straight to the Greyhound station to start a picaresque journey to the other end of the country — a journey in search of an old girlfriend and, one surmises, an autism-less American dream.\\n\\nLike TB and cancer before it, autism can accumulate moral weight. In Louise Erdrich's Four Souls (2004), a white settler who has despoiled the Minnesota pine forests and cheated its Ojibwe inhabitants subsequently endures the immolation of his business empire as well as the birth of a son with vacant eyes, the very picture of idiocy, who makes hideous sounds and cannot be soothed out of his gross repetition. Here is the transfiguration of a neurobiological disease into one that lays waste to the mind, taking along with it all the qualities that make us human. In Lake Success, the protagonist eventually returns home to his son, and — just as Little Eva's beautiful tubercular fade in Uncle Tom's Cabin spurs her father to promise to free his slaves — in Shteyngart's novel, autism becomes a vehicle for the father's spiritual growth.\\n\\nI ask myself why using autism the way these books do feels wrong. As a child who was disappointed to find the only Asian characters in any book in the library to be the Japanese-American family in Farewell to Manzanar, I am acutely aware of the importance of feeling represented in literature. And yet, when it comes to autism appearing in literary fiction, I instinctively feel a need to protect my son from these portrayals. He's not an Ojibwe curse, a savant or an alien. Nor is he an emotionless cipher with no inner life.\\n\\nAs a writer, I understand the absurdity of trying to place restrictions on what can and can't be written about. Keats defined negative capability as an artist's ability to transmute an experience or idea into art even if she hasn't experienced it herself; without it, we'd have no historical fiction, no Madame Bovary, no Martian Chronicles.\\n\\nThe crux of the issue is that with autism there is often, not metaphorically but literally, a lack of voice, which renders the person a tabula rasa on which a writer can inscribe and project almost anything: Autism is a gift, a curse, super intelligence, mental retardation, mystical, repellent, morally edifying, a parent's worst nightmare. As a writer, I say go ahead and write what you want. As a parent, I find this terrifying, given the way neurotypical people project false motives and feelings onto the actions of others every day.\\n\\nWith this divided consciousness, I am endlessly appreciative of The Reason I Jump (2013), a book by Naoki Higashida, a Japanese man with autism who is nonverbal and beset by behaviors that would, by conventional standards, cause him to be labeled, like my son, low-functioning.\\n\\nHigashida's mother created a special alphabet grid that eventually allowed her son to communicate by pointing. While still a teenager, he wrote The Reason I Jump, describing what it feels like to have autism."}

{"original": "This week's issue is all about pleasure reading — from the history of sex toys to a roundup of romance novels. In 1947, Margaret Mead reviewed Sex in Our Changing World, by John McPartland, a blunt meditation on the history of sex in the United States.\\n\\nThe general thesis of the book is essentially sound, if heavily weighted on the seamy side. This book deals for the most part with wide social pathologies — the divorce rate, growing sexual inversion and prostitution rather than courtship, marriage and parenthood. Tackling these social pathologies, sometimes with a detail and frankness to which the American reader is only just accustomed, Mr. McPartland illustrates his main theme, that since World War I America has changed drastically from a sex-shy, inhibited people to a hedonistic, cynical people, openly in search of pleasure, and that our old ethics of home and family have rotted away, leaving nothing except a few sporting rules. There are vivid descriptions of the sordid divorce mills, and other institutions which exploit broken lives. But primarily this is not a source book, but a long ethical essay, with considerable gaiety, humor and a refreshing time perspective. ...\\n\\nThere have been carnal people before and they were the ancestors of most of us.\\n\\nOne of the most illuminating discussions in the book centers around the idea of adult orphans, individuals who have lost the capacity to exist as parts of that complementary human group which we call the family and who, if they marry, merely beget and rear other adult orphans. On a different level of social analysis and seriousness is the amusing chapter headed Love of Women, which discusses the way some mysterious occult agreement among women changes the styles in men (when the men aren't looking), so that the poor male who has just got himself finally organized to be a Raftish character given to black hats, dark looks and contempt for women finds that the style has shifted and women are giving the unpurchasable look to good-natured athletes, broad-shouldered and broad-minded.\\n\\nThe book ends by suggesting three alternatives for the future: an America which becomes increasingly degenerate, an America which becomes increasingly over-controlled with science assisting the state in keeping sex in its place, and a more endearing picture of an America which will profit by our new careless freedom, use our new understandings of the working of body and mind and will achieve a sexual code that will be free without being careless."}
{"original": "But others said it had become clear that for conservative Christians, the cultural and political issues that define modern conservative politics mattered at least as much as moral piety. That was why, they suggested, Mr. Bentley was able to cling to his job for nearly 13 months after his reputation as a paragon of probity came under fire.\\n\\nThe idea that moral hypocrisy hurts you among evangelical voters is not true, if you're sound on all of the fundamentals, said Wayne Flynt, an ordained Baptist minister and one of Alabama's pre-eminent historians. Being sound on the fundamentals depends on what the evangelical community has decided the fundamentals have become. At this time, what is fundamental is hating liberals, hating Obama, hating abortion and hating same-sex marriage.\\n\\nWhen Mr. Bentley ran for governor in 2010, Christian voters saw extraordinary promise in the obscure lawmaker from Tuscaloosa who liked to tell people about how Bear Bryant, the revered University of Alabama football coach, had been one of his patients. He seemed oddly ordinary, the politician who was thought to be tailor-made for a state increasingly frustrated by decades of corruption in Montgomery.\\n\\nPeople were looking for something that was more grandfatherly, something that was more wise and trustworthy and less politically slick, said Angi Stalnaker, who was Mr. Bentley's campaign manager. They wanted someone that they could see themselves having Sunday dinner with, and, of the candidates in 2010, Robert Bentley was the one you could see inviting over for fried chicken and cornbread.\\n\\nHe won that election, and then another in 2014.

Under the polished direction of Jonathan Bank, and in the hands of a fine team of designers, its arguments remain provocative, while its structure feels familiar, its tone decorous.

It's a bit like a sex farce with real sorrow instead of slammed doors, and something like a drawing room comedy with moral conundrums peeking out beneath the cushions. It is often very funny; it is also very nearly a tragedy.\\n\\nUltimately, the play's insistence on the sanctity of open marriage, a stance that apparently reflected Mr. Malleson's own beliefs and practices, isn't all that persuasive. If the central claim, that to live effectively you must walk the line between a great slope of complacence on one side and rather a mess-up of promiscuity on the other, sounds reasonably plausible in the moment, that is a credit to the dapper Mr. von Essen. Does the road to moral enlightenment and matrimonial contentment absolutely lead into the beds of selected others? Is there really no other way?

{"original": "Far from stirring up controversy, his paintings were coveted by the establishment. The second version of The Massacre of the Innocents was made for a grand official residence, the Prinsenhof. Another Prinsenhof commission resulted in The Marriage of Peleus and Thetis (1592-3), a mythological scene that covered an entire wall. These were the most prestigious assignments in the city, garnered by an artist not yet 30.\\n\\nEven more intriguing than the support of the civil authorities is the early patronage of Jacob Rauwaert, a rich Amsterdam collector and dealer more than thirty years Cornelis's senior, who had apprenticed with Maarten van Heemskerck, an originator of Knollenstil, before redirecting his energies from making art to buying and selling it. Rauwaert provided the financial underpinnings for the group of Italian-influenced artists that was later termed the Haarlem Academy. The eldest of the three artists at its core was Karel van Mander, a painter who came from Flanders in 1583, having previously spent three years in Rome. He made his mark in Haarlem as a critic and theorist. Goltzius, a draftsman of genius, won fame through his engravings. Cornelis was the ambitious and productive young painter with a gloriously theatrical bent.\\n\\nImage Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem's Two Male Nudes (circa 1590) at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. Credit... The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles.\\n\\nIn addition to The Fall of Lucifer, which, considering the execution time required, was probably commissioned, Rauwaert owned at least 15 paintings by Cornelis, including two other major canvases: Two Followers of Cadmus Devoured by a Dragon (1588) and Hercules and Achelous (1590). The Dragon — which occasioned a magnificent engraving based on its design by Goltzius, his first collaboration with Cornelis, dedicated to their patron — portrays the dreadful beast sinking its teeth into the face of one chap and its claws into the meaty, decapitated body of another. It doesn't look like he's being devoured, said Aaron Hyman, assistant professor of art history at Johns Hopkins University, when I remarked on the painting's sadistic relish. It's more like he's being tortured. In Rauwaert's third important Cornelis painting, Hercules and Achelous, the hero is seen grasping the horn of a river god that has taken the form of a bull.\\n\\nThese large paintings would have been displayed in the reception rooms of Rauwaert's grand Amsterdam house. What did visitors think about all these lovingly limned male limbs? Probably nothing at all. Like the art historians who followed them centuries later, they would have remarked only on the thematic content. When the American art historian Julie L. McGee published a pioneering biography of Cornelis in 1975, she saw in The Massacre of the Innocents simply the theme of religious persecution, timely for Protestant resistors (Cornelis himself was raised Catholic) to Spanish rule. Pieter Van Thiel, in the compendious Cornelis catalogue raisonné that was his life achievement, ignores any homoerotic content in the oeuvre and writes, risibly, that a tepid late painting provided evidence that he possessed more libido than he usually showed.

But they have also presented the state with an opportunity to radically overhaul the company prominently implicated in the fires, Pacific Gas & Electric.\\n\\nThe most powerful proponent of far-reaching changes, Gov. Gavin Newsom, is threatening a state takeover if the giant utility fails to reshape itself to his liking. With a key deadline approaching in PG&E's bankruptcy case, the question is whether he is prepared to follow through — and what consequences could follow.\\n\\nThe state is technically on the sidelines in the San Francisco bankruptcy proceeding where PG&E is pressing forward with its own restructuring plan. The company achieved a breakthrough recently in uniting shareholders and creditors behind the plan, which it says would satisfy the claims of wildfire victims as well.\\n\\nBut PG&E has to emerge from bankruptcy by June 30 — on terms acceptable to the governor — in order to take part in a new $20 billion state fund designed to shield large utilities from large wildfire claims. Without that protection, PG&E's restructuring plan would fall apart and its viability would be in question."}

With the Electric Circus, which he opened in 1967 on St. Marks Place in the East Village, it was psychedelia.

Perhaps his best-known debacle was Jobriath, a gay performer whom Mr. Brandt backed with a lavish promotional campaign in 1973 and '74, hoping to create an American version of David Bowie's androgynous Ziggy Stardust persona.

It pauses before turning any corner, anticipating horrors that never satisfyingly arrive.\\n\\nThe movie follows Katherine (Katherine Waterston), the wife of Stefan Delvoe (Michiel Huisman), a rising Belgian film star who died in an apparent suicide. Their marriage was a rocky one, shaken by revelations about Stefan's drug use and the possibility that he was unfaithful. It was Katherine who found Stefan's body with a bullet lodged in his temple.\\n\\nOne year after Stefan's death, Katherine returns to their home in Brussels. Her mother (Mary Kay Place) has suffered a minor stroke and is in need of medical care. In between her visits to the hospital, Katherine unpacks the mess Stefan left behind.

In this shadowy landscape, Katherine's numbed grief is indistinguishable from a high."}
{"original": "Hughes's book begins with the prehistoric substrata, delving with curiously gripping detail into layers of settlement archaeologists have only recently unearthed. She begins with the discovery of the world's oldest wooden coffin, under the Yenikapi metro station, containing an 8,000-year-old woman whose fellow villagers even left their footprints in the ancient mud. And so, right from the start, we are confronted with a vastly larger sense of time than that in which the city is usually conceived. Moreover, Hughes also establishes just how deep the Greek roots of the settlement called Byzantion went, and how heterogenous the Hellenic frontier town of the seventh century B.C. probably was. She has a fine feel for the complexities and shadings of that distant past.\\n\\nOne of the strangest and most haunting objects in 21st-century Istanbul is the twisted bronze monument called the Serpent Column, a fifth-century B.C. monument to the Greeks' victory over the Persians. Still standing inside the shattered remains of the hippodrome, broken and yet superbly elegant, it was commissioned by the Spartan general Pausanius and moved to its present location by Constantine himself in A.D. 324. One cannot help but feel, Hughes writes, that Pausanius would be secretly pleased to know that this monument — a rather etiolated creature now — is one of the few remaining classical antiquities to survive back in modern Istanbul in the public space next to the Blue Mosque, today a favorite lunch-break stop for tourists and young Istanbullus. It's like a root from a vanished forest that has accidentally survived.\\n\\nIn contrast, Fidler begins his story more conventionally, with the Romans and, to be more precise, with his son, Joe, in Rome's Capitoline Museum, admiring the colossal head of Constantine, the man who made Constantinople both the capital of the Roman Empire and a Christian metropolis. While Hughes's tone is both scholarly and rich in visual detail, Fidler entertains us with novelistic vignettes and cut-and-paste erudition, though he wobbles a little here and there. In a timeline that precedes the main narrative we are informed, for example, that the city was renamed Istanbul in 1453. In fact, the Ottomans kept the name Kostantiniyye in official usage until the dissolution of their empire in 1923, and the two names were used in parallel fashion by court officials. Istanbul, in any case, comes from the common Greek expression eis tin polin, into the city, and was a word used by both Turks and Greeks long before Mehmet's conquest. As always with this great hybrid city, the continuities have as much force as the momentous changes. That said, Fidler displays great charm in the telling of his tale, spicing it with delicious gossip.\\n\\nTake the story of Nicephoros II Phokas, the ruthless mid-10th-century emperor who turned the tide of Byzantine military fortunes with a series of brilliant victories against Arab armies, culminating in the reconquest of Cyprus and Aleppo. In the summer of 968, the Lombard bishop Luitprand of Cremona visited Constantinople to negotiate a marriage contract between the family of Nicephoros and the future Otto II, king of Italy. Tensions between East and West were running high. Nicephoros treated the bishop shabbily, and Luitprand returned the favor with some unfavorable immortalizations. He is a monstrosity of a man, Luitprand wrote, fat-headed and with tiny mole's eyes. A short, broad, thick beard disfigures him, half going gray and disgraced by a neck scarcely an inch long, which is pig-like by reason of the big close bristles on his beard. In color he is like an Ethiopian and, as the poet says, 'you would not want to meet him in the dark.'"}

Watch the Michigan Marching Band warm up. They've got mommas and daddies as proud as if they were Big Uglies opening holes for scatbacks. Listen to them belt out Hail! to the conq'ring heroes! and get chills like those that made Jackson shiver 40 years ago on his first trip here as the University of Washington's football announcer, a half-dozen years before he went big-time at ABC Sports.\\n\\nThis is no doubt my favorite place, to see four generations rise up and appreciate it, for the pageantry, the ambience, said Jackson, standing inside the stadium's broadcast booth before last Saturday's game against Penn State.

So to say that Everybody Loves Somebody is predictable is no real criticism, as being able to foresee the ending — almost from the beginning — is exactly what most viewers expect.\\n\\nOur messed-up heroine is Clara (Karla Souza, clearly delighted to escape the constraints of her lugubrious character on How to Get Away With Murder), an OB-GYN by day and a drunken karaoke singer by night. Fumbling hookups with random men temporarily banish her loneliness without extinguishing her torch for Daniel (José María Yazpik), the lover who abandoned her eight years earlier. Guess who shows up, though, to a family wedding to derail Clara's fledgling bond with a cuddly Australian co-worker (Ben O'Toole)? And guess whose clothing soon evaporates in the heat of Daniel's twinkling attention?\\n\\nToggling between Los Angeles and Mexico, English and Spanish, this sophomore feature by Catalina Aguilar Mastretta asks Clara to choose between naughty and nice. The setup is commonplace, but the scenery is delicious, the dialogue refreshingly tart and the keen supporting cast frisky or affecting, as the occasion demands.\\n\\nIndeed, the movie's most authentically romantic moment occurs not between Clara and her suitors, but between her sister and brother-in-law (Tiaré Scanda and K. C. Clyde), whose marriage might be showing some strain. In a single, brief conversation, they reveal more about the nature of long-term love than Clara will ever comprehend."}

Marguerite Abouet's six-volume Aya comics series, set in Ivory Coast in the 1970s (illustrated by Abouet's husband, Clément Oubrerie, and translated by Helge Dascher), follows the lives of its ambitious but dutiful namesake protagonist and her more freewheeling friends, Bintou and Adjoua. In Aya: Love in Yop City — which encompasses the last three chapters in the series — Aya, now a medical student, is sexually assaulted by her biology professor. The shame she feels in the wake of her attack shifts over the course of the book as she plans a fiery revenge.\\n\\nIn her illustrated story collection Boundless, Jillian Tamaki flips the script: To read the first and last of her kooky and elegant tales, you often must rotate the book 90 degrees.

Carmen Maria Machado's inventive, sexually exuberant debut, Her Body and Other Parties — which includes a novella-length section outlining 272 speculative, alternative views of Law & Order: SVU episodes — reveals characters with crystalline consciousnesses clouded by their fabulist circumstances. In Kōno Taeko's Toddler-Hunting and Other Stories (published in Japan throughout the 1960s and translated by Lucy North and Lucy Lower), it is the women themselves — alienated, but composed — who push past boundaries to enact lucid waking nightmares.\\n\\nThe Marriage Trap\\n\\nThe domestic bonds that doom the female characters in the classics of the Western feminist canon — from The Yellow Wallpaper, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, to Wide Sargasso Sea, by Jean Rhys — find echoes in two arresting novels by Asian writers. The Waiting Years, Fumiko Enchi's psychologically astute 1957 novel of stifled emotions, traces the protracted humiliation of Tomo, a 19th-century Japanese wife obliged to procure a series of mistresses for her husband over the course of their marriage.\\n\\nIn Han Kang's propulsive, lacerating novel The Vegetarian, translated from the Korean by Deborah Smith, the bloodless union between Yeong-hye, a hushed bookworm, and her largely indifferent husband ruptures when she ceases to be a carnivore. Stop eating meat, and the world will devour you whole, Yeong-hye's mother chides. And she's right: When Yeong-hye asserts her dietary will, characters around her react with violent rage."}

{"original": "By the numbers alone, New York City Ballet's Here/Now Festival is mind-blowing. Over the course of four weeks, the company is dancing 43 ballets by 22 choreographers. Even if that accounts for less than a quarter of the 230 works that more than 60 choreographers have made for the troupe since the death of its godlike founding choreographer, George Balanchine, in 1983, it's still an epic-size sample. No other ballet company in the world can approach these numbers.\\n\\nBut it isn't just scale. The numbers tell a story. Only eight works from the 1980s and '90s are being revived, in effect conceding that that era was, as it is now generally remembered, a gloomy mourning period of anxiety, short on pathbreaking inspiration. Five of those eight are by Peter Martins, who has led City Ballet since Balanchine's death, and who, despite considerable skill, didn't turn out to be his equal as a genius choreographer.\\n\\nIn the 35 works from the current century, there's another imbalance. Nineteen are by just three choreographers: Christopher Wheeldon, Alexei Ratmansky and Justin Peck."}

{"original": "Molina has been doing wonderful work in the series, and this week he has one of his best moments, when he is overcome by a sense of shared pride at seeing Joan Crawford surrounded by a crowd of fans after a preview of Baby Jane. It's extremely vulnerable work from him. He bursts with happiness for her. (Jessica Lange's stare back at him is an intense kaleidoscope of pride, gratitude and steely self-satisfaction.) Aldrich's career unhappiness post-Baby Jane is evident when we see him directing a bullying and uncooperative Frank Sinatra (Toby Huss) in 4 for Texas and trying to assuage the fears of Davis, who is baffled that the offers haven't been pouring in.\\n\\nThroughout, Aldrich has been supported by Pauline (Alison Wright, who plays Martha on The Americans), his right-hand lady (as she calls herself), script-reader and assistant, cheerleader and troubleshooter. In the second side arc in the episode, Pauline rises to the forefront, speaking the first line after the credits sequence when she compliments the editor on his seamless job piecing together the beach scene in Baby Jane. Pauline has a secret. She has written a script for Crawford and wants to direct it. In this risky pioneering pursuit, she recruits Crawford's right-hand lady, Mamacita, asking for advice on how to approach the star. Mamacita's reaction to such an unorthodox idea is unexpected, leading to a hugely entertaining scene in which she lectures Pauline on census information in the United States. Women will someday outnumber men, Mamacita informs an astonished Pauline, and Hollywood will have to respond by catering to that majority.\\n\\nThis is not just a timely topic but a timeless one. (Kathy Bates's Joan Blondell points this out in one of the show's 1978 interview segments: Any film starring women that makes money will be treated as a fluke by the Boys Club.) We're seeing a situation like that right now with Hidden Figures, the best picture nominee that is still in theaters months after it opened and has box-office receipts far exceeding those of X-Men: Apocalypse and Star Trek Beyond, according to a recent report by The Wrap. Will the success of Hidden Figures be treated as a fluke? Or will it spur a paradigm shift in terms of business decisions? Money talks. The Boys Club would do well to listen.\\n\\nWright is touching in her portrayal of a woman stepping out into the unknown. But Pauline hasn't yet played a large enough role in the series to warrant this much time, especially when there are such tantalizing glimpses of Bette and Joan, alternately freaking out and relishing the experience of being in a hit again. The script (by Tim Minear and Gina Welch) sometimes veers toward pandering in Pauline's scenes. (Pauline tells Mamacita that her own mother wasted her life in marriage and child rearing, and then adds, Not that there's anything wrong with domestic work.) The points made about women and power in Hollywood are important ones, but they are more effective circling in the electrically charged orbit of Davis-Crawford.\\n\\nIn their separate spheres, Davis and Crawford deal with the success of Baby Jane very differently. In real life, Davis did tons of publicity for the film (Sarandon re-creates Davis's appearance on the Andy Williams Show when, in a flowing, sky-blue dress, she sings a funky pop song called Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?). Crawford did very little publicity, despite Warner's warnings that this could hurt her come Oscars season. The reviews of Baby Jane focus mainly on Davis, causing Joan to toss down a newspaper in fury: It's like I wasn't even in the damn thing!"}

As the dew dispels, the mist dissolves, and the sap rises on a morning such as the one that did not quite win over Beckett, the force of life is unmistakable. That is what put us here in the first place.\\n\\nGreat souls resemble the elements in their immensity. They absorb everything — pain, injustice, insult, folly — and give back decency and kindness. They are not born of a piece. They come into being through unflinching confrontation with life's spears. They reach quiet. Discipline is the backbone of graciousness. Stoicism is the other face of wounds. In the most beautiful smile, painful knowledge hovers.\\n\\nMidwinter is not what prompted these reflections, although when a freezing wind whips off the East River all thoughts turn to refuge. No, the death in quick succession of two friends was the catalyst. They were older than me. But they were not old enough and not so distant in age that their memento mori feel less than urgent."}

{"original": "CHAPTER ONE\\n\\nCatholic Converts\\n\\nBritish and American Intellectuals Turn to Rome\\n\\n\\n\\nBy PATRICK ALLITT\\n\\n\\n\\nCornell University Press\\n\\nRead the Review\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nIntellectuals Becoming Catholics\\n\\nFROM THE MID-NINETEENTH century to the mid-twentieth, a succession of English-speaking intellectuals converted to Catholicism. Since the Reformation almost no English-language writers of any influence had tried to advance the cause of the Catholic Church. When the church began to reassert itself in the nineteenth century, it used converts as its principal advocates. Outspoken, intellectually gifted, and impressed by their own example, Catholic converts said that they would show up the fallacies of Protestants and religious skeptics, end the long schism in Christendom, and place Catholics once more at the center of Western intellectual life.\\n\\nSome of the names of these convert intellectuals are widely familiar, and among them John Henry Newman, G. K. Chesterton, Isaac Hecker, Orestes Brownson, Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh, Thomas Merton, and Dorothy Day have all been the subject of more than one major biography. Around Newman, Day, and Merton, indeed, academic subfields have formed, and the existence of the Chesterton Review suggests that the memory of this prolific Londoner is also well tended. But no one has yet written a study of the general impact of converts on Catholic intellectual life in this era or the distinctive style of Catholicism they helped to create. Nor has anyone investigated the extensive transatlantic contacts among these English-speaking Catholic writers. Such is the purpose of this book.\\n\\nMany of their contemporaries regarded the idea of a Catholic intellectual as a contradiction in terms, believing that the repressive Roman church prohibited freedom of thought. The converts were eager to prove otherwise; their work in history, science, literature, and philosophy was designed to substantiate their belief that Catholicism was intellectually liberating rather than restrictive, despite the church's dogmatic style and hierarchical structure. They wrote partly for a Catholic audience, to be sure, but more for their Protestant and skeptical contemporaries, hoping to vindicate their own conversions by persuading others to follow them. To win more converts they knew that they would have to improve intellectual standards within Catholicism. History written in the form of pious hagiography and retrospective justification of every Catholic position, for example, would never convince Protestants and skeptics; it was annoying rather than persuasive to all but the most devout believer. Catholic history would henceforth have to be deeply researched, impartial in evaluating evidence, stylistically elegant, and vigorously argued. The same would have to be true in all other disciplines too. In urging such changes and in trying to set an example in their own work, however, convert intellectuals did not mean to abandon apologetics. Rather, they introduced a more circumspect apologetics, calculated to attract other intellectuals by appealing to them in their own idiom.\\n\\nSharing a common language and literary heritage, the British and American Catholic converts followed each other's progress closely. In both countries Catholics were a numerical minority, more or less resented by the Protestant majority and sometimes victimized by anti-Catholic uprisings, anti-Catholic political organizations such as the Know-Nothings, and a general cultural antipathy to all aspects of popery. Because Catholicism was a minority religion in the English-speaking nations, its adherents tended to cleave to one another and to respect their clergy. Anticlericalism, a fact of life in Italy, France, and Mexico, was very rare in Britain and America, although English-speaking Catholics had good reason to think that the Catholic hierarchy in Rome did not understand the situation in their nations. They sometimes found it vexing to act upon Vatican directives that had no relevance to their situation. Convert intellectuals responded to their shared problems by encouraging and aiding one another. A regular traffic developed as they crossed and recrossed the Atlantic to confer, teach, and spread the word in each other's nations.\\n\\nAs they tried to make a place for themselves in the Catholic Church and a case for this church in the wider intellectual world, the first generation of converts found little Catholic literature in English on which to build. They had to start almost from scratch in trying to show what Catholic science or Catholic history as serious intellectual enterprises would be like. We Catholics have no philosophy, wrote John Acton, an English cradle Catholic, in a letter of 1854 to the American convert writer Orestes Brownson. You alone can prepare us for the great controversies by founding among us a school and arming it with the principles of a sound philosophy. For Brownson and his fellow converts Catholicism was something quite new, but at the same time they were aware that it was far more ancient than its Christian rivals and that they had inherited a vast intellectual patrimony. They set to work, exploring and reinterpreting the Catholic past, trying to recover it from the obloquy of Protestant historiography as well as from the syrup of Catholic hagiography.\\n\\nThis paradoxical antiquity and novelty of Catholicism was complemented by another paradox: the converts' sense that Catholicism was both different from their former faiths and yet also very similar. They accepted their new faith as adults, having spent their youth and years of education outside the Catholic fold. In many cases a long intellectual preparation for conversion took place within other churches. The best-known British convert, John Henry Newman, for example, converted from Anglicanism at the age of forty-four after more than two decades of study and writing in Patristics. For many years he believed that the church Fathers were the precursors of Anglicanism, but at last in 1845, he admitted to himself that if they pointed in any direction, it was to Rome. Conversion changed his explicit allegiance and had immense consequences for the course of his life, but it did not overturn his pattern of thinking. The continuities in his thought before and after conversion are in many ways more striking than the discontinuities. The same was true a generation later of G. K. Chesterton, who converted at the age of forty-six. His book Orthodoxy (1908), written while he was still an Anglican, became a favorite among his Catholic admirers, who in this way acknowledged the continuity. Intellectually, then, conversion was often incremental, but institutionally (as well as perceptually, to outside observers), the jump was immense, from the establishment into the wilderness. The Catholic Church saw itself as embattled against the rest of the world and tried to recruit its converts as polemicists, but they, more often than not, retained heavy intellectual debts to their Protestant past and could not repudiate their personal and intellectual heritage. Paradoxically, then, Catholicism was both totally different from its rivals and yet, at the same time, remarkably continuous with them. It was a paradox that frequently caused friction between the new and old Catholics.\\n\\nThe outcome of the convert intellectuals' labors was not what they themselves had hoped. Although for three or four generations they were highly influential within the Catholic Church, playing a crucial role in transforming English-language Catholicism, they were powerless to halt or reverse the dominant intellectual trends of their era. The church was certainly unable to resume the central place in Western intellectual life which it had enjoyed prior to the Reformation. While the new Catholics challenged non-Catholic scholars on the vital issues of the era, the non-Catholics rarely deigned even to notice them in return and made little effort to incorporate their insights into their work. For example, William George Ward, a friend of Newman's and a fiery controversialist, converted in 1845 and later became editor of the Dublin Review, one of the leading British Catholic journals. His biographer (and son) describes at length Ward's fifteen-year correspondence with John Stuart Mill, giving the impression that Ward had a large effect on the utilitarian philosopher's outlook. But no biographer of Mill has found evidence of this supposed influence, and it is likely that the Wards indulged in wishful thinking when they came to assess the importance of the correspondence to Mill's own life and work.\\n\\nThe flow of conversions in Britain and America between the mid-1840s and the late 1950s was sufficient to indicate the continuing allure of Catholicism, but it was hardly large enough to throw non-Catholic intellectuals into a panic. Although Newman was widely admired and stimulated other members of the Oxford Movement to follow his example, he was unable to lead his own brother into the Catholic fold, and most of his erstwhile followers, including the other movement leaders, Nathan Pusey and John Keble, remained staunch Anglicans. As in Britain, so in the United States. Orestes Brownson, a member of the Transcendentalist circle, carried his family and a few friends into the embrace of Rome in 1844 but not his twin or his other siblings. Most of his New England cronies, accustomed to Brownson's frequent changes of opinion, treated him as a mercurial spirit who had finally stepped off the edge of the world rather than as a role model. Among them, only Isaac Hecker and the group who later founded the Paulist fathers went with Brownson to Rome.\\n\\nAt times events in other churches could prompt a new spate of conversions. In the early 1890s, for example, a group of High Church Anglicans led by Lord Halifax raised the question of corporate reunion, the collective readmission of the Church of England into the Catholic Church. Hopes ran high among Anglo-Catholics for a time, but in 1896 Pope Leo XIII made a categorical declaration in the papal bull Apostolicae Curae that Anglican orders were invalid and that, in effect, there was nothing to discuss. In reaction a cluster of Anglican clergymen who had seen themselves as members of the worldwide Catholic communion and had been hoping for a different answer, resigned from their livings and converted to Catholicism. A push came for American Episcopal priests in 1908 when their church decided to inaugurate an open pulpits policy, permitting all varieties of Protestant ministers to preach in Episcopal churches. American Episcopalians who saw themselves as Anglo-Catholics revolted at the prospect, and here too the result was a large handful of conversions.\\n\\nThere were, however, plenty of good reasons for not converting. Quite apart from the religious wrench of conversion, becoming a Catholic in Britain or the United States often prompted accusations of disloyalty to the nation, its Protestant heritage, even its sense of common decency. When Thomas Arnold (Matthew Arnold's brother) converted, his wife wrote a furious letter to Newman, accusing him of persuading her husband to ignore every social duty and become a pervert. She added, From the bottom of my heart I curse you for it. In 1848 the poet Christina Rossetti refused an offer of marriage from a young artist, James Collinson, because he had converted. She accepted him when he reverted to Anglicanism but canceled their wedding plans when he went over to Rome for a second time. Collinson's parents disowned him, and he was reduced to begging from his friends in the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.\\n\\nConversion usually entailed a jolting loss of social status. George Tyrrell, a young Anglican from a poor but genteel Irish family, was intellectually convinced by Catholic arguments, but his biographer notes, he recoiled from `the dirt and tinsel, and flashy gew gaws' in the Catholic chapels, from the `essential commonness' of Romanism, and when he overcame his distaste and announced his conversion to his parents, what pained his mother was `that a son of mine should go to Mass with the cook.' Moreover, as David Newsome writes, the convert became, as it were, an exile in his own land.... In addition to the humiliation of social ostracism, the pain of severed friendships and the torment of past memories, there was the inescapable problem of beginning life again within an alien community, while recognizing that all one's past distinctions and achievements counted for nothing. It is difficult to find any example of an intellectual who derived either social or monetary gain from conversion. For many, on the contrary, the material and prestige losses were considerable. The many Anglican and Episcopalian priests who converted were especially hard hit. Being, in many cases, married, they were ineligible to join the Catholic priesthood and so faced an economically precarious future. One such married clergyman, T. W. Allies, reported extreme depression of spirits due to the utter destitution of my temporal fortunes. He longed to produce some work for the glory of God but was condemned to the most anxious thoughts as to what I shall eat and what I shall drink, wherewithal I shall be clothed, I and mine, and to the drudgery of teaching dunces. Such cases strongly suggest that the motive for conversion was genuine religious conviction. There are few plausible ulterior motives to explain it, though it may be true that certain character types were more receptive to the demands of Catholic life than others.\\n\\nThe converts' position was doubly difficult because the Catholic Church received them with mixed feelings, an uneasy blend of gratitude and disdain. Catholic bishops were understandably glad that brilliant and influential men and women had decided that Rome represented the one true church, and delighted to learn that they were willing to put their skills at the service of Catholicism. But the bishops soon discovered that converts, intellectually adventurous and unused to clerical censorship, were likely to take speculative excursions that challenged orthodoxy rather than fortifying it. One part of the history of these converts is, accordingly, the story of conflicts with their bishops over what was or was not intellectually permissible. Newman, whose superiors often viewed him with suspicion for his ideas on the development of doctrine, the role of the laity, and the nature of religious certainty, once told Lord Acton that in the hierarchy's view all converts are dangerous. His fellow Oxford convert Richard Simpson, coeditor of the Rambler, the leading liberal Catholic journal of the mid-nineteenth century, had a long succession of conflicts with the hierarchy, which threatened to close the journal down as a hazard to the religion of the faithful. Isaac Hecker, the American Transcendentalist and Brook Farm communard who converted in 1844, also ran into official disapproval when his book Aspirations of Nature (1857) appeared to maintain that by nature human beings were good, minimizing the power of original sin, and hence the need for grace, well beyond what his superiors found admissible.\\n\\nOn the other hand, another group of converts, the Ultramontanes, became such fervent Romanizers that they dismayed the pragmatic Old Catholics of England. Henry Manning and William George Ward, for example, two Oxford converts, were among the leaders of the movement to declare the pope infallible on questions of faith and morals at the First Vatican Council (1869-1870) and some of the most passionate defenders of the pope's temporal power, which was threatened by the unification of Italy. These converts' views dismayed English Old Catholics who, over three centuries or more, had gradually adapted their faith to indigenous conditions. The converts were, then, anything but unanimous among themselves but tended toward radical or extreme positions in one direction or another, arousing resentment from their new coreligionists in either instance.\\n\\nThe later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries showed unmistakably that the Catholic Church had decided to climb out of the river of contemporary intellectual life rather than swim along in midstream, despite the hopes of Newman, Brownson, Hecker, and many other converts. The papal hammer fell frequently on efforts to modernize Catholic thinking, an enterprise in which converts were often closely involved. For example, Pope Pius IX (1846-1878) issued the Syllabus of Errors in 1864, condemning many of the principles upon which contemporary scientists, social scientists, and biblical critics outside the Catholic Church were then working. It concluded by condemning the proposition that the Roman Pontiff can and ought to reconcile himself to, and come to terms with, progress, liberalism, and modern civilization. The condemnation brought the work of several convert intellectuals under scrutiny, and it discouraged them from showing the consonance of their work with contemporary philosophy and science. Among the converts affected was the English evolutionary biologist St. George Mivart, who was ultimately excommunicated for his assertion that the Catholic doctrine of hell was untenable. The seemingly antiintellectual animus of the syllabus also disillusioned some converts, among them Thomas Arnold, who reverted to Anglicanism when he learned of it.\\n\\nSix years later Pius IX organized the declaration of papal infallibility at the First Vatican Council (1870), declining to countenance historical evidence (provided by Newman, among others) which showed that papal supremacy itself, let alone papal infallibility, was based on several centuries of development out of an early church that had been constituted quite differently. Papal infallibility, whatever its other consequences, represented a disastrous reversal for Catholic historians, who had dedicated themselves to close analysis of the early church. The pontificate of Leo XIII (1878-1903) promised them some relief, but his encyclical letter Aeterni Patris (1879) aimed to revive scholasticism, keeping new philosophical and historical approaches at arm's length. Its successor, Providentissimus Deus (1893), set sharp limits on Catholic participation in historical-critical study of the Bible.\\n\\nA third abrupt check for adventurous Catholic intellectuals came in 1907 when Pope Pius X's decree Lamentabili (1907) and the encyclical Pascendi (1907) sweepingly condemned modernism in theology; in response, one English convert, George Tyrrell, S.J., courted excommunication. In the following years seminaries and Catholic colleges in Britain and America were purged of all traces of modernism. Outsiders regarded these episodes as further evidence that Catholic intellectuals were hamstrung by intrusive, censorious, and often ignorant authorities. This was the age in which Andrew Dickson White, first president of Cornell University, wrote his influential History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom (1896), casting the scientists as truth-loving heroes through the ages and the Catholic Church as an antiintellectual villain trying to squeeze the life out of them. White made enormous capital out of the famous Galileo case and treated it as typical of Catholicism at all times. Converts who remained committed to contemporary intellectual principles found themselves walking a tightrope between the guardians of orthodoxy on their right and their former friends and colleagues to their left.\\n\\nIt should not be supposed that intellectual converts to Catholicism were reliably more liberal in their outlook than born Catholics. The convert who is more punctilious in his new faith than the lifelong communicant is a familiar figure in Catholic lore, and the nineteenth and twentieth centuries provided plentiful examples of such characters. The most notable was Henry Manning, the Anglican archdeacon of Chichester, who converted in 1851 and rose in the next fifteen years to leadership of England's Catholic community, becoming archbishop of Westminster in 1865 (cardinal from 1875). Manning supported papal infallibility, as did Newman's former Oxford colleagues William George Ward and Frederick Faber, and the American convert Augustine Hewit. Subsequent Catholic historians, most of them opposed to the Ultramontane position, have given Manning in particular a bad press and found Newman's antiinfallibilist views much more palatable. But we should remember that to Manning Ultramontanism seemed to be the most liberating position. Like many of the converts, he hated the subordination of the Church of England to the civil state; indeed, he left it in protest over the Gorham case of 1851, in which the state overruled an Anglican bishop and installed as parish priest a man he considered a heretic. Setting up the papacy as a powerful counterweight to the state seemed to Ultramontanists the surest way of assuring themselves of religious and intellectual freedom. Even Isaac Hecker, who had misgivings about infallibility during the Vatican Council, accepted it later as an assertion of the external dignity of the church, which could now be ideally complemented by a full development of its internal or intellectual life.\\n\\nUltramontanists placed their faith in Thomism. In an effort to assure intellectual coherence between disciplines and a foundation for all studies in theology, the popes who reigned in the second half of the nineteenth century placed a renewed emphasis on the work of Thomas Aquinas and his scholastic successors. Scholasticism and natural law theory have many strengths, among them an orderly rationalism and a conceptual framework into which every discrete item of information can be fitted, showing its connection to the whole and to the divine will from which it springs. But scholastic philosophy and natural law encountered a succession of powerful challengers in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, including pragmatism, vitalism, existentialism, and logical positivism, each of which debunked scholasticism's claims to intellectual respectability. Similarly, in the physical sciences and in the study of history, the developing academic orthodoxy in Britain and America, strongly empirical and increasingly based on evolutionary, probabilist, and materialist assumptions, was at variance with the scholastic framework, which, while granting science some autonomy, linked worldly phenomena to their supernatural origins. The scholastic criticism of materialism and positivism was not so much refuted as blithely ignored by most of the scientists. Protestant conservatives were also polemicizing against the new secular sciences, but for religious and traditional reasons, Catholic and Protestant objectors to secular scholarship were unable to make common cause. Meanwhile, the development of a Catholic ghetto, especially in the United States, with its own set of self-segregating schools, colleges, and journals, made ignoring the Catholics easier than if they had been forcing their attention upon their antagonists from adjoining offices. Non-Catholics rarely investigated the work of intellectuals in the Catholic Church unless they were searching for polemical ammunition.\\n\\nAfter Vatican I, and especially after Pascendi, English and American convert intellectuals tended to stay away from strictly theological questions altogether and work in the safer realms of literature, history, and the social sciences. Like their nineteenth-century predecessors, however, they too aimed to draw more converts into the faith that had won them. A succession of British converts, including Hugh Benson, Ronald Knox, G. K. Chesterton, and others, tried to dazzle their readers with wit, erudition, and ostentatious orthodoxy. Even so the experience of their earlier lives made their view of the outside world different from that of born Catholics and enabled them to make distinctions that sometimes escaped their born-Catholic fellows. These converts usually had relatives still outside the church; their own education outside Catholicism had formed their minds; and they found it difficult to demonize a non-Catholic society with which they were still intimately connected. Their chief line of attack was to criticize the premises of non-Catholic philosophy and science, to demonstrate its epistemological vulnerability, and to expose its links to a callow idealization of progress, sometimes with wry admissions that they too had once been deceived by its charms. They also brought their Catholic insight to bear on the political changes of their era, arguing that without the guidance of faith the world was out of control. The First World War gave their critique of progress a new plausibility.\\n\\nThe train of conversions continued during and after the war. Men and women disabused of their faith in progress as a force immanent in history found consolation in Catholicism. In the interwar years a distinguished group of British novelists converted to Catholicism, including Compton Mackenzie, Graham Greene, and Evelyn Waugh, and began to make lasting contributions to the canon of English literature. In the 1850s Newman had lamented that the great classics of English literature were Protestant to the core and that English was in effect a Protestant language. Now for the first time since the Reformation, English literature enjoyed a significant Catholic leavening. Convert writers took turns touring the United States, teaching at Georgetown, Fordham, and Notre Dame and trying to encourage a Catholic literary revival across the sea. They were joined by another group of gifted and prolific controversialists, including Shane Leslie, Arnold Lunn, and Christopher Hollis, who took up the mantle of Chesterton and tried to carry on his message that Catholicism was synonymous with urbanity, erudition, and wit. Aptly enough, the first holder of the Stillman Chair in Catholic Studies at Harvard Divinity School was the English convert Christopher Dawson.\\n\\nA new generation of converts in the United States joined the Catholic Church in the interwar years. The best known, Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton, each gradually won a wide and sympathetic audience in the non-Catholic world, eventually becoming spiritual celebrities. Less celebrated but equally important, a succession of converts from the ranks of academia--among them the historians Carlton Hayes, Ross Hoffman, and Elizabeth Kite, and the sociologist Eva Ross--brought a measure of intellectual respectability to Catholic education. This generation of converts was made up of white Anglo-Saxon Protestants. They had enjoyed an education in the leading American graduate schools--Hayes at Columbia and Hoffman at the University of Pennsylvania, for example--and they felt none of the immigrant insecurities and defensive belligerence still common among their ethnically assimilating Catholic contemporaries. They were as much a part of the American establishment as the convert sons of English Anglican bishops were part of the British establishment. They brought to Catholic academic life a new sense of ease and possession. Demonstrating a high level of technical skill in their disciplines, they began to win more sympathetic attention from non-Catholic academics. They also ran graduate programs, training young cradle Catholics to high standards, with the eventual effect of reducing the prominence of converts. Many non-Catholics found their critique of science and their philosophical antitotalitarianism germane to the total war of the 1940s and the Cold War of the 1950s. But whereas Brownson could rely only on himself and other converts, convert scholars a century later worked alongside born Catholics such as the Jesuit luminaries John Courtney Murray and Walter Ong.\\n\\nBy the 1950s some converts had persuaded themselves that their highbrow evangelizing effort was gaining ever more ground and that a demoralized secularist enemy was on the verge of capitulation, ready to throw itself into the arms of the pope. Not for the first time they were indulging in wishful thinking. Even as they made their hopeful prophecies, the long Catholic rear guard against modernity began to collapse from within. Catholic academics, priests and laity alike, began to question the adequacy of a scholastic and natural law approach to all issues. The church reformed itself at the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), abandoning its intransigence toward the outside world and looking with a new sympathy both on the Catholic innovations of recent decades and on the non-Catholic branches of Christianity. It belatedly opened itself to scientific and philosophical systems that for a century it had repudiated, and at the same time it surrendered some of the characteristics that had made its outlook distinctive. By the 1970s many of the special qualities of Catholic scholarship were disappearing, or else were confined to the angry handful of traditionalists who refused to forsake the ways of a lifetime. Ironically some of the intransigents were intellectuals who had converted to get away from modernism in its many guises, only to find that their church too was now negotiating with modernist teachings on all sides. It only compounded the irony that converts had done much to pave the way for these changes. They had insisted on higher standards and more rigorous research, had declined to demonize the outside world, but had never meant to break down the fortress walls of what was to them the one, true Catholic faith.\\n\\nIn the first flush of success, Catholic intellectuals who had been pressing for reforms--an end to censorship and the exclusive reliance on sholasticism--celebrated victory over the bad old days. Enough time has now passed since the Second Vatican Council that we can evaluate the rights and wrongs of this history in a new way, temper the exuberance of the modernizers, and pay at least a guarded tribute to the convert intellectuals and their work. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the Promethean self-confidence of the new sciences had seemed likely to sweep everything before it. Darwinism and the principle of evolutionary development had been applied widely to other phenomena and appeared irresistibly compelling to several generations of scientists, historians, philosophers, and social scientists. Evolutionists had scornfully dismissed the fixed principles and the unchanging universe of scholasticism and regarded it as easy to refute, if they bothered to look at it at all. Marxism, another developmental theory, which enjoyed its greatest vogue in the English-speaking countries between about 1890 and 1950, was no less scornful of Catholic thought, treating it either as an opiate for the oppressed or as the instrument of domination which a master class wielded against its subordinates. By now, however, these rival orthodoxies have, in their turn, worn thin. Evolution is still a central theory in biology but hardly in economics, anthropology, political science, or psychology, where it once ruled imperiously. From evolution sprang eugenics, the science of population manipulation, whose horrific face Hitler displayed to the world. In the same way marxism, for complex political and intellectual reasons, lost its allure; its predictions were falsified, its scientific pretensions exposed as a sham, and it too became closely linked with a brutal tyrant, Stalin, whose career in scientific politics was almost enough to give political science itself a bad name. The failure of the alternatives does not, in itself, demonstrate the correctness of the Catholic faith, to be sure, but it lends credence to the Catholic opposition to marxism and eugenics. It seems now that dogmatic Catholics enjoyed an insulation against some of the utopian currents that swept the Western nations in the first half of this century. It would be rash today to say that Catholicism was wrong when its adversaries were right. Our age, more jaded and skeptical in the face of successive disappointments, can pay it at least backhanded compliments, acknowledge its strengths as well as its weaknesses, and recognize that it provided the standpoint from which to make a telling critique of its secular rivals.\\n\\nA project of this kind, covering more than a century and two nations (with frequent glances at Ireland, Germany, France, Spain, Canada, and Italy), is obliged to move rapidly or become impossibly long. My approach is to single out the most influential figures from each generation and explain their work, rather than attempt to give a comprehensive account of all convert writers, though at times I have tried to rescue from obscurity characters who seem to me to deserve more fame than history has granted them, including Richard Simpson (Chapter 4), Elizabeth Kite (Chapter 7), and Bertram Windle (Chapter 8). Influence is, of course, an elusive phenomenon, not really amenable to accurate measurement. Such figures as Newman, Brownson, Hecker, Dawson, and Chesterton get comparatively thorough treatment not because they are typical of anything but because of their exceptional qualities; few of their fellow converts could rival them for insight or write so much and so well. In general I aim to demonstrate qualitative rather than quantitative changes throughout, arguing that the converts, who were never more than 2 or 3 percent of the Catholic population in either nation, were disproportionately represented in the ranks of Catholic writers, lecturers, editors, and professors, that their ideas often set the agenda for other Catholic intellectuals working within the tradition, and that non-Catholics looked to the more persuasive convert writers when they wanted to find the Catholic position on a controversial issue.\\n\\nAnother elusive yet important issue for a project of this kind is the question of the relationship between truth and intellectual respectability. The convert intellectuals were aware, in many cases, that what they believed to be true was not regarded by non-Catholics as plausible or reasonable or, indeed, respectable. On some points both groups could agree, of course, and the convert writers' intention was to make a closer fit between Catholic truth and intellectual respectability. At any given moment in the era from about 1825 to 1962, Catholic intellectuals knew that a range of ideas was considered respectable in the two nations. They also knew that some Catholic ideas sat comfortably inside this area and others remained well beyond its boundaries. Their job, as they saw it, was to drag the recalcitrant Catholics into the realm of the respectable, while trying to shift the zone of respectable ideas in the society at large, in order that Catholic truth and respectable ideas might coincide more fully. They wanted to convince Protestant and atheist contemporaries that much of their work was in error or based on fallacious premises, encouraging them to become more Catholic and more intellectually respectable.\\n\\nBut the general trend bore the range of intellectually respectable ideas steadily away from religion in general and Catholicism in particular. This trend, often labeled secularization, appeared for decades to be unstoppable, so that many convert intellectuals, far from reversing its momentum, found their own views gradually moving outside the realm of what other intellectuals considered plausible. The consequence was marginalization, and convert intellectuals in general lost influence with the passing decades, so that none in the twentieth century could have an effect on his or her non-Catholic contemporaries to match that of Newman and Brownson in the mid-nineteenth. Certain writers, such as Chesterton or Christopher Dawson, could still find admirers, but neither created a major school of thought, and non-Catholic admirers saw their religion as a colorful aberration rather than a central element in their work. In that sense this book is the history of a momentous and protracted failure.\\n\\n(C) 1997 Cornell University All rights reserved. ISBN: 0-8014-2996-X"}

No creo que hayamos tenido el aprecio emocional que necesitamos y merecemos por el tipo de año que mucha gente ha tenido, dijo McGonigal. La reflexión que se necesita es una mirada real, honesta y autocompasiva sobre lo que se ha perdido, quién se ha perdido y qué es lo que se quiere elegir para recordar el año 2020. La reflexión es una manera de estar listo para avanzar hacia el nuevo año.

Es demasiado fácil buscar un comportamiento por el que te criticas regularmente o por el que te sientes culpable, dijo McGonigal. Es esa falsa promesa del tipo: 'Si cambias esto, cambiarás todo'.\\n\\nLos estudios muestran que una de las mejores maneras de cambiar el comportamiento y formar un nuevo hábito es unirlo con un comportamiento existente, lo que en la ciencia de la formación de hábitos se llama acumulación. Es la razón por la que los médicos, por ejemplo, sugieren tomar un nuevo medicamento al mismo tiempo que nos cepillamos los dientes o tomamos café por la mañana: es más probable que recuerdes tomar tu píldora cuando la unes a un hábito existente. Añadir pasos a tu recorrido diario es a menudo una mejor manera de añadir ejercicio a tu día que tratar de establecer un tiempo separado para una caminata diaria.\\n\\nReflexionando sobre las lecciones del año pasado, podemos apilar y construir con base en los buenos hábitos que empezamos en 2020.

Stone\\n\\nIllustrated. 668 pp. Liveright Publishing. $35.\\n\\nEverybody knows that the easiest way to boost the sales of a book is to put a particular familiar word in its title. That word, of course, is Constitution. Geoffrey R. Stone is a professor and former dean at the University of Chicago, and his title is a bit of a tease. There is virtually nothing about the Constitution in this book until Page 263, and even then, it is only to say, Don't get too excited yet. Until the 1950s, Stone reports, the Supreme Court had little to say about the possible relevance of the Constitution to laws dealing with such issues as obscenity, contraception, abortion and homosexuality. Stone concedes, though he might not regard it as a concession, that the general assumption was that government could legitimately — and constitutionally — forbid behavior that the majority deemed immoral.\\n\\nIf Sex and the Constitution succeeds, future efforts by Stone and his publisher will no doubt include Sex and Magna Carta, Sex and the Declaration of Independence and Sex and the Instructions That Came With Your New Dishwasher. Stone tells the story fairly straight, but it's clear that he regards history as moving in a generally progressive direction — in favor of more tolerance — and that he thinks that's a good thing.\\n\\nImage\\n\\nActually, there isn't much about sex in Sex and the Constitution, either, until well into the book, let alone sex and the Constitution together. The first half is a mad dash through history, starting with the Greeks and ending with Senator Joseph McCarthy, the Stonewall uprising and Anita Bryant. This history proceeds in a seesaw manner, with periods of prudery in reaction to periods of license followed by more prudery, followed by license. But since Stone has made it clear that he thinks the general direction life has taken is toward more freedom, he generally approves of the way things have gone."}

At the behest of Mel, who wants to use Sharon's recovery as the basis for their next feature, they delve deep into Sharon's past by way of the List: a secret compendium of every man with whom I have ever fallen in love, in which drawings of unseemly things appear. Using the List as their guide, the women set out on the road first to visit Sharon's family in Kentucky, and then to track down a boy she knew as a child, who holds the key to the traumatic memories that are haunting her.\\n\\nThe Animators covers familiar debut-novel territory: the search for identity, the desire for success, the bewildering experiences of small-town misfits leaving home for the bright lights of New York City. But Whitaker turns these motifs on their heads simply by changing the direction of the road and populating it with women. New York success is left behind in favor of rural America — where a man will hit a woman in public just as easily as he'll open the door for her — a place sketched out with convincing ease by Whitaker, a Kentucky native. Sharon, who begins as an updated version of Sal Paradise or Nick Carraway, manages to draw herself (literally) into the starring role of her life and work, instead of simply chronicling the lives of those around her.\\n\\nThroughout, Whitaker repeatedly questions whether it's possible to tell one's story without robbing another person of theirs. It makes you both thieves, Sharon's boyfriend insists upon discovering his life is the subject of her new film. She disagrees. That story in there is mine. It belongs to me, she counters. This is what I do and you know it. We don't need your consent. Maybe not, but as the characters in this novel repeatedly learn, the freedom to tell one's own story often comes at a steep price.\\n\\nIf The Animators suffers from the debut novelist's curse of trying to do too much, Whitaker's obvious talent with dialogue and establishing a sense of place prevents it from feeling weighed down. Also, the intensity of the working relationship between these two flawed women keeps the momentum of the novel alive."}
{"original": "Amanda's and Joon's crossword — and story — were so good, I wanted to share it with you.\\n\\nNot to be outdone by my now husband who proposed to me via a New York Times crossword, this cruciverbalist bride wanted to make her own special puzzle for the wedding. I immediately came up with the AB POSITIVE theme based on our first initials.\\n\\nI made a list of about 20 possible theme entries of varying lengths. In addition, I was determined to hide our names somewhere in the grid, as well as somehow create an attribution to my father who passed away over the summer. More on that last part in a bit.\\n\\nGiven the constraints (not to mention the time sensitivity), I enlisted my friend and genius constructor Joon Pahk, who agreed to help me actualize my lofty idea. He would make the grid and I would do the cluing.\\n\\nHis first grid contained theme answers I wasn't wild about (ARMY BRAT, ALL BETTER) so I had the nerve to ask him to redo it, as I had my heart set on more sparkly fill like AURORA BOREALIS and AWESOME BLOSSOM. Joon generously obliged and then showed me where he had hidden our names, which leads me to how the published puzzle is a little different than the one we had at the wedding.\\n\\nAt the reception, guests were all given a copy of the puzzle at their seats, but Will Shortz also let me borrow one of the big whiteboards he uses at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament for the event. As guests completed their grids, I invited them to come up and fill something in, because doesn't every recreational solver want to feel like a finalist at a crossword tournament, even if just for a moment?\\n\\nAs for the puzzle itself, I gave it a title on the page: Marriage is as easy as … see? and a hint:\\n\\nWhen read in order, the answers to the starred clues will reveal the ultimate 60 Across. (Those starred clues are 16-across, 36-across, 65-across, and 68-across.) During the party, I cryptically told Will (Yes, Will Shortz was at my wedding!) that I was counting on him for something but he'd have to figure out what it was. He nodded, grinned, and accepted my challenge. (None of my five test solvers had grokked this last layer, so I deemed it best to offer the prompt, even to the puzzle master himself).\\n\\nWhen the big board was completed, I talked about the puzzle, the theme, the title, and our names, much to everyone's delight. And then I asked if anyone found anything else worth noting. Will raised his hand and addressed the crowd, explaining that what he found was the difference between a good puzzle and an amazing puzzle. He rightly discovered that I had coded the clues acrostic style, meaning that reading the first letter of each clue in order it would reveal a message.\\n\\nI won't spoil that bit here but now you know where to find it. It was my stealthy way of making sure my dad was at my wedding after all."}

{"original": "Ditlevsen's faceted truths tend to cut in more than one way — a jab in the heart, a slash to the throat. The confirmation party her mother throws to usher her, at 14, into the working ranks is another set piece of tenderly wrapped horror. The trap of filial piety isn't lost on Ditlevsen, but escaping a fate of low expectations and lower-paying jobs is never as simple as recognizing their cruel, gray facts. At first, she plays this for bruising comedy, recounting a stint as a nanny to a small boy who tells her, You have to do everything I say or else I'll shoot you. When she finally earns enough money to rent that essential room of her own in which to write, it is in a flophouse run by a blowsy Nazi who blasts Hitler's speeches on the radio but complains about the clatter of Ditlevsen's typewriter.\\n\\nBy her early 20s, Ditlevsen has married her first editor, a stout, impotent man three decades her senior who prints her work in his small literary journal, a spin on the stable skilled worker her mother imagined as her destiny. (Ditlevsen publishes her first book of poetry, Girl Soul, in 1939, her truth-telling landing her a devoted readership.) But nothing in her memoirs' first two volumes quite prepares you for what's to come. Her third marriage, to a sociopathic doctor who injects her regularly with Demerol — the name sounds like birdsong — nearly kills her. It does kill, for years, her urge to write, the protective membrane of words that has accompanied her since childhood dissolving into chemical oblivion. So unsparingly abject is her rendering of addiction — I frequently found myself having to pause, finger in book, and take a breath — that an episode involving Evelyn Waugh, whom she charms at a literary party before being dragged off humiliatingly by her lunatic husband, has an almost leavening effect.\\n\\nIn the annihilated aftermath of her third divorce, the words return, and Ditlevsen publishes, in 1968, her great novel, The Faces. Republished in Britain this year, it captures the dissociated mental state of a children's author, Lise, who hallucinates voices and faces, the latter — disembodied, floating, often those of children — inspiring the book's singular prose. Some of them, especially girls, had had to live out their mother's childhood while their own lay hidden in a secret drawer, Lise explains. Their voices would break out of them like pus from a sore, and the sound would frighten them, just like when they discovered that someone had been reading their diary, even though it was locked up among the junk and old toys from the time they had worn the discarded face of a 4-year-old. That face would stare up at them from among the tops and crippled dolls with innocent, astonished glass eyes.\\n\\nAs the paranoid Lise grows convinced that her husband is plotting to induce her to commit suicide, the voices ratchet up, accusing her of various offenses: of being an inattentive wife, an inconstant mother, a solipsistic writer. You've never seen anything but yourself in the whole world, she envisions her beloved daughter, Hanne, admonishing her. That madness can be more incisive than the rational is the novel's resonant irony, one that still lands. So, of course, does the crime of female subjectivity, of believing oneself a worthy literary subject, capacious enough to contain multitudes.\\n\\nA half-century later, all of it — her extraordinary clarity and imperfect femininity, her unstinting account of the struggle to reconcile art and life — still lands. The construct of memoir (and its stylish young cousin, autofiction) involves the organizing filter of retrospection, lending the impression that life is a continuous narrative reel of action and consequence, of meanings to be universalized. Ditlevsen's refusal to present her failings as steps on the path to some mythical plane of self-awareness reminds me of how potent the form can be when stripped of that pretense. Only at the conclusion of her memoirs, where we find her as she was when she wrote them — clinging to scraps of herself, a stranger to her children, gingerly returning to the page, the hunger lingering in her veins — did I really understand what occasioned these rare and indelible texts: the desire to be rid, finally, of her shame. Ditlevsen's voice, diffident and funny, dead-on about her own mistakes, is a welcome addition to that canon of women who showed us their secret faces so that we might wear our own."}

{"original": "Jaap van Zweden, the music director designate of the New York Philharmonic, built up good will with the orchestra's extended audience on Tuesday evening when he announced the details of his first season, which begins in September. He enthusiastically discussed his plans and programming, including five premieres he will conduct, the introduction of two new-music series tied to themes the season will explore, and much more. It was an auspicious occasion for the Philharmonic.\\n\\nLess auspicious was Mr. van Zweden's conducting on Wednesday night at David Geffen Hall. The concert, a program pairing the New York premiere of a short, recent work by John Luther Adams with a concert performance of Act I from Wagner's Die Walküre, was an opportunity to find out more about what he might bring to the Philharmonic, and to New York audiences. If anything, Mr. van Zweden can be too feisty and forceful in his performances of the standard repertory. So I was surprised that his account of this 70-minute Wagner act often lacked tension and urgency.\\n\\nThe performance started strongly. In the dark, pulsing orchestra music of the opening scene, Wagner simultaneously depicts the stormy weather that pummels a wounded young Siegmund as he is pursued through a dense forest, and the internal despair that never leaves him. Mr. van Zweden conducted this music with lean textures and crisp attacks.\\n\\nBut once Siegmund (here the veteran tenor Simon O'Neill), seeking shelter in a hut, chances upon the fearful young Sieglinde (the radiant soprano Heidi Melton), Wagner's music turns mysterious and quietly suspenseful. The isolated Siegmund and beaten-down Sieglinde, who is trapped in a marriage to the bullying Hunding, look at each other longingly. In fact, they are twins, separated since their early childhood. And during these passages Mr. van Zweden's performance often went slack."}
{"original": "CHAPTER ONE\\n\\nMarcel Proust\\n\\n\\n\\nBy EDMUND WHITE\\n\\n\\n\\nViking\\n\\nRead the Review\\n\\nIn England not long ago a survey of writers and critics revealed that the twentieth-century novelist they most admired--and who they thought would have the most enduring influence on the next century--was Marcel Proust. Certainly the madeleine moistened by herbal tea has become the most famous symbol in French literature; everyone refers to sudden gusts of memory as Proustian experiences. Snobs like to point out that if the Prousts had been better-mannered and not given to dunking, world literature would have been the poorer for it. Even those who haven't read Proust speak of him freely and often.\\n\\nStudying him, of course, can have a disastrous effect on a young writer, who either comes under the influence of Proust's dangerously idiosyncratic and contagious style or who feels that Proust has already done everything possible in the novel form. Even Walter Benjamin, who became Proust's German translator, wrote the philosopher Theodor Adorno that he did not want to read one more word by Proust than was actually necessary for him to translate because otherwise he would become addictively dependent, which would be an obstacle to his own production.\\n\\nGraham Greene once wrote: Proust was the greatest novelist of the twentieth century, just as Tolstoy was in the nineteenth.... For those who began to write at the end of the twenties or the beginning of the thirties, there were two great inescapable influences: Proust and Freud, who are mutually complementary. Certainly Proust's fame and prestige have eclipsed those of Joyce, Beckett, Virginia Woolf and Faulkner, of Hemingway and Fitzgerald, of Gide and Valery and Genet, of Thomas Mann and Bertolt Brecht, for if some of these writers are more celebrated than Proust in their own country, Proust is the only one to have a uniformly international reputation. The young Andrew Holleran, who would go on to publish the most important American gay novel of the seventies, Dancer from the Dance, wrote a friend eight years earlier: Robert, much has happened: That is, I finally finished Remembrance of Things Past and I don't know what to say--the idea that Joyce ended the novel is so absurd; it's Proust who ended the novel, simply by doing something so complete, monumental, perfect, that what the fuck can you do afterwards?\\n\\nJoyce met Proust once and they exchanged scarcely a word, even though they shared a cab together (neither had read the other). Beckett wrote a small critical book about Proust; Woolf admired Proust so intensely that she felt swamped by his genius. Gide's bitterest regret was that as a founder of a fledgling but already prestigious publishing house, he turned down Swann's Way, the first volume of Proust's masterpiece (he thought of Proust as a superficial snob and a mere reporter of high-society events). Genet began to write his first novel, Our Lady of the Flowers, after reading the opening pages of Proust's Within a Budding Grove. Genet was in prison and he arrived late in the exercise yard for the weekly book exchange; as a result he was forced to take the one book all the other prisoners had rejected. And yet once he'd read the opening pages of Proust he shut the book, wanting to savor every paragraph over as long a period as possible. He said to himself; Now, I'm tranquil, I know I'm going to go from marvel to marvel. His reading inspired him to write; he hoped to become the Proust of the underclass.\\n\\nAnd yet Proust was not always so appreciated, and even his chief defenders were capable of making snide remarks about him. Robert de Montesquiou (whose arch manners and swooping intonations Proust loved to imitate and whose life provided Proust with the main model for his most memorable character, the baron de Charlus) said that Proust's work was a mixture of litanies and sperm (a formula that he considered to be a compliment). Gide accused him of having committed an offense against the truth (Gide was irritated that Proust never acknowledged his own homosexuality in print nor ever presented homosexual inclinations in an attractive light). Lucien Daudet, a young writer with whom Proust had an affair (Proust liked artistic young men with mustaches and dark eyes: that is, those who resembled himself), at one point told Cocteau that Proust was an atrocious insect. Lucien's father, Alphonse Daudet, one of the most celebrated writers of the generation before Proust's, though now largely forgotten, announced, Marcel Proust is the devil! He might well have taken such a position, since it was Proust's seven-volume novel, Remembrance of Things Past (in recent editions, translated more literally as In Search of Lost Time), that surpassed--indeed, wiped out--the fiction written in the two decades before him. Who today reads Anatole France, Paul Bourget, Maurice Barres, or even Alphonse Daudet? Paul Claudel, the arch-Catholic poet and playwright, described Marcel as a painted old Jewess. In New York during the 1970s one popular T-shirt, using the Yiddish word for a female gossip, brandished the slogan Proust Is a Yenta!\\n\\nThese insults, many of them handed out by people who on alternate days adored Proust, were neutralized by an issue of La Nouvelle Revue Francaise, France's best literary magazine at the time, that was entirely dedicated to Proust. It came out in 1923, just a year after Proust's death, and contained photos of the dead master, previously unpublished snippets from his pen, and evaluations from critics, French but also from nations all over the world. Most touching were the many personal testimonies. The poet Anna de Noailles, herself a monument to egotism, praised Proust for his ... modesty. (The duc de Gramont, one of Proust's highest-born friends, once remarked that aristocrats invited Proust for country weekends not because of his art but because he and Anna de Noailles were the two funniest people in Paris.)\\n\\nEveryone had a sharp memory to share. Jean Cocteau, the poet-playwright-impresario-filmmaker (Beauty and the Beast), recalled Proust's voice: Just as the voice of a ventriloquist comes out of his chest, so Proust's emerged from his soul. The writer Leon-Paul Fargue remembered seeing Proust towards the end of his life, completely pale, with his hair down to his eyebrows, his beard, so black it was blue, devouring his face.... Fargue noticed the long sleeves covering frozen hands, the Persian, almond-shaped eyes. He looked like a man who no longer lives outdoors or by day, a hermit who hasn't emerged from his oak tree for a long time, with something pained about the face, the expression of suffering that has just begun to be calmed. He seemed possessed by a bitter goodness. A young aristocratic woman recalled that when she was a girl she was supposed to be presented to him at a ball, but the great writer, livid and bearded, wearing the collar of his overcoat turned up, stared at her with such intensity that when they were finally introduced she was so frightened she nearly fainted.\\n\\nOne of Proust's ex-lovers and his most constant friend, Reynaldo Hahn, the composer, recalled that soon after he met Proust they were walking through a garden when suddenly Proust stopped dead before a rosebush. He asked Hahn to continue walking without him. When at last Hahn circled back, after going around the chateau, I found him at the same place, staring at the roses. His head tilting forward, his face very serious, he blinked, his eyebrows slightly furrowed as though from a passionate act of attention, and with his left hand he was obstinately pushing the end of his little black mustache between his lips and nibbling on it.... How many times I've observed Marcel in these mysterious moments in which he was communicating totally with nature, with art, with life, in these `deep minutes' in which his entire being was concentrated.... Typically, Proust also invoked this very scene, but said that inhaling the moment was ineffectual; only the sudden, unprompted awakenings of memory, triggered by something illogical and unforeseen (the madeleine, for example), could invoke the past in its entirety.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe great Colette completely failed to sense his value when she first ran into Proust (they were both very young and just starting out as writers). She'd even gone so far, in one of her early Claudine novels, as to call him a yid (youpin), but her husband urbanely crossed out the insult and replaced it with boy (garcon). Even cleaned up, the passage doesn't make for very pleasant reading. It states that at a literary salon, I was pursued, politely, all evening by a young and pretty boy of letters. Because of her cropped hair, unusual for the period, he kept comparing her to the young god Hermes or to a cupid drawn by Prud'hon. My little flatterer, excited by his own evocations, wouldn't leave me alone for a second.... He gazed at me with caressing, long-lashed eyes.... At the same time, in 1895, she wrote Proust a letter in which she acknowledged that he had recognized a crucial truth: The word is not a representation but a living thing, and it is much less a mnemonic sign than a pictorial translation.\\n\\nPerhaps Colette had been initially irritated because the young flatterer had already divined her bisexuality. By 1917, after Proust had begun to publish Remembrance of Things Past, she could see him in another light. He was very ill, he weighed no more than one hundred pounds, and he seldom emerged from his cork-lined room. He had become a martyr to art (and she herself was one of his few living rivals as a stylist). She saw him at the Ritz during the war with a few friends, wearing a fur coat even indoors over his evening clothes: He never stopped talking, trying to be gay. Because of the cold, and making excuses, he kept his top hat on, tilted backwards, and the fan-like lock of hair covered his eyebrows. Full-dress uniform, but disarranged by a furious wind, which, pouring over the nape of his hat, rumpling the calico and the free ends of his cravat, filling in with a grey ash the furrows of his cheeks, the hollows of his eye-sockets and the breathless mouth, had hunted this tottering young man of fifty to death.\\n\\nThese portraits already suggest the outlines of Proust's extraordinary personality. He was attentive to his friends to the point of seeming a flatterer, though he thought friendship was valueless and conversation represented the death of the mind, since he believed only passion and suffering could sharpen the powers of observation and the only word of any value was the written. He could stare transfixed at a rose--or at anything else or anyone who was on his peculiar wavelength--but though he read everything and was deeply cultivated, he had little interest in disembodied ideas. He wasn't an intellectual, though he was supremely intelligent. He applied his attention to flowers and people and paintings, but not to theories about botany nor to psychology nor aesthetics. He never read a word of Freud, for instance (nor did Freud ever read a word of Proust). He was hilariously funny and entertaining, but he emanated a calm spirituality except, perhaps, when he was doubled up with a crazy bout of laughter (his famous choking fit of hilarity, his fou rire, which could go on so long it struck strangers as weird, even slightly mad). He was such a presence that many people spoke of him as tall, but in fact he stood just five feet six inches.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarcel Proust was the son of a Christian father and a Jewish mother. He himself was baptized (on August 5, 1871, at the church of Saint-Louis d'Antin) and later confirmed as a Catholic, but he never practiced that faith and as an adult could best be described as a mystical atheist, someone imbued with spirituality who nonetheless did not believe in a personal God, much less in a savior. Although Jews trace their religion through their mothers, Proust never considered himself Jewish and even became vexed when a newspaper article listed him as a Jewish author. His father once warned him not to stay in a certain hotel since there were too many Jewish guests there, and, to be sure, in Remembrance of Things Past there are unflattering caricatures of the members of one Jewish family, the Blochs. Jews were still considered exotic, even oriental, in France; in 1872 there were only eighty-six thousand Jews in the whole country. In a typically offensive passage Proust writes that in a French drawing room a Jew making his entry as though he were emerging from the desert, his body crouching like a hyena's, his neck thrust forward, offering profound `salaams,' completely satisfies a certain taste for the oriental.\\n\\nProust never refers to his Jewish origins in his fiction, although in the youthful novel he abandoned, Jean Santeuil (first published only in 1952, thirty years after his death), there is a very striking, if buried, reference to Judaism. The autobiographical hero has quarreled with his parents and in his rage deliberately smashed a piece of delicate Venetian glass his mother had given him. When he and his mother are reconciled, he tells her what he has done: He expected that she would scold him, and so revive in his mind the memory of their quarrel. But there was no cloud upon her tenderness. She gave him a kiss, and whispered in his ear: `It shall be, as in the Temple, the symbol of an indestructible union.' This reference to the rite of smashing a glass during the Orthodox Jewish wedding ceremony, in this case sealing the marriage of mother to son, is not only spontaneous but chilling. In an essay about his mother he referred, with characteristic ambiguity, to the beautiful lines of her Jewish face, completely marked with Christian sweetness and Jansenist resignation, turning her into Esther herself--a reference, significantly, to the heroine of the Old Testament (and of Racine's play), who concealed her Jewish identity until she had become the wife of King Ahasuerus and was in a position to save her people. The apparently gentile Proust, who had campaigned for Dreyfus and had been baptized Catholic, was a sort of modern Esther.\\n\\nDespite Proust's silences and lapses on the subject of his mother's religion, it would be unfair, especially in light of the rampant anti-Semitism of turn-of-the-century France, to say that he was unique or even extreme in his prejudice against Jews. And yet his anti-Semitism is more than curious, given his love for his mother and given, after her death, something very much like a religious cult that he developed around her. His mother, out of respect for her parents, had remained faithful to their religion, and Proust revered her and her relatives; after her death he regretted that he was too ill to visit her grave and the graves of her parents and uncle in the Jewish cemetery and to mark each visit with a stone. More important, although he had many friends among the aristocracy whom he had assiduously cultivated, nevertheless when he was forced to take sides during the Dreyfus Affair, which had begun in 1894 and erupted in 1898, he chose to sign a petition prominently printed in a newspaper calling for a retrial.\\n\\nThe Dreyfus Affair is worth a short detour, since it split French society for many years and it became a major topic in proust's life--and in Remembrance of Things Past. Alfred Dreyfus (1859-1935) was a Jew and a captain in the French army. In December 1894 he was condemned by a military court for having sold military secrets to the Germans and was sent for life to Devil's Island. The accusation was based on the evidence of a memorandum stolen from the German embassy in Paris (despite the fact that the writing did not resemble Dreyfus's) and of a dossier (which was kept classified and secret) handed over to the military court by the minister of war. In 1896 another French soldier, Major Georges Picquart, proved that the memorandum had been written not by Dreyfus but by a certain Major Marie Charles Esterhazy. Yet Esterhazy was acquitted and Picquart was imprisoned. Instantly a large part of the population called for a retrial of Dreyfus. On January 13, 1898, the writer Emile Zola published an open letter, J'accuse, directed against the army's general staff; Zola was tried and found guilty of besmirching the reputation of the army. He was forced to flee to England. Then in September 1898 it was proved that the only piece of evidence against Dreyfus in the secret military dossier had been faked by Joseph Henry, who confessed his misdeed and committed suicide. At last the government ordered a retrial of Dreyfus. Public opinion was bitterly divided between the leftist Dreyfusards, who demanded justice and truth, and the anti-Dreyfusards, who led an anti-Semitic campaign, defended the honor of the army, and rejected the call for a retrial. The conflict led to a virtual civil war. In 1899 Dreyfus was found guilty again, although this time under extenuating circumstances--and the president pardoned him. Only in 1906 was Dreyfus fully rehabilitated, named an officer once again, and decorated with the Legion of Honor. Interestingly, Theodor Herzl, the Paris correspondent for a Viennese newspaper, was so overwhelmed by the virulent anti-Semitism of the Dreyfus Affair that he was inspired by the prophetic idea of a Jewish state.\\n\\nIn defending Dreyfus, Proust not only angered conservative, Catholic, pro-army aristocrats, but he also alienated his own father. In writing about the 1890s in Remembrance of Things Past, Proust remarks that the Dreyfus case was shortly to relegate the Jews to the lowest rung of the social ladder. Typically, the ultraconservative Gustave Schlumberger, a great Byzantine scholar, could give in his posthumous memoirs as offensive a description of his old friend Charles Haas (a model for Proust's character Swann) as this: The delightful Charles Haas, the most likeable and glittering socialite, the best of friends, had nothing Jewish about him except his origins and was not afflicted, as far as I know, with any of the faults of his race, which makes him an exception virtually unique. It would be misleading to suggest that Proust took his controversial, pro-Dreyfus stand simply because he was half-Jewish. No, he was only obeying the dictates of his conscience, even though he lost many highborn Catholic friends by doing so and exposed himself to the snide anti-Semitic accusation of merely automatically siding with his co-religionists.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarcel Proust was born on July 10, 1871, to well-to-do middle-class parents. His mother was Jeanne Weil, a twenty-one-year-old Parisian, daughter of Nathe Weil, a rich stockbroker. Her great-uncle Adolphe Cremieux was a senator and received a state funeral; he was also president of the Universal Israelite Alliance. Her mother, Adele, was (like the Narrator's grandmother in Remembrance of Things past) a cultured woman who loved, above all other literature, the letters of Madame de Sevigne, one of Louis XIV's courtiers and a woman who was almost romantically in love with her own daughter (the one-sided Sevigne mother-daughter relationship inspired Thornton Wilder when he wrote The Bridge of San Luis Rey). This intense intimacy was in fact characteristic of Marcel and his own mother, who were inseparable, who fought frequently (usually over his laziness and lack of willpower) but always fell into each other's arms as soon as they made up. Mother and son shared a love of music and literature; she could speak and read German as well as English. She had a perfect memory and knew long passages from Racine by heart; her dying words were a citation from La Fontaine: If you're not a Roman, at least act worthy of being one. Marcel inherited her taste for memorizing poetry and knew long passages from Victor Hugo, Racine, and Baudelaire. Most important, Marcel and his mother both loved to laugh--gently, satirically--at the people around them, and in her letters to him she sends up the other guests at a spa or hotel with the same spirit of wickedly close observation and good-natured if prickly fun that was to inspire so many of his best pages.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProust's father, Adrien, thirty-five years old when Marcel was born, came from a far more humble background, though he rose to great heights in the medical profession. His father had been a grocer in Illiers (the name is derived from that of Saint Hilaire), a village near the cathedral town of Chartres, south of Paris; Marcel gave the village the name of Combray, and today it is known officially as Illiers-Combray and has become a major goal for Proust pilgrims from all over the world. (The local bakeries are all grinding out madeleines in Proust's honor, and the house where he and his family summered has become a museum. Perhaps in another century the name Illiers will be dropped altogether as life completely surrenders to the tyranny of art.)\\n\\nAdrien Proust was originally intended for the priesthood and he brought a nearly religious zeal to his work as a doctor. It was he who made famous--and effective--the idea of a cordon sanitaire, a sanitary zone circling Europe in order to keep out cholera. In order to put his principles to work Dr. Proust traveled to Russia, Turkey, and Persia in 1869 and figured out the routes by which cholera in previous epidemics had entered Russia and thereby Europe. For this successful investigation and the resulting efficacious sanitation and quarantine campaign Dr. Proust was awarded the Legion of Honor. He became one of the most celebrated professors of medicine and practicing physicians of his day. Whereas Marcel would be willowy, artistic, asthmatic, and obsessed with titled ladies, his father was the very model of the solid upper-middle-class citizen, fleshy, bearded, solemn, and, thanks to his wife's fortune, rich. He was also, unbeknownst to his son, an inveterate ladies' man. His extramarital adventures were never noticed by Marcel's mother--or if she did know something about them, she was too discreet to mention it.\\n\\nIn the partially autobiographical novel Jean Santeuil, written while his parents were still alive, Marcel portrays his father as a brute (What a vulgar man, thinks Jean Santeuil), someone whose peasant ways had not been amended by a lifetime of honors. In his correspondence Marcel later told his editor that his father had tried to cure him of his effeminacy and neuroses by sending him to a whorehouse. But by the time he came to write Remembrance of Things Past, after his parents' death, he idealized both of them and disguised his father as a wise, indulgent minister of state.\\n\\nProust's mother was pregnant with him during the Franco-Prussian War and the difficult aftermath of France's defeat, the period when Napoleon III was chased from the throne and a socialist commune was briefly declared in Paris before the Third Republic was at last established. During the months of war and the internecine street fighting, coal and wood supplies ran out and houses went unheated. In Paris the starving populace ate dogs and cats, even the animals in the zoo. As a result, Jeanne Proust was so weakened from hunger and anxiety that when Marcel was born he was sickly and fragile and at first not expected to live.\\n\\nIn this respect, as in so many others, Marcel was the opposite of his hearty, healthy brother, Robert, born two years later, on May 24, 1873, in more prosperous and settled times. The two brothers were perfect companions as children and remained very close all their lives, although it was the robust younger brother, Robert, who often played the role of protector to the asthmatic Marcel. Like his father, Robert became a doctor--and a womanizer--yet the two brothers never quarreled, and lived their whole lives in the most complete harmony. In the 1890s both brothers were Dreyfusards. At the end of his life Marcel asked Robert to intervene and secure for him the Legion of Honor and, once this honor was obtained, to confer it on him. Robert was at Marcel's bedside when he died, and after his death it was Robert who oversaw the publication of the last two volumes of his masterpiece as well as his selected correspondence.\\n\\nAs a little boy Marcel could not go to sleep without his mother's kiss; this necessity would become a major theme of Combray, the first section of Remembrance of Things Past. Quite understandably she was worried by these signs of her son's total dependence on her and would attempt to cure him by refusing to indulge him in his whims, but he would become so hysterical if denied a kiss or his mother's tenth good night visit to his bedroom that usually she gave in--or her less rigorous husband would urge her to do so. Not only did Proust not outgrow his dependence; it became the template for his adult loves, since for Proust passion was a nagging need that became only more demanding the more it was denied. Indeed, Proust would drive away all his lovers (in his fiction as in his life) through his unreasonable demands."}

He's written eight books (one is The Ten Commandments: Still the Best Moral Code), and since 1999 has hosted The Dennis Prager Show on the conservative Christian radio syndicate Salem.\\n\\nMr. Prager is 6-foot-4 and imposing, in a white button-down shirt, hunched over the microphone.\\n\\nHe read some promos for his sponsor Blinds.com. He took calls from listeners. He talked about the importance of children respecting parents (very important) and about how parents should not want their children to be the smartest in the class, but rather the most moral.\\n\\nHe carefully threaded the needle for listeners as he made the argument for Mr. Trump as a values leader. There are two types of values, micro and macro, he argued. One seems to do with the minutiae of one's life (marital fidelity, religiosity, respect); the other, he says, is more important and relates to the general effect of one's life.\\n\\nDonald Trump may not have terrific micro values, but I think he has terrific macro values, Mr. Prager said.\\n\\nWhen it comes to politicians, he said he marks a sharp divide between political life and personal life, and he argues that the president's personal behavior is irrelevant to his public message.\\n\\nThis is a new line of argument for Mr. Prager, who spent much of his career focusing on those micro values. He is a longtime opponent of same-sex marriage, which he considers an effort to destroy the foundation of our Judeo-Christian civilization. An episode in his Same Sex Issues collection is titled, Love Is Not Enough.\\n\\nFormer fans of Mr. Prager's work say they are confused by his Trumpist turn.\\n\\nIn terms of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' of watching people become more Trumpian, these moral icons becoming shills, he is way up there, said Charlie Sykes, the author of How the Right Lost Its Mind, and a former radio host who used to occasionally substitute on Mr. Prager's show. Now you have to put PragerU in the category of other very successful meme machines and low-rent conservative grifting."}

Since moving to Hollywood, she deducted 10 years from her age (some of it with cosmetic surgery) to preserve her writing career, she claims. She is afraid that my salt-and-pepper hair will bust her. Lately, she has been mostly out of touch. But the implication that I look so much older than her has rankled for years. When I confided my hurt feelings to her, she was unapologetic. Blame the industry and ageism, she said, not her. Do I have a right to feel hurt?\\n\\nANONYMOUS\\n\\nAge, as fantasists have long told us, is just a number. But patterns of numbers have meaning. If 50-year-old leading men routinely win the hearts of 30-year-old actresses in Hollywood films (as demonstrated by a totally nonscientific survey of movies watched on a recent cross-country flight), what happens to 50-year-old women? Who knows if this invisibility also pertains to writers? In any event, your friend is living in never-never land: It takes about three minutes to learn anyone's age these days.\\n\\nAs for your hurt feelings, they seem reasonable. Personally, I would be less hurt by her assessment of my looks (until I inspected her cosmetic surgery, anyway) than by her shame at associating with me. Still, you have shared your honest feelings, and she rejected them. If you are committed to this friendship, I would never dissuade you from trying again. But as my (brutally efficient) nana used to say: No use watering dead flowers. And don't out her as 50-something. Two wrongs. …\\n\\nRelease the Date?\\n\\nI am the eldest of five adult children. While packing up the family home after our father died (our mother predeceased him), I came across a copy of my parents' marriage certificate. They celebrated their anniversary on Jan. 12, so I was surprised to see the actual date was Jan. 6. But I was even more surprised to see the year: 1962 — after the first three children were born. I'm smiling just writing this. Good on them! Question: Should I tell my siblings?"}
{"original": "What happens when an author tries so strenuously to empathize with her subject that she loses control of her own book?\\n\\nIt's a question that kept coming to mind as I read My War Criminal: Personal Encounters With an Architect of Genocide, Jessica Stern's mystifying account of her conversations with Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader who was convicted in 2016 of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, and is serving a life sentence in prison at The Hague. Stern, a scholar of terrorism and trauma who served on President Bill Clinton's National Security Council, conducted 12 interviews with Karadzic over the course of two years — making hers the first such study, she says, of a leader tried for war crimes at an international tribunal since the Nazis were evaluated at Nuremberg.\\n\\nKaradzic was found guilty of orchestrating the massacre at Srebrenica, a Bosnian Muslim town and United Nations-designated safe zone where Serbian forces murdered 8,000 men and boys in 1995, burying them in mass graves. Four years before, he had given a speech to the Bosnian Assembly threatening Muslims with annihilation if they voted to secede from the disintegrating Yugoslavia. White supremacists across the world, including mass shooters in Norway and New Zealand, have looked to Karadzic for inspiration.\\n\\nStern's interest in Karadzic isn't purely academic. As the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, she writes about her deep curiosity about the causes of evil, and of a persistent desire to make creative use of the sequelae of childhood trauma. Ten years ago, she published a memoir, Denial, which recounted in unsparing detail how her grandfather molested her, and how a 15-year-old Stern and her younger sister were raped at gunpoint after a stranger entered their home."}

The lives of a young black couple in Atlanta are thrown into chaos after the husband, Roy, is imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit. As the couple grapple with their grief, they must also confront the failed hopes of a marriage and romantic love. The grave miscarriage of justice forms the core of Jones's deeply compassionate and heartbreaking novel.\\n\\nHOW DEMOCRACIES DIE, by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt. (Broadway, $15.) Think beyond the coups d'état: The backslide from democracy into autocracy can be brought about by elected officials who upend the processes that empowered them.

(Picador, $18.) A gruesome act of violence connects three teenagers, who stay linked to one another for the rest of their lives. As more is revealed about the crime, this thriller raises questions of guilt, culpability and forgiveness. As our reviewer, Sarah Lyall, put it, You have to work hard to follow the winding road Yates sends us down, and the drive is full of pleasantly unpleasant surprises.\\n\\nNO TIME TO SPARE: Thinking About What Matters, by Ursula K.

{"original": "But as Duncan Ryuken Williams, a professor of religion and East Asian languages and cultures at the University of Southern California, who organized the festival, explained, it's more complicated than that, a subject worthy of deep — and optimistic — exploration. The festival coincided with a conference at the University of Southern California on critical mixed-race studies, and the publication of Hapa Japan, a two-part volume of essays that Professor Williams edited.\\n\\nThe scholars, artists and musicians I met over four days embodied that complexity. They all shared some version of the same story: of boundary crossing, first by their parents, then by themselves, in lives that unavoidably tested rigid racial assumptions and expectations. For all that, they seemed comfortable in their skins, and strikingly creative: A singer-songwriter, Kat McDowell, of New Zealand and Japan, trying to make it in Los Angeles. A pop and hip-hop trio, the Yano Brothers, who were born in Ghana, grew up in Japan, and rapped smoothly in Japanese. Tetsuro Miyazaki, a Belgian-Japanese photographer. Jeff Chiba Stearns, a Japanese-Canadian filmmaker whose documentaries include One Big Hapa Family.\\n\\nIf you gaze at the many portraits of half-Japanese, half-Dutch subjects photographed by Mr. Miyazaki, you can see the searching in their faces, the puzzling out of what hapa means. But you can also gain the sense that there are deep currents, forces old and powerful, in opposition to wall-building and racial hunkering.\\n\\nMixing is happening all around, and the results can be surprising, wondrous, and unstoppable: Who knew that there were so many hapas in Holland? Yet in the hapa world, anxiety about breeding and bloodlines is never far from the surface. An essay in Hapa Japan recounts the paroxysms felt by some Japanese-Americans in California in the late 1970s, when an article in a newspaper of the Japanese American Citizens League warned that interracial marriage was a threat worse than a hundred million Manzanars, Tule Lakes, or Pearl Harbors.\\n\\nYoung couples, thankfully, did not heed that panicky call to preserve issei purity. As Professor Williams told me, Japanese-Americans marry out far more than other Asian-Americans. In the 2010 census, more than 460,000 of 1.3 million Japanese-Americans identified themselves as multiracial. The trend puts Japanese-Americans on the brink of becoming the first Asian-American group that is mostly racially mixed."}

They're eliminating themselves.\\n\\nThe Trachtenburgs had not seen the partial results from Iowa, having left home for the rally before the early numbers were released. I really feel there's going to be an upset, Ms. Trachtenburg said. I think Bloomberg has more than a fighting chance, and judging by tonight, she added, motioning to the crowd behind her, we're not the only ones who feel that way.\\n\\nInside the sprawling space, the Bloomberg campaign provided beer, wine, hoagies and Philadelphia Tastykakes, as people filled the main lobby and a wraparound balcony overlooking it.

{"original": "A bigger issue is that a wealth tax may not be constitutional. The 16th Amendment provides only for an income tax. The estate, gift and generation-skipping taxes pass muster because they're deemed excise taxes on the transfer of wealth, not on the wealth itself.\\n\\nSenator Warren's proposal is based on a study by two scholars, and she's pursuing that, said Joanne Johnson, head of wealth advisory group at J. P. Morgan's private bank. There is a lot of extremely important analysis that still has to occur.\\n\\nA third issue is logistical. A wealth tax would be like an estate tax levied every year. Figuring out the tax owed on large estates is complicated, costly and time-consuming. The Internal Revenue Service gives estates a year to file a return, but even then, executors often have to file extensions. And on the other end, auditors go through the returns, which can take years before an estate is settled.\\n\\nThe process requires not just lawyers and accountants but valuation experts who assess the worth of assets like closely held family businesses.\\n\\nIt would be a highly cumbersome tax return to prepare on an annual basis, said Jeff Moes, executive vice president and chief fiduciary officer at FineMark National Bank & Trust, which serves high-net-worth clients. Every federal estate tax goes through an audit, and presumably this would go through an audit as well. They'd have to figure out if the valuation methodology is correct.\\n\\nA billionaire would have a return that would be literally three feet high, he added. Our $100 million clients own multiple closely held businesses. All of them would require an expert valuation and five-year financials.\\n\\nAnd then the government would need to have enough auditors to verify everything that was submitted. In 2018, for example, an estimated 4,000 estate tax returns will be filed, with tax owed on 1,900 of them. That's a tenth the number of tax returns that would be filed under Ms. Warren's wealth tax plan."}

One of the challenges of writing about climate change is how to take this thing that is essentially on a larger scale than our minds can hold and how to make it a narrative that our minds can hold. … Climate change isn't quite on a human scale, but narrative is on a human scale, so how do you translate that?\\n\\nImage\\n\\nCourtney Maum visits the podcast to discuss Before and After the Book Deal, her guide for writers publishing their first book. We're in a culture where there's a lot of books and M.F.A. programs and summer conferences that teach you how to write and learn to revise well enough to get a book deal, Maum says. But the minute you realize your dream and you actually do get a book deal, there's nothing. There's not a lot of resources. There's certainly no books about it. And the conversations that you do have are a little loaded and icky. … So I wanted to put something out there for people who are navigating this immense privilege that nevertheless leaves you pretty raw and vulnerable."}
{"original": "I told myself I would never fall down the wife trap rabbit hole.\\n\\nMy mother and father both worked outside the home, but like many women of their generation, my mother was in charge of keeping the home and caring for the children on top of her paying job. When my boyfriend and I moved in together, I made sure not to take over the housekeeping. We both cooked and cleaned and knew how to operate the washing machine. Home maintenance was either a joint effort or jointly neglected.\\n\\nLike so many egalitarian efforts, our domestic parity was lost once we had a baby. Everyone probably has a story of how it happened to them. In our case, my husband fell into a depression. On top of that, our 2-week-old baby needed surgery for a stomach condition called pyloric stenosis, and he came out of the operation weak and underweight. Along with the love I gave him, I went into a tough-broad-who-gets-everything-done mode. But I never came out of it.\\n\\nAnd so our patterns formed. I took care of the baby. I took care of the house. As my son grew older, I managed everything: food, medical appointments, preschool reconnaissance, after-school activities, birthdays and wardrobe and transportation. We had a second child and we constantly renegotiated the terms of our labor division because neither of us wanted to be stuck in those stereotypical roles. But though my husband had emerged from his depression and I from my tough broad mode, we never got our gender equality groove back despite our efforts.\\n\\nThen, two years ago, my husband took a job in Luxembourg, where the lingua franca is French. He's fluent in French, whereas on a good day, I speak it like a 5-year-old. Suddenly, the entire dynamic between us changed."}
{"original": "At 14, I never looked at hard-boiled eggs the same way again.\\n\\nThe books not only covered blissful sex but also described a whole range of intimate moments, from the awkward to the funny to the very bad, including rape of both the stranger and intimate-partner variety. Beyond the dirty bits, the books I read described the moments before and after the main event, the stuff you don't see in mainstream movies, where zippers don't get stuck and teeth don't bump when you're kissing; the stuff you don't see in porn, where almost no time elapses between the repair guy's arrival and the start of activities that do not involve the clogged kitchen sink.\\n\\nObjectification doesn't exist just in porn, of course. So many men cannot get their heads around the idea that women are not first and foremost sexual objects, the novelist Jenny Crusie told me. You don't get that from porn; you get that from a persistent worldview modeled by the men around you that you've been taught to admire.\\n\\nI have no idea how much, if any, X-rated material Mr. Ansari or his date consumes. Statistically, we know that modern men and women have access to every kind of explicit material, literally in their pockets. And they're watching: One recent study found that 79 percent of men and 76 percent of women between 18 and 30 look at pornographic websites at least once each month, while another showed that three out of 10 men in that age group were daily viewers.\\n\\nSex might be easy, but relationships are hard. And a 400-page novel can teach you more about them than any X-rated clip. Fiction has time to draw a deeper picture, covering the getting-to-know-you stuff, the starts and stops and circling back that take boy and girl from first date to first kiss to the moment where they're both naked and hopefully into what's going to happen next.\\n\\nRomance novels teach readers that all partners are equal participants in a sexual relationship, said Bea Koch, the 28-year-old co-owner (with her 25-year-old sister, Leah) of the Ripped Bodice, a bookstore in Culver City, Calif., that exclusively sells romance titles. They highlight conversations about consent, birth control and myriad other topics that people generally find difficult to talk about. In some instances, it can be a literal script for how to bring up difficult topics with a partner. They give a road map to people wanting to experiment with their sexuality, or even just get in touch with what they want and need in a sexual relationship.\\n\\nPorn, necessarily, cuts to the chase: a little less conversation, a little more action.\\n\\nTalking's not sexy, people complain."}
{"original": "People who study marriage, or work with couples in therapy, as I do, talk about the need for a we story, a collaboration between partners about values and goals. But if couples are going to collaborate, they have to figure out how to have a productive conversation. A conversation — as opposed to parallel monologues — involves two people who are making an effort to understand each other. In the grip of strong emotion, productive conversation can be surprisingly hard.\\n\\nThat is why many manuals offer advice for navigating communication traps. They counsel asking your partner whether it is a good time to talk (since couples routinely broach complicated topics on the fly), and striking a balance between empathy and problem-solving. If your partner is an avoider, don't give up trying to connect. If your partner is an emoter, stay compassionate and firm: I'll be able to respond better if you take it down a couple of notches. In bad moments, we all need these skills.\\n\\nIn our conflict-averse culture we don't necessarily think of these skills as part of romance. But I've seen how the best marriages involve people who can deal with strong negative emotions — and who are cleareyed about how hard it can be. They don't avoid anger, but they don't indulge it. They tackle hard issues without shutting down. They apologize for their own bad behavior.\\n\\nWhat will matter most in marriage is what's possible on the other side of love's first blush: conversations that are rewarding, intimate and real. It's not that we come together in electric recognition and pure understanding, then fall away from that through conflict. Rather, we come together in a rush of passion, then we achieve love through continuing conversation.\\n\\nThrough that conversation we cultivate the essential emotional attitude in marriage: I can try to understand what you think and feel, without it taking away from my own experience. Your reality doesn't cancel out mine.\\n\\nAll this may seem an awfully low priority when the to-do list is a mile long and the wedding planner needs an answer now. But in married life, a sense of emotional emergency almost always means it's time to slow down. Emotions are often inconvenient.\\n\\nThe artist Georgia O'Keeffe said, Nobody sees a flower — really — it is so small it takes time — we haven't time — and to see takes time, like to have a friend takes time. What most people want from marriage is an intimate friend. The key to lasting love is taking time to understand and respond.\\n\\nA wedding is a one-shot celebration of tying the knot, but marriage is an open-ended practice of disentangling misunderstandings. I wish the newly engaged great happiness. I also wish that in between picking a caterer and a font for the invitations, they pause to think about how they fight, and how they want to talk."}
{"original": "The Days of Abandonment is told from the perspective of Olga, a woman whose husband, Mario, has just left her and their young son and daughter for another woman. The story unfolds in often excruciating psychological detail, as Olga falls apart and then pulls herself together again. We have little access to Mario's inner life. Ties puts the same plot elements through a kaleidoscope, telling the tale from three different perspectives, first that of the wife, Vanda, then of the husband, Aldo, and eventually that of their grown children, jumping backward and forward in time over an arc of decades.\\n\\nImage Domenico Starnone, husband of the woman who has been identified as Elena Ferrante. Credit... Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images\\n\\nIn case it's slipped your mind, Dear Sir, let me remind you: I am your wife, the novel begins. These are the words of Vanda, writing to Aldo, who has left after 12 years of marriage to move in with Lidia. You see us as an obstacle to your happiness, a trap that smothers your desire for pleasure, she writes. It is 1974, and politics are in the background. You came across a respectable young girl close at hand and in the name of sexual liberation and the dissolution of the family you became her lover, Vanda asserts. You'll go on like this forever, you'll never be what you want, just what happens by chance.\\n\\nAt the moment of this confrontation, Aldo tells Vanda only that he's been with another woman, not the more hurtful truth that he's deeply in love with Lidia. We learn years later about his lack of nerve. Several years after this dramatic rupture, Aldo and Vanda come back together — a painful process that takes time; their new equilibrium requires them to hide things from each other. They live together for decades. One day, they return from a beach vacation to find their Rome apartment ransacked.\\n\\nIn the chaos, the past comes rushing into the present. Out tumbles a box in which Aldo had kept photos of Lidia, and the letter from Vanda that opens the novel. He thinks back to that fraught time, to the day he told his wife he was leaving. I tried to explain that it wasn't a matter of betrayal, that I had enormous respect for her, that real betrayal was when you betrayed your own instinct, your needs, your body, yourself, Aldo recalls, but Vanda, raging and cursing, would have none of it. She shrieked, but then immediately she contained herself so as not to wake the children.\\n\\nThe children grow up. We learn how their parents' breakup has shaped their adult selves. But in Ties, no one has the last word. All the different truths are set before us, each given its due, each character fully realized, with the empathy and insight of a gifted novelist. Starnone's prose here is highly skilled without calling attention to itself. In this novel, unlike some of his others, the cleverness doesn't obstruct the emotional impact."}

{"original": "The Jews in the Novogrudok ghetto sent word to Bielski: they wanted him to mount an attack to release them from the ghetto. Bielski smuggled a message back: he reiterated his offer of shelter, but he didn't have the resources to help them escape. With no other option, the last survivors of the Novogrudok ghetto, including Rae, Lisa, Chanon and Naum Kushner, Sonya Oshman, and Jack Kagan, began to dig day and night. They smuggled implements from their work sites: pieces of wood, spoons. After long hours of labor under Nazi overseers, they stayed up all night, removing bags of dirt from the tunnel and passing them along a human chain to be stacked behind the walls to hide their activity. They worked like this for three months, at one point assigning the Jewish electrician to wire the tunnel with lights. The initial plan was to build a 150-meter tunnel to terminate in a cornfield, but the harvest came, and they had to more than double the length. Chanon Kushner, by now eighteen, was among the dozens of Jews who dug out the earth. As the tunnel neared completion, one of their number became frightened, saying the Nazis would surely catch and kill them all. The others worried he was going to inform on them to the Nazis, so they took him into the tunnel and choked him to death.\\n\\nOn a rainy night at the end of September 1943, as the Rosh Hashanah holiday was beginning, the residents of the ghetto decided conditions were right. With rain pounding down, they loosened a sheet of tin on the roof to add to the din. The electrician shorted the electric wires to dim the searchlights. The two hundred and fifty or so remaining residents lined up, the youngest and strongest in the front. The tunnel was claustrophobic, only large enough for one person to crawl through at a time. The lineup ensured that if anyone elderly fainted and blocked the tiny tunnel, there'd be fewer stuck behind. Rae and Lisa, though they were young, decided to stay back with their father. Lashed together with ropes and belts so they wouldn't lose their way, wriggling through a sixty-centimeter-wide dirt tunnel with another human's feet in their faces, all two hundred fifty Jews escaped Novogrudok.\\n\\nAt the end of the tunnel, connected by a belt to Lisa and Rae, Naum Kushner faltered. I told my children: 'You are young, go save yourself, leave me here,'  he was quoted in Nechama Tec's Defiance as saying. One of my daughters had an onion and an apple. She smeared the onion over my face and I felt better.8 The sting woke him up. He kept moving. Chanon Kushner was not so lucky. He and the other leaders of the escape became disoriented when they exited the tunnel in the driving rain. There was delirium in being free, out beyond the ghetto walls. The boys became confused and started to run in different directions. The next day, the enraged Nazis found Chanon and the others, and shot them. This was the second time the Nazis had shot Chanon and left him for dead. This time, he did not survive.\\n\\nBut Rae made it. As she, Lisa, and Naum were leaving the tunnel, Rae latched on to a Jewish youth who was from that area, who knew the countryside. She grabbed his pants and told him he was not going without her family. We're gonna die all together or we're gonna live all together, Rae said. The boy started to cry. He had someone, a gentile woman, who would take him in. But if he brought Rae, and Naum, and Lisa, he feared, she would call the Germans and they would all die. Rae told him that if she called the Germans they would all die together.\\n\\nThe country boy led the Kushners to the farmhouse, where the owner recognized them from the fur store. She gave them bread, water, and onions, but ushered them on their way, afraid the Germans would kill her if she was discovered hiding Jews. Another group, coming after Rae and Lisa and Naum and the farmer boy, prevailed on the woman to let them stay. All eight of them, including the Polish woman and her husband, were killed when the Nazis discovered them.\\n\\nFor the next ten days, from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur, the Kushners and the country boy hid in the bushes in the pouring rain. Lisa almost gave up, What kind of life is this? she asked. Let them kill us already. Eventually, they found a farmer to take them in. After two days, wagons pulled up. At first, Rae thought it was the Nazis. The men had machine guns. But soon they recognized the Jewish partisans. Tuvia Bielski had heard of their escape and dispatched a group to look for survivors.\\n\\nFor nine months, from the fall of 1943 until the summer of 1944, Rae lived in the woods with the Bielski partisans, in a highly organized camp of over a thousand Jews. At night, small armed groups would make their way silently to farms owned by gentiles for potatoes, onions, bread—and if they were lucky, an egg or a piece of meat. The partisans' tactics could be brutal: when they believed Belarusian farmers were turning Jews over to the Nazis, the partisans would kill them, sometimes slaying whole families. Then the food was collected, and the ammunition, and brought back to the camp for defense and more raids."}

{"original": "The title of Joyce Carol Oates's new collection of stories, Beautiful Days, is drawn from Les Beaux Jours, a painting by Balthus of a girl reclining in a chair and examining herself in a hand mirror, while a faceless man tends the fireplace behind her. But it might equally refer to Fleuve Blue or Big Burnt, the first two stories in the book — which are about (among other things) the strange disconnection that separates our romantic lives from the rest of life. Fleuve Blue describes an affair between a prominent small-town lawyer and a younger woman, whom he first sees walking across a bridge. He thinks, I will marry her. That one. Except, of course, he's already married. Later, he offers her a ride when she gets caught wearing high heels in a downpour and they start meeting in the afternoon in a rented room. She told him it would be the inside-out of the rest of her life, her relationship with him. … She meant, what they had together was a counter-world. … 'Because I'm always lying. In that other life. In my real life. I tell people — I tell myself — I live for my children. I adore my children.'  Unsurprisingly, their affair turns out to be susceptible to the same sort of forces that she wants to escape in her real life — boredom and the passage of time.\\n\\nBut it's the lying, or deception, or really just the uncertainty about other people that dominates the rest of this collection. A woman desperate for marriage spends a weekend with a guy she used to date who hasn't always been particularly nice to her. She doesn't know that he's tying up loose ends before killing himself, and afterward she has to deal with the puzzle of his intentions. Even years of shared life fail to produce real intimacy. Parents are just as untrustworthy as lovers. In Owl Eyes, a geeky kid at a math camp runs into a professor who tells him a story about how he used to be involved with the boy's mother — that he used to be a father to the boy himself. Vague memories come back to the boy, but it's hard to tell if they offer doubt or hope.\\n\\nImage\\n\\nIn general, Oates is dealing here with the academic world — professors and their kids, editors, writers, adjuncts — people who live in the provinces, on the outskirts of real success. Characters are often referred to by titles rather than names: mother, daddy, wife, husband, professor. Except You Bless Me, one of the standouts in a very strong collection, recounts an early incident in a woman's teaching career. She has become convinced that a black student in her class — one she's been trying to help — has been sending her racist hate messages.

The synagogue where his father worked as a cantor was destroyed during Kristallnacht in 1938; the theater that employed Weill as a conductor burned down and was replaced with a Nazi-designed one christened by Hitler; and much of the urban landscape as Weill knew it was leveled by air raids in World War II.\\n\\nIt hasn't been difficult for Germany to neglect one of its most significant and innovative composers: Weill, born in 1900, left the country in 1933 and vehemently rejected the idea of returning. He had a full life and career after settling in the United States, becoming an ambitious Broadway composer until his death in 1950.\\n\\nThe German critic Theodor Adorno dismissed Weill's American music as the work of a tunesmith and sellout, and much German thought followed in that vein. For decades, Germans performed almost solely a small fraction of his pre-1933 works, his collaborations with the brash poet and playwright Bertolt Brecht. In the United States, though, his early symphonic and stage works remained largely unknown.\\n\\nSlowly but surely, Germany has played catch-up with Weill's music — in particular through the Kurt Weill Festival in Dessau, currently celebrating its 25th anniversary. The festival, which ends this year on Sunday, March 12, began as a fantasy and has since grown into a microcosm of the work Germany has done to restore the legacy of a musical hero."}

In truth, the show doesn't explore much of anything; it, like its central character, just meanders along.\\n\\nCrashing is yet another comedy that is less interested in jokes than in wringing laughs out of awkward or humiliating situations, but it feels primitive compared with shows like, say, the FX series Baskets.

{"original": "Feb. 19 was the centenary of the birth of Carson McCullers, one of the most distinctive and ill-fated writers in American history. McCullers died when she was 50, in 1967. She suffered a series of strokes before she was 30, and spent much of her life in pain.\\n\\nEarlier this year, the Library of America published a volume of McCullers's short stories, plays, essays, memoirs and poems. But it's the author's fiction (also published by the Library of America, among others) that keeps her reputation strong a century on. Her debut, The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, is routinely listed among the best books of the 20th century, and Rose Feld's assessment of it in the Book Review in 1940 proves that its towering reputation was formed more or less immediately.\\n\\nNo matter what the age of its author, 'The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter' would be a remarkable book, Feld started. When one reads that Carson McCullers is a girl of 22 it becomes more than that. Maturity does not cover the quality of her work. It is something beyond that, something more akin to the vocation of pain to which a great poet is born.\\n\\nMcCullers was actually 23 at the time, but point taken.\\n\\nShe writes with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming, Feld said, concluding that we were to anticipate McCullers's second novel with something like fear, given the standard set by the first."}

{"original": "The government's repayment policy is an extension of its approach to British tourists or other citizens who get in trouble abroad and need help returning to the United Kingdom. People 18 years or older have to reimburse the government.\\n\\nThat age limit came into effect after The Guardian newspaper reported two years ago on a 17-year-old British teenager who sought help at the British embassy in Islamabad to escape a forced marriage in 2014. She had to sign a loan agreement and hand in her British passport before being allowed to return to the United Kingdom, and ultimately was billed more than $1,000, with her passport being held until she paid.\\n\\nAfter that, 16 and 17 year olds became exempt from the reimbursement policy.\\n\\nThe Times of London reported on four British women who were each charged roughly $900 for the government's efforts to free them from a religious institution in Somalia where they said they had been chained, whipped and told they would be held until they married.

Mr. Zhao did not have murderous intent, his lawyer said, despite the crime's violent aftermath, and so was guilty of manslaughter, not murder.\\n\\nBut the prosecutor countered that Mr. Zhao had confessed the killing to the police, including that he had used a power saw to cut up the body. As the judge read aloud the decision, Mr. Zhao, who was wearing a navy blue suit, stared forward calmly, listening intently to his interpreter.\\n\\nThe judge said the case had hinged on Mr. Zhao's mental state at the time of the shooting and whether he had the intent necessary for the crime to qualify as murder.\\n\\nThere will be a hearing next week to set a date for sentencing.

{"original": "Set and shot amid the Lebanese civil war, Ms. Saab's feature debut, A Suspended Life (1984), follows Samar, an independent-minded young girl reveling in the freedom afforded by warfare chaos. She thinks herself — and proclaims herself — free and able to do whatever I want, but the cost of her spirited wandering is a hymen-restoring operation imposed by her family.\\n\\nMs. Sabbag, who died in 2008, was equally provocative. Her early films include Sand Screens (1991), a drama centering on a woman determined to lead an uninhibited life in a deeply conservative society, and the sarcastically titled A Civilized People (1999), which touches on such discomfiting topics as homosexuality, the ill treatment of immigrant house servants and religious acrimony in Lebanese society. (The Lebanese government banned the film.)\\n\\nMs. Srour, Ms. Saab and Ms. Sabbag are among the women featured in Rebecca Hillauer's Encyclopedia of Arab Women Filmmakers. Ms. Hillauer notes in the preface that the book started with an investigation into the question Arab women filmmakers — do they exist? By the time she completed her research, she had enough material to expand what she had conceived as a small reference work into a tome of some 400 pages, covering women from Iraq to Egypt to Tunisia.\\n\\nSince the most recent version of Ms. Hillauer's book was released, in 2005, a number of younger Arab women have taken up film. In Morocco, Tunisia and Lebanon, women make up about a quarter of all new directors, and most focus largely on aspects of women's lives in the Arab world, according to Roy Armes's 2015 book New Voices in Arab Cinema. Mr. Armes credits the number of female directors to outside influence. Virtually all the women born in the 1960s and 1970s who have made a fictional feature have lived, worked, and/or trained abroad, he writes. There is no single pattern of entry to filmmaking, but it is notable that none of them has had the conventional, sheltered upbringing reserved for so many women in the Arab world. (Ms. Labaki, who has spent her life in Lebanon, is, as Mr. Armes points out, an exception.) This mass of educated and articulate women has changed the way in which a whole array of aspects of Arab society are experienced and depicted.\\n\\nMs. Hamoud and Ms. Labaki are entirely deserving of praise. They have made polished films with high production values, which are thoroughly engaging, often caustic and, at times, devastating. But they follow a path blazed by many women before them. Today they have a support system, which their predecessors lacked. The women before them worked away on their own, under much more dangerous conditions (including actual wars) and against much more pushback. But just like these contemporary Arab women directors, their work was acclaimed, welcomed and shown abroad, at leading European film festivals and on international movie screens. The output of the new wave of Arab female filmmakers — and even female writers and artists — should be viewed in the actual context of the history of Arab cinema, literature and art, and not with any misguided idea that these voices are emanating from a vacuum."}

That changed in the 2018 midterm elections, when Democrats took control of the Senate with the help of a number of young, liberal candidates who repeatedly challenged Mr. Cuomo, sometimes leading to heated conflicts.\\n\\nThat rift has already surfaced this year, as the governor and other Democrats grapple with the political fallout from a new law that sharply reduced the use of cash bail. The law went into effect on New Year's Day, and since then, concerns over a spate of anti-Semitic incidents and other recent alleged crimes committed by those released have led to calls for changes in the law, including by Mr. Cuomo himself.\\n\\nMr. Cuomo made no mention of the bail reform on Wednesday during his speech, which included quotations from George Washington, Henry David Thoreau and the singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, and an extended nautical theme, with mentions of rocky shores, rough seas, and a political and social superstorm of anger and divisive rhetoric.\\n\\nConsidering the state's financial straits, Mr. Cuomo leaned heavily on proposals that would need little or no state funding, like banning gun ownership for people who have committed certain misdemeanor crimes in other states, banning foam food containers and outlawing synthetic opioids similar to fentanyl."}
{"original": "With such a public subject, what could there be left to tell? Maher, a journalist based in Karachi, answers that question handily, and originally. A Woman Like Her is a model of how to report on celebrity: by focusing on the seedy characters who feed and exploit it, and by harvesting the details, especially at the seam between public and private, that more conventional journalists leave behind. Maher has an often thrillingly slant gaze, an eye alert to the absurdities, ironies and small tragedies at play in the manufacture of images and personas. Her book is full of unforgettable scenes and vignettes — Baloch, pretending to be a clueless urbanite, her stilettos sinking into the mud on a reality show set in a village like the one where she was raised; a television talk show blurring her cleavage-spot to capitalize on her risqué image, even though she is wearing nothing revealing. This tension over who is in control of Baloch's life drives the book.\\n\\nAmong Maher's wise choices is to accept that the very publicness of Baloch's life makes her, on some level, unknowable. She was a construction, down to her name, which was invented. (Indeed the disclosure of her real name by local media may have played a role in her death, by exposing her family to local ridicule and judgment.) Maher sprinkles the book with Baloch's own words, spoken and written, but she doesn't try to resolve their contradictions. Baloch was brave and foolish, phenomenally independent and pathetically needy, protective of her virtue and, as was her right, also willing to trade on it. She was a type (see: a Kardashian, to whom she was sometimes compared) but also only herself. She was proof, if we needed it, that a life can be lived simultaneously on the rise and on the run.\\n\\nMaher diligently traces Baloch's steps from her family home to an abusive marriage to the women's shelter where she resolves to leave her husband but also, permanently, her son, behind. From there Baloch moved through a series of disillusioning way stations, the limited menu for a woman on the make: bus hostess, model. Everywhere in these subcultures Maher finds women confined and commodified, desperately trying, and rarely succeeding, to govern their own lives. No wonder the internet seemed to offer Baloch a new kind of freedom, one worth the price of the abuse she received. Social media is not someone's father's property, she tells her critics. Everyone has the right to express their opinion on it. And yet this is a dark book, in which loyalty and kindness are outdone by exploitation and cruelty. Maher, for example, finds the young reporter who breathlessly raced to Baloch's family home after receiving a police tip about her murder. Dissatisfied with his scoop, he arranged to have the sheet covering her corpse removed so that he could photograph it, so he could see for himself. This is amorality without a floor."}

Researchers cite data collected in the 1980s to estimate the number of children born by donor sperm in the United States at anywhere from 30,000 to 60,000 a year, though advocates push back even on that range, saying there are no dependable figures because there is no regulation. Sperm banking itself was about a $4 billion industry in 2018.\\n\\nThere have always been infertile straight couples in need of donor sperm, but with the legalization of gay marriage and the rise of elective single motherhood, the market has expanded over the last decade. About 20 percent of sperm bank clients are heterosexual couples, 60 percent are gay women, and 20 percent are single moms by choice, the banks said.\\n\\nTo meet this demand, men provided sperm at a steady rate for years, some banks said. But the coronavirus changed things. Existing donors were scared to go in. New donor sign-ups stopped for months during lockdown and never really bounced back at some banks. Several banks said that they had a lot of old frozen sperm in storage, but that it could last only so long.\\n\\nDonor recruiting is a growing challenge, said Scott Brown, vice president of strategic alliances for California Cryobank.

{"original": "The academy said that 62 women were nominated across all categories, a record. The documentary branch nominated four feature-length films that were directed or co-directed by women: American Factory, about a Chinese billionaire who reopened an Ohio automotive plant; The Edge of Democracy, which focused on Brazilian politics; For Sama, about a woman's life in war-torn Syria; and Honeyland, which looks at a female beekeeper in the Republic of North Macedonia. The fifth documentary nominee was The Cave, the story of female physicians in Syria who treat patients in an underground hospital.\\n\\nNominating American Factory was the equivalent of sending an Oscar invitation to Barack and Michelle Obama. The former president and first lady have a multiyear production deal with Netflix, and American Factory, produced with Participant Media, was their first release.\\n\\nOver the last decade, the Academy Awards have become a bit superfluous, with a torrent of precursor ceremonies leaving fans (and honorees) exhausted and the contents of the envelopes unsurprising. The academy's board of governors, alarmed by sharp declines in television ratings, decided in 2018 to move up this year's ceremony. It will be held on Feb. 9, two weeks earlier than the last go-round, a seemingly small truncation that nonetheless has the movie capital in a tizzy.\\n\\nABC, which broadcasts the Oscars, said last week that the ceremony, viewed by roughly 30 million people in the United States, would not have a host for the second year in a row. Hosting is a thankless job that many celebrities turn down; fully vetting a host (scrubbing their social media accounts for potentially offensive comments) is time-consuming and far from foolproof; and last year's host-free show stopped the ratings free-fall."}

{"original": "THE PUSH\\n\\nBy Ashley Audrain\\n\\nIs my child's behavior normal? It's a parenting question for the ages, particularly at a time when a certain type of parent (present company included) frets over every childhood quirk, no matter how mundane. Does the preschooler with a predilection for hitting need a professional intervention, or maybe just a taekwondo class? Is the kid who drops naps but not tantrums a future rageaholic? This sort of hand-wringing, at its most extreme, is at the center of Ashley Audrain's taut, chilling debut novel, The Push.\\n\\nBlythe Connor is reluctant to become a parent — understandably so. Her own mother abandoned her when she was 11, after years of cruelty. Her grandmother, also abusive, departed in a more gruesome way: by hanging herself from a tree in the front yard. Blythe is primed, perhaps even genetically programmed, for maternal struggle. I think the baby hates me, she says just days after giving birth to her first child, a daughter named Violet. Their relationship goes downhill from there.\\n\\nBlythe's postpartum experience is familiar, and Audrain renders it flawlessly. Breastfeeding isn't a spontanous success, for one thing; a nurse stood over us and stared at Violet and my huge brown nipple as she tried to latch again. Blythe struggles to adapt to motherhood and she sees seismic shifts in her relationship to her husband, Fox. Noticeably absent is any sense of joy or wonder. I was so disappointed she was mine, Blythe says of Violet. She admits to ignoring her baby's cries for hours on end.\\n\\nIt would be easy to chalk up these difficulties to postpartum depression if it weren't for the periodic reminders of Blythe's traumatic family history, woven through the book in stand-alone chapters. Blythe's mother hit her and often disappeared for a night or two at a time. Blythe's grandmother routinely locked Blythe's mother out of the house after school and once held her head underwater in the bathtub, nearly drowning her."}
{"original": "The friendship/hateship between Susan and Ro, the ways in which each experiences the mere existence of the other as both a reproach and a criticism, is one of the great delights of this lyrical and beautifully observed reflection on women's lives. Ro cannot stop thinking of Susan's offhand remark that you don't truly become an adult until you have kids. Susan is preoccupied with the thought of Ro's questioning her reasons for changing her surname: How come nobody's allowed to criticize a woman's decision to give up her name for a man's name? Just because it's her choice? I can think of some other bad choices that—. Both women keep lists: Ro's is a self-flagellating inventory of reasons it's a bad idea for an unwed 42-year-old to raise a child; Susan's is a lengthy accounting of the unrelenting and grindingly dull routine of raising children: Herd crumbs into palm. Spray table. Wipe down table. Rinse cups and bowls, and on and on. Susan's resentment of Ro's rich intellectual life means the exhausted mother can't empathize with the single teacher's loneliness. But Ro's corresponding resentment of Susan's full family life means she can't empathize, either, with her friend's boredom and despair. These carefully chosen details feel urgent in our present moment, when women are constantly encouraged to compete with one another to attain an unattainable ideal of our gender.\\n\\nIf there is a criticism to be made of this highly absorbing novel, it is that it feels perhaps a shade too contemporary, and never quite reveals the horrors that would surely follow if the pre-Roe v. Wade days were to repeat themselves. The one disaster that has occurred — to Mattie's friend Yasmine — is elided from the action of the novel, and rendered soft-focus and ambiguous. The reader is left to wonder what it would be like to be a pregnant teenager of color under these new laws. Mattie's journey to try to terminate her pregnancy is far less demeaning and terrifying than the hardships endured by some women living in states with few legal, safe abortion clinics. Gin stands trial, but it's clear from early on that the forces conspiring against her would have seen her accused of a crime with or without the new laws. Having read one's Paley, one feels while reading Zumas's book that yes, this imagined dystopia is terrible, but the reality would be far worse.\\n\\nMaybe, though, it is almost impossible to write the truth about these things without seeming — how like a woman! — hysterical. As with the return of fascism and the measles outbreak, it's difficult to believe that mere foolishness and complacency could return us to the bad old days until we actually see it happen. And the novel gives the reader much to enjoy in the meantime. Zumas is a skillful writer, expertly keeping each of her characters in balanced motion, never allowing one to dominate the rest. Her cunning device of not revealing the name of each character in the sections she narrates grants us a multidimensional perspective on all four women, highlighting their roles in one another's stories. It's a beautiful metaphor for the interdependence of women's lives — for the way that, as Paley would remind us, the laws that imprison or criminalize one of us narrow the options for all of us.\\n\\nFloating over the narrative of Red Clocks, too, is the figure of Eivor Minervudottir, the subject of Ro's biography. This Arctic explorer's fierce yet cool interest in the natural world provides Zumas's suggested answer to the question: What is a woman when she is by herself? If, as Virginia Woolf posited, a woman must have … a room of her own — and, one is tempted to add, a womb of her own — to be able to create, then why are we so fearful of what nonsexual, nonreproductive passions could emerge from female solitude? And, if Minervudottir's tale never quite coheres, never quite touches the rest of the book, then her very ice-floe remoteness becomes a stark reminder of our society's detachment from a world in which a woman could simply and happily be left alone."}
{"original": "Time passed. She sold her house, she moved to a retirement community. This is the shrinkage that takes place in the modern story of the very long life: First comes love, then marriage, the baby in the carriage, and after decades, the retirement joint with craft classes, edifying programs, exercise routines, followed by the broken hip, assisted living, and finally, the dementia unit, the lockup.\\n\\nLarge house to one-bedroom apartment to studio apartment until you're in a small room that has little else in it but a bed. Home is bed. Home is also your mind, as always, only your mind may not retain much of that long life or even what happened five minutes ago. What has surprised me in all that shrinkage isn't the fact that my mother has again found love — because at 95 she is still pretty, kind and witty — but how she's found the attachments that seem very like marriages. Love, it turns out, comes on the wings of assigned seating.\\n\\nShe has entered into two significant unions since my father's death 35 years ago. The first occurred in assisted living, when at mealtimes she had to sit with Violet, full of complaint, and Bud, who grumbled nonstop when he wasn't singing Gilbert and Sullivan, and Bob, who didn't speak at all. After some time Bob departed and a man I'll call Pete Gilbert appeared. Oh, Pete Gilbert, as if floated down from the heavens, a cheerful, insightful man in a soft plaid shirt. He was interested in the world, he loved to read, and he had narrative skills. My mother, for her part, made him laugh. He had immediate affection for her, and soon an abiding tenderness. They did not spend time together away from the dining room table; it wasn't that kind of thing. The essentials of true marriage had once more changed in my thinking, so that now I knew it actually involved only the enormity that is Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner, day after day. That, it still seems to me, is the crux of real companionship, time spent over the grapefruit, the grilled cheese, the tilapia. I take you to be my beloved Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. Until Assigned Seating says otherwise.\\n\\nAfter many fine meals together my mother had to leave Pete for the lockup. By the time he joined her nine months later she'd forgotten their years together, and he was too infirm to actively love her company as he'd once done, although he never forgot the fact of his affection. This is how it ends, he said to me, waving weakly at my mother from his new table, across the room from hers.\\n\\nHe looks familiar, she said, but meanwhile, she'd had the good luck to be with a new tablemate, Eleanor. Her third marriage, her last, we think. It's an ancient story, the widows providing companionship, one to the other. And protection. Recently, when Lucille started eating Eleanor's cupcake, my mother cried, No, Doodle! That's Doodle's cupcake, not yours. Even though everyone is now Doodle, Eleanor is the significant Doodle. How miraculous, that when so much is lost there is still the possibility of deep friendship; the name is immaterial. The two women have an affinity beyond words, but they also share jokes that sometimes extend for as long as 10 seconds. There is comfort sitting silently side by side, comfort, I'm sure, knowing they are together in the same strange boat."}

{"original": "In 2017, Simon & Schuster canceled a book by the professional provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos after he gave an interview in which he appeared to condone pedophilia. His contract reportedly did not include a morality clause, and he sued, though he later dropped the suit. If a morality clause did lead to a book's cancellation, we probably wouldn't know it, according to Devereux Chatillon, a partner in the media and intellectual property law firm Chatillon Weiss who has represented both The New Yorker and writers. It wouldn't be public unless somebody sued over it, she said. And even then, the lawsuit probably wouldn't come to light.\\n\\nMorality clauses may be relatively new to mainstream publishing, but they have a long history. The entertainment industry started drafting them in 1921, when the silent-movie star Fatty Arbuckle, who had just signed a then-astonishing $1 million contract with Paramount Pictures, was accused of the rape and manslaughter of a girl at a party. Mr. Arbuckle was acquitted after two mistrials, but by then the public had soured on him, and the studios wanted out.\\n\\nToday the clauses are widespread in sports, television and advertising. Religious publishers have used them for at least 15 years, which seems fair enough. You can't condemn a Christian publisher that cancels publication of a book called The Ridiculously Good Marriage after the author is accused of having sexually assaulted an underage girl when he was a youth pastor. (He apologized for a sexual incident.) Children's publishers have been including the clauses for a decade or more, and they, too, have a case. It would be challenging to sell a children's book written by a pedophile.\\n\\nMaybe you don't find morality clauses alarming under any circumstances. If what you're selling me is your reputation, if that's what I'm paying you for, then I should not have to pay you if your reputation tanks, said Rick Kurnit, a partner in Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz, a firm specializing in art and entertainment law.\\n\\nMaybe you're asking: Why should anyone get away with being a racist or sexist jerk? What gives Mr. Alexie, accused of hitting on women who saw him as a mentor, and Mr. Díaz, accused of forcibly kissing someone, the right to have their books published? Or even: Why should opinion writers be allowed to gratuitously insult duly elected officials? If a loudmouth suffers from a backlash, this reasoning goes, he probably deserves it.\\n\\nThe problem with letting publishers back out of contracts with noncelebrity, nonreligious, non-children's book authors on the grounds of immorality is that immorality is a slippery concept. Publishers have little incentive to clarify what they mean by it, and the public is fickle in what it takes umbrage at.\\n\\nIn 1947, the concern was Communism, and morality clauses gave studios a way to blacklist the Hollywood 10, a group of directors and screenwriters who denounced the House Un-American Activities Committee as illegitimate and refused to say whether they'd ever been Communists. All 10 went to jail, and all but one, who decided to cooperate with the committee, became unemployable until the 1960s, though some continued to write under pseudonyms."}

A declining number of newborns was exceeded by a growing number of deaths, according to census data released by the South Korean government.\\n\\nFor years, population experts have warned that demographic trends in South Korea, like those in Japan, show declining growth — a bad signal for replenishing the labor force and caring for retirees and other older people as they become a larger share of society.

She's so open and unaffected about her intentions that several of the men she kills mutter Sorry when they try to escape.\\n\\nMs. Comer is good in the showier part of Villanelle, but it's Ms. Oh who makes sure that the series is more than a cute gloss on the glamorous international caper. She gets across Eve's vague but not terminal dissatisfaction with her job and marriage, her nerdiness (one boss calls her a tiresome thinkbucket), and her anger and fear when Villanelle makes their game lethally personal. And she never stops being funny, whether upbraiding her superiors, espousing conspiracy theories or being water-tortured.\\n\\nIn the press materials for Killing Eve, Ms. Waller-Bridge talks about her desire to subvert the spy-action-thriller genre, and the show is described (in publicist-speak) as the thunder of empowered women working in front of and behind the camera. And it's certainly true that scenes and characterizations play out differently than we're used to. When Eve, freaked out by all the killing, impulsively shatters a bus-stop partition, the mood instantly shifts to comic as she frantically paws at the shards of glass in her hair. A traitor's I had to do it for my family speech sounds pathetic coming from a feckless, overbearing male agent.\\n\\nThe subversions of Killing Eve (through seven episodes) mostly consist of gender switching rather than fundamental rethinking, though. Watching the series, you're just as conscious of its congruences with standard examples of the genre (like Berlin Station on Epix) as you are of the differences. And while Ms. Waller-Bridge's comic style is distinctive, her characters are not entirely new — we've seen aspects of them in La Femme Nikita, Covert Affairs, Homeland and any number of stories about female mutual obsession."}
{"original": "Presidential Transition Highlights: N.S.A. Will Install a Trump Loyalist as Its General Counsel Vice President-elect Kamala Harris plans to resign from her Senate seat on Monday. An impeachment prosecutor said President Trump committed the most serious presidential crime in U.S. history. This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the presidential transition.\\n\\nThe N.S.A. is installing a Trump loyalist as its general counsel days before Biden's inauguration. Allies of Michael Ellis, a Trump loyalist, had pushed for him to be installed as the National Security Agency's top lawyer before President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is inaugurated. Credit... Saul Loeb/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The National Security Agency is moving forward with hiring a Trump administration loyalist, the agency said Sunday, after the acting defense secretary ordered he be made the spy agency's top lawyer. Acting Defense Secretary Christopher C. Miller had ordered the agency's director, Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, to install Michael Ellis as its general counsel, giving him a 6 p.m. Saturday deadline. The deadline came and went with the National Security Agency remaining silent. But the agency said in a statement on Sunday that Mr. Ellis accepted his final job offer yesterday afternoon. N.S.A. is moving forward with his employment. Mr. Ellis has not been formally sworn in, and it is not clear when that would happen. Mr. Ellis has been accused of having a hand in one of the more contentious legal decisions the Trump administration made: the attempt to stop John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, from publishing a damning book about the president. Mr. Ellis's allies had pushed for him to be installed before President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is inaugurated. While it will be difficult to fire Mr. Ellis under Civil Service rules, the Biden administration could easily reassign him to another, less important post. A senior official at the National Security Council and a former top lawyer to Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Ellis applied months ago to be the National Security Agency's general counsel. He was one of three finalists, although he did not get the highest score from the panel evaluating the candidates, according to people familiar with the hiring process. Nevertheless, White House officials told the Defense Department general counsel that the administration favored Mr. Ellis for the job. Positioning a political appointee in a Civil Service job is a complex procedure requiring various approvals to prevent favoritism in the hiring process. With Mr. Ellis, the Office of Personnel Management eventually determined that the general counsel position was exempt from a policy requiring special approval, though those deliberations slowed the process. Mr. Ellis also had to seek a new security clearance. Although General Nakasone was not pleased that Mr. Ellis was chosen over career officials at the National Security Agency, he did not actively block or slow the process of installing Mr. Ellis in the position, according to two people familiar with the matter. He did however, insist that all procedures were followed and all approvals be put in writing. Frustrated by what they saw as a slow-rolling of Mr. Ellis's installation, the Pentagon ordered the National Security Agency to swear him in, a move The Washington Post reported on Saturday. Although Mr. Ellis had no formal training in the classification of national security information, he overruled the decision by a career official to clear Mr. Bolton's book for publication. The Justice Department, under pressure from Mr. Trump, has sued Mr. Bolton to recoup his profits from book. A judge overseeing the case issued a ruling on Thursday that makes it highly likely that Mr. Bolton's lawyer, Chuck Cooper, can question White House officials, like Mr. Ellis, about whether the classification decisions were made in bad faith.

Amr Alfiky/The New York Times Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, who remains a United States senator from California, plans to resign from her seat on Monday ahead of her inauguration two days later, a Harris aide said. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, a fellow Democrat, will appoint a successor to Ms. Harris, who was elected in 2016. Mr. Newsom said last month that he intended to tap Alex Padilla, California's secretary of state, for the seat. Mr. Padilla's Senate term will expire in 2022, when he can seek re-election. Ms. Harris continued to attend Senate sessions after her November election, and was in the Capitol for the certification of the election results this month when the building was stormed by a violent mob of Trump supporters. Ms. Harris will be sworn in as vice president on Wednesday by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a ceremony in which the first woman of color to become vice president will take her oath from the first woman of color to sit on the Supreme Court. Ms. Harris chose Justice Sotomayor for the task, according to a Harris aide who was confirming a report by ABC News. The vice president-elect and Justice Sotomayor have a shared background as former prosecutors. And Ms. Harris has called the justice a figure of national inspiration. Judge Sonia Sotomayor has fought for the voices of the people ever since her first case voting against corporations in Citizens United, Ms. Harris wrote on Twitter in 2019. As a critical voice on the bench, she's showing all our children what's possible. Justice Sotomayor, who was confirmed to the Supreme Court in 2009, swore in Joseph R. Biden Jr. for his second term as vice president in January 2013 (first in a private ceremony and again in public the next day because of a quirk of the calendar).\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nRaskin, lead impeachment prosecutor, says Trump is guilty of 'the most serious presidential crime' in U.S. history. Representative Jamie Raskin, center, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi at a meeting of House impeachment managers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times Representative Jamie Raskin, the Maryland Democrat who will lead the prosecution of President Trump in a Senate trial, vigorously defended the impeachment effort on Sunday, arguing that Mr. Trump needed to be held accountable even after he leaves office for his role in inciting a mob of loyalists that culminated in a deadly riot and the first occupation of the Capitol in two centuries. This was the most serious presidential crime in the history of the United States of America — the most dangerous crime by a president ever committed against the United States, Mr. Raskin, a constitutional law professor, said on CNN's State of the Union. Everything is due to his actions. Mr. Raskin took on the high-profile role of lead impeachment manager this month soon after burying his 25-year-old son, Tommy, who died by suicide on New Year's Eve. I'm not going to lose my son at the end of 2020 and lose my country and my republic in 2021, Mr. Raskin told CNN's Jake Tapper, as he delivered a heartfelt eulogy. Another of the nine impeachment managers, Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, said on ABC's This Week that the team would not need much lead time to move forward with a Senate trial. We're preparing as though we're going to go in the next hour, he said. Both Mr. Raskin and Mr. Castro declined to offer details about when the impeachment article against Mr. Trump would be brought to the Senate or whether Democrats would push to call witnesses in the trial. No witnesses were called in Mr. Trump's first impeachment trial, which unfolded last year while the chamber was controlled by Republicans. Democrats will control the Senate for this second trial. The remarks by Democrats defending the impeachment effort came as Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, wrote a letter to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, calling for a vote to dismiss the article of impeachment. Mr. Graham argued that a trial after Mr. Trump's departure was unconstitutional and would further divide the country. In an interview on Fox News's Sunday Morning Futures, Mr. Graham also called the strategy insane on every level and urged President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. to call on members of his party to change course. If you don't stand up against the impeachment of Donald Trump after he leaves office, you're an incredibly weak figure in American history, Mr. Graham said, directly addressing Mr. Biden. He also claimed, without further explanation, that Mr. Trump was trying to heal the nation. But even as Mr. Graham lobbied his Republican colleagues to vote against convicting Mr. Trump and offered a stream of flattery about the president's success in office, he rejected the suggestion that Mr. Trump should pardon any members of the mob before leaving office. I don't care if you went there and spread flowers on the floor, Mr. Graham said of the rioters. You breached the security of the Capitol. Other Republicans maintained that the House has moved too quickly to impeach. Representative Nancy Mace, a first-term Republican from South Carolina who voted against impeachment, said that the House had every right to impeach the president but that the process should have been more deliberate. The fact that we bypassed Judiciary, we did not open up an investigation, that we bypassed due process, that set a dangerous constitutional precedent for others, she said on NBC's Meet the Press. No matter — even if you think the president is guilty as hell, like many, many do believe, there has to be due process, there has to be an investigation. When asked if she felt the same way as Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas, who revealed last week that he feared his vote against impeachment would ultimately put him on the wrong side of this debate after more facts came to light, Ms. Mace said that she was also concerned. She argued that more Republicans would have backed the effort if more due process had been allowed beforehand. She pointed to a bipartisan push behind censuring the president, which she said was blocked by Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Kayana Szymczak for The New York Times The Biden administration is tapping two financial regulators from the Obama administration to oversee key departments that had loosened their grip of the industry under President Trump, according to two people with knowledge of the plans. Gary Gensler, who led the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the Obama administration from 2009 to 2014, will be President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s nominee to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, these people said. Also, Rohit Chopra, the former assistant director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has been chosen to run that agency. Mr. Gensler is a veteran regulator who played a central role in bringing the big banks to heel in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, giving new teeth to a watchdog agency. Lately, as an academic, he has been schooling himself on digital currencies like Bitcoin that have become an important part of the S.E.C.'s regulatory mandate. Mr. Gensler, 63, will step into an agency that has faced criticism as being too lenient in pursuing high-profile cases involving Wall Street and corporate America. The agency that Mr. Chopra will take over has been defanged under Mr. Trump. Created as a brainchild of Senator Elizabeth Warren as part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, the consumer bureau was made largely ineffectual after Mr. Trump appointed Mick Mulvaney to run it as interim chair. He pledged to run the agency with humility and prudence and requested no funding from the Federal Reserve. Kathy Kraninger, who took over as director of the agency in 2018, has been lambasted by Democrats for undermining the bureau, which they have accused of denying consumers of millions of dollars in relief. Democrats have been pressuring Ms. Kraninger to resign or face being fired.

The brisk market for pardons reflects the access peddling that has defined the Trump presidency as well as President Trump's unorthodox approach to exercising unchecked presidential clemency powers. Credit... Samuel Corum for The New York Times As President Trump prepares to leave office in days, a lucrative market for pardons is coming to a head, with some of his allies collecting fees from wealthy felons or their associates to push the White House for clemency, according to documents and interviews with more than three dozen lobbyists and lawyers. One lobbyist, Brett Tolman, a former federal prosecutor who has been advising the White House on pardons and commutations, has monetized his clemency work, collecting tens of thousands of dollars, and possibly more, in recent weeks to lobby the White House for clemency for the son of a former Arkansas senator; the founder of the notorious online drug marketplace Silk Road; and a Manhattan socialite who pleaded guilty in a fraud scheme. Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer John M. Dowd has marketed himself to convicted felons as someone who could secure pardons because of his close relationship with the president, accepting tens of thousands of dollars from a wealthy felon and advising him and other potential clients to leverage Mr. Trump's grievances about the justice system. A onetime top adviser to the Trump campaign was paid $50,000 to help seek a pardon for John Kiriakou, a former C.I.A. officer convicted of illegally disclosing classified information, and agreed to a $50,000 bonus if the president granted it, according to a copy of an agreement. And Mr. Kiriakou was separately told that Mr. Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani could help him secure a pardon for $2 million. Mr. Kiriakou rejected the offer, but an associate, fearing that Mr. Giuliani was illegally selling pardons, alerted the F.B.I. Mr. Giuliani challenged this characterization. After Mr. Trump's impeachment for inciting his supporters before the deadly riot at the Capitol, and with Republican leaders turning on him, the pardon power remains one of the last and most likely outlets for quick unilateral action by an increasingly isolated, erratic president. He has suggested to aides he wants to take the extraordinary and unprecedented step of pardoning himself, though it was not clear whether he had broached the topic since the rampage. He has also discussed issuing pre-emptive pardons to his children, his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, and Mr. Giuliani. A White House spokesman declined to comment. Michael S. Schmidt and\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nTwitter temporarily suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene's personal account. Twitter has temporarily suspended the personal account of Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican and supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory, citing multiple violations of the company's civic integrity policy. The move, confirmed by a company spokesperson on Sunday, came days after the platform banned President Trump over concerns that his continued use of the platform could incite more episodes of violence like the attack on the Capitol this month. A news release issued by Ms. Greene's congressional campaign, including what appeared to be screenshots of her account, said the suspension would last 12 hours. Her account's last tweet included a video in which Ms. Greene repeated baseless claims of voter fraud, blaming elected leaders in Georgia for failing to act ahead of the Senate runoff races that resulted in Republicans losing their majority. Below the video, Twitter posted a warning that the claim of election fraud was disputed. The company also disabled replies, retweets and likes due to risk of violence, an alert that also appears on other tweets by Ms. Greene. Ms. Greene's election to Congress last year signaled a major victory for QAnon, the once-fringe pro-Trump movement that the F.B.I. has warned poses a domestic terrorism threat. In the statement, Ms. Greene criticized the borderline monopolistic stranglehold of a few big tech companies over American political discourse and urged Congress to stop what she called censorship. After the rampage at the Capitol, Twitter updated its civic integrity policy to aggressively increase our enforcement action on misleading and false claims about the presidential election, the platform said. Several days after the riot, Twitter said it had suspended more than 70,000 accounts — though in many of those instances one person operated multiple accounts — that promoted QAnon-associated content and were primarily dedicated to spreading the conspiracy theory. After the Capitol riot, other platforms also moved to cut off Mr. Trump and others making false claims about the election. Facebook blocked the president from its platforms through at least the end of his term.\\n\\nAs Kamala Harris makes history this week, so will her big, blended family. The extended family of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, includes stepchildren, nieces and an ex-wife. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times When Kamala Harris is sworn in as vice president, she will represent many firsts: First female vice president. First Black woman. First woman of Indian descent. But there is another milestone that will be on display: that of her family. As Ms. Harris ascends to this barrier-breaking role, millions of Americans will see a more expansive version of the American family staring back at them — one that could broaden rigid ideas of politically palatable family dynamics or gender roles. It's striking, said Ralph Richard Banks, a law professor at Stanford who has written about race, gender and family patterns. In some ways they are at the frontier of different aspects of American families and how they're changing. Ms. Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, was raised with both Christian and Hindu practices, while her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is white, grew up attending Jewish summer camp. She was in her 40s when they married, older than the median age of first marriage for women in this country, though that number continues to rise. Mr. Emhoff was divorced, with two children from his previous marriage, making his children, Cole and Ella, among the one in four who do not live with both biological parents, according to the Census Bureau. Ms. Harris did not have children. In her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in August, Ms. Harris spoke about her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, an immigrant who came to California as a teenager and raised Kamala and her sister, Maya, after she and their father divorced. For most of Ms. Harris's life, it was the three of them. When Maya became pregnant at 17 with her daughter, Meena, it became four. When their family gathers this week in Washington, it will be the first time they've all seen each other in more than two months. The last time was the week of the election, gathered at a house in Delaware, where they passed the time with games, karaoke, food — and waited, anxiously, for the official results to come in. There was one night that just turned into a dance party, Cole said. In other words, just a family hanging out — hoping for history to be made.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nLoews Hotels says it won't host a fund-raiser with Senator Josh Hawley. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri challenged the legitimacy of Pennsylvania's electoral votes hours after a mob attacked the Capitol this month. Credit... Win Mcnamee/Getty Images Loews Hotels said on Saturday that it would not host a fund-raiser with Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, the latest indication that many companies are distancing themselves from Republicans who voted to overturn the election results. Fighting for Missouri, a political action committee affiliated with Mr. Hawley, had planned to host a fun-filled, family-friendly Orlando weekend event with the senator at the Loews Portofino Bay Hotel in Orlando, Fla., from Feb. 12 to Feb. 15, according to an invitation for the event. Tickets were being sold for $1,000 to $5,000, depending on the size of the group. But Loews said that the fund-raiser had been called off after the deadly riot at the Capitol, which many Democrats and Republicans have blamed in part on Mr. Hawley and other members of his party who supported President Trump's efforts to stop the certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory. We are horrified and opposed to the events at the Capitol and all who supported and incited the actions, the company said on Twitter. In light of those events and for the safety of our guests and team members, we have informed the host of the Feb. fund-raiser that it will no longer be held at Loews Hotels. Mr. Hawley sharply criticized the decision by Loews, which was established in 1960 and owns or operates 26 properties in the United States and Canada. If these corporations don't want conservatives to speak, they should just be honest about it, he said in a statement. But to equate leading a debate on the floor of the Senate with inciting violence is a lie, and it's dangerous. I will not be deterred from representing my constituents, and I will not bow to left-wing corporate pressure. Mr. Hawley persisted in his challenge to the election results even after the mob was cleared out of the Capitol this month, forcing the House and Senate into two hours of debate over Pennsylvania's electoral votes even though he never made a specific charge of wrongdoing. The rejection by Loews came after Simon & Schuster said that it would cancel the publication of an upcoming book by Mr. Hawley, The Tyranny of Big Tech, which had been scheduled to be published in June. Simon & Schuster said that it had made the decision because we take seriously our larger public responsibility as citizens, and cannot support Senator Hawley after his role in what became a dangerous threat. Mr. Hawley had said the cancellation could not be more Orwellian, and added, We'll see you in court. In recent days, a flurry of companies have suspended donations to some of the Republicans who voted to block the certification of the Electoral College results. Morgan Stanley said it was suspending all PAC contributions to members of Congress who did not vote to certify the results. Marriott said it would pause donations from its PAC to those who voted against certification of the election. And the chemicals giant Dow said it was suspending all PAC contributions to any member of Congress who voted to object to the certification of the presidential election.\\n\\nBiden plans to roll out dozens of executive orders in his first 10 days as president. Credit... Amr Alfiky/The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., inheriting a collection of crises unlike any in generations, plans to start his administration with dozens of executive directives on top of expansive legislative proposals in a 10-day blitz meant to signal a turning point for a nation reeling from disease, economic turmoil, racial strife and now the aftermath of the assault on the Capitol. Mr. Biden's team has developed a raft of decrees that he can issue on his own authority after the inauguration on Wednesday to begin reversing some of President Trump's most hotly disputed policies. Advisers hope the flurry of action, without waiting for Congress, will establish a sense of momentum for the new president even as the Senate puts his predecessor on trial. On his first day in office alone, Mr. Biden intends a flurry of executive orders that will be partly substantive and partly symbolic. They include rescinding the travel ban on several predominantly Muslim countries; rejoining the Paris climate change accord; extending pandemic-related limits on evictions and student loan payments; issuing a mask mandate for federal property and interstate travel; and ordering agencies to figure out how to reunite children separated from their families after crossing the border, according to a memo circulated on Saturday by Ron Klain, his incoming White House chief of staff, and obtained by The New York Times. The blueprint of executive action comes after Mr. Biden announced that he will push Congress to pass a $1.9 trillion package of economic stimulus and pandemic relief, signaling a willingness to be aggressive on policy issues and confronting Republicans from the start to take their lead from him. He also plans to send sweeping immigration legislation on his first day in office, providing a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people living in the country illegally. Along with his promise to vaccinate 100 million Americans for the coronavirus in his first 100 days, it is an expansive set of priorities for a new president that could be a defining test of his deal-making abilities and command of the federal government. Michael D. Shear and\\n\\nSince impeachment, some Republicans have said Kevin McCarthy has not been loyal enough to the president. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California is entering his eighth term in the House. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times BAKERSFIELD, Calif. — Representative Kevin McCarthy of California has been pilloried nationally and throughout the state for being loyal to President Trump to the bitter end — voting to overturn the election results hours after a mob of the president's supporters stormed the Capitol and urging censure of the president instead of impeachment. Democrats and some Republicans called on him to step down. The anti-Trump Lincoln Project released an ad calling him a pathetic enabler and urging his staff to pack up your desk and leave that loser behind. A scathing Sacramento Bee editorial denounced him for having a soulless lack of principle and for abusing his authority to promote big, dangerous lies about the election. But in his home district — one of the most conservative in California — Mr. McCarthy has been under fire for not being loyal enough. The split illustrates the gulf between the national outrage over the violence at the Capitol and the local hold the president still has on conservative parts of the country. Mr. McCarthy's district, which includes the city of Bakersfield and most of Kern and Tulare Counties in the San Joaquin Valley south of Sacramento and north of Los Angeles, is a place where oil, agriculture and MAGA dominate. Some Republicans said Mr. McCarthy, the son of an assistant chief with the Bakersfield Fire Department, has done too much for conservative voters in the region for them to abandon him. They believe his delicate navigation of the events in Washington in recent days — speaking out against impeachment but saying the president bears responsibility for the attack on Congress by rioters — would not hurt him significantly in his district as he eyes becoming speaker of the House in two years. Mr. McCarthy, now entering his eighth term in the House, has become a kingmaker of sorts in Kern County, helping his allies climb the political ranks, and enjoys a reservoir of good will among Republicans. But the events of this month in Washington have brought Mr. McCarthy, 55, more criticism than he is accustomed to in his hometown.

Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 2:23 - 0:00 transcript Science Is About 'Hope,' Biden Says President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris introduced key members of their White House science team on Saturday. We know that science is discovery, it's not fiction. It's also about hope, and that's America. It's in the DNA of this country, hope. We're on the cusp of some of the most remarkable breakthroughs that will fundamentally change the way of life for all life on this planet. We can make more progress in the next 10 years, I predict, than we've made in the last 50 years. Today, I'm proud to announce a team of some of the country's most brilliant and accomplished scientists to lead the way. The opportunities we have and the challenges we face are greater than ever before. The president-elect knows that science and technology will be crucial in meeting this moment. And he has tasked us in this letter, and I don't mean, just his scientific advisers, I mean, the whole scientific community and the American public with answering important questions about how science and technology can best be used to advance our health, our economic welfare, and our national security. Perhaps never before in living memory have the connections between our scientific world and our social world been quite so stark as they are today. The Covid-19 crisis has inflicted extraordinary suffering. But it has also held up a mirror to our society, reflecting in its deadly wake, resource gaps and medical disparities, the inequality we've allowed to calcify. Science at its core is a social phenomenon. It is a reflection of people, of our relationships and of our institutions. When we provide inputs to the algorithm, when we program the device, when we design, test and research, we are making human choices, choices that bring our social world to bear in a new and powerful way. It matters who makes these choices. The science behind climate change is not a hoax. The science behind the virus is not partisan. The same laws apply. The same evidence holds true regardless of whether or not you accept them. And President-elect Biden and I will not only listen to science, we will invest in it. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris introduced key members of their White House science team on Saturday. Credit Credit... Amr Alfiky/The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Saturday that he was always going to lead with science and truth as he announced top science and technology officials on his White House staff, reaffirming trust in the kind of expert research that the Trump administration often ignored or disdained. Extolling what he called some of the most brilliant minds in the world, Mr. Biden said his new team's mission would be to ask: How can we make the impossible possible? He vowed to elevate scientific research and thinking on topics like the coronavirus, cancer research, climate change, clean-energy jobs, artificial intelligence, 3-D printing and other fast-advancing technologies. The appointees included Eric S. Lander, whom Mr. Biden will nominate to be director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, a position that will for the first time hold cabinet rank. President Trump left the position of science adviser unfilled for 18 months and his administration routinely ignored the guidance of government scientists on issues ranging from the coronavirus pandemic to climate change. Without specifically mentioning Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris drew an implicit contrast with his administration's dismissive attitude toward expert opinion. The science behind climate change is not a hoax, Ms. Harris said during the introductions, held at the Queen Theater in Wilmington, Del. The science behind the virus is not a lie. Dr. Lander, who will also serve as presidential science adviser, was a leader of the Human Genome Project. As Dr. Lander's deputy in the science and technology office, Alondra Nelson, whom was also named by Mr. Biden, is a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study, who has studied the intersection of science with social inequality and race. Mr. Biden also named two co-chairs of the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology: Frances H. Arnold, the first American woman to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and Maria Zuber, a geophysics and planetary science expert and the first woman to lead a NASA spacecraft mission. Mr. Biden also said that Dr. Francis S. Collins would remain as the director of the National Institutes of Health. Earlier on Saturday, the Biden-Harris transition team announced several nominations to the State Department, including that of Brian P. McKeon, who has worked with Mr. Biden for more than 25 years, to be deputy secretary of state for management and resources. Bonnie Jenkins, a veteran arms control expert, was nominated for under secretary for arms control and international security affairs; Ms. Jenkins is also the founder of a group for women of color in national security. Uzra Zeya, who has held multiple roles at the State Department, was nominated for under secretary for civilian security, democracy, and human rights. Mr. Biden also formally announced the nominations of Wendy Sherman to be deputy secretary of state and Victoria Nuland as under secretary for political affairs; his plans to nominate both Ms. Sherman and Ms. Nuland were previously reported."}

Yet hear me clearly — disagreement must not lead to disunion.\\n\\nMr. Biden's ability to steer and stay the course calmly through turbulence is a testament, say friends and family, to both Mr. Biden's unabashed optimism and his deep belief in the importance of American political norms and traditions. The man who came to Washington at age 30 as one of the youngest senators in history now enters the White House as the oldest president in history, with more experience in government and legislating to guide his path than any leader in decades.\\n\\nHe's been around so long that now that he is going to be the leader of this country, he knows he must conduct himself with presidential composure, said Chuck Hagel, a longtime friend of Mr. Biden's who served as defense secretary in the administration of President Barack Obama and before that as a Republican senator from Nebraska. He knows the only way we'll be able to start to climb out of this hole is for the leader of the country to be seen as fair and open and not dwelling on the negative.\\n\\nThat Mr. Biden finds himself in this role at all is an unlikely turn of events for a man whose political career seemed to have stalled or ended so many times, including when tragedy struck just after he won his first election to the Senate in 1972. But after 36 years in the chamber and eight years as vice president, he became a familiar figure in the country's political consciousness. When Americans sought a way back to stability after four years of tumult, Mr. Biden felt like a comfort to many voters. As Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, one of Mr. Biden's most important supporters in the primary race, is fond of saying and repeated in an interview on Tuesday: We know Joe and Joe knows us.\\n\\nTo Mr. Biden's friends and family, his success at winning the White House is proof that there is something fundamentally reassuring about his character — his loyalty, his empathy and his experience — that Americans want after four years of an unpredictable and chaotic administration. Even when he misspeaks, they argue, it underscores his authenticity, the journey of a man who moved through the darkness of the losses of his young wife, baby daughter and adult son to remain optimistic about politics, the country and his own destiny.\\n\\nHe has a backbone of steel. He has a tremendous amount of empathy and he seeks the better angels in humankind, said Valerie Biden Owens, Mr. Biden's sister and closest political adviser. His word is his bond."}

Senator Lisa Murkowski speaks at a news conference in the Capitol building. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said on Thursday that the House had acted appropriately in impeaching President Trump, signaling possible support for convicting him at a Senate trial in a statement that called his actions unlawful and said that they warranted consequences. Ms. Murkowski said the second impeachment of Mr. Trump stood in stark contrast to the first, which she and virtually every other Republican opposed. She said Mr. Trump had perpetuated false rhetoric that the election was stolen and rigged and launched a pressure campaign against his own vice president, urging him to take actions that he had no authority to do. And though Ms. Murkowski did not commit to finding the president guilty, saying she would listen carefully to the arguments on both sides, she strongly suggested that she was inclined to do so. On the day of the riots, President Trump's words incited violence, which led to the injury and deaths of Americans — including a Capitol Police officer — the desecration of the Capitol, and briefly interfered with the government's ability to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, Ms. Murkowski said. Her remarks came the day after the House — with support from 10 Republicans — impeached the president on a single charge of incitement of insurrection, and as Republicans faced the prospect of a trial that could begin as soon as next week. Republicans were racing to gauge the political dynamics of a vote to convict Mr. Trump, which would open the door to disqualifying him from holding office in the future. Most of them kept their powder dry publicly, but were privately struggling to reconcile their own disdain for the leader they supported loyally for years and their fear of a backlash from a political base more devoted to Mr. Trump than any other party figure. Though few Republicans had gone on record in such stinging terms, Ms. Murkowski was not alone in breaking from the president. Senators Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania and Susan Collins of Maine had spoken out harshly against Mr. Trump, leaving colleagues to speculate that they could vote to convict him and bar him from ever holding office again. Even Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, indicated to colleagues that he was undecided about whether to convict Mr. Trump, and privately told advisers he approved of the impeachment drive and believed it could help the party purge Mr. Trump. Others in the party, led by Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, were pushing back hard against a conviction, warning it would harm the party and the country, as federal authorities cautioned about continued violent threats from pro-Trump extremists. With Mr. McConnell sending mixed signals about where he would come down, Republican strategists and seniors aides on Capitol Hill believed he could ultimately swing the result one way or another. If all senators voted, it would take 17 Republicans joining all Democrats to convict Mr. Trump. If they did, it would only take a vote by a simple majority of senators to disqualify Mr. Trump from ever holding office again.\\n\\nHere are the highlights of Biden's $1.9 trillion 'American Rescue Plan.' Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:34 - 0:00 transcript Biden Outlines $1.9 Trillion Economic Rescue Package President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday proposed a spending package to combat the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. The plan includes $1,400 direct payments to individuals and more generous unemployment benefits. During this pandemic, millions of Americans, through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck. Millions of Americans never thought they'd be out of work — many of them never even envisioned the idea — are facing eviction, waiting for hours in their cars to feed their families as they drive up to a food bank. A growing chorus of top economists agree that the moment of crisis — in this moment of crisis, with interest rates at historic lows, we cannot afford inaction. Our rescue plan also includes immediate relief to Americans hardest hit and most in need. We will finish the job of getting a total of $2,000 in cash relief to people who need it the most. The $600 already appropriated is simply not enough. One in seven households in America, more than one in five Black and Latino households in America, report they don't have enough food to eat. So we're going to extend emergency nutritional assistance for 30 — for 43 million children and their families enrolled in the SNAP program through the rest of this year. To the millions of you just looking for a fighting chance in this economy, I promise you, we will not forget you. We understand what you're going through. We will never, ever give up. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday proposed a spending package to combat the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. The plan includes $1,400 direct payments to individuals and more generous unemployment benefits. Credit Credit... Amr Alfiky/The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday proposed a $1.9 trillion rescue package to combat the economic downturn and the Covid-19 crisis, outlining the type of sweeping aid that Democrats have demanded for months and signaling the shift in the federal government's pandemic response as Mr. Biden prepares to take office next week. The package includes more than $400 billion to combat the pandemic directly, including money to accelerate vaccine deployment and to safely reopen most schools within 100 days. An additional $350 billion would help state and local governments bridge budget shortfalls, while the plan would also include $1,400 direct payments to individuals, more generous unemployment benefits, federally mandated paid leave for workers and large subsidies for child care costs. During this pandemic, millions of Americans, through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck, Mr. Biden said in a speech to the nation on Tuesday evening. There is real pain overwhelming the real economy. He acknowledged the high price tag but said the nation could not afford to do anything less. The very health of our nation is at stake, Mr. Biden said, speaking from Delaware. We have to act and we have to act now. Here are some of the highlights of Mr. Biden's so-called American Rescue Plan: The rescue proposal would be financed entirely through increased federal borrowing, and flows from the idea that the virus and the recovery are intertwined.\\n\\nThe $20 billion national vaccine program he announced envisions nationwide community vaccination centers.\\n\\nHe also called for a public health jobs program that would address his goals of bolstering the economy and the coronavirus response while also rebuilding the nation's public health infrastructure. The proposal would fund 100,000 public health workers to engage in vaccine outreach and contact tracing.\\n\\nTo address the racial disparities in health exposed by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately claimed the lives of people of color, he pledged to increase funding for community health centers, and also intends to fund efforts to mitigate the pandemic in prisons and jails, where African-Americans and Latinos are overrepresented.\\n\\nMr. Biden proposed a wide range of efforts to help those who have suffered the most under the economic shutdowns, including emergency paid leave to 106 million Americans, regardless of the size of their employer, and extending tax credits to many families to offset up to $8,000 in annual child care costs.\\n\\nThe plan gives billions of dollars in aid to renters struggling to keep up with mounting unpaid liabilities to landlords, and it would give grants to millions of the hardest-hit small businesses.\\n\\nThe proposal would temporarily increase the size of two tax credits in a manner that would effectively provide more cash from the government to low-income workers and families.\\n\\nMr. Biden called on Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, and he proposed extending expanded unemployment benefits through the end of September, with an extra $400 weekly supplement.

A mob of Trump supporters overtake the Capitol last week. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times Several people on a terrorist watch list were in Washington last week for pro-Trump events that ultimately devolved into the assault on the Capitol, according to a government official briefed on the Justice Department investigation into the riot. Most are suspected white supremacists, according to The Washington Post, which first reported on their status on the list. It was not clear how many people on the watch list were part of the mob that stormed the Capitol. But their presence in Washington last week adds to the urgent questions about security preparations for the events of Jan. 6, ahead of which thousands of supporters of President Trump had vowed to travel to Washington to disrupt, even violently, the congressional certification of the Electoral College results of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s win. The people were listed on the government's main terrorism watch list, the Terrorism Screening Database, one of several databases of people that law enforcement and intelligence officials have deemed to be known or suspected terrorists. The tool has undergone explosive growth in the era following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. As the lists were rapidly growing over a decade ago, the F.B.I. distributed guidance to its field offices that says agents may nominate someone to be considered a known or suspected terrorist if they have particular negative information to support their suspicions, like an allegation that the suspect has terrorism ties that is corroborated by at least one other source. But mere guesses or hunches, the bureau said at the time, are not enough. The Terrorism Screening Database is maintained by the F.B.I.'s Terrorist Screening Center. Some of the data used by the Terrorist Screening Center comes from a larger database maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center, an interagency clearinghouse for intelligence about potential terrorist threats. Being on the watch list can restrict people from entering the country, deny them government benefits or contracts, and subject them to greater scrutiny at airports and by the police. A subset of the people on the watch list are also placed on the so-called no-fly list, which bars them from being aboard planes in American airspace. The vast majority of people included in the database are foreigners abroad, but some are American citizens or lawful permanent residents. Court records suggest that in 2017, the F.B.I.'s Terrorism Screening Database had about 1.2 million people in it, including about 4,600 such American or green-card holders. The government has said a broader database of terrorism suspects called the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment had about 1.6 million names in it, of which about 16,000 were Americans. Katie Benner and\\n\\nSeveral more Capitol rioters have been arrested including man who carried a Confederate flag inside building. Kevin Seefried has been identified as having carried a Confederate flag into the Capitol during the siege last week. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times A man seen holding a Confederate battle flag, a person identified as striking a police officer with a flagpole and a retired firefighter identified as having thrown a fire extinguisher at officers were among those arrested Thursday for their role in the riot at the U.S. Capitol last week. A federal prosecutor in Texas also said on Thursday that a retired Air Force officer who stormed the Senate chamber dressed in military-style clothing and holding zip ties had intended to take hostages. The retired officer, Larry Rendell Brock, was arrested in Texas on Sunday on one count of unlawfully entering a restricted building and another of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, the Justice Department said at the time. He means to take hostages, the Texas prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Weimer, said on Thursday, The Associated Press reported. He means to kidnap, restrain, perhaps try, perhaps execute members of the U.S. government. The Justice Department has said that images from the Capitol siege appeared to show Mr. Brock wearing a green helmet, a tactical vest, a camouflage jacket and trousers holding zip ties that are used by law enforcement officers to restrain and/or detain subjects. But the A.P. quoted Mr. Brock's attorney, Brook Antonio II, as saying on Thursday that there was no direct evidence of him breaking into the Capitol or doing anything violent inside. The top federal prosecutor in Washington said this week that he expected the number of people charged with crimes tied to the Capitol riot to rise into the hundreds. The F.B.I. has received more than 126,000 photographic and video tips and as agents have scoured airline passenger manifests and video of air travelers to and from Washington to find potential suspects. The man who was photographed holding a Confederate battle flag inside the U.S. Capitol during the riot was arrested on Thursday in Delaware, two law enforcement officials said. The man, Kevin Seefried, was wanted by the F.B.I., which had sought help from the public to identify him and had widely circulated a dispatch plastered with images of him. In a bulletin, the agency said that it was looking for assistance to identify individuals who made unlawful entry into the Capitol, including Mr. Seefried. According to court documents, Mr. Seefried and his son, Hunter Seefried, were identified after the F.B.I. received a report from a co-worker of Hunter Seefried that said the man had bragged about being in the Capitol with his father on January 6.Mr. Seefried's son was also charged. A retired firefighter from Chester, Pa., was also arrested on Thursday after he was identified as the man seen in a video throwing a fire extinguisher at police officers during the riot. The man, Robert Sanford, is charged with assaulting a law enforcement officer engaged in the performance of official duties and civil disorder among other crimes. Mr. Sanford went to the Capitol following the president's instructions, a complaining witness told the F.B.I. Another man was charged on Thursday after law enforcement officials identified him as the person seen repeatedly striking an officer with a flagpole on the stairs of the Capitol in a video posted on Twitter. That man, Peter Stager of Arkansas, was charged with obstructing law enforcement, according to the criminal complaint. The complaint also identified Mr. Stager as saying in another video posted on Twitter that everyone in the Capitol is a treasonous traitor and that death is the only remedy for what's in that building.

Win Mcnamee/Getty Images Also on Thursday, an employee with Cleveland public schools was charged with entering and committing unlawful activities on the grounds of the Capitol. The woman, Christine Priola, was traced through an anonymous tip to the F.B.I. after she was recognized in photographs posted to Twitter, according to court documents. Photos from last Wednesday showed Ms. Priola inside the Capitol and holding a sign that read, The children cry out for justice, which law enforcement later recovered from her home. She resigned from her position as an occupational therapist the next day, according to a copy of her resignation letter that was obtained by Cleveland's Fox 8 News, in which she espoused a number of conspiracy theories.

Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA, via Shutterstock Federal investigators working to apprehend and charge the hundreds of people connected to last week's assault on the Capitol are focusing on any military and law enforcement personnel who may have been involved in the attack, according to a law enforcement official. Investigators also have yet to find any evidence that any member of Congress helped coordinate the siege, as one prominent leader of a pro-Trump group has claimed, but are scrutinizing those leads. The official cautioned that the investigation is sprawling and that all leads need to be carefully vetted. The F.B.I. and Justice Department have already arrested several suspects who were captured in photographs inside the Capitol, including Kevin Seefried, a man who was photographed holding a Confederate battle flag; Jake Angeli, a well-known QAnon conspiracy theorist who was seen carrying a spear and wearing a fur headdress with horns; and Robert Keith Packer, who was photographed wearing a Camp Auschwitz sweatshirt. Other insurrectionists moved through the chaos inside the building in tight military formation, using hand signals and wearing tactical gear, and investigators are seeking to determine whether they were working together or whether any had ties to law enforcement or the military. But the law enforcement official said that it was too soon to expect a raft of conspiracy charges. Such cases can be tough to prove in court, and investigators would need to seek additional evidence of coordination, such as financial ties, planning around logistics and travel or messages between any alleged group members. On Thursday, the Justice Department charged two off-duty police officers from Rocky Mount, Va., Jacob Fracker and Thomas Robertson, with unlawful entry and disorderly conduct in connection with the riots. Mr. Robertson said on social media that the media and the left were upset because we actually attacked the government who is the problem and not some random small business, according to the criminal complaint. Keep poking us, Mr. Robertson warned. In a nod to concerns that members of the military might have been involved in or supported the Capitol riots, the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff issued an unusual message to all military personnel this week, reminding them that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. would soon be their commander-in-chief and that they must continue to defend the Constitution. The Defense Department declined on Thursday to directly address whether members of the military were involved in attacking the Capitol. We in the Department of Defense are doing everything we can to eliminate extremism, said Garry Reid, the Pentagon's director for defense intelligence. He said that all members of the military, including members of the National Guard, go through extensive screening for participation in hate groups and militias.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nFederal authorities are said to be looking into Bitcoin donations made to people who breached the Capitol last week. Supporters of President Trump were forced off the Capitol grounds after a mob breached the building on Jan. 6. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times Federal authorities are investigating several Bitcoin donations made to right-wing figures ahead of the assault on the Capitol last week, according to a person briefed on the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly about it. A single donor from France appears to have sent around $500,000 in Bitcoin in early December to several figures involved in far right activist circles, according to an investigation published Thursday by the cryptocurrency data firm Chainalysis. Authorities are looking into whether the donations were linked to the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. The existence of the investigation was first reported by Yahoo News. The single largest donation that Chainalysis found, which was worth around $250,000 at the time, went to a Bitcoin wallet owned by Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist who was at the Capital building on Jan. 6 and who called for violence before the event. Mr. Fuentes has previously mocked journalists on Twitter who asked him about his involvement in the event. Other donations went to the right-wing social media network Gab and the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, Chainalysis said. By Jan. 6, the value of the donations had grown because of the soaring price of Bitcoin. The donor appears to have been a French programmer with clear right-wing sympathies, Chainalysis found. The technology behind Bitcoin makes it possible to hold and send money in ways that governments are unable to regulate or stop. This has made it popular with rogue governments and terrorist groups, along with many right-wing activists who have been blocked from using traditional payment networks.\\n\\nFallout roundup 17 Capitol Police officers are under investigation one week after rampage. National Guard troops deployed to the U.S. Capitol prepare to head out for a shift change on Thursday. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times With less than a week to go before the presidential inauguration, the police force charged with protecting the grounds of the Capitol is in crisis, as law enforcement agencies across the city brace for more potentially violent gatherings, based on intelligence reviewed in recent days. The chief of the Capitol Police and two other top security officials resigned after an angry mob of Trump loyalists stormed the Capitol last week. Three officers have been suspended, and 17 more are under investigation, according to a senior Congressional aide, including an officer who took selfies with people in the crowd and another who wore a Make America Great Again Trump hat and directed rioters into the Capitol. And lawmakers have demanded a full investigation into what some have referred to as a severe systemic failure. Currently, the Capitol complex, which is usually a bevy of activity, is cut off from its surroundings by National Guard troops and an imposing backdrop of seven-foot-tall, unscalable fencing. Here are other developments in the fallout from the Capitol siege: A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a bill in the House on Thursday to award Eugene Goodman, a Capitol Police officer, the Congressional Gold Medal because of his efforts to keep the violent mob of Trump supporters from accessing the Senate last week. Mr. Goodman was captured on video running up the stairs in the Capitol. The F.B.I. has warned police departments across the country to be on high alert for extremist activity and violence in their communities ahead of the inauguration next week. It also cautioned law enforcement agencies to look for armed militias and extremists who want to trigger a race war.\\n\\nGov.

Eileen Sullivan and\\n\\nCheney facing internal backlash for impeachment vote as Republican rifts deepen over Trump. Representative Liz Cheney had issued a scathing statement the day before the impeachment vote repudiating President Trump. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times A group of President Trump's most strident allies in the House is calling on Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican, to resign from her leadership post after she voted to impeach Mr. Trump, dramatizing the bitter rifts within the party and setting up a messy internal feud that could define its future. Members of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, including the chairman, Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, as well as Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio and Matt Gaetz of Florida, are circulating a petition calling on Ms. Cheney to step down from her role as chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, arguing that her vote to impeach Mr. Trump had brought the conference into disrepute and produced discord. Ms. Cheney was one of 10 Republicans to break with the party on Wednesday and vote to charge the president with incitement of insurrection for his role in urging on a mob that stormed the Capitol. One of those 10 cannot be our leader, Mr. Gaetz said in an interview on Fox News's Hannity on Wednesday evening. It is untenable, unsustainable, and we need to make a leadership change. Ms. Cheney has brushed aside calls to step down, saying that she was not going anywhere and calling her break with Mr. Trump a vote of conscience. Several Republicans, including some members of the Freedom Caucus, have begun to circle the wagons around her. The entire party would be wise to heed the words of Ronald Reagan: 'The person who agrees with you 80 percent of the time is a friend and an ally, not a 20 percent traitor,' said Representative Michael Burgess, Republican of Texas. Yesterday, Republicans jumped on the calls for unity and healing no matter how they decided to vote. Removing Liz from her leadership position would be divisive and a distraction we cannot afford. Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who also voted to impeach Mr. Trump, said that Ms. Cheney in the last week had gained immeasurable respect, and suggested that it was Republicans like Mr. Jordan who should be shoved aside in the wake of the siege and the impeachment it prompted. Since the discussion is opened, though, we may have to also have a discussion about who in our party fomented this, and their roles as ranking members, he said. The debate over Ms. Cheney's leadership post reflects the deep fractures in the Republican Party over Mr. Trump, who has demanded total loyalty from his party and, up until recently, largely received it. While prominent figures have recoiled from Mr. Trump's incendiary brand of politics in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 riot, worrying that it could spell ruin for their party, a large minority faction — many of them in the House — remains unwilling to abandon him. Republicans are scrambling to determine the political consequences of doing so, and whether they would pay a steeper political price for breaking with the president or for failing to. Senate Republicans are facing just such a dilemma as they contemplate how to vote in an impeachment trial that could start as early as next week. Both Representatives Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the minority whip, voted against impeaching Mr. Trump, though Mr. McCarthy said the president bore responsibility for the siege and deserved a censure. Ms. Cheney, by contrast, had issued a scathing statement the day before the impeachment vote in which she said: There has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution. But she chose not to speak during debate on the House floor. Many Democrats — who have long reviled her and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney — quoted her approvingly in their own speeches.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nNow that the House has impeached Trump, what happens next? It is the first time in American history a president has been impeached twice. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times Minutes after the House voted to impeach President Trump a second time, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, threw cold water on the prospect of the Senate beginning an impeachment trial before Mr. Biden's inauguration next Wednesday. He endorsed a later start to the proceedings and in effect handed responsibility for the process to Democrats, who will soon control the chamber. Given the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents that govern presidential impeachment trials, there is simply no chance that a fair or serious trial could conclude before President-elect Biden is sworn in next week, Mr. McConnell said. In light of this reality, I believe it will best serve our nation if Congress and the executive branch spend the next seven days completely focused on facilitating a safe inauguration and an orderly transfer of power to the incoming Biden administration. Here's what we know about what happens next. How does the impeachment process work? After the House has impeached the president — the equivalent of an indictment in a criminal case — members of the Senate consider whether to remove him, holding a trial in which senators act as the jury. The test, as set by the Constitution, is whether the president has committed treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. How can the Senate hold a trial if Trump is out of office? There is no precedent for the Senate holding an impeachment trial after a president has left office, but it has done so for other government officials. Democrats who control the House can choose when to send their article of impeachment to the Senate, at which point that chamber would have to immediately move to begin the trial. But even if the House transmitted the charge to the other side of the Capitol right away, an agreement between Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate would be needed to take it up before Jan. 19, a day before Mr. Biden is inaugurated. Since Mr. McConnell said on Wednesday that he would not agree, the trial cannot start until after Mr. Biden is president. That could clog the Senate floor in the early days of Mr. Biden's administration, at a time when he will be eager to have the chamber confirm members of his cabinet. Would impeaching Trump disqualify him from holding office again? Conviction in an impeachment trial would not automatically disqualify Mr. Trump from future public office. But if the Senate were to convict him, the Constitution allows a subsequent vote to bar an official from holding any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States. That vote would require only a simple majority of senators. There is no precedent, however, for disqualifying a president from future office, and the issue could end up before the Supreme Court.

Kirby, a retired Navy rear admiral, will be the Biden administration's Pentagon spokesman. Credit... Win Mcnamee/Getty Images A low-profile deputy defense secretary will be the lone Trump holdover running the Pentagon until President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s defense secretary pick is confirmed, according to transition officials. Mr. Biden is also planning to install John F. Kirby — the former spokesman for John Kerry when he was secretary of state, Chuck Hagel when he was defense secretary and Mike Mullen when he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — as the next Pentagon press secretary. David L. Norquist, who is now the No. 2 civilian at the Pentagon, will be Mr. Biden's first acting defense secretary — if only for a few days — transition officials said Wednesday. The transition team has been pushing to get Mr. Biden's choice for the top post, a retired Army four-star general, Lloyd J. Austin III, confirmed as soon as possible. But unlike the other top national security nominees on the Biden team, Mr. Austin will have to jump through three Congressional hoops before he is confirmed. The Senate and House must approve a waiver for him to serve at the helm of the Pentagon since he has not been retired from military service at least seven years, and then he must be confirmed by the Senate. Mr. Biden has decided that instead of bypassing Mr. Norquist and plucking Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy to run the Pentagon until there is a confirmed defense secretary, he will adhere to standard tradition. Under federal law, a confirmed deputy secretary automatically assumes the duties of the secretary during an absence. The decision to keep Mr. Norquist until a defense secretary is confirmed was first reported by Politico. Mr. Kirby, for his part, is a veteran government public affairs officer and a respected figure at the Pentagon. A retired Navy rear admiral, Mr. Kirby made a jump from the Pentagon to the State Department in 2015, and worked closely with Mr. Kerry during the Iran nuclear negotiations and for the last two years of the Obama administration. Mr. Kirby worked with Mr. Austin when they were both on the Joint Staff under Admiral Mullen, during the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. He also spent a year as the Pentagon spokesman under Mr. Hagel, and has been the spokesman for the Navy as well as for retired Admiral Mullen when he was chairman.\\n\\nInauguration security With heightened security underway, officials try to offer assurances that the inauguration will be safe. National Guard troops deployed to the Capitol stood guard on Thursday near where the inauguration will happen next week. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times In a briefing with Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday, federal law enforcement officials sought to assure the public that the inauguration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Jan. 20 would be safe after the widely publicized security failures that allowed supporters of President Trump to violently storm the Capitol last week. Christopher Wray, the director of the F.B.I., acknowledged that the bureau was seeing an extensive amount of concerning online chatter surrounding the inauguration — including plans for armed protests both in Washington and at state capitol buildings around the country — and said agents were trying to distinguish real threats from aspirational plotting. Mr. Wray added that the F.B.I. had arrested more than 100 people and identified more than 200 suspects since the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, and said, Anyone who plots or attempts violence in the coming week should count on a visit. James Murray, the director of the Secret Service, said he had been asked how Americans could be confident in inauguration security given the violence last Wednesday, which led to several deaths. I would point very keenly to the level of planning and coordination we've been carrying out for more than nine months, Mr. Murray said, adding that he believed the security measures the Secret Service had planned for the inauguration would have prevented the Capitol attack had they been in place at the time. The Secret Service, which is leading the effort to secure the presidential inauguration, said on Thursday that it would establish a green zone in downtown Washington this weekend, shutting down traffic and train lines as National Guard troops continue to flood into the increasingly militarized city. Most of the streets around the Lincoln Memorial and the scene of the deadly siege of the Capitol would be shut down from Saturday morning until the day after the inauguration. A green zone will also be established in the downtown area, with National Guard troops in place to verify entering residents or business owners. The Memorial bridge connecting Washington to Arlington, Va., will also be closed and multiple train stations in downtown Washington will be temporarily inaccessible, according to the statement. The area around the National Mall on Thursday resembled a city under siege, with multiple military vehicles stationed at intersections and steel fencing erected along streets near the Potomac River. As of Thursday afternoon, there were about 7,000 National Guard members deployed from D.C. and 13 states. About 20,000 overall were expected to be in Washington for the inauguration. Beyond the official preparations, a group of Washington community organizations, including the city's Black Lives Matter chapter, called on area hotels to close in the lead-up to the inauguration to signal to Trump supporters that white supremacists are NOT WELCOME in D.C.! And after some of the rioters last week targeted reporters and photographers in the Capitol, the Committee to Protect Journalists advised anyone covering the inauguration to avoid wearing press lanyards and to carry as little equipment as possible. Since the attack on the Capitol, Mr. Trump has begrudgingly and inconsistently pledged a peaceful remainder of the transition period — something he refused to commit to for more than two months after he lost the election. Mr. Pence tried to assure Americans more explicitly. We are going to ensure that we have a safe inauguration, and President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are sworn in as the president and vice president of the United States in a manner consistent with our history and traditions, he said.

{"original": "This interview was conducted by the editorial board of The New York Times, which will announce its Democratic primary endorsement on Jan. 19.\\n\\nFor noteworthy dialogues on...\\n\\nAndrew Yang's message is remarkably similar to Elizabeth Warren's and Bernie Sanders's — the American economy is not working for enough Americans, and it's going to require structural change to do better. Where Mr. Yang differs — beyond his almost complete lack of government or political experience — is in his prescriptions, including his signature Freedom Dividend.\\n\\nMr. Yang previously ran a successful test prep company and created the nonprofit Venture for America, which he argues is a strength, offering him fresh perspective and critical distance from the workings of Washington.\\n\\nIn an interview on Dec. 4, it was clear that Mr. Yang has done his homework, traveling across the country and listening closely. He really seemed to have an almost emotional sense of what people have been going through and what the problems are, a board member [Related: What Is an Editorial Board?] said afterward. His portrait of the fundamental economic problems were more moving than Bernie's, and Bernie has been selling this for 30 years.\\n\\nHe articulated a vision for the future of work, education and technology for the nation. The board also delved into Mr. Yang's approach to foreign policy and military intervention, and learned of his fascination with aliens and fear of flying vacuum cleaners.\\n\\nHere is a transcript, with annotations in blue, of the 90-minute discussion, which was filmed for a special episode of The Weekly, The Times's TV show on FX and Hulu. The transcript is unedited. [Related: Learn more about The Choice, or meet the editorial board members]\\n\\nKathleen Kingsbury: Wonderful. Thank you. Yeah. So I have a serious question to ask you, but first we wanted to ask, were you wearing a helmet while you were biking here?\\n\\nMr. Yang biked to the Times from his Manhattan home. More New York City cyclists died biking in 2019 than in any other year since 2000; Gothamist counts 29 deaths.\\n\\nI was wearing a helmet. I have a staffer with the helmet as proof.\\n\\nJesse Wegman: Is the inside of the helmet warm?\\n\\nMy team then had me take the helmet off and then tried to make my hair look good. So that's why I didn't show up with the helmet.\\n\\nKK: It looks sharp.\\n\\nI commented to one of my team members, I feel like running for president is at least a glimpse into what it's like to be a professional woman because I feel like I care about my appearance more now than I ever did. And there are people that are always like looking after ——\\n\\nHe's right, of course. Women in politics have long been subjected to much closer scrutiny than men; in 1917, the first female member of Congress, Jeannette Rankin, took office and The Washington Post ran an article headlined: Congresswoman Rankin Real Girl; Likes Nice Gowns and Tidy Hair.\\n\\nWatch a special endorsement episode of The Weekly This video excerpt has been edited by The Weekly.\\n\\nBrent Staples: Scrutinizing you.\\n\\nScrutinizing, looking after it, because I'm just like, What? My hair? Who cares? No one. And then people are like, No, no, and they have to put time in, smooth it out.\\n\\nKK: So let's get into it. We have about 90 minutes together. In your assessment, what are the policy breakdowns that lead to Americans still being hungry today?\\n\\nWow, I love this question. There are many causes of poverty, and the fact that we're not able to put food into people's houses and on their tables is a structural problem. My campaign's based upon the premise that we're going through this profound economic transformation, the fourth industrial revolution. And one of the major problems is that we still pretend we're in the economy of the '70s or '80s.\\n\\nMr. Yang is not the first to label this period the fourth industrial revolution — the term was made popular by Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, at its annual meeting in Davos in 2016. Mr. Schwab's book of the same name argues that the fourth industrial revolution is transforming every sector of the economy and industry through new technologies that merge the physical, digital and biological realms.\\n\\nIn the '70s or '80s, your labor and overall productivity were more or less in lock step. And we still pretend that if someone wakes up in the morning and says, Hey, I need to put food on the table, he can go out to his main street, he can sell his time for money at some hourly rate, and then he'll be able to make a good enough living so he can feed his family, raise kids and the rest of it. That has become progressively less true over the last 40 years, unfortunately, where wages have stagnated while productivity has gone up and up, and that's going to accelerate because of the convergence of capital and technology now, in unprecedented ways.\\n\\nStarting in 1979, productivity and pay sharply diverged — productivity rose nearly 70 percent, while typical hourly pay essentially stagnated, according to the Economic Policy Institute.\\n\\nEspecially for people who are at the lower end of the skills ladder, which is most Americans. Only 33 percent of Americans will graduate from college, 42 percent if you include two-year degrees.\\n\\nSo you're looking at a nation of high school graduates. And what do high school graduates do for a living? The top five occupational categories are retail and administrative, which includes call center work, retail, food service and food preparation, transportation, primarily truck driving, and attendant supportive jobs and manufacturing still. We all know that we have gutted many of these industries, and their labor bases have shrunk.\\n\\nSo for a high school graduate in America to get by, if you have one health problem or car breakdown, it can take a very tenuous financial situation and send it in a downward spiral. Then how do you put food on the table? In theory, there are nonprofits and food pantries that would see to this, but we all know that they're dramatically underresourced relative to the need. And so when you look at the causes of food poverty, to me the best solution is instead of trying to create organizations that will put food into people's hands, which we should do obviously, we should just put money into Americans' hands and then they would be able to procure food to provide for themselves and their families.\\n\\nMr. Yang's candidacy has centered on the idea of his Freedom Dividend, essentially universal basic income — which has a long history, drawing support from Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King Jr. and Friedrich von Hayek, but also a controversial one. (Later annotations will look at why.)\\n\\nKK: So I assume you're referring to [your] universal basic income plan. Your campaign platform, you have tons and tons of proposals, everything from U.B.I. to universal daylight saving time. Plans don't really mean anything unless you have priorities. What would you do immediately when you enter office? What would be first on your agenda? What would you want to accomplish in the first 100 days?\\n\\nMr. Yang has prided himself on injecting the race with new thinking through proposals like yearlong daylight saving time. Daylight saving time was instituted during World War I for energy-efficiency purposes. Mr. Yang argues that extending it year-round would decrease traffic accidents, increase economic activity and lower crime.\\n\\nTo me, the economic imbalances are causing many of our other problems. If you look up and down the line, health problems, poor educational attainment and results, even political polarization, they stem from the fact that we have this pervasive financial insecurity where 78 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Almost half can't afford an unexpected $400 or $500 bill. If you can't pay next month's rent, it's very hard to worry about climate change. I come and talk to you and say, Hey, we need to fight climate change. And you look up and say like, I'm worried about next month. Next year, next decade has to wait in line.\\n\\nThe statistic that 78 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck was reported in a 2017 study by the human capital management firm CareerBuilder. Read the study here.\\n\\nAnd that's probably a generous response. Some of the responses would be worse than that. So if you get the boot off people's throats, then you can start making progress on our health, on our educational outcomes, on our political polarization.\\n\\nEveryone knows my flagship proposal is this Freedom Dividend of $1,000 a month for every American adult, which is not a new idea. And it's not my idea. Thomas Paine was for it at the founding of the country. Martin Luther King fought for it and was fighting for it when he was assassinated. So after I'm the nominee and I defeat Donald Trump, everyone will know that I'm in the White House because of the Freedom Dividend.\\n\\nDemocrats and progressives will be so thrilled to have defeated Donald Trump, they will love the fact that we're going to put buying power into families' hands, make children stronger and healthier. But here's the great thing: The Republicans will look up and say, Wait a minute, do I hate the Freedom Dividend? And they look up, and they notice only one state's had a dividend for almost 40 years, and it's Alaska, a deep red conservative state, that was passed by a Republican governor.\\n\\nSince 1982, Alaska has been giving every resident an annual check from its $66.3 billion permanent fund, which gets at least 25 percent of the state's mineral royalties every year. The results of the experiment have been mixed — crippling poverty is low, but unemployment rates are among the highest in the country, and the fund's value fluctuates with oil prices.\\n\\nThe reason I am drawing, in some polls, 10 percent or more of Donald Trump voters to my campaign is that Republicans and conservatives do not hate economic buying power in citizens' hands. What they hate is a giant bureaucracy making everyone's decisions. So you ask what my main priority will be as president, it will be to get the Freedom Dividend across the finish line and get buying power into Americans' hands, which will then lead us to be able to solve many other problems much more quickly.\\n\\nMr. Yang's argument that he is pulling 10 percent or more of Trump supporters was not rated favorably on PolitiFact — the 10 percent figure comes from a July YouGov poll, and subsequent polls found the number to be lower.\\n\\nWatch a special endorsement episode of The Weekly This video excerpt has been edited by The Weekly.\\n\\nKK: Have you spoken to Republican lawmakers about the Freedom Dividend?\\n\\nI haven't sat down with a lot of sitting senators and congressmen and women, but I've talked to literally thousands of people who supported Donald Trump in the last election who say they are now supporting me. I've talked to many folks who are Republicans who say they are, at least, sympathetic to my message, in large part because they understand the numbers. When I talked to 70 C.E.O.s here in New York City, not that far from here, it was a fancy bank office, most of them were Republicans. I said, How many of you are looking at replacing your back-office clerical workers with artificial intelligence and software? Guess how many hands went up out of 70. All of them. The truth is, you should fire any C.E.O. who was not looking to make that happen, because their incentives are all tied to the bottom-line profitability of their firm. And most of them were Republicans. So they understand the need for what I am proposing.\\n\\nJamie Dimon, who is a Democrat but is a numbers person, has looked at the numbers and said, we should declare a national emergency around the fact that the economy is not working for most Americans. And he's proposing a negative income tax, which is a close cousin to the Freedom Dividend that I'm championing.\\n\\nUnlike universal basic income, a system that would provide some cash to every person regardless of income level, a negative income tax system would give cash to people below a certain income threshold. Milton Friedman made the case for the tax as a poverty alleviation tool in his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom.\\n\\nSo this is not a left or a right idea, this is bipartisan. And many Republicans will see that this is going to be a huge win for their constituents, for rural areas, for red states on the interior. We don't need 80 percent of Congress to pass it, we just need a majority.\\n\\nKK: I want to move on to some other questions, but I actually have one last for you, which is why run as a Democratic versus a Republican if you have such bipartisan issues?\\n\\nI've been a registered Democrat since the Clinton years; I was an Obama appointee. I had a fund-raiser for John Kerry. It wasn't a great fund-raiser because I was kind of young; it wasn't one of those fancy ones where you generate tens of thousands.\\n\\nKK: How much money did you raise?\\n\\nI want to say we raised maybe $5,000, and I was quite pleased. It was at a lounge.\\n\\nKK: With inflation, though, it would be higher, right?\\n\\nWell, thank you for saying so. Yeah, in 2019 dollars it must be at least $6,000. I've been a Democrat for years and years, and if you look at my alignment on the vast majority of issues, they're lock step with the Democratic Party. So it was very natural for me to run as a Democrat. I've ruled out completely any third-party bid because that would in my mind increase the chances of Donald Trump winning, and the mission is to defeat Donald Trump and help move the country forward.\\n\\nMr. Yang, a former technology executive and entrepreneur, has distinguished himself from Senator Sanders and the far left of the Democratic Party in making the case for a more humane capitalist system, what he calls human-centered capitalism.\\n\\nKK: O.K. Moving onto a perhaps slightly less serious topic.\\n\\nIn hindsight, this was not an accurate assessment of the next question.\\n\\nI like it already.\\n\\nAisha Harris: Back in September, you actually spoke out on behalf of the comedian Shane Gillis, who had been hired on SNL and then was quickly fired after some racist comments were stirred up that he had made in the past on one of his podcasts. And you said you didn't want to be judged for something you had done 25 years ago. But Gillis's comments were maybe a year ago. So I'm curious as to, in your mind, how long of a period of time should it be before someone faces some sort of consequences for something they've done in the past?\\n\\nMr. Gillis was hired by Saturday Night Live last September, then dropped days later after clips surfaced showing him using slurs and language offensive toward Asian and L.G.B.T.Q. people, including one specifically about Mr. Yang. Mr. Yang later said the comedian should have had the chance to keep his job and explained: As a society, we have become unduly punitive and vindictive about people making statements that some find offensive or distasteful.\\n\\nSo when I heard that Shane Gillis had called me Jew chink — I think was the slur — my reaction was the same reaction anyone would have, which was like, who the heck is this guy, and he sounds like a total jackass. Well, my wife actually had heard about it independently and was also like, Who the heck is this guy? And so then I sat down and started to figure out who Shane Gillis was, what he did for a living, and then I sat down and watched some of his comedy to try and get some context.\\n\\nAfter watching his comedy, I felt that he wasn't a malignant racist and that his slur toward me was just very, very bad comedy run amok. Which did not strike me as a fireable offense, and I realized that if I was the individual who was actually directly slurred, and I did not feel that he should lose his job over it, then I should probably share that sentiment with other people.\\n\\nParticularly because I think we've become unduly vindictive and punitive toward statements that people find objectionable. A friend of mine said something, he said, If the online universe descends on someone, and they lose their job, the online universe moves on a week later, but that person still does not have a job a week later. That the impact on the individual lasts much, much longer than the rancor. So I shared this.\\n\\nThe comment about I wouldn't want to be judged for something 25 years ago was about something completely independent. I think I'd seen something where Joe Biden was being called out for something he'd said 25 years ago, when I said I wouldn't want to be called out for some misstatement I'd made 25 years ago. And then I joked, good thing no one cared about what I was doing 25 years ago, because I was at that point a 20-year-old man, and the internet didn't really have full documentation of how I spent those years.\\n\\nMr. Yang was asked on CNN's The Van Jones Show about cancel culture and whether Americans have gone too far in the direction of a lack of grace or a lack of forgiveness. He responded: I'm new to politics, but I certainly would hate to be judged by something I did 25 years ago.\\n\\nSo the Shane Gillis opinion was not based upon the timeline, it was just based upon my reaction as a person, and the person that was directly named. I certainly think there should be consequences for one's statements and actions, and I certainly think that obviously he made the statements within the year, and that if you did have some sort of time frame when you would want to overlook something, it would be much longer than a year.\\n\\nMr. Yang's comments, on Mr. Gillis and on judgment more broadly, contribute to a growing conversation among political and cultural figures about the merits and downsides of cancel culture. Former President Obama, for example, spoke out about the prevalence of call-out culture during an interview in October, arguing that criticizing people on social media for not being woke enough is not activism and not bringing about change.\\n\\nAH: But do you think, I mean, he never truly apologized. He just said, I'm sorry you're offended. And while you may not have felt that way, there were other jokes he made about just Asian-Americans and Asian people in general, and there were other people who were obviously affected by this. So I mean, what kind of consequences do you think someone who makes those kinds of statements and who doesn't show any sort of remorse for it, should they face? If not firing, what should happen? What would the steps be?\\n\\nMr. Gillis issued what some saw as a non-apology, writing on Twitter that he is a comedian who pushes boundaries and his intention is never to hurt. He added, I'm happy to apologize to anyone who's actually offended by anything I've said.\\n\\nWell, in this case, what's interesting is it's up to the employer, and it was NBC and Saturday Night Live. Even as I made the statement saying I didn't think he should be fired, I thought he probably would be fired. Because if you're NBC and SNL, you look up and say, what is my upside for keeping this guy? He's not exactly a huge moneymaker, he hasn't worked a day on the set. Like, that's not a really powerful set of incentives. And so I thought they probably would fire him. I'd suggest that the extent there are consequences for people's misstatements, they should be somewhere commensurate to the level of power and influence they have and the harm that they're doing. In Shane Gillis's case, he was a comedian. I'd never heard of the guy before.\\n\\nAH: I mean, I don't think most people had.\\n\\nNo, certainly not before the statements had taken place, and in terms of consequences, I would suggest that someone like Shane had probably paid a price in many ways. Like, aside from being fired, there are many circles that, if he shows up in, he'd be labeled very, very negatively. He reached out to me personally, and I had a conversation with him. The conversation with him made me feel more confident that I'd done the right thing. Because I think in many cases we're trying to follow up on a sense of shame and humiliation that the person might already feel.\\n\\nAfter Mr. Gillis was fired, Mr. Yang tweeted that the comedian had reached out to him. Looks like we will be sitting down together soon, Mr. Yang wrote. Neither the comedian nor the candidate appears to have spoken publicly about the content of the meeting.\\n\\nKK: I think we have some questions around economics.\\n\\nBinyamin Appelbaum: Yes. After every invention basically since the plow, people have found new uses for the time saved by new technologies. You've argued that this time, this won't happen quickly enough. Why will this time be different? What gives you the confidence that we're confronting something new in all of human history?\\n\\nMr. Yang has argued that his Freedom Dividend is one answer to the needs of the millions who will lose their jobs to automation.\\n\\nThe numbers. So keep in mind, I didn't just wake up and say, Hey, technology is changing the world. I spent seven years working in Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis, Baltimore and other cities that have been blasted by the waves of automation.\\n\\nThis work was through Mr. Yang's nonprofit, Venture for America. More on that in a bit.\\n\\nDetroit is a city of 680,000 people. Its peak population was 1.7 million. If you look this direction, you can see a thriving neighborhood, and then you turn 90 degrees and you see abandoned buildings as far as the eye can see. If we were adapting, you would see not multidecade low rates of interstate migration, which we have right now. You would not be seeing 80 percent of the country have multidecade low levels of business formation, which we have right now. You would not be seeing historic lows of business formation among young people, which we have right now. You would not see labor force participation at 62.9 percent, a multidecade low which we have right now. You would not see record-high levels of drug overdoses and suicides to the point that America's life expectancy has declined for three years in a row, which we have right now.\\n\\nMr. Yang argues that the automation of manufacturing jobs — especially in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri and Iowa — helped breed the discontent and economic desperation that led to Mr. Trump's election.\\n\\nAndrew Yang in the spin room after the Democratic debate in Detroit. Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times\\n\\nBA: But we also have record low unemployment, and when you mention labor force participation, some people think a big factor there is that the government already is giving people too much money.\\n\\nLabor force participation — the share of Americans either employed or actively looking for work — declined precipitously from the late 1990s, dropping to 62.7 percent in 2014 (its lowest rate since the Carter administration). Critics of President Obama liked to argue that this was because of government handouts. But there's a counterargument to be found in demographic trends — the Congressional Budget Office estimates that a sizable portion of the decline in labor-force participation is a result of the aging of the work force.\\n\\nWell, the labor force participation rate has declined precipitously, so I don't buy that somehow the government started giving people more money over the last number of years. And the headline unemployment rate, and I'm sure you know this, it doesn't measure underemployment, 40 to 44 percent of recent college graduates are now doing a job that does not require a college degree. It does not measure the fact that 94 percent of new jobs in the economy are temp, gig or contract jobs that do not have health care benefits and can disappear at any moment. It doesn't include the fact that you might be doing two or three jobs to make ends meet.\\n\\nA 2016 study from the economists Lawrence Katz at Harvard and Alan Krueger at Princeton found that 94 percent of net job growth between 2005 and 2015 was alternative work, including independent contractors, freelancers and temps.\\n\\nUber is literally advertising to schoolteachers saying, Hey, we've figured out schoolteachers make really good Uber drivers. And if you look at that situation, the headline unemployment rate says, Check, this person is employed. Heck, this person might be employed twice. The headline unemployment rate when Donald Trump was running for president, he castigated it as fake news, and then he got into office and all the sudden it became real news. He was right the first time. The number is almost intentionally designed to obscure any of the difficulties in the labor market. If I drop out of the labor market, I no longer count. I actually help the number.\\n\\nRight now we have three flagship numbers we're beating the American people over the head with, telling them that things are going great. No. 1, the headline unemployment rate. No. 2, gross domestic product, which is obviously putting up record highs even as our life expectancy is declining. And No. 3, corporate profits and shareholder value. Stock market prices correspond to the fortunes of the top 20 percent of Americans, many of the people, obviously, who live here in Manhattan. The bottom 80 percent of Americans own 8 percent of stock market value. The bottom 50 percent own essentially zero.\\n\\nThe American cities with the highest number of high-net-worth individuals are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington. California has the most number of people on the Forbes list of wealthiest Americans.\\n\\nIf these are your measurements, then of course you're going to think things are going in one direction, while your way of life disintegrates. Even the inventor of G.D.P., Simon Kuznets, said 100 years ago, this is a terrible measurement of national well-being, and we should never use it as that.\\n\\nIf you run an organization, imagine having an organization that has the wrong measurements. How is that organization going to fare over time? That is where we are in the United States of America right now. We're riding a century-old measurement off a cliff, while our way of life deteriorates underneath our feet. If you looked at levels of anxiety, stress, mental health, depression, suicides, drug overdoses, you would see that we're in a mental health recession or depression, we're in a wellness or life expectancy recession or depression, and the corporate profits are going to keep on going up, because in the 21st-century economy, companies can do very, very well while not hiring a lot of people, not treating them as full-time employees, and they don't need to care what happens in their own backyard because they sell everywhere.\\n\\nGross domestic product is a measure of a country's entire economic output. Its inventor worried that it might be mistaken as a measure of citizens' well-being. Mr. Yang's campaign has proposed that America measure its economic prosperity with a different index that accounts for human and not just monetary factors, including inequality and quality of life.\\n\\nBA: But you're not proposing to fix any of that. People don't just work to make money; they do work for a sense of self-worth. They work so that they can develop skills, they work so they have the possibility of earning more money someday. You're proposing to replace a portion of the income they may have lost, but not any of those other things. Why is that a solution?\\n\\nI love work, and the numbers also clearly show that people need work. Men in particular, without work, they volunteer less than employed men. So think about that for a second. They have higher rates of substance abuse, their health deteriorates, all these social ills accompany. Of course, we need to create jobs in as many communities as possible.\\n\\nHarmful effects of unemployment are felt by men and women, but men are more likely to experience negative health effects including depression and increased risk of suicide.\\n\\nThe question is, what is the means to creating those jobs? What I'm suggesting is that if you were to put $12,000 a year into the hands of every American adult … Let's say there's a town in Missouri of 10,000 people. Let's say after I'm president, their disposable income goes up by $10 million a month. Where is that money going to go? It's going to go into car repairs, day care expenses, Little League sign-ups, the occasional night out.\\n\\nIf you were a person in that town in Missouri and you wanted to start a bakery, before the dividend, it's a dumb idea. Post-dividend, it might be a great idea. You can hire someone to help staff the bakery, you know if the bakery fails, you're going to survive because you have this income that you can rely upon. This is the most stable and secure way to create jobs that actually reflect our community's needs and values. What are the other alternatives? For the government to come in and say, Hey, we're going to designate five people to clean up this park forever. We're going to designate 10 people to make our people stronger forever, regardless of whether or not they're ——\\n\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the federal government commissioned a series of experiments to look at how guaranteed income effects labor participation. Researchers discovered that a program like U.B.I. doesn't have the drastic effect on work that some might predict; households overall reduce their workload by roughly 13 percent, according to a paper in the Canadian Public Policy journal.\\n\\nBA: So a Republican would say that alternative is to let markets work. Is that what makes you a Democrat — you don't think the market will create enough jobs for Americans?\\n\\nOh, I think the market will work beautifully toward what it's designed to do. The market is designed for maximal capital efficiency, and it is doing a phenomenal job. That's why you see the returns on capital outstripping the returns on labor at historic levels. The market is not designed to maximize human well-being.\\n\\nAnd again, all you have to do to look at it is to say, stock market prices and G.D.P. record highs, life expectancy declining. Like, that sums it up. You know? You don't need any clearer divergence than that.\\n\\nMr. Trump likes to say that the economy has reached historic highs under his administration. However, life expectancy has been falling and other measures of well-being have declined, including rising rates of depression diagnosis.\\n\\nWhat I'm suggesting is we actually make capitalism's goals align with ours, as human beings, as parents, as Americans. Instead of maximizing these capital efficiency measurements, we should be maximizing our own health and life expectancy, our children's education and success rates, our mental health and freedom from substance abuse, our environmental sustainability. Then we can line up the power of the markets with how we are doing. But the markets do not care one whit about us and our children.\\n\\nBA: I want to ask you about the — Oh, sorry, go ahead.\\n\\nKK: Oh, sorry, I just wanted to ask you, you know, there are some people who would suggest that a better use of money, instead of giving a Freedom Dividend, would be to dramatically overhaul America's high schools and start teaching people different skills instead of trying to continue the race against A.I. Why isn't that a path? Why couldn't we instead change how we do education in this country?\\n\\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's Future of Education and Skills 2030 project is exploring the ways education systems internationally need to change to prepare students for a rapidly automating economy.\\n\\nWe should definitely do that, in a very big and dramatic way. And I have proposals to help move us toward a better model of high school education. Only 6 percent of American high school students are in technical, trade or apprenticeship tracks. In Germany, that's 59 percent. Think about that gulf. Meanwhile, there are millions of those trade and middle-scale jobs that are left unfilled. Why is this?\\n\\nOne, it's a lot easier and cheaper for us to throw kids into a classroom with textbooks and a teacher and say, You're going to go to college, than it is to try and train them in skills that are going to give them a secure livelihood. Number two, we have fetishized college and stigmatized anything that's not college. We've beaten Americans over the head, pretended everyone's going to college and say, It's going to work for you. And the Democrats are guilty of this. That's why they're yelling, Free college, free college. Meanwhile, again, only 33 percent of Americans are going to go to college, and that is a relatively stable number.\\n\\nThe question of whether to prioritize free public college has divided the Democratic candidates. Senators Warren and Sanders say that four-year public colleges should be free, and Senator Cory Booker signed on to legislation that could make it debt-free. Senator Amy Klobuchar previously criticized the idea of free college for all, but then signed on to a version of a free-college proposal. Mr. Yang, though, has said he supports forgiving more student loan debt but thinks the Freedom Dividend is a better solution to inequality than free college.\\n\\nKK: But access to college is still a civil rights issue in this country.\\n\\nPresident Obama referred to education as the civil rights issue of our time, as did former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. Indeed, the gap between education outcomes for black and white students has barely budged in recent decades, according to research from the Brookings Institution.\\n\\nIt very much is. But if you were to apply resources, you would want to apply resources in ways that don't necessarily advantage the top third of your population by educational attainment exclusively. You would be trying to build more paths with the other two-thirds, which investing in trades and apprenticeships would do, and you would try and provide for the people who are the weakest and most vulnerable in the job market, which are not going to be the people that are attending college.\\n\\nMost American laborers work in the services sector, according to Pew Research — in July 2019, 107.8 million people worked in private service-providing industries including trade, transportation and utilities.\\n\\nOur economy is breaking down on all levels. Again, if you are fortunate enough to graduate from college today, you're in the top third of the population, you're graduating with tens of thousands in school loans very, very often, and there's a 40 to 44 percent chance you're going to do a job that does not require your college degree. That's if you're one of the winners in our society today. I spent seven years working with, frankly, some of the top educational products in our country. I saw that even the winners are not winning right now. And so imagine if you're a nonwinner, what this looks like.\\n\\nBS: Would you dilate what you're talking — seven years doing what?\\n\\nI started and ran a national nonprofit called Venture for America that recruited enterprising college graduates to help grow businesses in Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, New Orleans, Birmingham, Baltimore, and nine other American cities. We helped create several thousand jobs. I'm very, very proud of that. But I realize that the jobs we were creating were only going to apply for a small slice of the population. And these jobs were pouring water into a bathtub that has a giant hole ripped in the bottom. I'm running for president to let America know that it is not our imagination, the water is rushing out of the bathtub. Immigrants have nothing to do with it. It's the fact that we're going through the greatest economic transformation.\\n\\nMr. Yang founded Venture for America, a fellowship program for recent college graduates, in 2011, with the goal of creating 100,000 new jobs in the country's most underresourced cities. As of 2019, the nonprofit has created around 3,500 jobs.\\n\\nBA: Just before we move on, maybe I can ask one more question.\\n\\nOf course, sure.\\n\\nBA: Your proposal is oddly regressive. On the benefits side you're proposing that people will have to choose between this benefit and their existing federal benefits while someone like me just all the sudden gets a new check in their mailbox every month. On the funding side you're relying on a VAT, which is an inherently regressive funding mechanism. You've proposed some offsets, but I still don't understand why you don't just embrace a progressive approach to taxation. Either raise top rates or a wealth tax. If there are people who need help, why aren't you trying to help them as much as possible?\\n\\nA VAT (value-added tax) is a tax on consumption, so the burden disproportionately falls on low-income households, who spend a larger portion of their income.\\n\\nI'm for a more progressive tax structure. It's clear that the people at the top of the income chain are not paying enough. I don't think a wealth tax will work. I like the spirit of a wealth tax, but if you look at other countries' experience, Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, very sophisticated developed countries, they tried a wealth tax and they wound up repealing it because it had massive compliance problems, and it did not generate anywhere near the revenue that was projected.\\n\\nSo if you cannot learn from the experiences of other countries, what can you learn from? We have to take a policy that actually works, and what those countries and every other developed country have determined works, is a value added tax. Because a value added tax is impossible to game your way out of. If you're a trillion-dollar technology company — you know, I was just in New Hampshire campaigning yesterday, and you know what I say to them? I say to everyone around the country, Amazon, a trillion-dollar technology company sucking up $20 billion in business every year, closing 30 percent of your stores and malls, paying zero in taxes, how do you feel about that? You know? And they are angry. They say, how the heck can Amazon be paying zero in taxes? And I was like, I know. And it's up to you, the people of New Hampshire, to change it. So if you look at other countries ——\\n\\nIn 1990, 12 European countries had some form of a wealth tax, while today only three have kept the policy — Norway, Spain and Switzerland. Reports by the O.E.C.D. and others have found that the tax led to an exodus of the wealthy and didn't raise as much revenue as anticipated.\\n\\nBA: But that doesn't make our tax code more progressive.\\n\\nSo if you look at other countries, they have a value-added tax and then they take those resources and put them to work toward various social programs in ways to balance out the inequality. Now, another thing I love about the value-added tax is you can either reduce it or exempt things like diapers, toilet paper, eggs, milk, things that Americans consume just to make ends meet, and you can dial it up on things like artificial intelligence, yachts, luxury watches. There are ways that you can make it so that it falls more heavily on people that would barely notice. And we're taking the resources plus an additional hundreds of billions of dollars and putting it directly into the hands of working Americans. This would increase the buying power of literally 90 percent of Americans.\\n\\nBA: But just to be clear, it's still not a progressive tax. There's no model that says that you can use these kinds of exclusions and exemptions to make that progressive. You can make it less regressive. You're still fundamentally proposing a nonprogressive means of revenue raising.\\n\\nA progressive tax is one in which the rate increases with income, while a regressive tax increases inversely with income.\\n\\nIn a vacuum, you're 100 percent correct. But it's failing to account for the fact that we're taking that money, and then some, and putting it directly into the hands of the American consumer.\\n\\nBA: But that just brings us to the other side of it, where what you're proposing is not to give as much more money to the people who need it the most. You're saying, if you get food stamps, the amount by which your government benefits increase will be less than for me or you.\\n\\nA working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that U.B.I. could redirect spending to more affluent and middle-income families, therefore leaving low-income families worse off; a U.B.I. large enough to direct more funds to low-income households would be extremely costly. Read the paper here.\\n\\nLet's say I'm on food stamps, and I've got a 15-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. I'm concerned about their future, very, very deeply. And then Andrew Yang becomes president, and I find out that my 15-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month starting at age 18 for the rest of his life, and my 12-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month for the rest of her life. I'm going to say, wow. That's actually the biggest value gain I've ever even heard of in history. My kid will have a financial literacy class in high school, the first semester of their senior year. It is impossible to teach financial literacy to someone who does not have money. So the kids will actually learn about what to do with the money before they start getting the money.\\n\\nOther candidates have taken a different approach to creating a nest egg for low-income youth — Senator Booker, for example, favors baby bonds, which would provide every infant with a savings account that the government would contribute to annually depending on family income.\\n\\nThis is a game changer for Americans in any circumstance. And I am not for reducing or curtailing any of these social programs. For me, we're trying to lay a foundation that works for all Americans, and then we need to keep building on top of it. So if there are people that post-Freedom Dividend need additional programs and assistance, I'm all for it.\\n\\nKK: I want to ask you, you were the C.E.O. of Manhattan Prep. How does test prep — doesn't that contribute to income inequality in the United States?\\n\\nMr. Yang was the C.E.O. of a boutique test prep company that was purchased by Kaplan in 2009. The company flourished during the 2008 financial collapse, becoming the country's foremost preparatory company for the GMAT as more people flocked to business school.\\n\\nYeah, it does. It's one reason why I think we need to de-emphasize — excuse me.\\n\\nKK: Take your time.\\n\\nNot at all. We originated the SAT during World War II as a way to determine which kids we did not want to send to the front lines. Now we treat our kids like every year is wartime. I've talked to parents and teachers around the country, and I've said, we need to de-emphasize these standardized tests. They are a terrible measurement of human value, certainly have nothing to do with character. At this point, as you said, they are more likely to test your parents' socioeconomic status than anything else.\\n\\nThe SAT was first administered in 1926 and evolved out of a test used for admission to Princeton University and Cooper Union. It was inspired by military experiments with I.Q. testing.\\n\\nSo we need to have better, more holistic ways of measuring how our kids are doing educationally, and we need to empower teachers and let teachers do their jobs. Because if you are a teacher and you're teaching to the test, you end up making decisions in the classroom that you know are not right for the students.\\n\\nKK: Actually, I also want to ask you about your time at Manhattan Prep. Your colleague Kimberly Watkins told City Council in September that she had faced both gender harassment and pay inequity under your leadership there. Could you respond to those allegations?\\n\\nI believe your reporters then talked to maybe half a dozen or more of Kim's contemporaries at the organization and found out that those allegations were completely groundless, which they were.\\n\\nIn an essay published by the Gotham Gazette, Kimberly Watkins alleged that Mr. Yang fired her from Manhattan Prep because he did not think she would continue working as hard after getting married. Mr. Yang appeared on The View shortly after and said there was zero truth to Ms. Watkins's account. After publication, Ms. Watkins reached out to the editorial board, noting the question contained an error — she testified before a New York City hearing on pay equity, but, as she wroteto us , I have on multiple occasions drawn contrast to 'pay equity,' with what I experienced, which concerns long term economic stability. The reality that my economic future was destroyed by Yang, right after my marriage, after an unblemished six-year commitment to this company, has been the focus of my story, not pay inequity…Yang's response [also] grossly overstates the investigative process and draws a false conclusion.\\n\\nNick Fox: Can I clarify one point on taxation? Are you proposing any new or increased taxes on the wealthiest Americans or corporations, or is it strictly the VAT?\\n\\nIf you look at our proposals, we have a tax on financial transactions, which would obviously end up falling most heavily on the wealthiest Americans and the wealthiest companies. We have a carbon tax, which tends to fall most heavily on the wealthiest industries, which are emitting a lot. The value-added tax would obviously be enormously generative from people who benefit from society and consume the most. I'm for trying to restore our income tax levels to previous levels to be more progressive.\\n\\nA Times evaluation of Mr. Yang's tax plan by N. Gregory Mankiw, professor of economics at Harvard, found that Mr. Yang's tax plan would target the affluent who spend their money lavishly while incentivizing people to save.\\n\\nMichelle Cottle: Now, I think it's clear that people are responding to you in part because you have this big vision, but Washington has a problem achieving even kind of modest ——\\n\\nMr. Yang has a fervent online following that calls itself the Yang Gang.\\n\\nYeah, we noticed.\\n\\nMC: So, and we are currently enjoying a businessmen president who has no experience in government or the military. What is your argument to people, that we should trust you with no experience in government and the military, in the same position, and that you will do a better job dealing with the peculiarities of Washington.\\n\\nMany of Mr. Yang's supporters say they are drawn to his perspective as a political outsider; in The Wall Street Journal, some say they previously supported Senator Sanders but now look for a candidate who offers an even fresher non-Washington perspective.\\n\\nWell, it sounds like you've been there.\\n\\nMC: Quite a lot.\\n\\nDid you come up for this?\\n\\nMC: Yeah, I'm based out of ——\\n\\nOh, man. Well, thank you for making the trip. Then you know. First, any person who says they're going to run government like a business does not know what they're talking about, because they are two completely different things.\\n\\nIn a business you can say, Hey, we're going to go this way, and people generally have to do what you're saying. In government it's much more analogous to my role as the founder of a national nonprofit, where you have hundreds or even thousands of stakeholders, and you have to try and generate energy around a vision. Let people see that it's in their self-interest or the self-interest of the people that they represent to get on board with your vision. And that you're willing to compromise and work with them. That is the way I would lead as president.\\n\\nMr. Yang told Vox's Recode that one of the reasons he quit Venture for America, the nonprofit he created, was because he realized it couldn't achieve the change he wanted at the necessary scale. For instance, it had fallen short of the 100,000 jobs he set out for it to create.\\n\\nDonald Trump does not speak for every non-politician or nonmilitary officer. But there is a deep need, and you've seen this, because you spent time in D.C., the D.C. establishment will not generate big solutions.\\n\\nOne of the reasons why Donald Trump is our president is that millions of Americans feel like our government is unresponsive to our needs and the needs in our communities. They've been casting about for some sort of change agent for years. And it's not just Donald Trump's victory; it was Bernie Sanders outsized success. In some ways, it was even Obama's victory in 2008. If you remember that campaign, it was oh, hope, change. It was not, get the most experienced person in the seat as possible, because we are decades behind the curve in addressing the problems and challenges that are tearing us apart. Now ——\\n\\nMr. Yang has frequently said that automation contributed heavily to Mr. Trump's win, because voters feel disaffected and worry that the futures of their jobs and industries are in jeopardy.\\n\\nKK: Do you feel like President Obama achieved the change that he had promised in the 2008 campaign?\\n\\nI think that he did a lot of great things and he did a lot of what he could, but to the extent that there was a missed opportunity, it was in the wake of the financial crisis. And it's very hard to Monday morning quarterback a team when they literally felt like the economy itself was at stake, but we should have done much more to recapitalize homeowners as opposed to the banks. We could have kept many more people in their homes. We could've kept many of these communities ——\\n\\nA critique of President Obama's financial policies by Matt Stoller, of the Open Markets Institute, argues that the Obama administration let banking executives off the hook for their role in the financial crisis and enabled nine million foreclosures.\\n\\nBS: Without a doubt.\\n\\n—— more strong and more whole. There's a saying, I think it was actually, and maybe in this … no, it was an earlier administration, but a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. There was a crisis. There was a massive opportunity to help rebalance our economy, but we instead recapitalized the banks to the tune of $4 trillion. And what I say to Americans around the country, I say, Hey, do you remember voting for the $4 trillion bailout of Wall Street? And it gets this laugh. But then they answer, Wait, we did that? And it's, Of course we didn't vote for that.\\n\\nA crisis is a terrible thing to waste is a quote attributed to the Stanford economist Paul Romer. He made the comment at a meeting in 2004, referring to the competition America faces from the rising education levels around the globe. Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's chief of staff, later echoed the statement after President Obama's election.\\n\\nSo, that to me was the biggest missed opportunity in the Obama administration, and it happened very, very early on. I wish that they owned and reflected a little bit on the fact that maybe they could have done some things differently at that stage, because we're still angry. This country is still angry. I was so shocked by what happened in the financial crisis, I quit my job and started a national nonprofit and ran it for seven years. I had — my wife was pregnant. I mean, what happened to this country then is still tearing us apart.\\n\\nMr. Yang started Venture for America in 2011, shortly after selling his test prep company to Kaplan. He said that he saw, in the wake of the financial crisis, how certain communities were rapidly losing jobs and wanted to create new work opportunities in those underserved areas.\\n\\nLauren Kelley: Mr. Yang, can you say who is on your short list for running mate?\\n\\nI love this question.\\n\\nLK: So do we.\\n\\nWell, one of the joys of running for president is you get to know incredible people on the trail, including some of the other contenders. I'm on the record saying I would prefer to have a female running mate. I think teams run better if you have men and women leaders at the highest possible levels. I joke, but it's mostly true, that if you get too many men alone for too long, we kind of become morons. So we need to keep that from happening at the highest levels.\\n\\nMr. Yang confirmed this summer that he would like his running mate to be a woman.\\n\\nMC: He has my vote. All right. [LAUGHTER]\\n\\nBut at the same time, in order to have someone at that level of relationship, you need to have as much trust as possible and I'm still developing that kind of relationship with some of the other, not just candidates, but also people who could be running mates that are not currently running.\\n\\nMr. Yang has scored internet points with some tweets paying tribute to former 2020 Democratic rivals, for example by tweeting I miss Beto.\\n\\nLK: So no names yet.\\n\\nNo names yet, no.\\n\\nKK: Do you feel like you need to have a running mate who has operated in Washington before or who has previous government experience?\\n\\nAlmost certainly, yes. And you saw it a little bit with Barack Obama where he tapped Joe Biden in part because Joe had very deep relationships on Capitol Hill. If you had another outsider like me, we'd still be trying to figure out who to call. So, you need to have folks who have deep relationships on Capitol Hill from day one.\\n\\nLK: Speaking of women, I wanted to ask you about reproductive rights as well. You told some of our colleagues in the newsroom that you would consider some executive actions to protect reproductive rights, but I haven't seen any details about what actions you're considering. Do you have any details to share with us about that?\\n\\nWell, I'm all about trying to improve the reality on the ground, to the extent that we can actually put resources and funds to work in communities to make sure that women have access to reproductive rights in clinics. Certainly any way we can make sure that there aren't any obstacles to the funding of Planned Parenthood clinics around the country. I would take those actions immediately. A lot of the legislative actions, you need a bit more time and a bit more buy-in from Congress, but at the Supreme Court level, I would consider appointing more justices if it was necessary to safeguard women's reproductive rights.\\n\\nMr. Yang has argued that more legislative oversight on reproductive issues should come from physicians rather than politicians. He tweeted: I personally don't think male legislators should be weighing in on women's reproductive rights and freedoms.\\n\\nKK: You mean, you would in addition to the nine that we already have?\\n\\nIn addition to the nine we already have. I believe that — so if you look at the Constitution, there is nothing there that stipulates the number of Supreme Court justices. We've had fewer than nine, we've had more than nine. I think that appointing new justices would be helpful on several levels. It would help depoliticize the process, at least marginally, because if you have 17 justices and one steps down, then it's not as much of an earthquake. Well, right now we we're hinging our laws on the health of an octogenarian. It would literally be rational for us to all just to follow Ruth Bader Ginsburg around and just scrub any door knob she touches. You know what I mean?\\n\\nJustice Bader Ginsburg has had a series of health scares in recent years, including surgery for lung cancer and radiation treatment. She also had surgery for early-stage pancreatic cancer in 2009.\\n\\nJW: You remember what happened the last time a president tried to do this, right?\\n\\nYeah. And I think in some ways, there's some positive lessons to be drawn from that time, because there were some significant accomplishments during that era.\\n\\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt tried to advance a court-packing strategy to ensure favorable rulings on New Deal legislation. He wanted to appoint up to six additional justices, one for every justice older than 70 years. The plan was unpopular in Congress and among the Supreme Court's justices.\\n\\nKK: So, can you give us some names of people you would nominate to the Supreme Court?\\n\\nThat's a fun exercise, too. I haven't gotten into the judicial appointment shortlist yet, but safeguarding women's reproductive rights would be one clear criteria. Because women's reproductive rights are fundamental human rights in my mind.\\n\\nI think it's actually unfortunate that I get asked about those sorts of questions, in the sense that I feel like men should leave the room and let women decide what to do with your bodies. I have a feeling I know what you would decide, and then we could come back and say, Hey, what did you decide? I also think that if men got pregnant, this would be a very, very different conversation. And we'd have a completely different approach to these issues. So, I don't have a short list of Supreme Court justice appointees, but safeguarding women's reproductive rights and having an evolving sense of the law would be very important.\\n\\nWe need to modernize the court. Lifetime appointments might have made sense at one point a long time ago, but when the Constitution was drafted, people did not live as long. And also, people stepped down from the Supreme Court for any of a range of reasons. They did not wait until they were at death's door. This is not a way to run a 21st-century society.\\n\\nWe should have 18-year term limits, increase the number of justices, make it so it's predictable that you lose an election, the other party might get one or two justices, and then we don't need to literally be monitoring the health of our justices. Or, the most ridiculous thing is you're literally looking at the age of the person you're appointing being, Ooh, this person will be there for 30, 40 years. What kind of system do you want where you're having a society decide 30 years ago what women's rights are today? Doesn't make any sense.\\n\\nJW: Are you concerned that you wouldn't be triggering a sort of a war of — a back and forth between Republicans and Democrats, who were continuing to add justices to the bench with each new administration to satisfy their own policy priorities?\\n\\nIf you have term limits, it is bipartisan. Because ——\\n\\nJW: Right, but you're talking about expanding the court, too, and if you expand the court, as you say correctly, that it's a federal law, there's nothing in the Constitution about the number of justices. You expand it to 13, the next Republican who comes in, who is furious about women having too many reproductive rights, will expand it to 17 to overturn the rulings you just got. So, how doesn't that just become — doesn't devolve into ——\\n\\nCourt packing isn't a violation of any part of the Constitution, but it is widely debated with critics pointing out that it would trigger severe political backlash.\\n\\nBS: An arms race.\\n\\nWell, I would suggest that one side has been acting as if it is an arms race. And so, in that environment, it's only appropriate to respond in a way that you think would help move the country and our legal system in the right direction. Can I talk — oh.\\n\\nJeneen Interlandi: Oh no, go ahead.\\n\\nJW: I just wanted to tie together the question — a question from Lauren and a question from Michelle, and ask you about Washington, both with regard to Supreme Court confirmation process and your agenda more generally. You said at the very beginning of our conversation, in response to Katie, that you don't need a — you were talking about various [cross talk].\\n\\nYeah, you said you don't need 80 percent of Congress, you need a majority. And I would push back and say neither of those is correct. You need 60 percent of the Senate currently. The question is, how do you plan to get things done, even if you had a Democratic majority in the Senate? Which I think is right now less than an even chance. How do you propose getting your agenda through Congress when the filibuster is in place?\\n\\nTo your earlier concern, I think we should examine the filibuster. I think that gridlock is bad for anyone trying to get anything done and solve problems. This might be controversial in this room, but I am for the restoration of earmarks, because it helped make legislation possible. That if I was a congressperson in a district, and there was a bill being passed, it's, Hey, at least I can get some pork for my local museum. And that's a very small price to pay for a functional legislature. So, getting past the filibuster to me is one possible necessity, and the restoration of earmarks could be another.\\n\\nEarmarking allows Congress to appropriate discretionary funds for specific projects. Mr. Yang supports them because he feels they allow representatives to generate revenue for their constituents to offset costs their area might experience from a given piece of legislation.\\n\\nJW: And let me just, one last follow-up on that. If Democrats don't take back the Senate, how do you feel with the Supreme Court — how do you, I mean, put aside expanding the number of justices, how do you even get a justice onto the court in the first place?\\n\\nIt's obviously much harder. I'm all about trying to maximize the possible. And so, if we don't get a majority — I expect the Democrats will win a slight majority in the Senate. I'm very optimistic that way, but we're going to get done what we can get done with the branch of the government we have control of. And I will say too, I believe that we can get some things done that are traditionally bipartisan, regardless of who has control of the Senate. To me, I cannot believe that we did not get infrastructure done during the first couple of years of the Trump administration. I thought at least he would build some bridges and roads, and I was even willing to accept the Trump name on those bridges and roads if it got some bridges and roads built. I was, At least we're going to get this.\\n\\nThe editorial board recently called for the Trump administration to break the impasse on funding for the proposed rail tunnel under the Hudson River in an editorial titled: Build the Donald J. Trump Tunnel. The vital infrastructure project has stalled because of political infighting.\\n\\nKK: We've called for that, too.\\n\\nReally? So, we have to get done what we can get done. And if we have to focus on things that are traditionally bipartisan, I'd be excited to lead with that. I mean, I'd be much more excited to lead with a much bigger agenda to balance out this economy, to work for people. And I will say that's bipartisan, too. When I go around to Americans around the country, if you were to go to a room of Republicans and say, Hey, how do you feel about Amazon paying zero in taxes? They're not excited about that. They feel like this economy is rigged against them and their families, and they're generally correct, and that is bipartisan.\\n\\nJI: You've proposed legalizing gambling at the federal level, regulating it.\\n\\nKK: Online.\\n\\nJI: Yeah, online gambling.\\n\\nJust online poker.\\n\\nJI: Yes. Regulating it heavily and using the revenue to treat gambling addiction. Can you talk through that? You say on your website that you think gambling addiction doesn't get nearly enough attention, and it is a really important issue. How does legalizing gambling, even if you use the revenue, not make that problem worse?\\n\\nAny American who wants to gamble online on a poker site can do so from any state in the country right now. If it's illegal in your state, you just end up using an offshore betting site, which is shady, has problems, but it's not going to ease your gambling addiction at all. So the question is, do we want Americans, in the vast majority of the country, on offshore betting sites, dealing with shady characters and generating no revenue and still being addicted? Or would we prefer that they do business with American firms, where we do have better regulations, we know they're not getting cheated, we know they're not getting exploited, and you generate tax revenue that you can use to treat gambling addiction.\\n\\nMr. Yang's campaign estimates that federally regulating the U.S. online poker market could raise $2.2 billion just in its first year. The campaign also argues that federal regulation would make it easier to combat money laundering.\\n\\nJI: So, what steps would you take to take that money and create a gambling addiction treatment program or system? So, what exactly would you do to get from A to B?\\n\\nI mean, you could make it so it's analogous to what happened in the tobacco industry, where there's a certain level of revenue that gets set aside and then you have various public service announcements.\\n\\nPresident Obama signed into law the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in 2009, which gave the Food and Drug Administration authority to fully regulate the sale of tobacco products.\\n\\nJI: In that system, a lot of that money didn't actually go to treating tobacco-related health problems. A lot of it went to shoring up state budgets, and some of them even went to the tobacco industry actually, so I don't know if that's the best model.\\n\\nIn 2007 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that states direct 14 percent of funds from tobacco taxes and the national settlement toward antismoking campaigns, but most states have funneled it toward other areas, from agriculture to literacy.\\n\\nOh, you might not want to push the money to the states and then have them determine how to use it in their budgets. You could empower a national program or an agency to help administer it at the federal level, if you didn't trust the states to actually use it in the right way.\\n\\nJI: I actually really quickly want to go back to a question that Binya was asking you. You said, you gave us the example of parents with two kids and you're on food stamps and you're worried about your kids' future. And at the end of that explanation, you said that you are not for curtailing social supports, but isn't your plan such that, that mother, aside from what the kids would get in the future, that mother would have to choose between the food stamps and the actual U.B.I., right? Is that correct?\\n\\nThat is correct. But when I've dug into it, very, very few Americans are getting $1,000 in food stamps. And most of the people who are on government assistance live in fear of losing that assistance because there are various requirements that tend to come with it. And when, if you ask them, say, Hey, would you prefer $1,000 unconditional that you can rely upon, they actually think that's too good to be true.\\n\\nJI: Sure. But to Binya's point, it's still a trade-off. So, if I'm on food stamps, I'm getting less of a benefit than, say, Jesse, who's not on food stamps.\\n\\nWell to me, playing the relative benefit game, I mean of course in any large scale national program, it's you can't calibrate it precisely to everyone's individual situation. To me the test is more, is that person going to be better off tomorrow than they are today?\\n\\nKK: So I want to move on. We have some more personal questions for you.\\n\\nReally?\\n\\nKK: I think Mara's going to kick you off.\\n\\nMG: So, if you become president, what government secret are you most excited to learn about?\\n\\nDefinitely aliens, of course.\\n\\nKK: O.K.\\n\\nThat'd be my first question if I got in there, I'd be, All right, let me see them. Let's see what we've been hiding all of these years.\\n\\nKK: And, who has broken your heart?\\n\\nWow, these questions are really fun. Who's broken my heart?\\n\\nBS: Don't be tactical now.\\n\\nThis is — I mean, this is going to make me very sad to say, but I feel like I had an arc or a relationship with President Obama, where it was inspirational when he won. I was celebrating with my wife in the streets. And then over the years I began to feel like we'd missed a great opportunity. So, I'd say there was some heartbreak attached to that. And I worked with the president afterward, and I still admire him a great deal, but I think we could have done a lot more, and I don't think opportunities like that come along very often.\\n\\nThe Obama administration named Mr. Yang a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship in 2015 and a Champion of Change in 2012.\\n\\nKK: For millions of Americans, church and religion are the centers of their communities. Do you believe in God? Do you go to church regularly? Who are your spiritual advisers?\\n\\nI grew up in an entirely secular household. My parents did not talk about God in the house, but I had this instinctive belief in a higher power. I had many Christian relatives. I went to church over holidays growing up quite often. And then I married my wife, Evelyn, who's Christian. And so, we're raising our kids in a Christian church. I go to church when I'm home, which is not very often unfortunately nowadays. I enjoy it. My faith is still very much a journey, but I'm unreservedly thrilled about the impact it has on my wife, my boys, my family, my community.\\n\\nMr. Yang was raised in New York; his parents immigrated from Taiwan.\\n\\nBS: Which denomination?\\n\\nIt's a progressive Protestant church. We primarily go upstate, where we have a house in a town called New Paltz. They've got a rainbow flag up front. It's a very welcoming community.\\n\\nMr. Yang and his family began attending Sunday services at the Reformed Church of New Paltz after they purchased a home nearby in 2015.\\n\\nMG: Actually just a quick follow-up. When was the last time you rode the subway?\\n\\nI rode the subway maybe six weeks ago or so. It's become much more of a pain in the neck now that I actually get recognized. I confess that that's been the biggest adjustment in running for president. Because I was, No, I'm not going to get recognized on the street. Of course, keep in mind, when I started my run I was completely anonymous. I mean none of you had ever heard of me. And also there is, and this is not to make too much of it, but there's also this invisible Asian man thing. That you feel like all you have to do is just not want to be seen and then you disappear, and that doesn't work anymore.\\n\\nWhen I'm on the subway, people will look at me and then look at me. And then eventually someone will inch over and say, Hey, you running for president? And then I'll say, Yes, I am. They'll say, Yeah, yeah, I like you. Thousand bucks a month, something like that. And then they want to take pictures. And then as soon as someone breaks the seal, then it's safe for everyone to do it. And so, then I'll be — and then there's this uncomfortable period in this subway car after you've taken the pictures with him, you're still sitting there. And so then they're, So, where are you going? Or, how's Bernie? Or whatever the questions are. And so, I have not been riding the subway lately, but I've ridden the subway an awful lot over the years. Now my preferred mode of transportation is the bike, because if someone recognizes me, it's generally too late.\\n\\nKK: I thought you were going to say it's a lot harder to ride the subway now because of the breakdowns of New York infrastructure.\\n\\nIn 2017, Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York's subway and pledged $1 billion for improvements. The editorial board has repeatedly called for action to make the subways workable for this paper's millions of readers.\\n\\nThat too. I mean, it's rough. But I mean, New York's going through — I just want to bring some things to you from experience. Like yeah, the infrastructure breaking down. I mean, we're coasting on the investments made decades ago and they're starting to fall apart. But also what you all do in terms of journalism — I've been campaigning around the country and over 1,200 local papers have gone out of business because the local establishments that used to advertise are gone. All of their classified revenue went off to Craigslist and democracy works much less if you don't have local journalism.\\n\\nA report released by PEN America in November found that more than 1,800 local print outlets have closed since 2004, and at least 200 counties have no newspaper.\\n\\nThis, to me, is an emblem of what's gone wrong in American life. Where the market is all knowing and all powerful, and if the market decides that local journalism has zero value, then it has zero value. And that is not the way forward for us. We need to make our own independent determination of our own value as people, of the value of local journalism, of the value of arts, of the value of volunteering, of caregiving, of — like all the most important things in American life. And so you, in many ways, you're like the guardians of this incredible journalistic tradition, and it's like a unique privilege because the people who've pursued the same vocation in other parts of the country are just seeing it disappear.\\n\\nKK: Do you believe in government subsidies for journalism?\\n\\nYes. I have three major pro-journalism proposals on my website, including federally funding journalists for every congressional district, billions of dollars in grants to help transition local journalism. Matching grants, so you're not like saying, Hey, we're going to do this. But matching grants to help transition them to cooperative models of ownership to nonprofit and philanthropic models.\\n\\nOne criticism of government subsidized journalism is that it could stifle the media's capacity to serve as a watchdog.\\n\\nYou can build it around the town library, because a lot of them have this bulletin board that serves as the skeleton of a local paper when the local paper has gone out of business. A lot of these papers would be able to get by if they did not have to generate stock market level returns for hedge fund owners and private equity owners. If you had a cooperative model and it's made a certain amount of money, spent a certain amount of money, ran as a nonprofit, you could restore and sustain local journalism and thousands of communities, but it will not happen without government support. It just won't.\\n\\nKK: Think you might be overly optimistic. Maybe we'll move on to foreign policy, if you don't mind?\\n\\nSure. Yeah.\\n\\nAlex Kingsbury: Another thing the country's invested in quite a lot is the military, and as commander in chief, you'd be in charge of that. Can you tell me how many aircraft carriers the United States Navy has?\\n\\nOh my gosh.\\n\\nAK: Whether or not the Navy is big enough to meet its commitments with the Chinese and the South China Sea? What's going on in the Persian Gulf? What do you think?\\n\\nI think the number of aircraft carriers is either seven or nine. I confess to not knowing precisely. In terms of our investment, we're spending $650 billion plus on our military. Certainly more than any other country, but I think more than the next four countries combined, and we have to examine, at this stage, whether that $650 billion is making us safer and more secure.\\n\\nThe correct answer is 11.\\n\\nWhat are the true threats of the 21st century? Climate change is number one, and then cybersecurity and A.I., loose nuclear material, military drones in the hands of nonstate actors. It's very hard to secure a location from something the size of a flying vacuum cleaner. That's very, very difficult. So we're entering an era where it's going to be much easier to be offensive than defensive, and you don't need massive levels of resources to cause significant levels of damage. To me, a new aircraft carrier does not make our elections any more secure from Russian hacking, which is the most direct threat to our democracy upcoming in this cycle. We're spending money on the threats of the 20th century, and we need to try and modernize our approach as quickly as possible.\\n\\nAK: The president at the moment is at a NATO summit, or he might've left ——\\n\\nI saw the headlines about how people were making fun of him. I was like, Oh man, this is really — we really have to put an end to this administration.\\n\\nMr. Trump canceled a planned news conference at a NATO gathering in December after a video circulated that showed world leaders including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Emmanuel Macron of France in what appeared to be a conversation mocking Mr. Trump.\\n\\nAK: But one of his priorities has been to get our European allies to spend more money on their own defense. And I wonder if you think that that's a worthwhile goal and how you might go about it, if you agree that that's something that should be a priority for the United States.\\n\\nTo me, one of the worst things you can do in a relationship is if you have this longstanding understanding or a friendship or partnership, and then you try and change the understanding at a particular point in time and do it unilaterally.\\n\\nWe need to let our historic allies know that our commitments are good, and that if we want to make a change, we want to do it in a way that's not pulling the rug out from under you but actually consultative. If we want other people to invest more, then we have to try and sit down with them and drive them to do so without questioning our commitment to NATO wholesale. But to me, trying to nickel-and-dime our relationships with our historic allies is not the best way forward. I think it was James Mattis that said that if you invest more in diplomacy, you have to invest less in ammunition, which should be the goal. So we need to make sure our partnerships and alliances are actually strong, stable and secure, and then we can put pressure on Russia and China with more of a global consensus, and maintain the international world order that's benefited us for decades that now is falling apart because Donald Trump is so erratic and unreliable, even with the people we've been allies with for decades.\\n\\nIn response to announcements about Mr. Trump's planned cuts to State Department funding, retired generals wrote a letter to lawmakers citing Secretary of Defense James Mattis's 2013 comment, If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately.\\n\\nAK: Speaking of allies, should Ukraine be invited to join NATO? I know that Ukraine's received sort of undue influence on this election, but going forward?\\n\\nI mean, that's not solely an American decision. NATO expansion is something that is fraught and elevates tensions with Russia in particular. I think we should explore it. I'm sympathetic, but it's not a decision we can make alone.\\n\\nA recent poll found that roughly 50 percent of the Ukrainian population favors joining NATO, though Hungary's foreign minister recently said his country would block Ukrainian membership unless Ukraine changed a policy restricting its citizens' use of minority languages.\\n\\nKK: Do you think — speaking of allies, do you think Turkey is still an ally to the United States, and do you think the U.S. should have nuclear weapons there?\\n\\nThis is what's so tough right now is that countries are trying to figure out what are the benefits of being an ally of the United States and doing what we want them to do, and then what are the costs. Unfortunately that calculation is going against us more and more. Turkey's relationship with the U.S. has been stronger than our relationship with many other countries in that region. I think we should invest in that relationship if we're going to be able to accomplish any of our goals there. And that includes, to me, being a little bit more accommodating about behaviors that we might find objectionable or troubling from them than we might from another country.\\n\\nSerge Schmemann: Yeah. And staying with relationships and alliances, President Trump has reversed several key policies the United States has had toward Israel. He's moved the embassy to Jerusalem, he's recognized sovereignty over the Golan Heights, et cetera, et cetera. Would you reverse those?\\n\\nHistorically, we've endorsed a two-state solution, which has always struck me as the best way forward, and I think it's really unfortunate that Donald Trump has moved us away from that to the extent that he has. I would try to move us back in that direction.\\n\\nMr. Yang has frequently reiterated his commitment to a two-state solution but has not released any detailed plans about how he would advance an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan or address Mr. Trump's policies in the region. He told the Council on Foreign Relations, I don't want to prescribe the specifics of a two-state solution, as the Israeli and Palestinian people both need to be leading any conversation, and I look forward to engaging with all stakeholders.\\n\\nSS: O.K. Again, about your responsibilities as president. One of the heaviest ones would be waging war. When you look back on the conflicts into which recent presidents have put us, would you support this? Is this something you would have done in Syria, in Libya, in Kosovo? Would you have sent troops there?\\n\\nSo I have a three-part test for sending troops into harm's way. Number one, it needs to advance a vital American interest or avert a humanitarian catastrophe. Number two, it has to have a clearly defined timeline where we can look troops in the eyes and say, It's going to take this long and you're going to be able to accomplish our mission and then you're going to be able to come home. And not some boardroom self-delusion, like you actually believe that you're going to get it done and then be able to bring them home in that time frame. And number three, we're not going in alone; there are allies joining us in the mission. If those three things are in place, then I would consider sending our troops into harm's way.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, I think we have become overly aggressive and optimistic about what we can accomplish in various foreign theaters. I've signed a pledge to end the forever wars because I don't believe it's the will of the American people for us to be in a constant state of armed conflict in foreign theaters for years and even decades at a time. Our Constitution says that it's in Congress's hands to declare war, but Congress has completely ceded this authority through the A.U.M.F. [Authorization for Use of Military Force] and then just said, Hey, executive branch, you can do what you want. And now they want nothing to do with it, and that is not the will of the American people, and it's not the will of the Constitution. So we should repeal the A.U.M.F. and say, Look, Congress, if we want to authorize armed conflict, it should be on you and it should be the will of the people.\\n\\nCommon Defense's End the Forever War pledge advocates for an expedient conclusion to the global war on terror and American military involvement in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, and Mr. Yang became the fourth candidate to sign on, in May, following Senators Sanders and Warren (and former Senator Mike Gravel).\\n\\nSS: Concretely, would you have sent troops, say, to Syria?\\n\\nNo. I'd have to look at the facts at the time that that decision was being made.\\n\\nJames Dao: Can I pose a future hypothetical? If the Chinese government were to flood Hong Kong with military troops after you were president and impose a violent crackdown, similar to, say, Tiananmen Square in 1989, what would you do?\\n\\nI have family in Hong Kong. I spent a semester there in college, and so when I see those streets wracked with riots and violence, I actually remember being on those streets. And so it's incredibly jarring, and it's an extraordinary situation because of Hong Kong's status as this semiautonomous region that's being reintegrated back into China.\\n\\nOur best path forward with China is to try and have them continue to show restraint, but also see that the costs to human rights abuse is not just in Hong Kong, but with their ethnic minorities and the Muslim population of Uighurs, that the costs are higher than their perceived benefits of maintaining social order and stability. In order to have those costs feel real to the Chinese, we can't just moralize and say, Hey, do the right thing. Because at this point they're looking at us and saying like, Keep your opinions and value statements to yourselves.\\n\\nWe have to be working toward China's second main priority, which is maintaining robust economic growth. So there are two goals. There are two primary goals that are sometimes in tension, of maintaining social order and maintaining robust economic growth. And the best way we can try and contain their behavior in Hong Kong is to say, Look, the economic costs are going to be very, very high. And the best way we can do that is to build global consensus around certain norms and behaviors.\\n\\nAt the last debate, I proposed a world data organization, because to me, China's in position to leapfrog us in artificial intelligence. They're investing tens of billions in a way that our government is not. It's a national effort. And they've now separated their technology ecosystem from the West's and they're trying to sell their software and operating systems to other countries with very limited success right now, but this parallel tech universe, to me, is something that we can actually use to bring China back to the table.\\n\\nThat's why something like world data organization is so vital. When they had to join the W.T.O. [World Trade Organization], they realized this was going to be vital to their economic growth, so they're going to have to make some decisions and compromises in order to join the world order. We can create an analogous situation for data and technology and then use that to try and curb some of their worst abuses and behaviors. Now, is this going to happen in time to help Hong Kong? I certainly hope so. I mean, I certainly hope that they don't flood the streets of Hong Kong with troops any time in the next number of days or weeks.\\n\\nMr. Yang has been critical of China's increasingly authoritarian behavior and told the Council on Foreign Relations the United States must in reply demonstrate a model for democratic capitalism.\\n\\nKK: And do you think President Xi is a dictator?\\n\\nI think he meets just about every conventional definition of dictator. Yes.\\n\\nCharlie Warzel: You were talking about data and that's a good segue into some of the — I mean, you're probably the candidate who sort of runs on understanding the internet better than anyone right now. And I'm curious first about this worldwide data organization. For someone like China, wouldn't it actually be better for them to sort of hoard that data and hoard that information and keep that closed system?\\n\\nMr. Yang has proposed what he describes as a W.T.O. for data and has argued that data ownership should be made a property right. Some argue that such an organization could enable more partnership among countries in setting standards for artificial intelligence and data.\\n\\nSo this is the carrot and the stick. So imagine if you had data standards that were endorsed by the U.S., the E.U., and Japan, and it had certain technology protocols associated with it. Then China said, Hey, I don't want to adhere to that. Because like you said, they like to hoard data, and one of the reasons why they're in position to leapfrog us is they have more data than we do and they have essentially nonexistent privacy rights or regulations. They have complete surveillance. That's one reason why they've banned masks in Hong Kong, so that their surveillance technology can pick up who the protesters are. So China has its own vast hoard of data.\\n\\nThere has been a continuing controversy over Hong Kong's law banning masks to target anti-government protesters. One court ruling found it unconstitutional, but a later ruling temporarily reinstated it.\\n\\nBut for them the challenge is not even what's happening internally. The challenge is whether or not they can get developing countries on board with their technology standards to be able to roll them out internationally. So if you're a third party, let's say you're a developing country in Africa or Latin America, then you have a choice essentially between the global standard and the Chinese standard. And if you're the Chinese, you do not want a standard that only you are using over time, because that's going to curb your economic upside to all of the software that you're building. One of the reasons why our tech companies are so successful is that they export it to virtually the entire rest of the world, and China does not want to be in the opposite position.\\n\\nCW: I'm curious, then, focusing on the U.S., a couple of months ago the general counsel for the N.S.A. wrote an Op-Ed for us and was worried about this big challenge of the government not being able to acquire the tech talent. That Silicon Valley is actually so much more attractive, so much more interesting there. And that when you're looking at 5G technology, quantum computing, technology, A.I., not having engineers in that space and sort of outsourcing that to the private sector is potentially incredibly dangerous. Like how do you actually make people want to come and bring that engineering talent to the federal government, rather than ——\\n\\nKK: Especially given your proposal for Department of the Attention Economy.\\n\\nWell, the Department of the Attention Economy would likely be based in Silicon Valley, and it'd be run by a guy named Tristan Harris, who's a design ethicist. He started Time Well Spent. So I don't think it's necessarily the case that you need to try and bring everyone into the cubicles in D.C. to get the rules ——\\n\\nMr. Yang has been the most vocal of all candidates about privacy issues. Tristan Harris, whom he has alluded to in discussing the Department of the Attention Economy, spent three years as a Google design ethicist. He left to found the Center for Humane Technology, a nonprofit that seeks to address the digital attention crisis.\\n\\nKK: I meant more make people want to work for government? And I think that's your question, right?\\n\\nCW: Yeah. Rather than, you know, a big exit or something like that. Sexy start-up.\\n\\nSo the clearest emblem of this is NASA and space travel where we all watched the Apollo 13 movies and we've seen the armies of research scientists helping launch these missions. Now where those research scientists? They're all at Space X and Blue Origin and they're there working for the tech guys who are putting billions into it. It's going to be very, very difficult to somehow reverse essentially decades of talent migration into the private sector. And if you're a talented kid out of Stanford, why would you work for the federal government? It's like if you're working in the private sector, you feel like you're going to go faster, you're certainly going to get paid more. You're going to be working with smarter people and you idolize Elon Musk, like who the heck, you know?\\n\\nKK: Yeah, that's literally our question.\\n\\nAY: Yeah. And I will say on a personal level, I spent seven years recruiting some of our top educational products to Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis. So I have seen that essentially the tide has turned in the direction it's gone and we should not be relying upon the government as the primary employer of a lot of this tech talent. We have to face facts and say, at this point, most of the intellectual capital is being attracted to these private firms and we need to instead try and support and work with the private firms.\\n\\nThrough Venture for America, Mr. Yang created opportunities for college graduates in under-resourced American cities — but almost half of V.F.A. alumni left the cities they were placed in through the fellowship.\\n\\nCW: Well, what about when it comes to like the N.S.A. and the technology they have and the surveillance? You don't want Google doing surveillance of people here and abroad?\\n\\nBS: Any more than they already are.\\n\\nCW: More than they already are. Right.\\n\\nMore than they already are.\\n\\nCW: But doing it in a national security sense. Or do you?\\n\\nI mean, the question is what trade-offs you're willing to make, really. The N.S.A. is going to be able to recruit the tech talent that he can recruit and you want to try and ramp that up. So one thing ——\\n\\nCW: They're worried about it.\\n\\nThey should be, I mean clearly. Because if you spend time on these campuses, you know where they're going. So one thing you can do that's very, very fast and immediate is you can become much more flexible in terms of compensation and a type of work environment.\\n\\nSo if you had, for example, a rule that said, Look, the government is allowed to match whatever salary a private sector employee is being offered, then you'd have more success. If you said, Look, you don't need to move to Washington, D.C., and sit in the thing that was built decades ago, that's like solace, and you have this giant parking lot and you just feel miserable being there for like a day, let alone a career.\\n\\nMr. Yang has said most Americans don't want to work for the federal government and argued that his Freedom Dividend would therefore be more effective than a program like a federal jobs guarantee.\\n\\nIt seems like a nice place to work. Then you might have greater success. We also saw this happen even with the rollout of healthcare.gov. Remember this? It's like they had the consultant and then they totally botched it and then they needed to bring in the ——\\n\\nBS: Remember The New Yorker cartoon?\\n\\nHm?\\n\\nBS: The New Yorker cartoon. They had a secretary with like a floppy disk. With her glasses pulled down and her fingers crossed.\\n\\nSee The New Yorker satirizing the Affordable Care Act rollout here.\\n\\nAnd it's not just the leading edge N.S.A.-type stuff. If you look around congressional offices or the I.R.S., they're all using technology from the '90s or whatever it is. I had a whiz kid who said he got yelled at for writing a script in a congressional office that automated a task. They were like, No, we just wanted you to do it manually forever. So there needs to be a massive modernization effort. Not just in terms of how we recruit tech talent at the highest levels, but how we function even in the basics.\\n\\nCW: Sort of pivoting off of that, you said that Senator Warren's taking sort of a 20th-century antitrust framework to big tech. What does a 21st-century framework look like in that?\\n\\nThe 21st-century framework. First, you don't use price as your primary determinant of whether or not there are antitrust problems, because the tech companies would say, What? We would never gouge anyone. It's free. We're underselling everyone. So that you have to get rid of, and that's not something she's advocating, but what she is advocating, which I find to be a bit backward looking, is thinking that competition is the answer in these spaces. And competition misses the point in one way and another way.\\n\\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation, like Mr. Yang, has argued that the country's approach to antitrust regulation is outmoded. In early 2019, the Federal Trade Commission created a new task force focused on monitoring competition in technology markets, which the foundation celebrated as a step toward modernizing antitrust.\\n\\nLet me explain. I'm a parent. I've got — how many of you all are parents? So if your kids are like my kids, they are mesmerized by any screen that is nearby. I regularly challenge my kids. I say, What's more important? People or screens? And they know the right answer's people. And then if they say screens, then I hold them upside down by their ankles until they say, People, people. And the people that are most diligent about screen time are the tech folks in Silicon Valley. You go there, and all of a sudden there's not a screen to be had because they know that we have the smartest engineers in the country turning supercomputers into dopamine delivery devices for kids, because that's how they make their millions of dollars.\\n\\nSo if that's your problem and you break Facebook into Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, does that somehow make the kids stronger or healthier? No. If anything, it actually ratchets up the incentives to try and further their engagement.\\n\\nSo if that's your problem, you have to go and try and solve it directly by getting into the guts of the apps and say, What are the design choices you made? Let's calibrate them so they actually balance our kids' health and not just your financial returns. So that's one way she's missing the point.\\n\\nThe other way is that many of these competitive markets end up very quickly accelerating toward one or two winners and saying, I'm going to break you up. Does not solve that problem. I joke that it would be cruel and unusual punishment to say you have to use the fourth-best navigation app. Like what is that? Apple Maps. We all hate Apple Maps, right? If you use that thing, you're like, Oh. You curse the gods until you figure out how to get Google Maps going. So going up and saying, Look, you're the winner in the space. We're going to break you up, it doesn't revive Main Street businesses, and it doesn't actually end up solving the competition problem.\\n\\nIf you want to solve the hyperacquisition problem, which is a problem, then you have to go in and say, Look, you have to not acquire businesses that are in your space with these criteria. That would be a legitimate stance to take, because right now the business model in Silicon Valley is not to try and outcompete the behemoth. It's just to get bought by them. If you get to a point where they'll offer you $1 billion and you win, your investors win, you're rich and then these get folded in, and it doesn't even matter what they do with your business at that point.\\n\\nOver the past five years, 90 percent of A.I. start-ups in Silicon Valley were acquired by major companies, according to TechCrunch.\\n\\nBA: You've expressed profound distrust of market forces. You just compared the major tech companies to drug dealers, and you want the N.S.A. to outsource national security work to them?\\n\\nI do not want the N.S.A. to outsource national security work to them. I want them to try and fight fire with fire and actually recruit using some of the same methods, and I want the N.S.A. to try and work with them to the extent that they're realistic, and they know that Google is going to be innovating in ways that the N.S.A. will not be able to do.\\n\\nCW: Going back though, my question is, there's an issue of power here. I mean, sure. You might not want to. You might not be able to address the problems of Facebook if you break it up from Instagram, and I understand that, and there's still going to be addictive products, but there's an issue of the consolidation of actual power, the ability to buy those companies, to make those acquisitions. Just simply the leverage that Mark Zuckerberg can use to have a meeting with Donald Trump that they won't tell us about, I mean, how do you — if you don't break them up, how do you get rid of that conglomeration of power?\\n\\nNF: I mean, is there still a role for 20th-century antitrust?\\n\\nYes. All of this is a prelude to say that, should some of the tech companies be asked to divest parts of their businesses? One hundred percent yes. Like Amazon should not be selling its own house brand to its advantage to other goods. These companies do have excessive power and influence. At this point you could argue they control our democracy.\\n\\nSo, and I know The New York Times, I mean you've had your issues with Facebook and the rest of it, and they made a change and then all sorts of things happen.\\n\\nListening to the tape, we have no idea what this means.\\n\\nSo, right now, the government is like this flopping appendage behind a lot of this stuff. I mean, honestly. The Office of Technology Assessment was eliminated in 1995. So our legislature is literally 24 years behind the curve on technology, and they don't understand. They're totally outgunned. They don't know what's going on.\\n\\nSo you definitely need to bring the tech companies to heel and say, Look, here are the list of problems we're concerned about. But the solution to the abuse of power is not to say like, Hey, we're just going to try and keep anyone in the country from having the ability to do wrong. What you have to do is you have to figure out what the abuses you're concerned about are, and then actually address them directly.\\n\\nCW: Who else besides you that you're running against understands the internet?\\n\\nI haven't hung out with enough of them to know, but I'm confident I understand the internet better than the [cross talk]——\\n\\nCW: What's your gut feeling?

{"original": "BEIJING — The number of babies born in China last year fell to a nearly six-decade low, exacerbating a looming demographic crisis that is set to reshape the world's most populous nation and threaten its economic vitality.\\n\\nAbout 14.6 million babies were born in China in 2019, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. That was a nearly 4 percent fall from the previous year, and the lowest official number of births in China since 1961, the last year of a widespread famine in which millions of people starved to death. That year, only 11.8 million babies were born.\\n\\nBirths in China have now fallen for three years in a row. They had risen slightly in 2016, a year after the government ended its one-child policy and allowed couples to have two children, a shift that officials hoped would drive a sustained increase in the number of newborns. But that has not materialized.\\n\\nExperts say the slowdown is rooted in several trends, including the rise of women in the work force who are educated and don't see marriage as necessary to achieving financial security, at least for themselves. For Chinese couples, many cannot afford to have children as living costs increase and their jobs demand more time and energy. And attitudes have shifted."}

In that sense I'm following my physical shift through time.

But then in my last semester, one day I walked into the lunchroom and several people I knew but didn't like were all sitting together at the same table. It was an overwhelming experience to see them there. I couldn't control myself. I went up to painting class and I did a painting that really went beyond painting the model. It was a group of people that had sharp tongues and looked weird; it was not what you were supposed to paint in art school. That was the start of figuring out that I could paint what I wanted to paint, rather than what I was told to paint.\\n\\nIs there ever cruelty in your work now?\\n\\nNo. That was just that one instance. I love all the people in my paintings. I would take care of them, no matter what they look like or what they are doing. They might be misguided, they might be a little naughty, but they're nice. Because I'm nice.\\n\\nEven the earliest paintings in this exhibition depict interactions between men and women. Was that a preoccupation of yours in the mid-60s?\\n\\nNo. I was happily married, and everybody in my paintings had to have a significant other. In the early work, there would be a lot of times when I would be counting how many men and how many women were in the pictures, so that everybody would have a mate."}

I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms. When it's over, I don't want to wonder if I have made of my life something particular, and real. I don't want to find myself sighing and frightened, or full of argument.

She said she'd taken it as her personal mantra. This was years before mindfulness became a thing, but my fellow traveler with cancer quoted another of Ms. Oliver's lessons for living: To pay attention, this is our endless and proper work.\\n\\nThat, too, was new to me, as I started to use not only my eyes, but my ears and even my nose, to pay attention: to see, to hear and to smell the world around me.\\n\\nIn the many years since then, Mary Oliver's gentle insistence that we do not end up simply having visited this world became my touchstone. When scared, I did my best to stand up to the fear (I don't want to find myself sighing and frightened…)."}

But it also means holding the line on church teachings that young activists disagree with.\\n\\nThere are also differences in approach. Pastors often want to work within the system to effect change, while many activists try to disturb and upend the system.\\n\\nBishop Blake is not someone to be found on protest lines or shouting down law enforcement; he tends to advocate through more formal channels. He departs from some activist ministers in his social conservatism, opposing same-sex marriage and abortion. Yet he tries to strike a welcoming posture in an era of activists who can feel like the church is judging them.\\n\\nHe hosted a rally at his church to protest the killing of Trayvon Martin. Last year, he wrote a letter to the mayor of St. Louis suggesting that if police practices were not reformed, his denomination could take its annual convention — and the millions of dollars that come with it — elsewhere.

{"original": "He sang anthems of social lament and timeless wisdom, typically in Shona, Zimbabwe's predominant language, but also in English and Ndebele. His music pulled from traditional Shona rhythms and sounds while incorporating influences from South Africa's more cosmopolitan, jazz-inflected mbaqanga tradition, as well as African-American dance music. What resulted — a kind of soundtrack to Zimbabwean life in the late 20th century — became known as its own idiom, called Tuku music, after Mr. Mtukudzi's nickname.\\n\\nI looked for a sound the guitar couldn't make, in a guitar' he told the South African publication TshisaLIVE in an interview shortly before his death, remembering his early years. Professional guitarists at the time used to laugh at me. I used to look for a mbira on the guitar strings, he said, referring to a traditional Shona thumb piano.\\n\\nIn the 1970s, as a member of the band Wagon Wheels, he played alongside the singer Thomas Mapfumo, who would become the only other Zimbabwean musician with a reputation to rival his. Mr. Mapfumo left the country in the 1990s and became well known in the West. Mr. Mtukudzi stayed, and cemented his status as the country's most renowned musician.\\n\\nHis popularity in Zimbabwe reflects the fact that in a country bitterly divided by political allegiances, he positioned himself as a unifier. While Mr. Mapfumo took a strong political stance in his music — pioneering a genre known as chimurenga (revolutionary struggle music in Shona) before the fall of white minority rule, then vigorously criticizing Robert Mugabe, who ruled the country from 1980 to 2017 — Mr. Mtukudzi generally avoided taking a political side. He sang at events for the ruling ZANU-PF party, as well as the wedding and funeral of the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai.\\n\\nBut his songs boldly told the stories of his communities, and he made no effort to avoid social issues. Perhaps his biggest hit was Todii, a cautionary song about the perils of H.I.V. from the 1997 album Tuku Music. Powered by a melancholy chorus of background singers and the gravelly lament of Mr. Mtukudzi's lead vocal, it warned listeners of the virus that by then had infected a quarter of Zimbabwe's population."}
{"original": "NASHVILLE — Brothers Osborne broke an unspoken rule at a recent songwriters round — a show where groups of writers take turns singing their songs in their most unadorned forms, spotlighting the lyrics and melody. But when the duo performed its hit Stay a Little Longer, the singer T.J. Osborne reached the end of the final chorus and tilted his head toward his older brother John, who promptly went into a rhapsodic acoustic guitar solo.\\n\\nBesides showcasing some of the best-known entries in their catalogs, the participants in this songwriters round, a charity event called The First and the Worst, were asked to share some of their greenest, most embarrassing output for the audience's amusement. So the Osbornes offered Don't Bring the Redneck Out in Me, a song that reeled off rowdy, boastful good ol' boy stereotypes. Midway through a line about having three children and a wife, T.J., 33 and lanky with a long face and combed-back hair, paused to wryly point out that at 16, this was what he'd thought country songs were supposed to be like.\\n\\nThe day before, at a taco shop the brothers frequent up to twice a day when they're not on the road, John, 35 and sporting a bushy, red beard with a ball cap over his shaggy mane, joked that Don't Bring the Redneck Out in Me was the first official song we wrote that we thought, yeah, we've got it all figured out.\\n\\nBack then, the Osbornes naïvely assumed that copying country's familiar templates might get them somewhere. Later, they concluded it was far more important, and satisfying, to commit to a musical identity they could inhabit convincingly. The one they chose — a groove-driven, occasionally jammy singing-and-shredding duo — has made for a rather exotic presence in contemporary country over the last half-decade. Guitar heroes have receded from the spotlight, and even in Nashville, once nicknamed Guitar Town, studio production is frequently powered by drum machines, programming and synthesizers these days."}
{"original": "In the bottom ranks of educational achievement, they continued, trends in inequality are\\n\\nconsistent with the decline in the odds of marriage between high school dropouts and those with more education since the 1970s, a period over which the real wages of men in this education group declined.\\n\\nChristopher Federico, a professor of political science and psychology at the University of Minnesota, described the key roles of education and employment opportunity in the right-wing mobilization of less-educated white men:\\n\\nA major development since the end of the Great Compression of the 30 years or so after World War II, when there was less inequality and relatively greater job security, at least for white male workers, is that the differential rate of return on education and training is now much higher.\\n\\nIn this new world, Federico argues, promises of broad-based economic security were replaced by a job market where\\n\\nyou can have dignity, but it must be earned through market or entrepreneurial success (as the Reagan/Thatcher center-right would have it) or the meritocratic attainment of professional status (as the center-left would have it). But obviously, these are not avenues available to all, simply because society has only so many positions for captains of industry and educated professionals.\\n\\nThe result, Federico notes, is that group consciousness is likely to emerge on the basis of education and training and when those with less education see themselves as being culturally very different from an educated stratum of the population that is more socially liberal and cosmopolitan, then the sense of group conflict is deepened.\\n\\nNone of these forces diminishes the key role of racial animosity and racism. Instead, they intensify racial resentment.\\n\\nJennifer Richeson, a professor of psychology at Yale, wrote by email that there is\\n\\nvery consistent and compelling evidence to suggest the some of what we have witnessed this past week is a reflection of the angst, anger, and refusal to accept an America' in which White (Christian) Americans are losing dominance, be it political, material, and/or cultural. And, I use the term dominance here, because it is not simply a loss of status. It is a loss of power. A more racially, ethnically, religiously diverse US that is also a democracy requires White Americans to acquiesce to the interests and concerns of racial/ethnic and religious minorities.\\n\\nTrump, Richeson continued,\\n\\nleaned into the underlying White nationalist sentiments that had been on the fringe in his campaign for the presidency and made his campaign about re-centering Whiteness as what it actually means to be American and, by implication, delegitimizing claims for greater racial equity, be it in policing or any other important domain of American life.\\n\\nMichael Kraus, a professor at the Yale School of Management, argued in an email that\\n\\nRacism is the key construct here in understanding why this sort of violence is possible. The other explanations would be the pathways through which racism creates these conditions. An individual experiences their standing in society as relative and comparative, so sometimes the gains of other groups feel like losses to Whites. Whites in the last 60 years have seen minoritized folks gain more political power, economic and educational opportunity. Even though these gains are grossly exaggerated, Whites experience them as a loss in group status.\\n\\nEmily G. Jacobs, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of California-Santa Barbara, argued that all the rights revolutions — civil rights, women's rights, gay rights — have been key to the emergence of the contemporary right wing:\\n\\nAs the voices of women, people of color, and other traditionally marginalized communities grow louder the frame of reference from which we tell the story of American is expanding. The white male story is not irrelevant but it's insufficient, and when you have a group of people that are accustomed to the spotlight see the camera lens pan away, it's a threat to their sense of self. It's not surprising that QAnon support started to soar in the weeks after B.L.M. QAnon offers a way for white evangelicals to place blame on (fictional) bad people instead of a broken system. It's an organization that validates the source of Q-Anoners insecurity — irrelevance — and in its place offers a steady source of self-righteousness and acceptance.\\n\\nJane Yunhee Junn, a professor of political science at the University of Southern California, was outspoken in her view:\\n\\nPeople of color in political office, women controlling their fertility, L.G.B.T.Q. people getting married, using their bathrooms, and having children go against the state of nature defined by white heteropatriarchy. This is a domain in which men and white men in particular stand at the apex of power, holding their rightful position over women, nonwhites, perhaps non-Christians (in the U.S.), and of course, in their view, sexual deviants such as gay people.\\n\\nHerbert P. Kitschelt, a professor of political science at Duke, wrote in an email that compared to other advanced countries caught up in the transition to knowledge society, the United States appears to be in a much more vulnerable position to a strong right-wing populist challenge.\\n\\nKitschelt's listing of some of the reasons for American vulnerability to right-wing forces illuminates current events.\\n\\nFirst, Kitschelt noted,\\n\\nThe difference between economic winners and losers, captured by income inequality, poverty, and illiteracy rates within the dominant white ethnicity, is much greater than in most other Western countries, and there is no dense welfare state safety net to buffer the fall of people into unemployment and poverty.\\n\\nAnother key factor, Kitschelt pointed out, is that\\n\\nThe decline of male status in the family is more sharply articulated than in Europe, hastened in the U.S. by economic inequality (men fall further under changing economic circumstances) and religiosity (leading to pockets of greater male resistance to the redefinition of gender roles).\\n\\nUnlike most European countries, Kitschelt wrote,\\n\\nThe United States had a civil war over slavery in the 19th century and a continuous history of structural racism and white oligarchical rule until the 1960s, and in many aspects until the present. Europe lacks this legacy.\\n\\nOn top of that, in the United States.\\n\\nMany lines of conflict mutually reinforce each other rather than crosscut: Less educated whites tend to be more Evangelical and more racist, and they live in geographical spaces with less economic momentum.\\n\\nComing days will determine how far this goes, but for the moment the nation faces, for all intents and purposes, the makings of a civil insurgency. What makes this insurgency unusual in American history is that it is based on Trump's false claim that he, not Joe Biden, won the presidency, that the election was stolen by malefactors in both parties, and that majorities in both branches of Congress no longer represent the true will of the people.\\n\\nAt the same time, hostility to Trump on the left can make it easy to overlook the shortcomings, such as they are, of the center-left political coalition in this country — and I think it is important that liberals, among whom I count myself, keep this in mind.\\n\\nBernard Grofman, a political scientist at the University of California, Irvine, put it this way in an email:\\n\\nWe would not have Trump as president if the Democrats had remained the party of the working class. The decline of labor unions proceeded at the same rate when Democrats were president as when Republicans were president; the same is, I believe, true of loss of manufacturing jobs as plants moved overseas.\\n\\nPresident Obama, Grofman wrote,\\n\\nresponded to the housing crisis with bailouts of the lenders and interlinked financial institutions, not of the folks losing their homes. And the stagnation of wages and income for the middle and bottom of the income distribution continued under Obama. And the various Covid aid packages, while they include payments to the unemployed, are also helping big businesses more than the small businesses that have been and will be permanently going out of business due to the lockdowns (and they include various forms of pork.\\n\\nThe result, according to Grofman, was that white less well-educated voters didn't desert the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party deserted them.\\n\\nAt the same time, though, and here I will quote Grofman at length:\\n\\nMore religious and less well-educated whites see Donald Trump as one of their own despite his being so obviously a child of privilege. He defends America as a Christian nation. He defends English as our national language. He is unashamed in stating that the loyalty of any government should be to its own citizens — both in terms of how we should deal with noncitizens here and how our foreign policy should be based on the doctrine of America First. He speaks in a language that ordinary people can understand. He makes fun of the elites who look down on his supporters as a basket of deplorables and who think it is a good idea to defund the police who protect them and to prioritize snail darters over jobs. He appoints judges and justices who are true conservatives. He believes more in gun rights than in gay rights. He rejects political correctness and the language-police and woke ideology as un-American. And he promises to reclaim the jobs that previous presidents (of both parties) allowed to be shipped abroad. In sum, he offers a relatively coherent set of beliefs and policies that are attractive to many voters and which he has been better at seeing implemented than any previous Republican president. What Trump supporters who rioted in D.C. share are the beliefs that Trump is their hero, regardless of his flaws, and that defeating Democrats is a holy war to be waged by any means necessary.\\n\\nIn the end, Grofman said,"}

At 9 months old, the baby wasn't hitting his developmental milestones and his pediatrician wanted to rule out vision problems. In Albuquerque, the ophthalmologist found cherry red spots on the backs of the baby's retinas, and immediately diagnosed him with Tay-Sachs disease, a very rare, but inevitably fatal, genetic disorder. And the world tilted on its axis.\\n\\nIn her well-received 2013 book, The Still Point of the Turning World, written while Ronan was still alive, Black (who at the time used the name Emily Rapp) found beauty in stolen moments. She was able to derive lessons to learn and wisdom to share from the terrible freedom of parenting a child without a future and turned to writing as a way to find underlying patterns of meaning in a situation that, from the outside, looked inviolate and incontrovertibly meaningless — an endeavor that would ultimately give her a way to connect with and help others.\\n\\nHer current memoir comes from a much darker place. It begins in the summer of 2012. Ronan is dying, and Black is actively considering a jump from the Rio Grande Gorge bridge. Her marriage has imploded — exploded, really — after the corrosive effects of too many days and nights of anger, guilt, resentment, exhaustion and, above all, a never-ending, all-consuming grief. Black's coping mechanism has been desperate self-numbing — compulsive extramarital sex, extreme exercise, any sort of tangible, identifiable, physical pain. Her husband has fled into rage. Their self-immolation and ultimate split amount to a rupture that a crater of any size in any ground and beneath any sky failed to accurately depict, and in the aftermath, she has been left feeling mentally fractured, she writes. My mind was shifting and molting as my life broke slowly apart, like some strange and painful rebirth, but with no imaginable future — for what mother can imagine a future without her child?\\n\\n[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of January. See the full list. ]\\n\\nBlack resists the pull of the river 565 feet below. And that choice — equal parts survival instinct and desire to live — marks a turning point in her trajectory. Ronan's life can go only in one tragic direction — he died on Feb. 15, 2013, just before his third birthday — but Black's refusal to die means that she can open up a little bit of space in which she can find a way to live in the world, as she puts it. And that space, in which life and death, love and loss, rage and happiness, pleasure and pain can tolerably intermingle, is the mourner's sanctuary."}

{"original": "Over the top? Maybe. But the new, alarming truth is that I didn't care. At all.\\n\\nI suppose this was inevitable in the age of Donald Trump. Before his election, I had a wariness about racism that was abstract and low key; it noted things, like being the only black person in an E.R., but it was chiefly interested in gathering information, reflecting, analyzing. Now, that racial awareness has become visceral and overstimulated. When something racially questionable happens, I tend to leap immediately to anger. This happens even when I know distinctly I shouldn't leap. But it doesn't matter.\\n\\nAnd why should it matter? In this Trump age of gross unreason, meeting incivility with civility has felt small to me, and futile. More and more, it feels as if the only way to be heard and understood is to give back exactly what I'm getting, not just from bilious Mr. Trump but from his base, otherwise known as my fellow Americans. That fact alone — that we are all Americans — has become infuriating. Watching those outrageous Trump rallies especially puts me on edge, seeing those red faces taunting Mexicans, Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi, in eager unison. The anger that was drawn to the surface in 2016 and stayed there quickly boils over. I feel like a fool for believing in racial harmony, for being taught at an early age that it is fundamental to the American project. I feel — again — that Malcolm X was right, black people are wasting their time trying to win over white people when they so clearly have no interest in being won over.\\n\\nThe fact that our fates are intertwined — something even Malcolm eventually realized — makes me not hopeful, as it once did, but angrier. I feel stuck in a terrible, lopsided marriage. The least I should be able to do in this dysfunctional relationship is to vent my anger, not on paper or newsprint, but in the real world, in real time. That's what a big chunk of Republican America is doing, with zero regrets. I have become envious of that. I want true equality, 2020 style — the right to claim and fully express my own well-earned piece of the American id.\\n\\nAnd yet, I know this is indulgent. Aggression for aggression's sake goes against the practice of generations of black struggle that have made justice bigger than everybody's anger, black and white. Going off on a white person because she deserves it or because you can is not something Malcolm X, or Martin Luther King Jr., would have approved of — not because it's unwarranted but because it's undisciplined. It's a waste of resources. And then there's the fact that public displays of anger are still risky for black folk. They might land you in jail, or at the very least on the wrong side of authority, potentially heaping injustice on top of waste.\\n\\nOn the way out, I told the receptionist I was sorry if I had been rude. I've had a bad morning, I said. It was true: I've had bad mornings for three years."}

{"original": "In my 10 years in Iran researching the Revolutionary Guards and their depiction in Iranian media, one of my key observations was that wherever they operate, in Iran or on foreign battlefields, they function with that same ad hoc leadership: Decisions and actions don't just come from one man or even a small group of men; many within the organization have experience building relationships, creating strategies and making decisions.\\n\\nThis contrasts with General Suleimani's public image, both at home and abroad, which, since 2013, has been propped up by a vast media campaign. I followed some of his media team during my research and saw how they produced films, documentaries and even music videos, in both Persian and Arabic, lionizing his feats against the Islamic State. Inside Iran, he consistently polled as one of the most popular figures in the regime. The fact that most of his activities took place outside Iran helped preserve his reputation in the often fractious politics of the Islamic Republic.\\n\\nIt is likewise hard to overstate the symbolic power of General Suleimani in the region, particularly among Arab Shiite groups in Iraq and Lebanon. He was the face of Iranian power from Lebanon to Yemen, a face that brought money, weapons and advisers. Yet he wasn't the only person in the Revolutionary Guards who built such personal relationships, as the Western news media tends to depict. Far from it.\\n\\nThanks to the guards' ad hoc structure, the relationship between the Revolutionary Guards and Iraqi and Lebanese Shiite armed groups is a long and deep one. During my time in Lebanon and Iran, I met foreign militants who spent long stretches in Iran, for both work and pleasure. They spoke fluent Persian and fully understood the Revolutionary Guards ethos. The ties that bind many of these groups together include generations of marriage, commerce, history and culture. General Suleimani, as important as he was, was not singular.\\n\\nIran and its populations have thousands of years of history in the region. That doesn't get rooted out with assassinations and missile strikes. These relationships — among Revolutionary Guards cadres and between the guards and their allies abroad — are deep, and they do not rely on one figure. In fact, Iran has already named General Suleimani's longtime deputy, Ismail Qaani, as his successor."}

She portrayed a dead woman who is tossed around by her partner in choreographed movements that suggested she was inert.\\n\\nShe found her signature role in Ballet Theater's revivals of Eugene Loring's Billy the Kid, from 1938. A brilliantly stylized experimental work that used occasional speech, the ballet had a biographical plotline by Lincoln Kirstein (who would become a founder of New York City Ballet), and a double role for Ms. Koesun, who portrayed both the sweetheart and the mother of the outlaw Billy."}

{"original": "Mr. Brown and Mr. Gomes both create stage worlds that contain same-sex partnering as well as conventionally heterosexual duets; both allow for those same-sex relationships to be interpreted in sexual terms. Although Mr. Brown is much the least experienced dance-maker of this program's three, he's the one with the strongest sense of structural suspense. One group of four (one woman, three men) is juxtaposed with another of six (three male-female couples); and what he does with each group keeps you wondering what will happen next. A sustained duet for two men looks natural: a study of intimate cooperation.\\n\\nHis worst flaw here, one from which Mr. Gomes's work also suffers, is cuteness. Dancers flirt with the audience and jokily vie for attention in ways that shatter the stage reality they've been building together. The music is Rossini's unusually scored but appealing Duet for Cello and Double Bass in D major. If Mr. Brown can pare away his immaturities, he may yet become a choreographer.\\n\\nMr. Gomes uses Dvorak's American String Quartet (No. 12 in F major, Op. 96) to tell a tale of social relations in small-town America. One man wants to leave (with suitcase) despite his powerful affection for the woman we may assume is his wife. Two pairs of male-female lovers spend time together, with one couple reaching the marriage ceremony as the ballet ends (veil, bouquet, trousseau, confetti); but one of these two men is keener on the other man than on his own girlfriend, and so sulks when his devotion is rejected.\\n\\nThat's quite a soap opera to pile onto poor Dvorak's wonderful and large-spirited quartet. Mr. Gomes is not short of ideas; but almost none of them feel organic. There are forcefully folksy handclaps where the music doesn't call for them; later, when the music develops a folk atmosphere, Mr. Gomes ignores it. Though I believe that there are many such small-town stories to tell, I don't believe the way Mr. Gomes tells this one. He keeps nudging us to notice the same points about the same relationships. The long pas de deux between the husband and wife creates its own clichés.\\n\\nLarger than each work is the engaging impression created by Ms. Kent's dancers. They carry the evening. They aren't, however enriched or extended by it."}

Suzanne Agee said she believed that her father had a lot of remorse over not keeping in close contact with his first family but that he couldn't do so without breaking ties with Mary.\\n\\nIn response, Ms. Cunningham Agee said she had urged her husband to reconnect to his first family, but couldn't persuade him. Every Christmas, I begged him to do it, she said.\\n\\nIn October, less than two months before he died, a frail Mr. Agee, who suffered from scleroderma, a degenerative disease of the immune system, reconnected with his first family. Legal documents show that he gave Suzanne Agee power of attorney (along with his 32-year-old daughter with Ms. Cunningham Agee, Mary Alana Kurz), filed for divorce and rewrote his will to divide his assets among Ms. Cunningham Agee and his five children. (Previously, the will had left everything to Ms. Cunningham Agee.)\\n\\nMs. Cunningham Agee attributes his erratic behavior to dementia. She said doctors had diagnosed Alzheimer's in 2014. His health deteriorated, and in mid-October she put him in an assisted living facility. She said that her husband was very conflicted and paranoid and that he had used the divorce filing — which would've divided up the couple's assets and allowed Mr. Agee to alter his estate planning — as a good tool to get out of assisted living. (The divorce was never finalized, which means the proceeding would be legally nullified.)\\n\\nBut Suzanne Agee and others close to Mr. Agee disputed the Alzheimer's diagnosis and said he was mentally competent. In an Oct. 29 email exchange, Bruce A. Miroglio, a lawyer and friend to the couple, wrote that Ms. Cunningham Agee had retained counsel, to help her get Bill declared incompetent. He wrote, Bill is still competent. Mr. Agee was never declared mentally incompetent by the courts.\\n\\nMs. Cunningham Agee said that until those final weeks, her marriage had been blissful, but people close to the family said the couple had been living in separate wings of their St. Helena home, comparing the arrangement to the 1989 movie War of the Roses. Ms. Cunningham Agee confirmed that they lived on different floors, but said it was because Mr. Agee, whose illness had taken its toll, walked with a cane and couldn't climb stairs."}

He said voters in Iowa, the critical early primary state, will actually appreciate a candidate who recognizes and acknowledges previous shortcomings. But he said Democratic candidates need to be acutely sensitive to those who in the past have been left behind. Not intending to offend is not an excuse,'' he said.\\n\\nWhat is less clear is whether what works in a primary will be harmful in the general election and whether the cascade of apologies risks making Democrats look like the hypersensitive, politically correct crowd Republicans make them out to be — especially when compared with President Trump, who often insults and offends people and almost never apologizes for anything.\\n\\nThe zero tolerance on issues of race also played out in the almost immediate demands by nearly all the Democratic presidential candidates that Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia resign over a racist yearbook photo. (Mr. Northam began with an apology but pivoted to a new defense when he triggered a crush of calls for him to resign.)\\n\\nPolitical strategists and crisis communication experts said the sensitivity speaks to how quickly the center of gravity has shifted for Democrats on key issues. As recently as 2006, national Democrats including former President Barack Obama expressed wariness about immigrants' ability to assimilate into American culture and did not openly embrace gay marriage — two talking points that would probably be deeply damaging for any 2020 candidate.\\n\\nFor candidates seeking to lead the party into its post-Obama era, their hope is that the base is more concerned with defeating President Trump and Republicans than holding every candidate to rigid standards of ideological purity."}

{"original": "Depending on who you ask, Chelsea's Maritime Hotel could be seen as proof of the architect Albert C. Ledner's inspired vision — or a monolithic monument to 1960s kitsch. Originally designed as a hiring hall for the National Maritime Union, the 11-story, porthole-adorned tower has since served as a shelter for runaways and as housing for the New York Service Center for Chinese Study Fellows, before opening as a fashionable hotel in 2003.\\n\\nNow, the building's storied history also includes La Sirena, chef Mario Batali's first New York restaurant in a decade. Since it's in a hotel, and because we have this magnificent location, it will function as the piazza at the center of a small town, says Batali, who hopes the restaurant and bar becomes a bustling hive of activity. You can have breakfast here, lunch here, late-night snack here. It's kind of a cross between Lupa and Babbo — and yet available in a much wider and more recognizable way, he says, citing two of his high-end Manhattan establishments. Food-style wise, it's kind of like a trattoria.\\n\\nAsked whether the hotel's nautical flourishes have inspired the menu, Batali says he preferred to keep the two sensibilities separate. We wanted to honor the marine tradition, and 'La Sirena' is a little doff of the hat to that, but the food is more like what I want to do now, within the confines of classic Italian food. Still, Batali, a fan of Homer's Odyssey, felt a name with aquatic flair was only appropriate. My tie to the marine culture is something a little more macabre, he says. I love the idea that the sirens would sing the songs and the passing ships could not avoid them, like all the traffic on Ninth Avenue.\\n\\nLa Sirena's décor plays off the '60s architecture with a retro flair. This could be a Fellini set, right? Look at that floor, look at that lighting, look at the Caesarstone walls, says Batali, surveying the restaurant from the corner of its expansive bar. (Batali has admitted that La Sirena's opulence had a high price: Originally set to open months ago, the restaurant ballooned millions over budget.) This is a different beast for us, he says. Serving all the way through the day is something that is going to give us more fun to play around with. Eventually we'll have a high tea in the afternoon. The world has changed a lot, and we're embracing it. Batali is also considering limiting meals to the tables, except for a cart that carries salami, Cravero Parmigiano Reggiano and marinated olives. I like the idea of a stand-alone bar, because if I'm at a hotel, I don't want to be aced out by 34 seats of people eating their dinner. I want to go have drinks."}
{"original": "Phil Spector died Saturday as an inmate in California, convicted of the 2003 murder of Lana Clarkson. By then, other facts had emerged about his volatile, erratic, gun-toting behavior, notably in Ronnie Spector's 1990 memoir, Be My Baby, which detailed his abuses during their seven-year marriage. Some listeners may well decide that all of his music is poisoned. But it is also inextricable from pop history.\\n\\nIt was decades earlier, in the early 1960s, when Spector made the hits that he famously described as little symphonies for the kids, packing brash innovation into three-minute melodramas, treating adolescent romance as a universe of rapture and tragedy.\\n\\nHe brought dozens of musicians and singers into the studio to perform together, doubling parts for heft and impact and pushing mixes to the brink of distortion, to create his Wall of Sound. He gathered songwriters who could convincingly capture female longing and desire for his girl groups to deliver. And he found singers — many of them ambitious Black teenagers — who would supercharge those songs with gospel spirit.\\n\\nAfter his prodigious hit-making streak in the early 1960s, Spector found admirers eager to work with him during the 1970s: the Beatles (collectively and individually), the Ramones, even Leonard Cohen. Then Spector withdrew from music almost completely for the next decades. But through the years, countless others — among them the Beach Boys, Bruce Springsteen, the Walker Brothers, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Abba, Meat Loaf and Bleachers — would emulate the thundering beat, chiming chords and lavish percussion of his Wall of Sound. I still smile whenever I hear the music we made together, and always will, Ronnie Spector told Billboard in an interview after Spector's death. The music will be forever."}

Harlots doesn't shy away from doubt, sorrow and the straightforward presentation of appalling exploitation, but it doesn't linger on them — it always moves right along to the next scene of intrigue and competition between brothels, or the next bit of comic business involving the desperate buffoonery of the male customers. All against a backdrop of jolly sex and nudity, mostly by extras.\\n\\nThe show's creators — the accomplished and ambitious playwright and screenwriter Moira Buffini and the actress Alison Newman — set an unflagging pace in the two episodes available for review, with dialogue that's sufficiently crisp and performances that are entertaining enough to keep you interested, even if the story feels a little hollow at the core."}

{"original": "Diana Athill spent most of her life as an editor, working with titans of literary history. They were mostly male — most anointed titans are — and the challenge of this job was immense enough to warrant a thick memoir, Stet: An Editor's Life. Remarkably, Athill didn't use the pages to complain, an instinct that would have been easy to understand, but instead to sing the praises of the written word and the people who make it their mission to tell stories. What she less overtly advertised, though, was her fiercely independent life. Athill died last week at the age of 101, and her words, at several critical points in this reader's life, provided a lifeline. Perhaps her greatest legacy was her refusal to cede to societal expectations as she carved out a persistently unusual world for herself in which the demands of femininity — marriage and children, specifically — were rethought and redefined.\\n\\nI was introduced to Athill through her memoir Somewhere Towards the End. Published when she was 91, it was a meditation on the mixed bag that is aging. While Athill was quick to point out the injustices of growing older, chief among them giving up sex (Athill loved sex in her very British way, decreeing that every woman should have a few good love affairs), her tone was almost defiantly peppy — never saccharine, but refusing to give in to the weighty fear with which we tend to face the great unknown. I had my first existential crisis (that's putting it generously) at age 13, and sat with the pain for years afterward. My primary literary bedfellows in the ensuing years were death obsessives like Philip Roth and Robert Lowell, or poets who were far too successful in its pursuit (Sylvia Plath, who was less enthusiastic about her life in the London literary scene than Athill, her counterpart who was born more than a decade before her and survived her by more than 50 years). I figured if I couldn't solve the mystery around mortality then I could at least wallow with some of the greats. I was on year 15 of this strategy when I found myself in possession of Athill's slim book in consideration of the topic. The simplicity of her prose belies a complexity of thought that would have been necessary to edit V. S. Naipaul (or survive a dinner with Jean Rhys); though Athill may not have been afraid of death, she didn't think it was simple, either. She just didn't dwell on its complexities. I swallowed her words like barbiturates and they killed the fear. I think that underneath, or alongside, a reader's conscious response to a text, Athill writes, whatever is needy in him is taking in whatever the text offers to assuage that need. Guilty as charged.\\n\\nIn the same book Athill reflects on how her relationship to sex had gone through several stages and had not always been a happy one, but that had always seemed central to my existence. Sex, she explains, obliterates the individuality of young women more often than it does that of young men, because so much more of a woman than a man is used by sex. And her individuality appears to be the quality Athill valued most as she made decisions that were unorthodox, and geared to maximize joy and minimize obligation. She wasn't the workaholic we expect passionately single women to be (in the movies, it seems everyone who's unmarried by choice wears a blazer and wields a Blackberry), proclaiming in Stet, I was not ashamed of valuing my private life more highly than my work; that, to my mind, is what everyone ought to do.\\n\\nBut here she must have been underplaying her ambition, so spectacular was the second act that followed (achieved at fourth-act age). Athill was under no illusion that she would be celebrated for her work as an editor: We must always remember that we are only midwives — if we want praise for progeny we must give birth to our own. And so she did, writing novels, essays and nonfiction with the kind of 9-to-5 work ethic she'd once shown in the office of the publisher André Deutsch. She quickly found her subject: romance in its many forms. In Stet, it was a romance with words. In Yesterday Morning, with memories of childhood. In After a Funeral, it was a love lost to depression, her partner ending his life violently in Athill's home, an act she treated with her signature lack of fanfare. She used A Florence Diary to describe every inch of the Italian city as happily as a tween with a thesaurus. She made peace with love's dark demise in Instead of a Letter, in which she admits frankly that an early broken engagement has left her with a fear of lasting intimacy. She had love affair after love affair, including a brief but soul-expanding dalliance with the Black Panther Hakim Jamal (a man who'd also had a high-profile relationship with the actress Jean Seberg before the murder of his next girlfriend by his fellow Panthers, and who later was murdered himself). Athill lived with the Jamaican playwright Barry Reckord for nearly 40 years, though she was his lover for fewer than 10."}

{"original": "When a Black man appears in a Virginia courtroom this month to stand trial on charges of eluding the police, assaulting an officer and other crimes, he will face a scene that defendants in that room have not experienced in decades: The portraits of white judges will no longer line the walls.\\n\\nA judge late last month ordered the removal of the portraits ahead of Terrance Shipp Jr.'s Jan. 4 trial, ruling that the presence of the artwork, depicting judges who served in Fairfax County, could have suggested that the legal system is biased. The judge, David Bernhard of the Fairfax Circuit Court, wrote in his Dec. 20 opinion that the court was concerned the portraits might serve as unintended but implicit symbols that suggest the courtroom may be a place historically administered by whites for whites, and that others are thus of lesser standing. The display of portraits of judges in courtrooms of the Fairfax Courthouse is based on a non-racial principle, yet yields a racial result, he said.\\n\\nThe order was in response to a motion filed by Bryan Kennedy, a lawyer for Mr. Shipp. The idea, Mr. Kennedy said, came from both his client and a murder case in Louisa, Va., where a judge in September ordered a life-size portrait of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee removed from a circuit courtroom at the defendant's request.\\n\\nThe decision underscores a year in which Virginia and the rest of the United States grappled with both implicit biases and overt images of white supremacy, leading to Confederate monuments and other symbols of racism being removed from public spaces."}

Koch Theater on Wednesday, presented by the Joyce Theater Foundation; it comes to dancing life through the lens of 20th-century Italian politics. On Thursday, a mixed bill, featuring works by Yuri Possokhov, Myles Thatcher and Christopher Wheeldon — an all-too typical array of male ballet choreographers — didn't wash away the sense that this is a company in need of an identity.\\n\\nThe Joffrey, formed in 1956 by Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino, is now under the artistic direction of Ashley Wheater.

And though the academy, which is due to release its nominations next week, has taken great pains to diversify itself since the years of #OscarsSoWhite, this past week suggests that other awards bodies still have a lot of soul-searching to do, and that this issue may require a total shift in what's considered weighty and worthy.\\n\\nJust look at BAFTA, the British awards group that issued a list of nominations on Tuesday that failed to include even a single actor of color. The British-Nigerian actress Cynthia Erivo picked up a Screen Actors Guild nomination for Harriet, but BAFTA snubbed her; ditto Lupita Nyong'o, so tremendous in Us, as well as Awkwafina, who had just won a Golden Globe for her performance in The Farewell."}

Click here to R.S.V.P. to a virtual conversation, led by Claire Messud, about The Custom of the Country, to be held on Jan. 28.\\n\\nThe Custom of the Country (1913), by Edith Wharton, is about many things: the terrifying ambition of its protagonist, Undine Spragg; marriage; divorce; New York and Paris society — but also the arrival of new American money into those fashionable circles, the ranks of which have always been carefully guarded. Undine, who is originally from the fictional Midwestern town of Apex City, and who marries into the old-world Marvell family, is the perfect embodiment of such aspirational consumerism. And Wharton, who was born into a prominent New York family and was the beneficiary of not one but three legacy inheritances over the course of her life, was in a unique position to observe this monied world and conjure a version of it on the page. (The exact amount Wharton received was and still is a point of contention, on account of antiquated wills that put her trusts in the hands of her brothers, but still, the sum was substantial. A legacy left by her father of $20,000 in the early 1880s amounts to half a million dollars today; $120,000 from a cousin would now be $3.4 million, and a $90,000 gift from her mother is equivalent to an additional $2.7 million upon whose interest and annuities she could draw.) In her novel, Wharton describes in meticulous detail myriad gowns and pieces of jewelry, various properties, priceless artworks and much more. Below: an incomplete account of the material trappings of Undine's costly lifestyle, in which several experts estimate, to the best of their abilities, how much various items may have cost. Though there are a number of clues in The Custom of the Country as to the precise years in which the novel takes place, we settled on 1908 as our point of comparison, which was the year Edith Wharton began writing the novel in earnest."}

For almost 40 years the two artists have collaborated on life casts, making them from the South Bronx to Taiwan and from Brazil to Puerto Rico. Creatively, they are like John Lennon and Paul McCartney, sharing credit on life-size sculptures of famous and obscure people. Temperamentally, Mr. Torres can be reticent to the point of being more like George Harrison, the quiet Beatle.\\n\\nTheir partnership has endured through distance, even as both pursued solo projects. About 15 years ago Mr. Torres left New York for Orlando, Fla., while Mr. Ahearn continued working in his South Bronx studio. With Mr. Ahearn the one with connections to the city's art world, people sometimes forget about Mr. Torres's equal contributions to their oeuvre. But if anything, Mr. Ahearn was relieved and excited when Mr. Torres returned to his studio recently to prepare several pieces for a show in Chelsea in the fall.\\n\\nJohn has his own anxieties going on, Mr. Torres, 54, said with a laugh. I'm the more relaxed one. I'm the one who fixes everything after they're broken. I'm not so anxious about things.\\n\\nThey met in summer 1979 at Fashion Moda, a fabled gallery near 149th Street and Third Avenue in the Bronx that attracted downtown artists like Tom Otterness, Jane Dickson and Mr. Ahearn, as well as local graffiti artists and break dancers. Mr. Ahearn had been making casts of people by the gallery's big storefront windows when a cousin of Mr. Torres's stopped by to check out the scene. Mr. Torres soon went to see for himself."}

Officials said the number will be required to pay taxes, open bank accounts and get a drivers' license, in addition to accessing health and schooling services.\\n\\nCivil rights groups, however, said the program risked disenfranchising millions of people who already face systemic challenges getting the documents required to obtain biometric ID cards.

I felt more solidarity from strangers than I did from some of my own blood relatives.\\n\\nA few months after my release, my uncle was severely injured in a suspected terrorist attack in Sinai, where he was stationed. My mother implored me to offer sympathy. I refused to call. I almost felt a sense of justice.\\n\\nTwo years later, Uncle Anas was still unable to walk. It had been nearly a year since he had surgery for a spinal fracture he sustained as a result of the attack and his muscles had not recovered. Medical exams revealed a fatal diagnosis: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or A.L.S., a degenerative illness.\\n\\nI still could not bring myself to call my uncle, but as I watched my mother grieve, I began to rethink. I came to realize that in my self-righteous pursuit of justice, I had committed injustice against myself and my loved ones. My resentment blinded me to what was truly important: my empathy and humanity. I had dehumanized one of my most beloved, just as he had dehumanized me. I was angry at him for abandoning me while I was in prison, yet when he became a prisoner of his own body, I was ready to abandon him.\\n\\nLast summer, I made peace with my uncle. It was the most difficult experience I have had since I left prison. I called him on the first day of Eid, and I could hear the slightly panicked excitement in his voice as we exchanged greetings. He spoke faster than usual, as if trying to make up for lost time. The weight of the resentment I carried vanished as soon as the conversation turned to kids, marriage, health and the famous feast that my aunt makes every Eid. As I ended our five years of silence, I felt the same sensation of freedom I had experienced when I was released. Soon after, my mom told me that the call had done wonders for his morale and that he had accompanied her on a visit to my father, who remains in prison.\\n\\nMy father served in the Morsi government; I was imprisoned for my activism; my uncle was a police officer under successive regimes; many other family members were army generals or politicians under the government of the former president, Hosni Mubarak. Is my family unique? In many ways, not at all. Most Egyptian families are similarly split across the country's political divides.\\n\\nWith rampant state violence and the absence of any semblance of justice, Egyptian society is beyond polarized — it is broken. The targeting and dehumanization has extended beyond Islamists. Now anyone who dares to challenge the status quo is demonized. Families remain strained, political differences seem existential, dinner tables still have empty seats. Many weddings, birthdays and funerals are missed because of imprisonment, exile or exclusion. The hate, anger and vengeance have somehow overrun human decency."}

She rose before dawn to churn out pages while her children slept, then car-pooled to Manhattan to work at the Gordon R.

She sets her sights on a group of female pals, neighbors on a comfortable cul-de-sac who weathered the last lethal storm together.\\n\\nIn Leigh Silverman's lopsided world-premiere production, the friends make a cracking ensemble, each fully human and with her own comic charge: the aggressively chipper Sandy (Mia Barron); timid Beth (Kate Wetherhead), with her failed marriage and disheveled lawn; tough-talking Pam (Danielle Skraastad), as fierce as the stilettos she wears to coffee (costumes are by Kaye Voyce); and Renee (Nikiya Mathis), an editor at a gardening magazine. She thrills to Diane's radical landscaping plans — and the possibility of a fling with her.\\n\\nDiane is problematic, though. Ms. George (The (Curious Case of the) Watson Intelligence) describes her in a stage direction as a butch charm factory, and charisma is as vital to the success of Diane's mission as it is to the success of the play. She needs to get the women in her thrall and seduce the audience as well.\\n\\nYet Becca Blackwell's tentative performance as Diane has no magnetism. Subdued to the point of flatness, it drains the life out of Ms. George's humor — a particular shame for the beautifully written monologues. Instead of an enigmatic god, the Diane before us is closer to a nonentity, and the sexual energy among her and the women, vital to moments of attraction and abandon, is nowhere to be found. It's not credible that this outsider would succeed at not only insinuating herself into the group but also commanding it.\\n\\nThe other odd thing about this staging, whose set (by Rachel Hauck) is a suburban kitchen, is how little sense it conveys of the natural world beyond. Ms. Silverman doesn't ask enough of the lighting (by Jen Schriever), but leans hard on the excellent sound design (by Bray Poor), which is particularly vivid when a new storm comes."}

{"original": "CHAPTER ONE\\n\\nThe Vanishing American Jew\\n\\nIn Search of Jewish Identity for the Next Century\\n\\n\\n\\nBy ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ\\n\\n\\n\\nLittle, Brown and Company\\n\\nRead the Review\\n\\nIntroduction The Jewish Question for the Twenty-first\\n\\nCentury: Can We Survive Our Success?\\n\\nAmerican Jewish life is in danger of disappearing, just as most American Jews have achieved everything we ever wanted: acceptance, influence, affluence, equality. As the result of skyrocketing rates of intermarriage and assimilation, as well as the lowest birth rate of any religious or ethnic community in the United States, the era of enormous Jewish influence on American life may soon be coming to an end. Although Jews make up just over 2 percent of the population of the United States--approximately 5.5 million out of 262 million--many Americans mistakenly believe that we constitute a full 20 percent of the American people, because of our disproportionate visibility, influence, and accomplishments. But our numbers may soon be reduced to the point where our impact on American life will necessarily become marginalized. One Harvard study predicts that if current demographic trends continue, the American Jewish community is likely to number less than 1 million and conceivably as few as 10,000 by the time the United States celebrates its tricentennial in 2076. Other projections suggest that early in the next century, American Jewish life as we know it will be a shadow of its current, vibrant self--consisting primarily of isolated pockets of ultra-Orthodox Hasidim.\\n\\nJews have faced dangers in the past, but this time we may be unprepared to confront the newest threat to our survival as a people, because its principal cause is our own success as individuals. Our long history of victimization has prepared us to defend against those who would destroy us out of hatred; indeed, our history has forged a Jewish identity far too dependent on persecution and victimization by our enemies. But today's most serious threats come not from those who would persecute us, but from those who would, without any malice, kill us with kindness--by assimilating us, marrying us, and merging with us out of respect, admiration, and even love. The continuity of the most influential Jewish community in history is at imminent risk, unless we do something dramatic now to confront the quickly changing dangers.\\n\\nThis book is a call to action for all who refuse to accept our demographic demise as inevitable. It is a demand for a new Jewish state of mind capable of challenging the conventional wisdom that Judaism is more adaptive to persecution and discrimination than it is to an open, free, and welcoming society--that Jews paradoxically need enemies in order to survive, that anti-Semitism is what has kept Judaism alive. This age-old perspective on Jewish survival is illustrated by two tragic stories involving respected rabbinical leaders.\\n\\nThe first story takes place in 1812, when Napoleon was battling the czar for control of the Pale of Settlement (the western part of czarist Russia), where millions of Jews were forced to live in crowded poverty and under persecution and discrimination as second-class subjects. A victory for Napoleon held the promise of prosperity, first-class citizenship, freedom of movement, and an end to discrimination and persecution. A victory for the czar would keep the Jews impoverished and miserable. The great Hasidic rabbi Shneur Zalman--the founder of the Lubavitch dynasty--stood up in his synagogue on the first day of Rosh Hashanah to offer a prayer to God asking help for the leader whose victory would be good for the Jews. Everyone expected him to pray for Napoleon. But he prayed for the czar to defeat Napoleon. In explaining his counterintuitive choice, he said: Should Bonaparte win, the wealth of the Jews will be increased and their [civic] position will be raised. At the same time their hearts will be estranged from our Heavenly Father. Should however our Czar Alexander win, the Jewish hearts will draw nearer to our Heavenly Father, though the poverty of Israel may become greater and his position lower.\\n\\nThis remarkable story is all too typical of how so many Jewish leaders throughout our history have reasoned about Jewish survival. Without tsuris--troubles--we will cease to be Jewish. We need to be persecuted, impoverished, discriminated against, hated, and victimized in order for us to retain our Jewishness. The chosen people must be denied choices if Judaism is to survive. If Jews are given freedom, opportunity, and choice, they will choose to assimilate and disappear.\\n\\nThe story recurs, with even more tragic consequences, on the eve of the Holocaust. Another great Eastern European rabbi, Elchanan Wasserman--the dean of the Rabbinical College in Baranowitz, Poland--was invited to bring his entire student body and faculty to Yeshiva College in New York or to the Beis Medrish Letorah in Chicago, both distinguished Orthodox rabbinical colleges. He declined the invitations because they are both places of spiritual danger, for they are run in a spirit of freethinking. The great rabbi reasoned, What would one gain to escape physical danger in order to then confront spiritual danger? Rabbi Wasserman, his family, his students, and their teachers remained in Poland, where they were murdered by the Nazis.\\n\\nI call the approach taken by these rabbis the Tsuris Theory of Jewish Survival. Under this theory, the Jews need external troubles to stay Jewish. Nor has this fearful, negative perspective on Jewish survival been limited to ultra-Orthodox rabbis. Many Jewish leaders, both religious and secular, have argued that Jews need enemies--that without anti-Semitism, Judaism cannot survive. Theodor Herzl, the founder of political Zionism and a secular Jew, believed that our enemies have made us one ... It is only pressure that forces us back to the parent stem. In a prediction that reflects an approach to the survival of Judaism strikingly similar to that of the founder of the Lubavitch Hasidim, Herzl warned that if our Christian hosts were to leave us in peace ... for two generations, the Jewish people would merge entirely into surrounding races. Albert Einstein agreed: It may be thanks to anti-Semitism that we are able to preserve our existence as a race; that at any rate is my belief. Jean-Paul Sartre, a non-Jew, went even further, arguing that the sole tie that binds [the Jewish people together] is the hostility and disdain of the societies which surround them. He believed that it is the anti-Semite who makes the Jew.\\n\\nIf the Tsuris Theory of Jewish identity, survival, and unity is true, then Jews are doomed to live precariously on a pendulum perennially swinging in a wide arc between the extremes of persecution and assimilation. As the pendulum swings away from the Scylla of persecution, it inevitably moves toward the Charybdis of assimilation. In this reactive view, Jews have little power over their ultimate destiny. Our enemies always call the shots, either by persecuting us, in which case we fight back and remain Jewish, or by leaving us alone, in which case we assimilate. The only other alternative--the one proposed by Herzl--is for all Jews to move to Israel, where they control their own destiny. But most Jews will continue to ignore that option, certainly if our hosts continue to leave us in peace in our adopted homelands. In this respect, aliyah (emigration) to Israel has also been largely determined by our external enemies, since most Jews who have moved to the Jewish homeland have done so in reaction to anti-Semitism and persecution in their native countries.\\n\\nHistorically, therefore, there has been some descriptive truth to this pendulum view of persecution alternating with assimilation. Jews have retained their Jewish identity, at least in part, because of tsuris. Our enemies herded us into ghettos, created pales of settlement, discriminated against us, excluded us from certain livelihoods while pressing us into others. We stuck together and remained Jews, resisting as best we could the persecution by our enemies.\\n\\nBut there is more--much more--to Jewish identity than collective self-defense. There is something important that is worth defending. After all, until anti-Semitism changed from religious bigotry to racial bigotry--roughly near the end of the nineteenth century--persecuted Jews generally had the option of conversion. Unlike Hitler, our religiously inspired persecutors--the Crusaders, the Inquisitors, Martin Luther, and the pogromists--did distinguish between Jews who converted to Christianity and Jews who did not. Indeed, it was precisely their religious mission to convert the Jews, by whatever methods it took.\\n\\nMany Jews did convert--some at knifepoint, others to advance themselves. The story about Professor Daniel Chwolson illustrates the latter phenomenon. Chwolson, a Russian intellectual of the nineteenth century, had converted from Judaism to Russian Orthodoxy as a young man, but he continued to fight against anti-Semitism. This led a Jewish friend to ask him why he had converted: Out of conviction, the great man said. What conviction? his Jewish friend inquired. Chwolson responded: Out of a firm conviction that it would be far better to be a professor in St. Petersburg than a Hebrew school teacher in Shklop. Yet despite the material advantages of conversion, most Jews resisted it. Clearly, those Jews--who sacrificed so much--remained Jewish not only in reaction to their enemies. More than our fabled stiff-neckedness was involved. There are substantive principles that Jews have been so stubborn about--that we have been willing to fight and even die for. For Jews who define their Jewishness in theological terms, it is easy to find that principle: It is God's will. For the large number of Jews who are skeptical about being God's chosen people, the principle is more elusive, but it is palpable to most of us, though difficult to articulate. It is a disturbing reality, however, that for a great many Jews, their Jewish identity has been forged and nurtured by our external enemies who have defined us as victims of their persecution.\\n\\nNow, after two millennia of persecution and victimization, we may well be moving into a new era of Jewish life during which we will not be persecuted or victimized. If this comes to pass, we will need to refocus our attention on defining the positive qualities of Jewish life that ought to make us want to remain Jews without help from our enemies. We must become positively Jewish instead of merely reacting to our enemies.\\n\\nIf Herzl's and Sartre's entirely negative view of the reason for Jewish survival were to persist even as we enter this new era of equality and acceptance, then Judaism would not deserve to endure. If Jewish life cannot thrive in an open environment of opportunity, choice, freethinking, affluence, success, and first-class status--if we really do need tsuris, czars, pogroms, poverty, insularity, closed minds, and anti-Semitism to keep us Jewish--then Jewish life as we know it will not, and should not, survive the first half of the twenty-first century. We have been persecuted long enough. The time has come to welcome the end of our victimization without fear that it will mean the end of our existence as a people. We must no longer pray for the czar's victory out of fear that the end of our collective tsuris and the success of individual Jews will mean the failure of Judaism.\\n\\nI believe that Jewish life can thrive in the next century, not despite the end of institutional anti-Semitism, the end of Jewish persecution, and the end of Jewish victimization, but because of these positive developments. The ultimate good news may be that the denouement of negative Judaism--Jewish identification based largely on circling the wagons to fend off our enemies--compels us to refocus on a more positive and enduring Jewish identification, which will be more suitable to our current situation and the one we will likely be facing in the twenty-first century, when Jews will have the unconstrained choice whether to remain Jewish or to assimilate. We may be entering a true Jewish golden age, during which we will prove, once and for all, that Jews do not need enemies to survive. To the contrary: We can thrive best in an open society where we freely choose to be Jews because of the positive virtues of our 3,500-year-old civilization.\\n\\nI say we may be entering this golden age; there are no guarantees. Many Jews believe that the end is near, because increasing rates of assimilation and intermarriage are propelling us toward a demographic Armageddon. A recent apocalyptic article in a Jewish journal concluded that Kaddish time is fast approaching for the American Jewish community. (Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.) But reports of the death of Judaism may be premature--if we can change the way we think, and act, about Jewish survival. If we refuse to change, if we accept the current demographic trends as intractable, then Jewish life in America may indeed be doomed.\\n\\nThe challenge is to move the Jewish state of mind beyond its past obsession with victimization, pain, and problems and point it in a new, more positive direction, capable of thriving in an open society. For unless we do, we may become the generation that witnesses the beginning of the end of one of the most influential civilizations in the history of our planet--a unique source of so much goodness, compassion, morality, creativity, and intelligence over the past several millennia. The demise of Jewish life as we have come to know it would be a tragedy not only for the Jewish people collectively, but also for most of us individually--and for the world at large.\\n\\nThe thesis of this book is that the long epoch of Jewish persecution is finally coming to an end and that a new age of internal dangers to the Jewish people is on the horizon. Institutional anti-Semitism is on its last legs as governments, churches, universities, and businesses embrace Jews. No Jew today needs to convert in order to become a professor, a banker, or a corporate CEO. Although anti-Semitism persists in many quarters, today's overt anti-Semites--the skinheads, militias, Holocaust deniers, and Farrakhan followers--have become marginalized. They continue to constitute a nuisance and pose a potential threat, but they do not have a significant day-to-day impact on the lives of most Jews, as anti-Semites in previous generations did. Today's marginalized anti-Semites do not decide which jobs we can hold, which universities we can attend, which neighborhoods we can live in, which clubs we can join, or even whom we can date and marry. We no longer look up to anti-Semites as the elites in our society who determine our fate. We look down on anti-Semites as the dregs of our society who make lots of noise but little difference.\\n\\nAs Jews and Israel become more secure against external threats, the internal threats are beginning to grow, as graphically illustrated by the recent assassination of an Israeli prime minister by a Jew, the growing conflict between fundamentalist Jews and more acculturated Jews, the increasing trends toward intermarriage and assimilation, and the decline of Jewish literacy.\\n\\nFor thousands of years, Jews have been embattled. Surrounded by enemies seeking to convert us, remove us, even exterminate us, we have developed collective defense mechanisms highly adaptive to combating persecution by anti-Semites. But we have not developed effective means of defending the Jewish future against our own actions and inactions. This is our urgent new challenge--to defend the Jewish future against voluntary self-destruction--and we must face it squarely, if we are to prevent the fulfillment of Isaiah's dire prophecy Your destroyers will come from your own ranks.\\n\\nWe must take control of our own destiny by changing the nature of Jewish life in fundamental ways. The survival of the Jewish people is too important--to us and to the world at large--to be left in the hands of those ultra-Orthodox rabbis who would rather face Armageddon than change the religious status quo. Just as Jews of the past changed the nature of Jewish life in order to adapt to external necessities and to survive the ravages of their external enemies, so, too, must today's Jews change the nature of Jewish life to adapt to new internal necessities and to survive the demographic challenges of intermarriage, assimilation, low birthrates, and the breakdown of neighborhoods and communities.\\n\\nA hundred years ago, Theodor Herzl identified the Jewish question of the twentieth century as the literal survival of Jews in the face of external enemies committed to our physical annihilation--Jew-haters in every nation where Jews lived as a minority. His solution--the creation of a secular Jewish state--was to change the nature of Jewish life in dramatic and unanticipated ways. A hundred years later, the Jewish question of the twenty-first century is survival in the face of our internal challenges. Herzl also anticipated that this new Jewish question might arise if and when our Christian hosts were to leave us in peace. This is now coming to pass. The solution to this Jewish question also requires the creation of yet another Jewish state: a new Jewish state of mind!\\n\\nThis book continues where Chutzpah (1991) left off, in exploring the larger issue of being Jewish today. In the concluding paragraphs of that book I issued the following challenge:\\n\\nWe have learned--painfully and with difficulty--how to fight others. Can we develop Jewish techniques for defending against our own success?\\n\\nPogo once said: We have [met] the enemy and he is us! As Jews, we have not yet been given the luxury of seeing ourselves as the enemy. There are still too many external enemies who challenge the very physical survival of the Jewish people in Israel and throughout the world. But as we become stronger in the face of our external enemies, we must prepare to confront ourselves.\\n\\nIn confronting ourselves, we must face the reality that the generation of Jews I wrote about in Chutzpah--those of us who remember the Holocaust, the creation of Israel and the mortal threats to its survival, the movements to save Soviet, Syrian, and Ethiopian Jewry, the struggle against institutional anti-Semitism--is aging. Our children, who have no actual memory of embattled Judaism fighting for the life, liberty, and equality of endangered Jews, are now the crossroads generation that will determine what Jewish life in America and around the world will be in the coming century. It is to that younger generation of Jews, as well as to their parents, that I address this volume.\\n\\nThe last decade of the twentieth century has witnessed the end of state-sponsored and church-supported anti-Semitism. The fall of the Soviet Union, a nation that, since the time of Stalin, had been a major source of international anti-Semitism, had a domino effect on ending the state sponsorship of this oldest of bigotries. Other nations within the Soviet sphere of influence stopped espousing anti-Semitism as a matter of government policy. Even most Arab and Islamic countries dropped their overtly anti-Semitic policies. As a result, the United Nations has changed its tone, condemning anti-Semitism and reducing somewhat its pro-Arab and anti-Israel bias. Equally important, the Catholic church--the single institution most responsible for the persecution of Jews over the past two millennia--approved diplomatic relations with Israel, thus annulling its entrenched view that Jewish homelessness ... was the Divine judgment against Jews for rejecting Jesus. The American Lutheran Church explicitly rejected Martin Luther's anti-Semitic teachings.\\n\\nBill Clinton's presidency marked the end of discrimination against Jews in the upper echelons of government. For the first time in American history, the fact that an aspirant for high appointive office was a Jew became irrelevant in his or her selection. President Clinton--our first president who grew up in an age when anti-Semitism was unacceptable--selected several Jewish cabinet members, two Jewish Supreme Court justices, numerous Jewish ambassadors and other high-level executive and judicial officials. Nor, apparently, was Jewishness a bar to election to the United States Congress, which has ten Jewish senators and more than two dozen Jewish representatives, several from states with tiny Jewish populations. Though we have still not had a Jew at the top of either party's ticket, it is fair to say that in today's America, a Jew can aspire to any office, any job, and any social status.\\n\\nThe wealth of individual Jews grew perceptibly during this decade, with 25 percent of America's richest people being of Jewish background. (If only earned, as distinguished from inherited, wealth is counted, the percentage would be even higher.) An American Leadership study in 1971-72 found that Jews represented more than 10 percent of America's top movers and shakers in business, a higher percentage than any other ethnic group. Jews' per capita income is nearly double that of non-Jews. Twice the percentage of Jews as non-Jews earn more than $50,000 a year. And twice the percentage of non-Jews as Jews earn less than $20,000. Jewish charitable giving has increased along with Jewish wealth. Jews are now among the largest contributors to universities, museums, hospitals, symphonies, opera, and other charities. In 1991, the United Jewish Appeal raised more money than any other charity in America, including the Salvation Army, American Red Cross, Catholic Charities and the American Cancer Society. Yet only one-tenth of Jewish philanthropists limit their giving to Jewish charities alone, while one-fourth give only to non-Jewish causes.\\n\\nA Jew today can live in any neighborhood, even those that were formerly restricted. Jews live alongside white Anglo-Saxon Protestants in the most exclusive neighborhoods throughout the country--Grosse Pointe, Greenwich, Fifth Avenue, Beacon Hill. And they have been welcomed into the best families, including the Roosevelts, Kennedys, Cuomos, and Rockefellers. Economically, socially, and politically, we have become the new WASPs, as a perusal of the sponsor list of any major charitable or cultural event will show. Indeed, terms such as J.A.S.P. (Jewish Anglo-Saxon Protestant) and W.A.S.H. (White Anglo-Saxon Hebrew) have become current in some circles to denote the full social acceptance that Jews increasingly enjoy.\\n\\nOf America's Nobel Prize winners in science and economics, nearly 40 percent have been Jews. Of America's 200 most influential intellectuals, half are full Jews, and 76 percent have at least one Jewish parent. Jews attend Ivy League colleges at ten times their presence in the general population. It is no wonder that so many non-Jews believe that we constitute so much higher a percentage of the American population than we actually do. Jews today are equal in virtually every way that matters. What could not have been said even at the end of the 1980s can be said today: American Jews are part of the American mainstream; we are truly victims no more.\\n\\nYet despite these enormous gains, many older Jews do not seem to be able to give up their anachronistic status as victims. A recent book on the American Jewish community notes: [A]bout a third [of affiliated Jews in San Francisco said] that Jewish candidates could not be elected to Congress from San Francisco. Yet three out of four Congressional representatives ... were, in fact, well identified Jews at the time the poll was conducted. And they had been elected by a population that was about 95 percent non-Jewish.\\n\\nNor is this misperception limited to California. According to journalist J.J. Goldberg, [T]he percentage of Jews who tell pollsters that anti-Semitism is a `serious problem' in America nearly doubled during the course of the 1980s, from 45 percent in 1983 to almost 85 percent in 1990. Yet by every objective assessment, the problem was less serious in 1990 than it was in 1983, and the trend has clearly been in the direction of improvement.\\n\\nWhen I speak to older Jewish audiences, I am often accused, sometimes stridently, of minimizing anti-Semitism and am told that it is worse than ever. Social scientists call this dramatic disparity between the reality of declining anti-Semitism and the widespread belief that it is increasing a perception gap between what is actually happening and Jewish sensibilities. Some of the Jews who believe this are similar in this respect to some feminists and black activists I know, who insist that the plight of women and blacks is worse than it ever was. These good and decent people, whose identities are so tied up with their victimization, are incapable of accepting the good news that their situation is improving. It is not even a matter of perceiving the glass as half full or half empty. They see the glass as broken, even though it is intact and quickly filling up. As the sociologist Marshall Sklare puts it: American Jews respond more readily to bad news than to good news.\\n\\nI am reminded of the story of the two Jews reading their newspapers over a cup of coffee in a late-nineteenth-century Viennese cafe. Kurt is reading the liberal Yiddish-language newspaper and shaking his head from side to side, uttering soft moans of Oy vey and Vey is meir. Shmulie is reading the right-wing, anti-Semitic German-language tabloid and smiling. Kurt, noticing what Shmulie is reading, shouts at his friend, Why are you reading that garbage? Shmulie responds, When I used to take your newspaper, all I would ever read about was Dreyfus being falsely accused, the Jews of Russia being subjected to pogroms, anti-Semitic laws being enacted all over Europe, and the grinding poverty of the Jews in the Holy Land. Now, ever since I take this paper, I read about how the Jews control the banks, the press, the arts; how Jews hold all political power behind the scenes; and how we will soon take over the world. Wouldn't you rather read such good news than such bad news?\\n\\nWith some of today's older Jews, it is exactly the opposite: they refuse to read the good news, even when it is demonstrably true. They insist on focusing on the oys rather than the joys of Judaism, as Rabbi Moshe Waldoks put it. This is understandable, in light of the long history of persecution. Like an individual victim of a violent crime who sees his assailant around every corner, the Jewish people have been traumatized by our unrelenting victimization at the hands of Jew-haters. It is impossible for anyone who did not personally experience the Holocaust, or the other repeated assaults on Jewish life throughout our history, to comprehend what it must have been like to be victimized by unrelenting persecution based on primitive Jew-hating. We continue to see anti-Semitism even where it has ceased to exist, or we exaggerate it where it continues to exist in marginalized form. Indeed, some Jewish newspapers refuse to print, and some Jewish organizations refuse to acknowledge, the good news, lest they risk alienating their readerships or losing their membership. For example, in November of 1996 I saw a fundraising letter from a Jewish organization which claimed that anti-Semitism ... appears to be growing more robust, more strident, more vicious--and more `respectable.' Well-intentioned as this organization is, it seeks support by exaggerating the threats we currently face and by comparing them to those we faced during the Holocaust.\\n\\nMy students, my children, my friends' children--our next generation--understand our new status: they do not want to be regarded as victims. They do not feel persecuted, discriminated against, or powerless. They want to read the new good news, not the old bad news. A 1988 poll of Jewish students at Dartmouth College made the point compellingly: When asked whether they believed that their Jewishness would in any way hamper their future success, not a single student answered in the affirmative. That is the current reality, and it is different from the reality my parents faced--and even from the reality many of my generation perceived when we were in college or beginning our careers. The coming generation of Jewish adults will not remain Jews because of our enemies or because of our perceived status as victims. They crave a more positive, affirmative, contemporary, and relevant Jewish identity. Unless we move beyond victimization and toward a new Jewish state of mind, many of them will abandon Judaism as not relevant to their current concerns.\\n\\nIf we are to counteract this trend, we must understand the dynamics of contemporary assimilation and not confuse them with past episodes of assimilation, which were based largely on the perceived need to escape from the burdens of Jewish identification. Today, there are no burdens from which to escape. Being Jewish is easy, at least in relation to external burdens. Jews today assimilate not because Christianity or Islam is better or easier, but because Jewish life does not have a strong enough positive appeal to offset the inertial drift toward the common denominator. Jews do not convert to Christianity; they convert to mainstream Americanism, which is the American religion closest to Judaism. They see no reason not to follow their heart in marriage, their convenience in neighborhoods, their economic opportunities in jobs, their educational advantages in schools, their conscience in philosophy, and their preferences in lifestyle. Most Jews who assimilate do not feel that they are giving up anything by abandoning a Jewishness they know little about. They associate the Judaism they are abandoning with inconvenient rituals and rules that have no meaning to them. As one young woman remembers her Jewishness: An old man saying no.\\n\\nWe must recognize that many of the factors which have fueled current assimilation and intermarriage are positive developments for individual Jews: acceptance, wealth, opportunity. Most Jews do not want to impede these developments. Indeed, they want to encourage them. For that reason, we must accept the reality that many Jews will continue to marry non-Jews, but we should not regard it as inevitable that these marriages will necessarily lead to total assimilation. We can take positive steps to stem that tide--but it will take a change in attitude toward mixed marriages, and indeed toward the tribalism that has understandably characterized Jewish attitudes toward outsiders for so much of our history.\\n\\nWhy is this book different from other books about the Jewish future? Because its author does not have a religious or political agenda. This book is not a commercial for any particular brand of Judaism or Zionism. It does not begin with a priori assumptions about God, the survival of the Jewish people, the superiority of Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, or Reconstructionist Judaism, or the essential conservativism or liberalism of Judaism. I am neither a rabbi, a Jewish fund-raiser, a member of a Jewish studies faculty, an officer of any Jewish organization, nor an advocate for any particular Israeli party. Though I am essentially a secular Jew, I do belong to Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist congregations. Most of my family members are modern Orthodox, and a few are ultra-Orthodox. Some are completely secular. I have generally positive feelings about all Jewish denominations, as I do about the numerous Jewish political, educational, and philanthropic organizations to which I belong and contribute. I have no personal stake in any particular solution to the problem of Jewish survival. I just want American Jewish life to move from strength to strength. I love my Judaism and I feel passionately about its survival, but I do not believe in survival merely for survival's sake. Judaism should not be seen as a patient about to die a natural death, who is kept alive artificially on a respirator for as long as possible without regard to the quality of life. Our goal should be a self-sustaining Judaism that can thrive in the kind of open society in which most Jews want to spend their lives. I strongly believe that it is essential--both for Jews and for America--that the mainstream American Jewish community flourish. It would be a tragedy if the only forms of Judaism the made it past the twenty-first century were insular, ultra-Orthodox Judaism and Israeli Zionism. I hope that they, too, will continue to prosper, but I believe that a more diverse Jewish life has even more to contribute. If I have a bias, it is in favor of an eclectic, tolerant many-branched menorah that is inclusive of all who wish to safeguard and share the future of the Jewish people.\\n\\nI also bring to this book a unique perspective informed by my experiences growing out of the publication of Chutzpah five years ago. Since that time, I have spoken to well over 100,000 Jews in nearly every city with a significant Jewish population, not only in this country but throughout the world. The talk is usually preceded by a social hour and followed by a question period. I estimate that I have been asked more than a thousand questions by concerned Jews. I have received more than ten thousand letters and phone calls from Jewish men, women, and children. I have also been teaching young students, many of them Jewish, for a third of a century. I have served as faculty adviser to the Harvard Jewish Law Students Association, have been an active participant in Hillel, and have spoken to Jewish student groups at many colleges and universities around the world. Over these years, I have discussed virtually every Jewish issue--from God to intermarriage to Israel to anti-Semitism to Jewish feminism--with thousands of students. These questions, letters, calls, and discussions have given me an extraordinary window into the fears, hopes, and beliefs of a wide assortment of Jews. It has been quite an education. I think I understand what is on the minds and in the souls of many Jews, of all ages, and I try to address myself to these concerns in this book. I also have a unique window into the mind of the anti-Semite, since I continue to receive hundreds of anti-Semitic letters and calls each year, some quite lengthy and revealing.\\n\\nThough I care deeply about the survival of the Jewish people, I do not believe that survival is assured by any biblical imperative or divine promise. I approach the issue of Jewish survival as I would any other important empirical challenge: with an open mind ready and willing to accept any pragmatic solution, or combination of solutions, that will work. I am committed to doing whatever is in my power to help ensure the Jewish future. I know that many Jews feel the same way.\\n\\nI agree neither with those theologians who believe that Jewish survival is assured because God promised it nor with those demographers who believe that Jewish disappearance is inevitable because of forces beyond our control. I believe that our future as a people is largely in our own hands, and I want to help define and defend the new Jewish state of mind.\\n\\nIn the first chapter of this book, I focus on what is probably the most whispered-about subject among American Jews today: intermarriage and how to cope with this growing reality. I try to bring this controversial subject out of the closet in all its dimensions. I do not moan and groan and wring my hands. I do not present a religious agenda. I explore the issue from both a demographic and a personal perspective, in an effort to understand it and deal with it instructively and realistically. My analysis and conclusions will be controversial and will, I hope, stimulate a debate within the Jewish community and beyond. My goal is to ask all the hard questions, and to provide a wide variety of responses in addition to my own. I know that many readers will disagree with me, but I hope they will not be able to ignore the challenges I pose.\\n\\nIn chapters 2, 3, and 4, I develop my thesis that the nature of anti-Semitism is changing in fundamental and important ways: Mainstream anti-Semitism--as traditionally practiced by churches, states, corporations, universities, and other elite institutions--is coming to an end; today's Jew-haters are largely marginalized and powerless. This change means that although anti-Semitism persists and must continue to be monitored, it has far less daily impact on the lives of American Jews than in the past. Thus we must define our Jewish identity in different and more positive ways than we did the past.\\n\\nIn chapters 5, 6, and 7, I explore the most frequently proposed solutions to the problem of assimilation. To those who are sure that return to religion is Judaism's only salvation, I say, Get as many to return as you can. Maybe you are right. But we cannot rely exclusively on your solution, because maybe you are wrong. Maybe not enough Jews will become religious. Maybe religion--at least as currently defined and practiced--is not the wave of the future for most young intellectuals. Maybe there is a strand of Judaism that can survive and thrive without exclusive dependence on theology and ritual. After all, the Yiddish secularism that flourished between the beginning of the Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah) and the Second World War was an authentic Jewish culture, which was destroyed by external forces. Political Zionism, which grew largely out of that culture, remains an authentic Jewish civilization of enormous importance to the survival of Judaism. Today's influential American Jewish community is largely secular.\\n\\nTo those who look to Israel as Judaism's sole salvation, I say, Keep trying to get Jews from throughout the Diaspora to make aliyah. Maybe you are right. But we cannot count on Zionism and aliyah alone, because maybe you are wrong. Maybe most Jews will want to remain where they and their families have established a comfortable home. Maybe they will not come to Israel. Maybe Israel will not endure forever as a Jewish state. Maybe it will normalize--as Theodor Herzl put it--and become like most other states, which began as religious but became secular and multicultural over time.\\n\\nTo those who believe that an emphasis on Jewish ethics will be enough to transmit the essence of Judaism to our children, I say, Maybe you are right. Certainly many Jews, especially secular Jews, agree with you and hope you are right. But beyond broad generalities, it is difficult to distill from the highly diverse Jewish sources a few programmatic essences that are easily transmittable from generation to generation, without living the kind of Jewish lives that our grandparents lived.\\n\\nTo those who say that Jewish fund-raising, charity, and defense organizations are the answer, I say, Work on, raise money, build buildings, elect officers, bestow honors, monitor anti-Semitism, support Israel. But do not count on it to ensure the Jewish future, because maybe the next generation will not be as attracted to these institutions as the post-Holocaust generation was.\\n\\nTo those who say that Jewish education is the key to Jewish survival, I say, You are undoubtedly right. Whatever the essence or essences of Judaism may be, they are in large part, at least, to be discovered and rediscovered in our books, in our history, and in our approach to learning. But we cannot count on all Jews, so many of whom are busy with their successful careers, to become Jewishly educated, especially since Jewish education today is controlled almost entirely by the religious component of Jewish life and has been one of the great failures of the American Jewish community.\\n\\nIn the final chapter, I propose a series of steps that I believe we must take in order to safeguard the Jewish future. We must change the nature of American Jewish life in fundamental ways if we are to survive the new threats to our continuity as a people. These changes must make us more adaptive to the reality that we can no longer define ourselves--and our children--by reference to our past victimization and persecution. We must adopt a new, more positive, Jewish identity based on a 3,500-year-old tradition of education, scholarship, learning, creativity, justice, and compassion. But first we must figure out a way to make this diverse library of Jewish knowledge accessible and useful to generations of Jews who are abysmally ignorant of their remarkable tradition. The famed Yiddisher cup (khop)---Jewish head--is only half full: the typical Jewish college graduate is extraordinarily well educated about general subjects, but goes through life with a kindergarten understanding of Judaism. We must begin to fill the Yiddisher cup with the kind of useful Jewish knowledge that will assure both our success and our survival. To do this, we will have to loosen the monopolistic hold that rabbis now have over Jewish education, so that we can begin to compete effectively in the marketplace of ideas for the minds and hearts of our Jewish youth. Unless we begin to make use of our competitive advantage--as teachers, communicators, scholars, advocates, and strategists--we will lose our children and grandchildren to the seductive drift toward assimilation and away from Jewishness. The fundamental changes we must make will require a reordering of our priorities away from an almost exclusive focus on defending Jews against external enemies and toward new ways of defending ourselves and our children against self-destruction through assimilation. We will have to educate our children differently, allocate our charitable giving differently, select our leaders differently--even define our very Jewishness differently. Jewish life will have to become less tribal, more open, more accepting of outsiders, and less defensive.\\n\\nWhen I describe some of the multiple roads we must take if we are to maximize our chances for survival, I think of a variation of the old story of the rabbinical judge who, after hearing a wife's complaints about her husband, says, My daughter, you are right, and, after hearing the husband's complaints, says, My son, you are right. When his student observes, Rabbi, they can't both be right, he replies, My son, you are right. Under my variation, the rabbi responds to his student, No, you are wrong. They can both be right. To the differing and sometimes inconsistent approaches to Jewish survival, I would say, You may all be right. Don't you dare tell each other that you are wrong. Nobody has a monopoly on the truth about the Jewish future. Everything that may work must be tried.\\n\\nAt the end of the last century, Theodor Herzl called for a new Jewish state. As we approach the close of this cataclysmic century, I believe we need a new Jewish state of mind if we are to define and ensure the Jewish future, not only for our sake but for the sake of all humankind.\\n\\n(C) 1997 Alan M.

Wolitzer has been writing excellent fiction for 30 years, and it has always been this astute.

{"original": "July 18, 1959 OBITUARY Billie Holiday Dies Here at 44; Jazz Singer Had Wide Influence BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Billie Holiday, famed jazz singer, died yesterday in Metropolitan Hospital. Her age was 44. The immediate cause of death was given as congestion of the lungs complicated by heart failure. Miss Holiday had lived at 26 West Eighty-seventh Street. She had been under arrest in her hospital bed since June 12 for illegal possession of narcotics. Miss Holiday set a pattern during her most fruitful years that has proved more influential than that of almost any other jazz singer, except the two who inspired her, Louis Armstrong and the late Bessie Smith. Miss Holiday became a singer more from desperation than desire. She was named Eleanora Fagan after her birth in Baltimore. She was the daughter of a 13-year-old mother, Sadie Fagan, and a 15-year-old father who were married there years after she was born. The first and major influence on her singing came when as a child she ran errands for the girls in a near-by brothel in return for the privilege of listening to recordings by Mr. Armstrong and Miss Smith. Miss Holiday took her professional name from her father, Clarence Holiday, a guitarist who played with Fletcher Henderson's band in the Nineteen Twenties and from one of the favorite movie actresses of her childhood, Billie Dove. She came to New York with her mother in 1928. They eked out a precarious living for a while, partially from her mother's employment as a housemaid. But when the depression struck, her mother was unable to find work. Miss Holiday tried to make money scrubbing floors, and when this failed she started along Seventh Avenue in Harlem one night looking for any kind of work. At Jerry Preston's Log Cabin, a night club, she asked for work as a dancer. She danced the only step she knew for fifteen choruses and was turned down. The pianist, taking pity on her, asked if she could sing. She brashly assured him that she could. She sang Trav'lin' All Alone and then Body and Soul and got a job--$2 a night for six nights a week working from midnight until about 3 o'clock the next afternoon. Recommended to Goodman Miss Holiday had been singing in Harlem in this fashion for a year or two when she was heard by John Hammond, a jazz enthusiast, who recommended her to Benny Goodman, at that time a relatively unknown clarinet player who was the leader on occasional recording sessions. She made her first recording, Your Mother's Son-in-Law in November, 1933, singing one nervous chorus with a band that included in addition to Mr. Goodman, Jack Teagarden, Gene Krupa and Joe Sullivan. Two years later Miss Holiday started a series of recordings with groups led by Teddy Wilson, the pianist, which established her reputation in the jazz world. On many of these recordings the accompanying musicians were members of Count Basie's band, a group with which she felt a special affinity. She was particularly close to Mr. Basie's tenor saxophonist, the late Lester Young. It was Mr. Young who gave her the nickname by which she was known in jazz circles--Lady Day. She in turn created the name by which Mr. Young was identified by jazz bands, Pres. She was the vocalist with the Basie band for a brief time during 1937 and the next year she signed for several months with Artie Shaw's band. Miss Holiday came into her own as a singing star when she appeared at Cafe Society in New York in 1938 for the major part of the year. It was at Cafe Society that she introduced one of her best-known songs, Strange Fruit, a biting depiction of a lynching written by Lewis Allen. During that engagement, too, she established trade-marks that followed her for many years--the swatch of gardenias in her hair, her fingers snapping lazily with the rhythm, her head cocked back at a jaunty angle as she sang. Arrested in 1947 In 1947, a cloud that had been gathering over Miss Holiday and which was to cover the rest of her career, burst on her. She was arrested for a narcotics violation and, at her own request, was committed to a Federal rehabilitation establishment at Alderson, W. Va., for a year and a day in an attempt to rid herself of the habit. Ten days after her release Miss Holiday gave a concert at Carnegie Hall to a packed house but, although she appeared at concert halls in New York from time to time after that, she was not allowed to appear in New York night clubs. As a result of her narcotics conviction, she could not get the necessary cabaret license. During the Nineteen Fifties Miss Holiday's voice began to lose its useful elasticity. This, combined with occasional brushes with narcotics agents, made her last years difficult, although she continued to record frequently. Miss Holiday appeared in a film, New Orleans, in 1946 and was featured in a Broadway revue for a short run a few years later. In 1954 she made a tour of Europe and was featured in a widely acclaimed television program, The Sound of Jazz, in 1958. She is survived by her husband, Louis McKay. A previous marriage, to Joe Guy, a trumpet player, ended in divorce."}

He was checking the carbon monoxide levels in an apartment when he heard banging from the outside wall.

I look down the hall and say, 'My check!' recalled Mr. Lesh, who never got paid for the job. As for the carbon monoxide, he said, It was high.

As he walked through the garden level, he tripped over a white shag carpet, revealing the floorboards, which were floating in water. The owner had covered the boards with newspaper and plastic to keep the water from seeping through, but the water problem was unmistakable. It was definitely saturated, Mr. Fundaro said. You would step on it and float.\\n\\nThe buyer, who was supposed to put down a large deposit that afternoon, was livid. The seller's broker tried to assure her that the problem could be easily fixed.

{"original": "Unresolved feelings and unsatisfied ambitions animate A Woman, a Part, Elisabeth Subrin's sophisticated take on female friendship and professional frustration.\\n\\nFor Anna (Maggie Siff), the 44-year-old star of a popular, long-running television series in Los Angeles, burnout is imminent. Weakened by an autoimmune disease and weary of her brittle character, she abandons the series and returns to New York City to reconnect with the friends and collaborators who helped spark her career. But a lot can happen in two decades, and Anna is about to learn that the bits of ourselves we leave behind can't always be reclaimed.\\n\\nI feel like you want something from me, remarks Kate (Cara Seymour), welcoming yet wary. At 50, Kate is no longer an actor and is facing financial and other crises of her own. As is Isaac (John Ortiz), a playwright and the third member of their former theater group. With a teetering marriage and vague future, the gentle Isaac could have seemed a mere go-between for his two circling friends; but Mr. Ortiz is so quietly compelling that he makes Isaac's modest ambitions feel improbably consequential.\\n\\nTouching on issues of artistic survival and the porous boundary between work and pleasure, Ms. Subrin, an accomplished visual artist and filmmaker, sifts addiction, celebrity and the plight of the aging actress into something rarefied yet real. A strong, intelligent screen presence, Ms. Siff can make the simplest line feel pregnant with possibility. And Ms. Seymour is the perfect counterpoint, giving Kate a warm vulnerability that's never overplayed or milked for sentiment."}

The film's central couple Babak (Shahab Hosseini) and Neda (Niousha Jafarian) play along, each wryly accusing the other of hiding secrets, each saying that the other might be the killer. The Persian-language, Los Angeles-set thriller that follows builds tension around the resentments that have accumulated in their marriage.

{"original": "The day Paradise burned, Aaron Singer was a skeptic. Then he saw the flames in his rearview mirror.\\n\\nThis was November 2018, and the Camp Fire, the most destructive wildfire in California history, was making swift and smoky headway through the Sierra Nevada foothills. It took fewer than four hours to rip through this town of 26,000 residents, reducing schools, businesses, and 11,000 homes into piles of smoldering ash. When Mr. Singer got the evacuation order, he believed it was another false alarm. But he peeled out of his driveway as flames licked his yard, making it out of town with minutes to spare.\\n\\nParadise was lost. Eighty-five people died, and more than 90 percent of its population was driven out. Two years later, about 4,000 residents have returned to its scorched earth to lay new foundations and test fate once again. Mr. Singer, who has spent the past 24 months preparing to rebuild his home, is among them.\\n\\nNow he is having second thoughts.\\n\\nFor decades in this chaparral-covered ecosystem, it's been a ritual: after the burn comes the rebuild. But as the nation's most populous state stares down a seething climate crisis, one that cranked temperatures into triple digits last fall and set off a series of infernos that exploded, into bone dry air, the rebuilding process is beginning to look different.\\n\\nCalifornia has battled dual crises, with the largest wildfire season on record breaking out in the midst of the pandemic. At the close of 2020, as millions of Californians were put under a second lockdown in a bid to quell a massive second surge in Covid-19 cases, more than 4.2 million acres of the state had been scorched by nearly 10,000 fires. But in many ways, the crises have split the state into two: Northern California continues to reel from multiple megafires, including the August Complex Fire and the SCU Lightning Complex Fire that exploded in late summer. And in Southern California, Los Angeles is now the epicenter of the pandemic, leading the nation both in confirmed cases and in numbers of deaths."}
{"original": "My sister divorced her husband years ago. Until recently, we remained on friendly terms with my former brother-in-law, socializing at family events he hosted and exchanging holiday gifts. Lately he has become so radical in his political and world views that I am no longer comfortable maintaining a relationship. He has a blog and is an occasional radio host, so his are very public opinions that are filled with hate and even calls to violent action. I find this horrifying, and I am firmly in the category of people he is calling for violence against, along with most of my family. This is more than simply differing ideologies. (I do not believe he is a physical danger. I believe he needs help, the way Alex Jones needs help.)\\n\\nMy question is this: Do I tell him that his behavior offends me and I wish to cut off contact, or do I simply decline invitations and cease sending gifts? Is one behavior more ethical than the other? Name Withheld\\n\\nOne reflection of our country's toxic partisanship is that families may now find dinner-table conversations about politics impossible. Yet if people can't talk about the things that divide us with their families — where there's a background assumption that you should try to stick together even when you disagree — you've got to wonder where they can. So I'd be inclined to have a go at talking to this fellow about his noxious opinions, letting him know what you think. If most of his political discussions are in the echo chamber of social media and on a right-wing radio station, you and your family may be the only fellow citizens of his who have a chance to make him consider other points of view. Supposing that he doesn't respond reasonably — the likeliest outcome, no doubt — you can tell him that you're breaking off with him, and he'll know your reasons. But at least you'll have treated him respectfully, both as someone you had a family connection with and as a fellow American citizen.\\n\\nSeeing him as needing help, though, suggests that you think he's mentally ill. Of course, it's possible that he is. But his views may have just been heightened by the extreme rhetoric that circulates in social media nowadays. If that's the case, it's not him individually but our civic culture that's in need of help. Casting a social phenomenon as an individual pathology is a perilous temptation. (You can see it in the movement now afoot to medicalize racism as a mental disorder.) In crazy times, you can have crazy views without being insane."}
{"original": "Near the end of the novel, Lizzie reads about a group of cloistered monks who say, We have died and we are in love with everything. Weather understands that we can still be in love with what happens on a dying planet, and that life is always many things at once — full of love, full of despair, full of slobber frogs and melting glaciers and babies who won't nap; that what happens on one scale doesn't negate the others. But democratizing these scales can also become an alibi for complacency — for allowing us to shift back into the daily, the private, the emotional, as crutch or buffer. Weather suggests the comfort and peril of that retreat by narrating the life of a woman for whom retreat is becoming impossible. What happens when the horror of climate change gets lodged so deep under our skin we can't escape it any longer? What happens when an author manages to translate this horror from an abstraction to a gripping tale of immediate particulars?\\n\\nWalking away from her son's elementary school one morning, Lizzie thinks: The problem with Eli's school is it's not on a human scale. The same could be said of writing about climate change: The subject isn't on a human scale. Our minds can reckon with it, but how do we ask our child-size human hearts to hold it — to be productively overwhelmed by it? If I responded more strongly to Dept. of Speculation than to Weather, it might be a testament to the narrative dilemma the new novel is reckoning with: the scale of its ambition, despite its brevity, in its attempt to tell a story about climate change that carries the same visceral force as our private emotional dramas — that is, in fact, inseparable from them. It's quite possible I'm just as much a solipsist as the red-faced man in the novel who listens to a lecture about melting glaciers and then asks, But what's going to happen to the American weather?\\n\\nYet I think the intensity gap might also have to do with the way internal dangers allow for richer narrative tension than external ones: A marriage collapses from the inside, while the weather is external. It's a deeper gut-punch when the call is coming from inside the house. The same is true for climate change. We've made the call. We are the threat. But the antagonism feels faceless and less psychologically complex than the domestic torment of intimate betrayal, and the vexed hope of rebuilding.\\n\\nOffill's whittled narrative bursts are apt vessels for the daily experience of scale-shifting they document — the vertigo of moving between the claustrophobia of domestic discontent and the impossibly vast horizon of global catastrophe. This fragmented form is weirdly well-suited to both melodrama and plotlessness: In Dept. of Speculation, it allowed Offill to narrate marital infidelity, which can easily verge into soap opera, with an oblique, devastating grace — its searing shards summoning the sensation of holding a hot saucepan for just a moment, before it burns the skin off your fingers. Offill's agent once described that book as an X-ray rather than a novel, but in Weather we have something like an inverted X-ray: a narrative that illuminates not the obvious bones of the story but its unexpected details; not the bold lines of your femurs but the detritus in your pockets — the crumpled receipts, the pacifier dropped on the sidewalk, the key whose lock you can't remember. These bits and bobs highlight the feeling of daily life, but their mundane silhouettes are backlit by something more like a nuclear explosion.\\n\\nIn both novels, Offill's fragmentary structure evokes an unbearable emotional intensity: something at the core of the story that cannot be narrated directly, by straight chronology, because to do so would be like looking at the sun. In Dept. of Speculation, that white-hot core was the heartbreak of domestic collapse. In Weather, the collapse exists on a scale at once broader and more abstract: the end of the world itself. The thing that cannot be stared at directly is not the sun, but our own doomed planet."}

{"original": "Once, a senior associate for whom I was working berated me for such a mistake and said, Getting these things right is the easy part, and if you can't get that right, what does it say about your ability to analyze the law properly? I learned my lesson. To restore the focus-training function of the classroom, I stopped allowing laptops in class early in my teaching career. Since then research has confirmed the wisdom of my choice.\\n\\nFocus is crucial, and we do best when monotasking: Even disruptions of a few seconds can derail one's train of thought. Students process information better when they take notes — they don't just transcribe, as they do with laptops, but they think and record those thoughts. One study found that laptops or tablets consistently undermine exam performance by 1.7 percent (a significant difference in the context of the study). Other studies reveal that writing by hand helps memory retention. Screens block us from connecting, whether at dinner or in a classroom. Kelly McGonigal, a psychologist and lecturer at Stanford University, says that just having a phone on a table during a meal is sufficiently distracting to reduce empathy and rapport between two people.\\n\\nFor all these reasons, starting with smaller classes, I banned laptops, and it improved the students' engagement. With constant eye contact, I could see and feel when they understood me, and when they did not. Energized by the connection, we moved faster, further and deeper into the material. I broadened my rule to include one of my large upper-level courses. The pushback was real: A week before class, I posted the syllabus, which announced my policy. Two students wrote me to ask if I would reconsider, and dropped the class when I refused. But more important, after my class ends, many students continue to take notes by hand even when it's not required.\\n\\nPutting aside medical exemptions, many students are just resistant. They are used to typing and prefer it to writing. They may feel they take better notes by keyboard. They may feel they know how to take notes by hand but do not want to have to do so. They can look up material, and there's no need to print assignments. Some may have terrible handwriting, or find it uncomfortable or even painful to write.\\n\\nTo them, I'll let the Rolling Stones answer: You can't always get what you want, but sometimes you get what you need. My students need to learn how to be lawyers and professionals. To succeed they must internalize an ethos of caution, care and respect. To instill these values and skills in my students, I have no choice but to limit laptop use in the classroom."}
{"original": "One night, after one of these songs ended, I found myself writing a story about our story's end. I wrote it on an empty envelope that had been addressed to us as I sat by our records and the map on the wall. As I was cutting a pizza, I wondered idly who would get the pizza slicer. I thought about how I would make eggs only for one. As I wrote, I felt as if I were on the outside looking in, making a decision without being a part of it. Being on the inside would have hurt too much.\\n\\nOn a Friday night soon after, I kissed the man who sent me the folk-blues songs. When I came home and got in bed, my whole body itched. I thought of the unfaithful wife I had interviewed who had believed it was wrong to let the other man kiss her, but she also knew she would go wild with loneliness if she didn't.\\n\\nSomething came apart in me after that. In life, there are certain truths you hold on to: I am good. We are good. When a truth you believe in falls away, a friend told me, everything seems uncertain. I stopped eating, sleeping and caring what I wrote or what I did.\\n\\nThere was no outrunning pasts — that was what I saw now. There was no papering over flaws with research and interviews. When I had interviewed the wife about her infidelity, I had inwardly judged her for what she had done. Or maybe I had been judging myself, predicting all along that this would happen.\\n\\nIn the days that followed, I packed my books and clothing in a suitcase and then took them out again. I told myself the right thing to do was to let him go so he could build a cabin near Susquehannock State Park with a woman who kept her word, but I couldn't convince myself to leave. I kept remembering how he brushed his hair back and blinked at the same time. For some reason, this tiny movement is what I loved about him most.\\n\\nThe day he said he wanted to marry me, there was sand in the sheets from our day at the beach, but then I remembered (though I wanted to forget it) how that night my body had said no."}
{"original": "Roy J. Glauber, a theoretical physicist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2005 for using quantum theory to explain the field of optics and how light interacts with matter, laying the foundation for the field of quantum optics, died on Dec. 26 in Newton, Mass. He was 93.\\n\\nHis son, Jeffrey, confirmed the death. He said his father had entered Newton Wellesley Hospital that morning having difficulty breathing. No specific cause was given.\\n\\nDr. Glauber's seminal work addressed an area of research that had been largely ignored in quantum physics. For much of the first half of the 20th century, physicists had concentrated on trying to understand the nature of matter, neglecting the field of optics. That began to change with the development of the laser in 1960. Physicists wanted to understand how it worked vis-à-vis quantum mechanics, the mysterious rules that govern subatomic particles.\\n\\nFor his part, Dr. Glauber became intrigued by an experiment, performed in 1956 by the British astronomers Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss, to measure the apparent angular diameter of visible stars. (The angular size of a star is essentially how large the dot of light appears in the night sky.) The two scientists had set up two detectors, which received photons and sent them to a central device for measurements."}

{"original": "In A United Kingdom, David Oyelowo plays Seretse Khama, the real-life king of Botswana (then a British protectorate known as Bechuanaland) who set off an international crisis in 1948, when he married Ruth Williams, a white British clerk. South Africa, which was instituting apartheid at the time, objected to an interracial couple's leading a neighboring country; Britain opposed the marriage because resource-rich South Africa did; and Botswanans were angry that their leader had chosen a queen not of their race or tribe.\\n\\nReviewing A United Kingdom for The New York Times, Glenn Kenny said the best reason to see the film was Mr. Oyelowo's performance and added, It is remarkable, genuinely riveting work. One scene in particular encapsulates the performance: an open-air meeting at which he must convince his countrymen that he should remain their king and that they should accept his wife. In an interview at The Times, Mr. Oyelowo, who was also a producer of the film, explained how, for this scene, he drew on his own life as well as historical research. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation:\\n\\nHow did you think about this scene?\\n\\nFor me, things hopefully come together. Obviously you have to know your lines and know them well enough in front of a crowd, [so] you harness their attention. There's also the accent: Seretse Khama had a Botswana accent, but he also spent a lot of time in the U.K., so his accent was a hybrid. And sometimes the emotion can take over and the technical aspects can go by the wayside, and you don't want that to happen. Then there's the truth of what he's saying, the emotional truth. None of the technical work means anything unless there is an emotional connection — for you as the actor but also to the people you're delivering the speech to and then the audience as well.\\n\\nImage David Oyelowo, who stars as the king of what is now Botswana in the film A United Kingdom. Credit... Tony Cenicola/The New York Times\\n\\nWhat was the attitude you started out with when you looked out into the crowd?\\n\\nIt was one of those rare instances for me as an actor where what I say as the character very much overlapped with what I believe as a person myself. And so I felt a lot of the emotions I imagine Seretse Khama would have felt. We shot it in Botswana in front of a Botswana crowd, a lot of whom would know who Seretse Khama was. So in some ways, it's a real test to play this leader who means so much to them and to convince them both within the film and as real people who see me as an actor not from Botswana."}
{"original": "I liked that our May-September romance was unconventional. Bucking the norms I had hewed to out of a sense of duty felt as validating as it did challenging.\\n\\nMy husband had to confront the alienation of his Tunisian family, who refused to acknowledge my existence, even after our wedding. Yes, we had fallen deeply in love, but choosing to marry was also an act of rebellion for each of us, a rejection of what society and friends and family expected. It felt like setting out into uncharted territory. It was exhilarating.\\n\\nBut marriage was also a necessity for our relationship's survival. When I moved to Paris with my sons, my lover's Tunisian passport made it nearly impossible for him to spend time with me here. We fixed our problem by flying to California and tying the knot.\\n\\nAlas, thrill-seeking and passion can only take a marriage so far and, now that we were living as a family, reality had set in. Gone was the Middle Eastern backdrop, the inexpensive four-bedroom house with the verdant garden. The City of Lights is as romantic as ever, but Paris, for me, represented a return to the responsibilities of adult life with its endless loads of laundry and the drudgery of putting dinner on the table every night.\\n\\nSince my husband's arrival, I had been bumping up against the uncomfortable understanding that the way I wanted to live as a woman in my 50s was starkly different from how he thought life in his late 20s should look. My middle-aged friends bored him. My insistence on living in a clean and orderly house was, to him, senseless. And the hours he lost to Facebook, to watching European football, seemed pointless to me.\\n\\nWe sought out couples' therapy, twice, but were no more able to communicate past our language and cultural barriers than we had been before. We still didn't have the tools to address the imbalance of power that resulted from his being dependent on me for financial and visa support. He resented being reliant on me and, truthfully, I resented it too. I wanted an equal partner, someone I could depend on, someone who would share the load."}
{"original": "The Regime of Covenants acknowledges the fact that we don't really choose our most important attachments the way you choose a toaster. In the flux of life you meet some breathtakingly amazing people, usually in the swirl of complex circumstances. There is a sense of being blown around by currents more astounding than you can predict and control. Mostly you're bumblingly trying to figure out the right response to the moments you're in.\\n\\nWhen you are drawn together and make a pledge with a person, the swirl doesn't end; it's just that you'll ride it together. In the Regime of Covenants, making the right one-time selection is less important than the ongoing action to serve the relationship.\\n\\nThe Covenant people tend to have a we consciousness. The good of the relationship itself comes first and the needs of the partner are second and the individual needs are third. The covenant only works if each partner, as best as possible, puts the other's needs above his or her own, with the understanding that the other will reciprocate.\\n\\nThe underlying truth of a Covenantal Regime is that you have to close off choice if you want to get to the promised land. The people one sees in long, successful marriages have walked the stations of vulnerability. They've overthrown the proud ego and learned to be utterly dependent on the other. They've faced the ways they are difficult to be with and tried to address them. They've gone through all the normal episodes of confession, apology, defensiveness, forgiveness and loving the other most when there's nothing lovely about them.\\n\\nYou only do all this if you've set up a framework in which exit is not an easy option, in which you're assured the other person's love is not going away, and in which the only way to survive the crises is to go deeper into the relationship itself.\\n\\nThe final feature of a covenant is that the relationship is not just about itself; it serves some larger purpose. The obvious one in many cases is raising children. But the deeper one is transformation. People in such a covenant try to love the other in a way that brings out their loveliness. They hope that through this service they'll become a slightly less selfish version of themselves.\\n\\nThe Covenant Regime is based on the idea that our current formula is a conspiracy to make people unhappy. Love is realistically a stronger force than self-interest. Detached calculation in such matters is self-strangulating. The deepest joy sneaks in the back door when you are surrendering to some sacred promise."}

Words were whatever got him through the next interaction, people who worked with him say. Words were not deemed important enough to invite serious trouble.\\n\\nSo well-developed were Mr. Trump's survival instincts, in theory, that he had all but perfected the art of semi-plausible deniability — an upside of being on seemingly every side of every major political issue at various points in his adult life.\\n\\nHadn't he said the right thing that one time? That was what he meant.\\n\\nHadn't he winked at the crowd a bit? Everyone takes him too seriously.\\n\\nHadn't he used the word peacefully one time in that address before the Capitol riot, tucked between the more dominant instructions to fight and show strength and go by very different rules as he whipped up anger against elected officials, including his own vice president, who were disinclined to subvert the will of the electorate?\\n\\nHe has had a habit of saying outrageous things and then saying he was being sarcastic, he was kidding, that people shouldn't take him literally — and in fact, if you do, what an idiot you are, said Gwenda Blair, a biographer of the Trump family. It's both deniability for himself, but it's also deniability for his followers. He gives them something to hold onto so that they can then continue to believe in him.\\n\\nBut Mr. Trump, and much of the political class that was shocked and disoriented by his 2016 win, has sometimes conflated his reputational resilience with a notion that nothing he says can hurt him, no matter how ostensibly damaging."}

{"original": "East Wind is what its 72 residents call an intentional community, a modern descendant of the utopian colonies and communes of centuries past where individuals share everything from meals, chores and living space to work, income, domestic responsibilities and the burden of self-governance. The term intentional community dates to the late 1940s, when the Inter-Community Exchange — an organization formed in Yellow Springs, Ohio, in the wake of World War II to help promote peaceful, cooperative living arrangements (in the hope of eradicating war altogether) — changed its name to the Fellowship of Intentional Communities; the founders felt the new title better conveyed the deliberateness with which these groups were assembling. The members of East Wind, for example, range in age from infancy to 76: Some have lived here for more than three decades, but around half of the population is part of a new wave, people in their late 20s and early 30s who joined in the last four years. These newer residents moved to East Wind to wean themselves off fossil fuels, grow their own food, have a greater say in how their society is run and live in less precarious financial circumstances.\\n\\nAccording to Sky Blue, the 39-year-old executive director of the Foundation for Intentional Community and a former member of the Virginia-based commune Twin Oaks, which was founded in 1967, the number of intentional communities listed in the FIC's directory nearly doubled between 2010 and 2016 (the last year the directory was published), to roughly 1,200. Although the number of people living in these communities is hard to pin down — the demographic is often deliberately off the grid — Blue estimates that there are currently around 100,000 individuals residing in them. There's an obvious growth trend that you can chart, he said; millennials get this intentional community thing more than people in the past."}

I'm Michael Barbaro.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nHow are you doing? I'm Vince Champion.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nHi, Mr. Champion. Nice to meet you.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\n[LAUGHS] Nice to meet you.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nSounds like you've been having pretty long days, so we appreciate you.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nIt's been interesting, to say the least.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nCan you just start by telling me what you do?\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nI am the Southeast regional director for the International Brotherhood of Police Officers. Basically, I'm the director for the police union.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nGot it. And for those who don't know the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, this is a major police union in the U.S.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nYes, sir. We are a national union. We are all over the U.S. But all around, we're probably — just the officers alone, we're at about 15,000 plus.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nWow. I want to ask you, as a union head, about what appears to be a growing consensus. That in this discussion and this debate about changing policing, that unions have been a barrier — that they have created systems. And I know you may disagree with this, but let me just get through it. The perception is that unions have created systems that protect police officers — at times, even the most problematic officers — by making it challenging to see complaints against those officers and by erecting significant barriers to firing them. Do you think that that's fair?\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nTo a certain extent, yeah. Yeah, I do think so.\\n\\n[chimes]\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nFrom The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today: In the weeks since George Floyd was killed by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, Americans have been confronting hard questions about bias and racism within policing, and what the role of the police should be. And in the face of those questions is another question: Is the culture of policing, and the resistance to change by some police unions, so entrenched that whatever change is necessary would require fundamental rethinking from the outside, rather than incremental change from within police departments and their unions? In that context, we wanted to talk to someone who sits at the heart of these questions. Vince Champion is a police union representative in Atlanta, Georgia. Georgia is a right-to-work state, where police officers aren't required to join the union or pay dues, so the unions don't hold the same power to block reforms as they do in many states. And Champion has supported some of the reforms that unions have been criticized for resisting in the past, including banning chokeholds, the use of body cams, and transparency around police officers' records. And like many law enforcement officials, Champion has forcefully condemned officer Chauvin. But when it comes to another high-profile police killing in his own city — the killing of Rashard Brooks, just weeks after Floyd's death — Champion's views are more complicated. It's Monday, June 29.\\n\\n[chimes]\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nVince, I want to talk about the protests that have been happening all over the country. And I'm curious what you think, as a union leader, when you have seen these vast crowds in 2,000 U.S. cities and towns, protesting the death of Rashard Brooks, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, among many others. What did you see when you watched those?\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nI see people that have a message that they believe that it's systemic racism in the police departments. And they believe that because of the color of their skin, they're treated a certain way. They're afraid, because of the color of their skin, their children may go out and not come home.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nI mean, that is what I heard. And one of the biggest things that I took out of all the videos that I watched and everything was the word de-escalation — that officers need to learn how to de-escalate. Valid points. But I guess to answer your question, I think I heard what the protesters were saying. I don't disagree with the protesters. I want everybody to be able to say and be able to tell their kid, when we're not there to protect you, that man in uniform is. Go to him. And at the end of the day, that's what we need to get to. That's why I became a cop.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nYou're talking about the need for change. And I wonder, just to start, what your views are on what needs to change in policing.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nI mean, what I would love to see is law enforcement go to anybody that's willing to represent the Black community and have that conversation. What do you feel we're doing? And then we tell them, here's what we're actually doing. Now, how can we bring you, the community, to us and we meet in the middle? Is it that we need more social workers to where a police officer isn't acting like a social worker? Do we need to get more financing towards where we can make a phone call — we being the police — to say, I need a psychiatrist here. And instead of them saying, well, we've got to find somebody, it's going to take two or three hours, because we don't have the money to put anybody there. Or, can it be, yeah, we've got a person on call. They'll be there in 10 minutes. So now we can stand by and wait for them, and then they can take over that mental health aspect, that child protection thing. We are asked to do a myriad of things that are socially driven. And what I would rather see, like I was talking about having the ability to have a social worker on call.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nThe unfortunate part is, it's totally opposite of the defunding of law enforcement. It comes down to the politicians. And I really hate to be that way, but it does. And instead of building parks that make no sense, putting flowers up and down the roads that probably are going to die and you're going to have to replace or something, why can't we take that budget money and move it over to there? I'll stand next to the community and fight for that every day.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nWell, what you're describing is similar, in some ways, to what protesters and activists and reformers are asking for — a social worker at a scene instead of a police officer, a therapist at a scene instead of a police officer. I hear you saying that that is at odds with defunding and dismantling police. But help me understand why. If a social worker takes the place of a police officer, if a group of therapists is on call instead of a traditional police officer, then why do you need more money for policing? Don't you need less money for policing?\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nOK well, one, you mentioned replace. I'm not asking to replace. They have to go hand-in-hand. There has to be more of them, or as many of them as there is officers.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nI think, to many ears, there's going to be some skepticism to the idea there's not a lot of money spent on policing. And the question becomes, how is that money spent on policing? For example, let's go back to the therapist or the social worker who might go out and deal with a police call. Are you suggesting that a police officer needs to be with that social worker. Does there need to be two people at that scene? What if there's one? And if there's one, do we need that police officer? I guess one of the interesting questions of this moment is, are you all called too much? Is the system built too heavily around the idea that you dial those three digits, 911, and a police officer with a gun shows up? Is that not what we need? What do you think?\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nIt's a good question, because thinking back, there are scenarios where, yeah, we weren't needed. And maybe we shouldn't have gotten the call. But unfortunately —\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nThat's the system.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\n— they only know 911. Nobody knows the seven-digit number or the 10-digit number to call anyone else, so —\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nI guess if you look at it that way, and you're framing it that way, I still don't know if there's enough funding. But if you're talking in relation to, if we took calls away — I don't want to say away, but calls that aren't necessary for law enforcement, and we were able to — I don't know how we would do it, teach, or whatever the word you use, the public to call another number, then maybe, yeah, that may be something that would cause the cost factor to go down.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nI mean, again, I don't believe that would be a systematic, across-the-board defunding. I think if we start doing that — let's say that using your argument, that that works out. Everybody starts to now call — they see a homeless person talking to themselves, instead of calling law enforcement, they call the therapist number. That person goes out. Everything goes real good. They get that person some place to live, or figure out how to get them safe. And those calls for service go down, and that leaves law enforcement to handle the real, I guess, emergencies?\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nYeah, I think if you put that in practice, and then you start doing a cost analysis on it, it could actually lower the budgets. And I'm not even saying now that the budgets shouldn't be looked at, and seeing if there's another way to do that. Because look, a lot of officers, we're social workers. We're marriage counselors. We're doctors sometimes. We're more than actually what we were trained to be. I mean, we try to train for everything that we can, but we just can't be. And then, but you then expect us to. Not you; I'm just saying as a society —\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\n— as a whole, you expect us to. And then, when we slip up, we're the enemy. And yeah, I mean, I can see your point.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nRight. And I think for the people who are calling for reform, what you have just described as a problem is, to them, a problem as well. Police officers trained for one thing — public safety — being asked to respond to all manner of scenarios that are not pure questions of public safety, and then there being problems in those encounters that have now led people to question why police respond to those in the first place.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nGood point. I mean, and I can't disagree with that.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nDo you ever find yourself, as a union leader, representing a police officer who has been disciplined and who faces, perhaps, expulsion, termination, and yet, because of a contract, or because of your own union instincts and ethos, you're supposed to defend them? I'm thinking about, for example, officers that we have learned about over the past few years, with 10, 12, 15, 17 complaints of misconduct against them, who end up in one of these shootings. And everyone looks back and says, wow, look at that record. And then I always imagine, and maybe I'm mis-imagining, that there is a union official — maybe he looks like you — and he is defending that officer from being terminated.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nI think you use a broad brush. When I first took over in Florida — the union, when I was first elected as a president — I lost members, because I refused to lie for them to try to keep their jobs.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nMy job as a union representative is to give you the ability to be treated fairly. If you did wrong, we need to go forth and go before whomever we have to go for, for your due process. The one fortunate thing that I have in a right-to-work state is I'm not bound to represent everybody. I have the right, even though you pay your dues to us, I have the right to turn you down for representation.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nI mean, the reason I'm asking these questions is because some police unions around the country have resisted efforts to make public complaints against police officers, and they have fiercely resisted eliminating, firing police officers who are accused of a pattern of misconduct. Do you feel like unions are invested in the status quo in ways that mean that it is going to be hard, is hard, will always be hard to change policing in this country?\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nHuh. I think that pattern should be checked. I don't know why anyone, union or other, in the police would want to have somebody on there that's going to cause this issue. I hope not.\\n\\n[music]\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nAgain, a bad cop, whether we like it or not, we get painted with a broad brush. So why would we want to continue having those individuals around causing those problems for us?\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nWe'll be right back. On June 12, less than three weeks after George Floyd's killing in Minneapolis, a police officer in Atlanta responded to a 911 call from a Wendy's employee, who reported that a man had fallen asleep in the drive-through lane. That man was 27-year-old Rashard Brooks.\\n\\narchived recording (officer) To visit, or what's a — archived recording (rashard brooks) I'm visiting. archived recording (officer) Where are you visiting? archived recording (rashard brooks) My mother's grave site. archived recording (officer) Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. archived recording (rashard brooks) Yeah. archived recording (officer) How long has she passed for? archived recording (rashard brooks) It's been probably about a year and a half now, but — archived recording (officer) OK, I'm sorry to hear that. archived recording (rashard brooks) Her birthday's just passed.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nAs my colleagues have reported, for much of the encounter, Brooks cooperated with police.\\n\\narchived recording (officer) Will you take a [INAUDIBLE] breath test for me? Just a yes or no. archived recording (rashard brooks) I don't want to refuse anything. archived recording (officer) It's yes or no. It's completely up to you. archived recording (rashard brooks) Yes, I will. archived recording (officer) OK, just wait here while I grab it.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nBut after failing a sobriety test, the two officers on the scene, Garrett Rolfe and Devin Brosnan, tried to handcuff him. Brooks then punched Officer Rolfe, took control of Officer Brosnan's taser, fired it and ran from the officers. Officer Rolfe chased after him. Brooks turned around, fired a second taser shot over Rolfe's head. Rolfe drew his gun and shot Brooks twice in the back, killing him. Five days later, the Fulton County district attorney, Paul Howard, held a press conference —\\n\\narchived recording (paul howard) So, we have decided to issue warrants in this case today.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\n— where he announced that Officer Brosnan was being charged with aggravated assault.\\n\\narchived recording (paul howard) We have had something quite remarkable that happened in this case, and it involves the testimony of the other officer, Devin Brosnan.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nBut that he was participating in the investigation and would be a witness against Officer Rolfe.\\n\\narchived recording (paul howard) He plans to make a statement regarding the culpability of Officer Rolfe.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nWho was being charged with murder and who, if convicted, would face life in prison or the death penalty.\\n\\narchived recording (paul howard) Rolfe was aware that the taser in Brooks's possession, that it was fired twice.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nHoward said that Officer Rolfe's life was never in danger.\\n\\narchived recording (paul howard) And once it's fired twice, it presented no danger to him or to any other persons.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nAnd Howard revealed new details about the encounter.\\n\\narchived recording (paul howard) What we discovered is that Officer Rolfe actually kicked Mr. Brooks while he laid on the ground, while he was there fighting for his life. We were able to conclude that, based on the way that these officers conducted themselves while Mr. Brooks was lying there, that the demeanor of the officers immediately after the shooting did not reflect any fear or danger of Mr. Brooks, but their actions really reflected other kinds of emotions.\\n\\n[chimes]\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nBoth of the officers are represented by the International Brotherhood of Police and by Vince Champion, who quickly criticized the investigation. We wanted to understand why Champion, a union official who supports reform, is defending the officers in the Brooks killing. I wonder what it means to have a member of your union — a police officer — charged with murder in the line of duty.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nWell, only to correct because of the severity, he's actually in Georgia, being charged with felony murder. Which means that if he's not put to death, he will spend the rest of his life in prison without a chance for parole. And to answer your question, it's heavy on my heart and disheartening, not so much of the charge, as the fact that the due process and the investigation that led to the charge was not done at all, and very done improperly.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nWhat do you mean? I know you came out right away and you said that firing Officer Rolfe was rushed. Do you still feel that way after reading the charges, after watching the news conference from the district attorney, the videos — all the information that has come out?\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nYeah, and I even feel more so. We've said from day one, we the union, that looking at the videos and everything, we're not saying whether it was a good shoot or a bad shoot. We don't have enough evidence to say that. Normally how this situation goes in officer-involved shootings, the G.B.I., Georgia Bureau of Investigation, does the investigation. The officer is either put on administrative leave with or without pay, and then the results are turned to the D.A. or to the city. But the district attorney here decided to do his own investigation that he normally doesn't do. And then, after he did his press conference, we found — I guess, to be politically correct, misspoken — misspokens, if you will, or lies that he did. And we haven't even been entitled to all of the investigative material. So yeah, we still believe that it was a rushed investigation, and it was politically motivated.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nI want to make sure I understand what you are referring to. When you say that there are cases where the district attorney may have misspoken, what do you mean?\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nIn his press conference, the district attorney came out and stated that Officer Brosnan, the second officer on the scene, had turned state witness, and he was going to testify against Officer Rolfe. That ended up not being true. Less than 10 minutes after that statement came out, the attorney for Officer Brosnan said that had never happened. He was not going to testify against the other officer. He never said he would turn state witness. He's never pled guilty to any charges. And he has cooperated with the D.A. — meaning answering questions and stuff — but he's never said that he would be state witness. So the question then becomes, if you're not telling the truth now or you're having inconsistencies, how can we believe your report? Or, did you just do a shoddy investigation? If that's the case, you should have allowed what we consider the professionals — which is an unbiased outside agency from Atlanta, the G.B.I. They're the state organization that does this.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nOK, so those issues aside — and I understand why you have raised them — I wonder what you make of the evidence that has been presented, knowing that it may not be entirely complete? To summarize what the district attorney has said in his public presentation, he said that that Officer Rolfe's life was never in danger, that he shot Rashard Brooks in the back when Brooks was running away, and that after Brooks was shot, Officer Rolfe kicked him as he lay dying. Do you dispute any of that?\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nYeah. As far as, OK, the first one that you talked about — that Officer Rolfe's life was never in danger — well, let's not forget, there was a fight ensued. One officer did go to the hospital with a concussion. And I guess it depends on whether you subscribe to that a taser is not a deadly weapon.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nBut the taser is considered a deadly weapon under Georgia law.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nYou're referring to the fact that Rashard Brooks grabbed the officer's taser and shot it twice.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nYeah, at the officer.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nNow, I watched the district attorney's news conference. And what he said was that at the time that Rashard Brooks was shot twice in the back by Officer Rolfe, he had twice shot the taser in such a way that it was essentially empty and unusable. And that this would be something that an officer like Officer Rolfe would know — having carried a taser, used a taser — that it contained two taser shots. So in that case, does that complicate the point that you're making here?\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nNo, because the taser isn't considered unusable after the two shots. The taser also has a method or a way to use it in a drive-stun situation. And what that means is you can actually walk up to a person — like the old stun guns that arc in between and you used to touch people with them — the taser still has that effect. So it's still an active weapon.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nSure, but Brooks was 18 feet away, I believe, at the time that he was twice shot. And he was moving away from the police.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nWell, that's your assumption that Brooks wouldn't stop and turn around and come back. It was evident that he was running, yes. But if he decided to stop and come back, it could have been used.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nBut at the moment that Officer Rolfe shot Mr. Brooks, he wasn't in close range, and it wasn't capable of being a stun gun. So I just want to be very clear on the question of in what way Officer Rolfe would have believed that his life was in danger in that moment. You're painting a scenario where something could have changed. Someone might have done something. Brooks might have turned around, might have come back at him. But at that very moment, 18 feet away or so, when the cartridges had been spent and it's only role was as a stun gun, how was Officer Rolfe's life in danger?\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nWell, you're assuming that they didn't fire simultaneously. You don't know that, and we don't know that. You're assuming that he's fired the taser, and then Officer Rolfe shot. Well, nobody knows that, including the district attorney. You don't know when Officer Rolfe decided to squeeze the trigger. We don't know when Mr. Brooks decided to squeeze the trigger. Did they do it at the same time? Did they not? We don't know. We can find that out. So again, you're making an assumption that Brooks fired and then the officer fired. We just don't know that, and I can't make that assumption either.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nMy recollection from watching the video and the —\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nBut you can't do that. I mean, you can't, because you don't know. You haven't done time-distance. You don't know the time that it takes for a person to think, to squeeze the trigger. You don't know how much time it took him to draw his weapon. So I don't know how you can make any assumptions from that video. And if you're asking that, that's what you're asking for — assumptions, not facts.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nSo in your mind, there's not sufficient evidence to discount the possibility that Officer Rolfe felt his life was in danger, despite the distance, despite this state of the taser?\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nI don't know. We're asking for due process and for an investigation. And if the investigation proves what you're saying is right, then that's an issue. If it's saying what you're saying is wrong, then it was a good shoot. But I don't have an opinion there, because I don't work on opinions. I work on evidence. And I haven't seen all the evidence. And I'm not going to answer or get painted into a corner or try to ask a question. What I answered you with is as a taser instructor — what we teach, what they say, what the law says. It doesn't matter, quite honestly, if you read Georgia law, it clearly says that the taser is a deadly weapon. So I mean, what's the difference? If a gun's a deadly weapon, a taser is a deadly weapon, you point either one of them, then you're justified for using deadly force.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nI want to turn to the visual evidence that prosecutors pointed to in their presentation of Officer Rolfe kicking Brooks's body once he had been shot. And I know that talking about the specifics of this is tricky for you. But you are a longtime officer. You train people. You're a union representative. That feels like a singular moment in all of this. And is that appropriate conduct ever appropriate conduct for an officer?\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nWell first off, to your first part of the question, during the press conference, Paul Howard never showed a video of Officer Rolfe kicking Mr. Brooks. He showed a still shot.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nYes, he showed a picture.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nOK, he showed a picture. That's a picture. Now, we all know a picture is worth 1,000 words. We know what it appears from the picture. We don't know what led up to that, where exactly in time that was. But with all that being said, you are correct. There's no reason to kick a suspect. And we don't train to do that. We're not allowed to do that. That's normally not the course of business. So that part of the question, I would agree and answer that no, it shouldn't be done. However, do I take Paul Howard's word that that's what that picture meant? No, sir, I do not. But that's why we have investigations. And even though it's been numerous times the media has jumped out and swore that that officer was wrong, but after all the evidence and the videos were looked at properly and in context, almost all of those have been turned over — or they haven't been found guilty. But yet, the video started out looking bad. And if we're going to get to a society where mayors and district attorneys can look at video and go, that looks bad, I don't like it, so I'm going to terminate you and charge you with murder — that's a bad precedent to start.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nI mean, ultimately, I'm asking all these questions because I think a lot of people's reaction to this incident, above all, is, why did a man who was found asleep in a Wendy's drive-through — a man who was not armed when this interaction began, and a man who really just wanted to go home — why did he end up dead at the end of this encounter and at the hands of police?\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nHe did not just get shot because he was in the Wendy's parking lot asleep and he just wanted to go home. No, that's not what happened. He chose to fight the officers. He chose to be a fleeing felon when he hit the officer in the head and gave him a concussion. And then the officers reacted at that point. So you can have the conversation all day whether you agree or not that the shot was right or wrong, and we can wait for the evidence. But what you can't dispute, or you should not be saying, is that a man was killed because all he wanted to do was go home, and he was just sitting in a Wendy's drive-through and he fell asleep. So I don't — you know, words have meaning. So when you say certain words, you have to understand that you need to say what you mean. And to say that our training should keep us from killing a man that just wanted to go home just isn't genuine.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nI wonder if you believe, as many do, that race was a factor in his death. The prosecutor insinuated this when he spoke of other kinds of emotions.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nDo I feel — you know, a lot of people ask those questions. And it's hard to answer, because I personally don't ever see race. I never have. I've been in law enforcement for over 30 years. I don't care what's your color, creed, race. It doesn't matter. You're a human being. I will treat you as that until you — and I will act the same way you act towards me. If we're cordial, we're talking, we're going to be cordial and talking. If you're going to fight me, I'm going to defend myself. Do I think these officers decided to shoot Mr. Brooks — because that appears basically what you're asking me — because of his skin color? Absolutely not.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nNo, no, no. The question being, did race play a factor in this? Not, was he killed because they sought out —\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nI mean, to answer your question, no. I don't think so. And I don't know how you could — I mean, other than we are in the climate that we're in today — how you draw that.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nJust to be sure I understand, in your mind, would a white man or a white woman who engaged in the same behavior as Rashard Brooks, do you think that they would have also ended up dead?\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nThat's the way you want to ask the question?\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nOK. Because it's kind of offensive.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nBut why do you think?\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nWell, let me finish. If you're asking me if a white person, man or woman, would have done exactly what Mr. Brooks did, would they have been shot and possibly died from it? Yes. If they did exactly what it is, I believe that would have happened the same way. But the way you framed it is that if it was a white person, would they have been killed? You keep saying, would they have been killed? Mr. Brooks was killed because of actions that led up to it. The officer did not go out, again — and I don't know why we have to keep stressing this — he didn't go out to plan to kill Mr. Brooks or anybody that day. But the way you made it sound, if that was a white person — let's just go there — if that was a white person that did the exact same thing that Mr. Brooks did? Absolutely. They would have been shot. I don't know how to say that any clearer. But let's caveat that by saying with the exact same actions. But they've got to be the exact same actions. We have to be talking about the same situation and just switching the color.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nBut I wonder if this connects to something that you said earlier. You said that you don't see race. And I wonder if you've ever heard pushback on that concept, the idea that it's possible to be colorblind. Because there's a very strong line of thinking that —\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nYeah, that I've heard, too. That apparently I am racist because I say I don't see color.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nNo, let me just get through this, because I think it's important. That concept, it may be very well-intentioned — I don't see race. But the thinking is that it's actually dangerous, because if a person says, I don't see race, then what you may actually be saying is that you don't see Black people as different from white people, or as treated differently. And then, therefore, you don't see racism. And it means that no measures will be put in place to acknowledge that the reality of being a Black person is different than the lived reality of being a white person, right? So the point being, it's actually important to see race. It's important to see race in order to change policing. I mean, what do you think of that?\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nI think that's the problem.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nWhen I say I don't see race, that means I treat everybody as the same. But it doesn't mean that I don't see the struggles that other people have. And that is, that's the difference. And if that offends somebody, I apologize to that. But what I mean is, they're a human being. But it's not that I don't see that there's racism. I'm not saying that there isn't. What I said to you is, I don't see it as far as I don't do it. Me, as my person — me, as Vince Champion — I do not subscribe to that type of stuff. And you know, it's interesting. We're sitting there having this conversation, but nobody really wants to talk about how many times officers have stepped in and protected people from racism. And nobody knows about it, because, you know why? Because that's our job. And you talk about seeing it? Absolutely, we see it. It just seems like everybody wants to make people talk different and act different, when you asked the question.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nI don't see it. And that's the only way I can explain it. And for anybody to say that that makes me a racist, shame on you. You want to change what words mean. That's all there is to it.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nNo, you're making clear that you do see it. You're saying you have seen acts of racism. So you do see race.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nCorrect. Racism.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nI'm curious —\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nUh —\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\n[INAUDIBLE]\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nNo, please. No, go ahead.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nHere's the — you're walking down the road, and I understand the questioning. But here's the problem that I see, how I see it. A lot of people are going to have this argument about race and systemic racism in law enforcement. The statistics don't prove it. And you go and pull nationwide, and you pull in certain cities and states law enforcement records. And I just did this, because I had to do this in front of the city council in Chattanooga, Tennessee. In 2019, use of force, 59 percent were white, 39 percent were Black. If you start looking nationwide, you start seeing similar percentages. So the issue is, statistically, the argument isn't there. My opinion — my opinion only — the statistics are not the issue. What the issue is, is the perception from the Black community that that is what's going on. So where we in law enforcement fall short is we don't change and help change that perception.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nI want to counter what you have just described in those statistics and the idea that this is a question of perception rather than conduct in patterns. I'm sure you know some of this. Local and federal investigations have found what they describe as systemic racial bias in the Chicago Police Department, in the Baltimore Police Department, in the Ferguson Police Department. Now, in Ferguson, what they found was that Black drivers were more than twice as likely to be searched after being stopped as white drivers were. In New York City, where I live, data makes clear that police stopped and frisked Black and Latino New Yorkers at significantly higher rates than they actually represent in the city. About 83 percent of the stops during about a decade-long period involved Black and Hispanics, even though they make up about 50 percent of the city's residents. So 83 percent of stops, 50 percent of the city's residents. And in Minneapolis, just a few weeks ago, data showed that use of force against Black people in that city was seven times greater than it was against white people in the city. So the idea that it's just perception, rather than a documented, data-based conclusion about conduct, does not seem accurate. Because all of that data seems to point to a pattern of racial discrimination.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nI'm not going to dispute the fact of what you're saying. One, I haven't pulled the stats. I'll take your word for the stats. You said three or four cities. I said one city. So the thing is, you can go to your state's and pull yours. I can go to my state's and pull mine. Now, is there departments that actually may have it? I'm not going to argue that point. You're probably — yes, that could be absolutely right. I just think that trying to go to our respective corners, if you would, and make our arguments is not going to do it. We in law enforcement have to admit that in the Black community, this is how they feel. How do we prevent them from feeling that way?\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nYou keep saying feel, and I believe that is a deliberate word choice. But when a Black American is hurt or is killed in one of these interactions, in many cases by a white police officer, do you understand why that doesn't feel like a perception? It's an experience, a reality.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nYeah, sure. Sure, I can understand that. And I understand what you were saying. But we can do this all day long, but that's not helping anything. What we need to do is fix why it is the way that it is, and why people feel that way. Because if we try to prove and try to change that and make it better to where it's not that way, isn't it the same, whether it's a perception or reality?\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nWe talked about the concept of systemic racism in policing, and you said that you didn't think police officers are operating with racist assumptions. Do you think police officers operate with unconscious bias? Police officers, as you know, they have enormous discretion and power. They carry guns. They can end lives. And I think what people who are protesting and demonstrating now are talking about are decisions that don't feel conscious. They may not be intentional. But they are baked into how people operate and how they police.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nAre you asking me if I believe that's the rule, or if that —\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nHappens. If it can, if it does explain behavior, and if it's a reality.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nYes. I would say probably so. Could somebody, because of their upbringing and how they've lived their life and everything, subconsciously do that? Yeah. And the main reason that I would have to say yes is, when you're in a stressful situation, technically, you don't think. Your subconscious takes over, and you react. When a law enforcement officer has their training that they go through, you know, you try to just train that if you're going to be in a stressful situation, that your training is going to take over — not your thought process. So with that being said, your subconscious — if you've trained yourself over your years of living a certain way, and maybe you've, I don't know, suppressed those because it's not societally acceptable, and you're trying to be a good person in society, that under a stressful situation, could that bias come out, unstbeknowingly? I mean, that only would make common sense, since scientifically, it actually, it works. In training in and in other stuff. So yeah, I could see that that could be a true statement.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nMm-hmm. And I think that's where somebody who is Black, and somebody who has had an experience with the police that is unpleasant and maybe even violent, would say, that's not a perception. That's their reality.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nMm-hmm. And I agree with that.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nI'm curious what conversations you and your colleagues are having in this moment. I have to assume that you go into the office each day, the union headquarters, or you meet with rank-and-file officers, and you're all absorbing these protests. And I'm curious what kinds of conversations you all are having in this moment.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nThe conversations are really questioning whether we want to continue to do the job.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nHmm.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nWhat the conversations are becoming are more of, more of digging down in our personal being to decide is, did we do this job for the right reason or the wrong reason?\\n\\n[chimes]\\n\\nI walked into this job, my son has walked into this job for what it's for: to protect and serve. As cliché as that sounds, that's why we do this. We don't get holidays and weekends off. We know that going in. We know that the pay is not the best. We know that going in. We know we could get hurt or killed. We know that going in. So you look at yourself, and you go, why are you doing the job? And that's been the conversation. Is the job getting to where it's not what you thought it was? It's not maybe for you, you know, now? Are you becoming the dinosaur officer that needs to go? And everybody says things aren't done like they used to. Well, that's true. They're not. So you've got to learn to conform and make these changes. And if you don't think you can, maybe it's time for you to move on.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nI really appreciate your time, Mr. Champion. It's been good talking to you.\\n\\nvince champion\\n\\nI enjoyed it, and thank you.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nDuring an interview on CNN, Paul Howard, the Fulton County district attorney, was asked about claims that his prosecution of officers Rolfe and Brosnan is politically motivated.\\n\\narchived recording (paul howard) It is the same criticism we have had in every police case, particularly no matter how important the case was. The more important or significant the case, the more the accusation was that it was political. This is nothing new.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nHoward said that politics has played no role.\\n\\narchived recording (paul howard) We've charged it based upon the facts. And I'm hoping that the people in this country will get away from the little criticisms and understand the broad picture. This is a 27-year-old man who's dead. He didn't have to die. These shootings are continuing to happen all over our country. And I think what those protesters and all over the country, they're not demonstrating because they thought Paul Howard did something political. They're demonstrating because citizens in our country continue to die, and a high number of those citizens are African Americans.\\n\\n[chime]\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nWe'll be right back.\\n\\n[music]\\n\\nHere's what else you need to know today.\\n\\narchived recording (alex azar) The window is closing. We have to act, and people as individuals have to act responsibly. We've got the —\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nOn Sunday, the secretary of health and human Services, Alex Azar, told NBC News that the coronavirus was on the verge of becoming an uncontainable crisis in the U.S.\\n\\narchived recording (alex azar) We need to social distance. We need to wear our face coverings if we're in settings where we can't social distance, particularly in these hot zones.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nOver the weekend, infections soared across the West and South, with 42,000 new cases identified on Saturday alone. Texas and Arizona reported a record number of hospitalizations, and testing sites in Florida turned people away because lines became so long.\\n\\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) Look, if you listen to what the secretary said, if you listen to what the president says, they're saying what they said three months ago. They're basically in denial about the problem. They don't want to tell the American people the truth. And they don't want to have any federal response, except supporting the states, supporting the states.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nSpeaking on Meet the Press after Azar, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo blamed the Trump administration for failing to act decisively and for giving little guidance to states.\\n\\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) So I heard that, and I understood where they were.

But it is Asughara who forces Ada's rational self ever further into the background and takes over her body more than any other personality.\\n\\nImage\\n\\nFreshwater is a poetic and disturbing depiction of mental illness as it haunts the protagonist from birth to adulthood: the brief insanities that are in you, not just the ones that blossomed as you grew taller … but the ones you were born with, tucked behind your liver. It is an unflinching account of the way mental illness can grow, transform and destroy not just relationships, but one's sense of self as well. Unlike many depictions of dissociative identity disorder in fiction, Emezi steers clears of hysteria and fear-driven drama. The voices in Ada's mind build creatively on a consistent belief about madness: that in the height of suffering, sufferers are not themselves; they become possessed by different spirits. As Sylvia Plath famously wrote in 1962, I am terrified by this dark thing that sleeps in me.\\n\\nAda's voices don't just talk to her; they fight with her during the novel's narration in a moving portrayal of a struggle against something that exists within, a mental anguish that no amount of reasoning can conquer. More powerful than Emezi's prose, though, is what it brings to the real world. Eating disorders, cutting, depression, suicide, manic depression — in the popular imagination, all these things are most often seen as the struggles of young, wealthy, white American women. This novel expands the universe of mental illness to include women of color and other ethnicities. Rooting Ada's story in Igbo cosmology forces us to further question our paradigm for what causes mental illness and how it manifests. It causes us to question science and reason.\\n\\nFreshwater builds slowly, but that only crystallizes how fractured Ada and her personalities are. As the voices in her head get louder and grow hungrier, the story gains momentum. Only when Ada looks to her roots is there hope that she will wrest back control from her tormentors. For both the reader and Ada, that comes as a revelation, if not quite a relief."}
{"original": "With the death last month of the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman at age 91, the intellectual world lost a thinker of rare insight and range. Because his style of work was radically different from that of most social scientists in the United States today, his passing is an occasion to consider what might be gained if more members of our profession were to follow his example.\\n\\nMr. Bauman wrote scores of books and taught for many years at the University of Leeds, in England. He became a scholar to be reckoned with relatively late in his career. A major success came in 1989, at age 64, when he published a landmark study, Modernity and the Holocaust. Against the widespread view that the Holocaust reflected an anti-Semitic madness that had seized civilized Germany and thrown it back into an atavistic state, Mr. Bauman described the genocide as an all-too-characteristic creature of the modern era.\\n\\nThe early 20th century, he noted, had brought us large-scale factories, efficient systems of transport, huge enterprises with disciplined work forces and pseudoscientific ideologies like eugenics. These were essential elements, alongside anti-Semitism, of Hitler's mass slaughter. Mr. Bauman argued that we must not celebrate the achievements of the modern age without also paying attention to its dark side.\\n\\nModernity and the Holocaust was a work of theory and synthesis.

{"original": "Every subsequent culture-war battle, in Caldwell's account — the debates over feminism and gay marriage, transgender rights and immigration — follows the lines of this constitutional division. The new constitutionalists are constantly discovering new rights and empowering courts and bureaucracies to enforce them; the old constitutionalists object, win a few elections on the objection and then find themselves defeated nonetheless. And this pattern of defeat is responsible, he implies, for the Trumpian turn: After so many failures to defend the old Constitution, Trump-era conservatives are embracing the logic of the new one, choosing white-identity politics because in the new constitutional dispensation that began in 1964, group identities are the only ones that count.\\n\\nCaldwell's book is noteworthy for being a conservative account that effectively reinforces a liberal ideological narrative. It is usually liberals who argue that on every new culture-war battlefield their side is just extending Martin Luther King Jr.'s vision, while conservatives respond that the civil rights acts were supposed to correct a specific historical injustice and their application to debates over gender or marriage or abortion or the rights of illegal immigrants warps that purpose. Caldwell shrugs off this idea as a pleasant illusion; in his account the original critics of civil rights legislation were probably correct to warn against its revolutionary implications, which include the steady subsequent advance of cultural progressivism, an enormous expansion of deficit spending and the economic abandonment and cultural vilification of the white male working class.\\n\\nAnd this is where Caldwell's account becomes unpersuasive in its turn. He depicts federal economic policymaking after the civil rights era as a hugely expensive attempt at integrating Americans by race and sex, a project paid for after Ronald Reagan by deficits rather than transfers. But as Wesley Yang points out in a review of The Age of Entitlement for The Washington Examiner, there's little evidence that American public policy actually transfers lots of money from whites to minorities; the spending that Reagan's deficits funded was for the military and old-age entitlements, both of which flowed far more into white pocketbooks than black ones. Nor were the economic policies that have arguably harmed working class whites the most somehow a necessary extension of civil rights legislation: China's entry into the World Trade Organization, to choose one signal example, was not somehow foreordained when L.B.J. set pen to paper.\\n\\n[Listen to The Argument podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]\\n\\nSo if Caldwell's book supplements and corrects Klein's, by giving a clearer sense of the ideological stakes involved in post-1960s polarization, his account needs to be corrected and supplemented in its turn. And a third new book, Michael Lind's The New Class War: Saving Democracy From the Managerial Elite, does an important part of that work, by explaining an aspect of our present polarization that can't be traced to specifically American racial fears or constitutional debates: Namely, the way that our populist-era divisions increasingly mirror Europe's, with the same exodus of downscale voters from left-of-center parties, the same polarization by education and class.\\n\\nIn Lind's account, Caldwell's story about the advance of social liberalism through bureaucratic and judicial power is just a subsidiary of the more important story, the post-1970s consolidation of economic power by a managerial upper class. The liberalism of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama isn't an ideology of white disempowerment, in his account, so much as a solvent that weakens any institution — from churches and families to union shops and local industries — that might grant real power to groups outside the gilded city, the Silicon Valley bubble, the Ivy League gate. And together with its center-right partner in crime, Reagan-Thatcher libertarianism, this liberalism's policy choices — economic and social permissiveness, effectively conjoined — created a new class divide, between thriving meritocratic hubs and a declining and demoralized heartland, that explains both the frequency of populist irruptions and their consistent futility.\\n\\nBut even as he acknowledges the faults of populism, Lind treats the class-war aspect of polarization as a potentially positive development, because he hopes that it will create a real political coalition for the losers of neoliberal era — a socially conservative, economically left-leaning constituency that's numerous but often homeless. Making such a coalition constructive rather than just disruptive may be impossible, but it's the only way he sees to escape neoliberal oligarchy and bring our class war to an end with a negotiated peace."}

He was 96.\\n\\nHis longtime partner, Ruth Kirchmeier, confirmed the death, at Martha's Vineyard Hospital. He lived on the Vineyard, in West Tisbury.\\n\\nFrom the mangroves of the Yucatán watching for green-winged teals to the grand ballet of fly-fishing on the Salmon River in Nova Scotia, Mr. Bryant's often-poetic, first-person accounts took readers to many places, but perhaps none more so than the mythical past, when boys went fishing with their fathers, watched rainbow trout hover above the pebbles in a brook and learned that patience, cultivated during hours in a duck blind, was more than a needlepoint virtue. His insights appealed to many readers who had never set foot in woods or a stream.\\n\\nRaised on Martha's Vineyard, Mr. Bryant was a seaman, a carpenter, a ditch digger, a logger, a cook and a dock builder. He was also a Dartmouth College graduate and a reporter and the managing editor of The Claremont Daily Eagle in west-central New Hampshire for more than a decade in the 1950s and '60s."}
{"original": "Buttigieg has campaigned frequently with his husband, embracing him onstage, and has mentioned his marriage in debates. And he doesn't shy away from questions about his sexual orientation, which he didn't publicly acknowledge until the age of 33, shortly before his election to a second term as mayor of South Bend, Ind.\\n\\nBut he doesn't volunteer lengthy ruminations about its impact on how he sees the world or showcase it in any other way. It's there if you look and listen for it. But sometimes you have to look and listen hard.\\n\\nNone of the voters at his rallies in Iowa brought it up when I asked them what drew them to Buttigieg. They mostly raved about his intelligence.\\n\\nWere there any particular obstacles he might face in a general election?\\n\\nHis youth, said Louann Cooling, 62, of Le Grand, Iowa. It was the same answer — his youth, or his inexperience — that others gave. No one mentioned his being openly gay.\\n\\nBeing gay and an emblem of progress hasn't given Buttigieg any special traction with younger Democrats, who respond much less favorably to him than older Democrats do. It hasn't established any solidarity with other minorities, though he reached for such a connection when stating a commitment to racial justice during the Democrats' November debate.\\n\\nWhile I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country, turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate, he said. Wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldn't have happened two elections ago lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day, even if they are nothing like me in their experience.\\n\\nThose remarks didn't have the effect he intended. Some African-Americans accused him of equating very different kinds of discrimination, and polls show that his support from black Democrats remains abysmal. When they appraise Buttigieg, they notice a whole lot beyond his sexual orientation, including worrisome friction between him and some black residents of South Bend and a path of extraordinary privilege (Harvard, a Rhodes scholarship, a job with McKinsey) that brought him to this point."}

Eight Textbooks. Two American Stories. American history textbooks can differ across the country, in ways that are shaded by partisan politics.\\n\\nWe analyzed some of the most popular social studies textbooks used in California and Texas. Here's how political divides shape what students learn about the nation's history.\\n\\nThe textbooks cover the same sweeping story, from the brutality of slavery to the struggle for civil rights. The self-evident truths of the founding documents to the waves of immigration that reshaped the nation.\\n\\nThe books have the same publisher. They credit the same authors. But they are customized for students in different states, and their contents sometimes diverge in ways that reflect the nation's deepest partisan divides.\\n\\nHundreds of differences — some subtle, others extensive — emerged in a New York Times analysis of eight commonly used American history textbooks in California and Texas, two of the nation's largest markets.\\n\\nIn a country that cannot come to a consensus on fundamental questions — how restricted capitalism should be, whether immigrants are a burden or a boon, to what extent the legacy of slavery continues to shape American life — textbook publishers are caught in the middle. On these questions and others, classroom materials are not only shaded by politics, but are also helping to shape a generation of future voters.\\n\\nConservatives have fought for schools to promote patriotism, highlight the influence of Christianity and celebrate the founding fathers. In a September speech, President Trump warned against a radical left that wants to erase American history, crush religious liberty, indoctrinate our students with left-wing ideology.\\n\\nThe left has pushed for students to encounter history more from the ground up than from the top down, with a focus on the experiences of marginalized groups such as enslaved people, women and Native Americans.\\n\\nThe books The Times analyzed were published in 2016 or later and have been widely adopted for eighth and 11th graders, though publishers declined to share sales figures. Each text has editions for Texas and California, among other states, customized to satisfy policymakers with different priorities.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, it's a political process, said Jesús F. de la Teja, an emeritus professor of history at Texas State University who has worked for the state of Texas and for publishers in reviewing standards and textbooks.\\n\\n[Thousands of readers have responded to this article. Here is what they had to say.]\\n\\nThe differences between state editions can be traced back to several sources: state social studies standards; state laws; and feedback from panels of appointees that huddle, in Sacramento and Austin hotel conference rooms, to review drafts.\\n\\nRequests from textbook review panels, submitted in painstaking detail to publishers, show the sometimes granular ways that ideology can influence the writing of history.\\n\\nA California panel asked the publisher McGraw-Hill to avoid the use of the word massacre when describing 19th-century Native American attacks on white people. A Texas panel asked Pearson to point out the number of clergy who signed the Declaration of Independence, and to state that the nation's founders were inspired by the Protestant Great Awakening.\\n\\nAll the members of the California panel were educators selected by the State Board of Education, whose members were appointed by former Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat. The Texas panel, appointed by the Republican-dominated State Board of Education, was made up of educators, parents, business representatives and a Christian pastor and politician.\\n\\n[In California Today: Dana Goldstein talks about why she picked California and Texas. Read the newsletter here.]\\n\\nMcGraw-Hill, the publisher whose annotated Bill of Rights appears differently in the two states, said it had created the additional wording on the Second Amendment and gun control for the California textbook. A national version of the pages is similar to the Texas edition, which does not call attention to gun rights, the company said in a written statement.\\n\\nPearson, the publisher whose Texas textbook raises questions about the quality of Harlem Renaissance literature, said such language adds more depth and nuance.\\n\\nCritical language about nonwhite cultural movements also appears in a Texas book from McGraw-Hill. It is partly a result of debates, in 2010, between conservative and liberal members of the Texas Board of Education over whether state standards should mention cultural movements like hip-hop and country music. Their compromise was to ask teachers and textbook publishers to address both the positive and negative impacts of artistic movements.\\n\\nTexas struck that requirement in 2018, but its most recent textbooks, published in 2016, will reflect it for years to come.\\n\\nPublishers are eager to please state policymakers of both parties, during a challenging time for the business. Schools are transitioning to digital materials. And with the ease of internet research, many teachers say they prefer to curate their own primary-source materials online.\\n\\nHow Textbooks are Produced 1 Authors, often academics, write a national version of each text. 2 Publishers customize the books for states and large districts to meet local standards, often without input from the original authors. 3 State or district textbook reviewers go over each book and ask publishers for further changes. 4 Publishers revise their books and sell them to districts and schools.\\n\\nStill, recent textbooks have come a long way from what was published in past decades. Both Texas and California volumes deal more bluntly with the cruelty of the slave trade, eschewing several myths that were common in textbooks for generations: that some slave owners treated enslaved people kindly and that African-Americans were better off enslaved than free. The books also devote more space to the women's movement and balance the narrative of European immigration with stories of Latino and Asian immigrants.\\n\\nAmerican history is not anymore the story of great white men, said Albert S. Broussard, a history professor at Texas A&M University and an author of both the Texas and California editions of McGraw-Hill's textbooks.\\n\\nHere is how the politics of American history play out in California and Texas textbooks, on subjects like race, immigration, gender, sexuality and the economy.\\n\\nWhite resistance to black progress is covered differently in the two states. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Continuity and Change, California, P. 505 California notes the suburban dream of the 1950s was inaccessible to many African-Americans. McGraw-Hill, United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 436 Texas does not.\\n\\nCalifornia and Texas textbooks sometimes offer different explanations for white backlash to black advancement after the Civil War, from Reconstruction to housing discrimination in the 20th century.\\n\\nSouthern whites resisted Reconstruction, according to a McGraw-Hill textbook, because they did not want African-Americans to have more rights. But the Texas edition offers an additional reason: Reforms cost money, and that meant higher taxes.\\n\\nWhole paragraphs on redlining and restrictive deeds appear only in the California editions of textbooks, partly as a result of different state standards. Texas' social studies guidelines do not mention housing discrimination at all.\\n\\nCalifornia Texas Takeaway Texas says that white Southerners opposed Reconstruction because of tax increases as well as racial resentment. California instead includes primary-source quotations from black historical figures about white resistance to civil rights. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Growth & Conflict, California, P. 586; McGraw-Hill, United States History to 1877, Texas, P. 555 Both states say that breaches of racial etiquette led to lynchings after Reconstruction. But only California, whose edition was written more recently, makes clear that the perpetrators of lynchings also hoped to discourage black political and economic power. HMH, American History: Reconstruction to the Present, California, P. 245; HMH, The Americans: United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 288\\n\\nNevertheless, Kerry Green, a high school social studies teacher in Sunnyvale, Tex., a small town east of Dallas, said she discussed redlining with her 11th graders, adding it as a counterpoint to lessons about postwar prosperity — the optimistic story of consumerism, television and the Baby Boom that is emphasized by her state's standards.\\n\\nMs. Green said she preferred to assign primary sources that encourage students to explore history on their own. But she said she would welcome textbooks that contain more historical documents and a greater diversity of voices and themes from the past.\\n\\nThe textbook companies are not gearing their textbooks toward teachers; they're gearing their textbooks toward states, she said.\\n\\nOn gender and sexuality, California textbooks include history that is not in Texas editions. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Growth & Conflict, California, P. 624 California states that the federal government failed to recognize nonbinary gender identities and female leaders in its early relations with Native Americans. McGraw-Hill, United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 111 Texas does not mention gender roles or gender identity in its discussion of efforts to Americanize Native Americans.\\n\\nIn Texas textbooks, mentions of L.G.B.T.Q. issues tend to be restricted to coverage of events in recent decades, such as the Stonewall uprising, the AIDS crisis and debates over marriage rights.\\n\\nBut for recent California editions, publishers wrote thousands of words of new text in response to the FAIR Education Act, a law signed by Governor Brown in 2011. It requires schools to teach the contributions of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and disabled Americans.\\n\\nPeppered throughout California books are passages on topics like same-sex families under slavery and early sex reassignment surgery in the 1950s — text that does not appear in Texas versions.\\n\\nCalifornia Texas Takeaway California states that enslaved women faced sexual violence from owners and overseers. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Growth & Conflict, California, P. 449; McGraw-Hill, United States History to 1877, Texas, P. 443 California mentions the lavender scare that targeted thousands of gay men and lesbians. Pearson, United States History: The Twentieth Century, California, P. 486; Pearson, United States History: 1877 to Present, Texas, P. 456. California states that Alfred Kinsey's research and early sex reassignment surgeries challenged the postwar ideal on gender. Pearson, United States History: The Twentieth Century, California, P. 498; Pearson, United States History: 1877 to Present, Texas, P. 470. Both states focus on women's fight against discrimination in the workplace. Only California says birth control played a role, by allowing women to exert greater control over their sexuality and family planning. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Continuity and Change, California, P. 627; McGraw-Hill, United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 525.\\n\\nStephanie Kugler, an eighth-grade history teacher in West Sacramento, Calif., said she had expanded an idea mentioned briefly in her classroom's textbook, about women who dressed as men to fight in the Civil War and continued to live as men, into an entire lesson on troops who today would be considered transgender. The students read accounts of those soldiers' lives alongside more traditional sources, such as letters written by a black Union soldier and a Confederate soldier.\\n\\nHer goal, Ms. Kugler said, was to make it really authentic to talk about diversity in the context of each historical period.\\n\\nWhile both states devote many pages to the women's movement, Texas books, in general, avoid discussions of sex or sexuality.\\n\\nImmigration and nativism are major themes in American history textbooks. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Continuity and Change, California, P. 736 California includes an excerpt from a novel about a Dominican-American family. McGraw-Hill, United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 609 In the same place, Texas highlights the voice of a Border Patrol agent.\\n\\nMichael Teague, a Border Patrol agent, is featured in the Texas edition of McGraw-Hill's 11th grade textbook. He discusses his concerns about drug trafficking and says, if you open the border wide up, you're going to invite political and social upheaval.\\n\\nMr. Teague's story is featured at the end of a chapter on recent immigration, alongside accounts from a Vietnamese immigrant and a second-generation Mexican-American.\\n\\nThat section in the California edition of the same book is devoted to a long excerpt from the novel How the García Girls Lost Their Accents, by Julia Alvarez. It deals with intergenerational tensions in a Dominican-American family.\\n\\nIn a written statement, McGraw-Hill said the full-page Border Patrol narrative was not included in the California edition because it would not fit beside the literary excerpt. And at the time the Texas edition was produced, six years ago, state standards called for students to analyze both legal and illegal immigration to the United States.\\n\\nIn contrast, California textbooks are more likely to note when a historical figure was an immigrant. And they include more detail on the role immigrants such as Japanese and Filipino farmworkers played in labor movements.\\n\\nCalifornia is one of many states to ask teachers and textbooks in recent years to cover the contributions of specific immigrant groups, including Asian-Americans, Pacific Islanders, European-Americans and Mexican-Americans.\\n\\nCalifornia Texas Takeaway Only California states that Levi Strauss was a German Jewish immigrant. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Growth & Conflict, California, P. 416; McGraw-Hill, United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 417 California tells the story of Wong Kim Ark, whose 1898 Supreme Court case established birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants; Texas's edition, which is older, does not mention this case, but does cover the Chinese Exclusion Act. HMH, American History: Reconstruction to the Present, California, P. 247; HMH, The Americans: United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 289\\n\\nThese additions are part of the reason California books are almost always longer than their Texas counterparts.\\n\\nCalifornia's Board of Education adopted an expansive 842-page social studies framework in 2016. Two years later, Texas' school board streamlined its social studies standards, which are now laid out in 78 tightly compressed pages.\\n\\nCritics of California's approach say that making state standards and textbooks longer and more inclusive can be overwhelming to teachers trying to move quickly through hundreds of years of material.\\n\\nBoth states emphasize the role of big business from the Gilded Age to the present. HMH, American History: Reconstruction to the Present, California, P. 160 California is critical of wealth inequality and the impact of companies like Standard Oil on the environment. HMH, The Americans: United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 235 Texas is more likely to celebrate free enterprise and entrepreneurs like Andrew Carnegie.\\n\\nTexas policymakers feel strongly about giving students a positive view of the American economy; since 1995, state law has required that high school economics courses offer an emphasis on the free enterprise system and its benefits. That emphasis seems to have made its way into the history curriculum as well.\\n\\nCalifornia's curriculum materials, by contrast, sometimes read like a brief from a Bernie Sanders rally. The yawning gap between the haves and have-nots and what is to be done about it is one of the great questions of this time, says the state's 2016 social studies framework.\\n\\nAs a result, California textbooks are more likely to celebrate unionism, critique the concentration of wealth and focus on how industry pollutes the environment.\\n\\nCalifornia Texas Takeaway California refers to the income gap and explains that changes in tax structures and safety-net programs and higher costs for education, child care, and housing played a role. Both state editions discuss economic inequality in reference to the Occupy Wall Street movement and the decline of labor unions. Pearson, United States History: The Twentieth Century, California, P. 728; Pearson, United States History: 1877 to Present, Texas, P. 687. The older Texas edition highlights additional Republican critiques of President Barack Obama's environmental policies, while the California book discusses the threat of rising sea levels. Pearson, United States History: The Twentieth Century, California, P. 749; Pearson, United States History: 1877 to Present, Texas, P. 709.\\n\\nBoth the California and Texas 11th-grade textbooks from Pearson state, The main argument against environmental legislation is that it hurts the economy and the nation's industries.\\n\\nThe Texas edition goes further to highlight criticism of federal efforts to subsidize the green energy industry: Republicans accuse the government of wasting taxpayers' money, for example by supporting the failed solar manufacturer Solyndra. The Solyndra controversy was a fixation for conservatives in 2011, when the company went bankrupt after accepting half a billion dollars in federally guaranteed loans.\\n\\nThe Texas book also states that American action on global warming may not make a difference if China, India, Russia and Brazil do not also act.\\n\\nThe California edition does not mention Solyndra or the other nations. However, it does include a section on the threat to American states and cities from rising sea levels, noting that the impact on tourism in Florida could hurt that state's economy, and that transportation networks and buildings could be threatened.\\n\\nPearson said in a written statement that the differences between the books could be attributed mostly to the fact that the California book was published several years later, and that concerns over coastal flooding have become more heightened in recent years."}
{"original": "TEXT ME WHEN YOU GET HOME\\n\\nThe Evolution and Triumph of Modern Female Friendship\\n\\nBy Kayleen Schaefer\\n\\n288 pp. Dutton. $24.\\n\\nIn Text Me When You Get Home Kayleen Schaefer recalls a first date — not with a potential romantic partner but with a potential friend. Describing the emotional rush of an evening spent colluding and conjoining, she sounds as if she has a new crush: I related to every single thing she said, Schaefer tells us, reporting that they discussed things I don't typically share with someone I'm just sitting down with for the first time. She gushes to her mother via text the next day: I have a new best friend. … I love her.\\n\\nIn a year that has been described as a women's renaissance, female friendship feels particularly worthy of contemplation. As professional opportunities broaden and cultural attitudes shift, competition between women has given way to allyship. Through the return of women's social organizations and the formalization of whisper networks, female solidarity is more pervasive than ever, a byproduct of girl power and the cumulation of years of quiet rebellion.\\n\\nWomen are stepping up together, loudly and publicly, writes Schaefer, a journalist whose subjects have ranged from the Korean beauty industry to the occult. It seems the world is finally recognizing the power of female connection, which the poet Adrienne Rich once described as the most feared, the most problematic and the most potentially transforming force on the planet."}
{"original": "So effortlessly did Keller glide along life's surface that for a long time few people had any inkling of his personal struggles away from the pool. In the months before the 2004 Athens Olympics, for example, Keller endured a stretch of sleeplessness and malaise that culminated in what his coach at the time, Jon Urbanchek, described as an emotional breakdown.\\n\\nKeller rebounded to deliver one of the signature moments of those Games, holding off the Australian star Ian Thorpe over the final 100 meters of their anchor legs to clinch the gold for the United States in the 4x200 freestyle relay. It was his second medal of the Olympics, and the fourth of five he would eventually claim in his decorated international career.\\n\\nHe later admitted it was a mistake to stick with swimming after his star turn in Greece. In a 2014 interview with NBC Sports, Keller said he regretted that he had not retired after Athens. Around this time, he told a different interviewer, he had entertained the idea of enrolling at Arizona State to study criminology. But unsure of his path, Keller chose to stay with what he knew.\\n\\nIt's not right, but I still probably hold some bitterness toward myself mostly, but also a little bit toward my sport, because I let myself get too deep into it, Keller said at the time.\\n\\nAfter earning a third freestyle relay medal — his second gold — at the 2008 Beijing Games, Keller walked away for good.

{"original": "Why a Priest The number of men studying for the priesthood has plummeted, and the resulting shortage is a major problem for the Catholic Church. But for those enrolled at Mount Saint Mary's Seminary, it isn't the church that has to change -- it's the world. By JENNIFER EGAN Photographs By GRETA PRATT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrayer Break: Michael Dobbins (left) and Brian Bashista in an afternoon ritual.\\n\\natch people's faces when we come in the door, Tom Holloway says. Holloway is a 29-year-old fourth-year Catholic seminarian at Mount Saint Mary's Seminary, and on this stunningly cold winter night, he and six other seminarians have driven to a diner not far from Emmitsburg, Md., where the seminary is situated, to have dessert. Holloway and two others in their fourth and last year, Brian Bashista and Damien Cook, are wearing clerical attire, or clerics, as they call them: black slacks, black shirts, Roman collars. They have already been ordained as deacons; they've made solemn promises of celibacy and obedience, and can perform baptisms and preside at marriages, as well as preach. They will be ordained as priests later this spring. As they enter the diner, a collective awareness seizes the room, much the way it might in the presence of someone famous. People either look up, or resolutely avoid looking up. After the seminarians settle in at a round table, Holloway, a slight, fair-haired man from Peoria, Ill., expands upon the reactions I've just seen -- a phenomenon seminarians refer to as the head-turn effect. Jennifer Egan writes frequently for the magazine. Her last article was about homosexuals in the military.\\n\\nPeople do one of three things, Holloway says. Suddenly they get really nice, and they want you to think they're really good people. Somebody my age, they're calling me Sir. The second one is, people get very stony, like they're mad at you. They just glare. The third one is my favorite: you walk in and they do a double take and they look really scared, like, Why is he dressed like that? He knows my secrets! The sight of a Roman collar, the seminarians go on to explain, can have the power to flush profanity from conversations, douse lovers' fights and halt the scolding of children. Airplane rides are notorious for inspiring long queries from seatmates, Catholic and non-Catholic alike, even when the seminarian isn't wearing clerics; the sight of a breviary is often enough to set things off. (Priests regularly hear confessions on airplanes, I'm told, finding two back seats for that purpose whenever possible.) Jerome Magat, a brainy, energetic 26-year-old of Filipino descent, is a second-year seminarian, so he wears clerics off-campus only when attending a formal, ecclesiastical event or when visiting hospitals, homeless shelters, prisons and schools, which is part of the seminary program. It's that supernatural element, Magat says of the reactions his clerics provoke. There's a mystery about the priesthood. Some of that mystery inheres in the very nature of the Catholic priesthood. A priest is called to be an alter Christus, to stand in the Person of Christ and perform the sacraments, through which grace is conferred by God. Nowadays, though, the distance between the Catholic priesthood and the surrounding culture has given it a near occult mystique. As America hurtles forward unblinkingly into the consumer-driven, technological and environmental unknown, the Catholic priesthood remains becalmed in a zone of otherworldly preoccupations relatively unbuffeted by present-day vicissitudes. Today, as, say, 500 years ago, a man -- and only a man -- who senses he has a vocation, or a call from God to the priesthood, hands over his life irrevocably to the church, promising celibacy and obedience. Now, as centuries ago, he answers to the bishop of his diocese, celebrates the Mass, performs the sacraments and, if he has been appointed a pastor, oversees and maintains the solvency of his parish. (A religious-order priest like a Franciscan or Jesuit makes an additional promise of poverty, and commits his life to his religious community and its particular mission.) In exchange for these sacrifices, a diocesan priest typically receives from his diocese a room, board, a place to retire when he is too old or sick to serve any longer and around $10,000 a year. It is perhaps not surprising that in contemporary America, with its focus on individualism and personal achievement, not to speak of wealth, the number of men seeking out this sort of existence has plummeted. In 1998, according to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University, there were 47,582 active priests in America -- about 10,000 fewer than in 1975. The average age of a diocesan priest is now 58, and nearly a quarter of all priests are older than 70, the average age of retirement. Perhaps no institution in America faces a more severe personnel crisis than the Catholic Church. And it is likely to get worse. The total number of graduate seminarians in America last year was the lowest on record: 2,622, a drop of almost 70 percent from the 8,159 in 1967-8. This decline comes at a time when the number of Catholics in America, where they represent by far the largest religious denomination, has ballooned from 48.7 million in 1975 to 61.6 million today, largely as a result of Latin American and Asian immigration and population growth. The drop in vocations has been under way since the 1970's, when seminaries emptied precipitously, in part because of a disillusionment with celibacy. Meanwhile, families of Italian, Irish and Central European descent -- the old Catholic ghetto that, earlier in this century, was a major source of American priests -- have shrunk in size and risen to the middle class, broadening opportunities for their sons. More recently, the pedophilia scandals of the late 80's and early 90's have been a public relations catastrophe for the church. But those within the church say that the increasingly secular nature of American life has taken the biggest toll on vocations. This is the world of advanced science and physics -- what are priests doing in this world? asks the Rev. Lorenzo Albacete, a theology professor at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers. Those that come into the seminary today are taking a radical stand. They are countercultural.\\n\\nMen in Black: Bashista on campus; with Dobbins in a mall; at Communion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCountercultural is not a word one would readily pin to the amiable, clean-cut young men who are enjoying a rare night out at the diner for ice cream and cheesecake. And yet in America today, a man whose personal heroes are martyr-saints, who invokes God often in conversation, who worries intensely about the poor and believes that contraception and masturbation are always morally wrong is, to put it mildly, outside the mainstream. He stands apart. Sometimes it's hard to talk about Jesus Christ, says Damien Cook, 25, a friendly, Falstaffian-looking deacon from Omaha. I remember in high school, you feel odd bringing Him up. You're told by the culture that Christianity oppresses people. Like all counterculturalists, seminarians and priests can provoke suspicion, even hostility, from a society whose values they seem, by their very presence, to challenge. Seminarians say they're frequently approached by strangers who disagree with the church's position on women's ordination or, more often, celibacy. They go: 'Father, you can't get married, right? Well, I don't agree with that,' Brian Bashista, who is 34 and from Arlington, Va., recounts. You try to explain, but some of them don't want to hear it. Maybe I took offense the first couple of times, but it happens so much that I say, Lord, you must be doing something. Maybe this is an opportunity to try to help teach. Seminarians often confront the suggestion that a high proportion of them are homosexual. Magat, who worked as a health-care consultant before entering the seminary, learned that some colleagues were wondering if he was gay after he divulged his intention to be a priest. At first I felt emasculated, he says. I had a nave view of what people thought about priests; in my home environment and my family, priests are upheld as pillars of the community. In fact, there is a concern among some within the church that the proportion of gay men entering the priesthood has risen sharply. Magat and Bashista claim that they are not aware of gay men at Mount Saint Mary's, but say that it shouldn't matter if some seminarians have homosexual inclinations, since anyone seeking to become a Catholic priest, straight or gay, is striving to live a celibate life. The conversation drifts to another, darker presumption about the sexuality of priests. Magat recalls an encounter he had recently in a supermarket. I was standing in line in my clerics, he says. The woman in front of me was checking out her groceries, and her young son in the shopping cart, probably 2 or 3, he was kind of looking at me, interested. I waved and said, 'Hi, how's it going?' and she pulled him out of the cart and away from me. I was just mortified. Despite the high profile of the scandals involving the sexual abuse of minors by Catholic priests, there is no evidence that the incidence of sexual misconduct is greater among priests than among clergy of other denominations or the population at large. But this is of little comfort to Catholic clergy or parishioners -- nor is it likely to alter the widely held perception that men who choose to live celibate lives have psychological problems they wish to conceal. This perception is not lost on the seminarians. Magat was dating a woman before he entered the seminary, but he avoided telling her that he was considering a vocation until the last possible moment. I was afraid, he says. If I decided not to go to the seminary and I'd told her in advance, then I'm out of the vocation and I'm out of her. Because I knew she would have dropped me like a hat. For a long time, Bashista says, he was critical of the fact that priests cannot marry, and celibacy was a big impediment for many years as he struggled with the idea of becoming a priest. I really felt that I was called to be a father and a husband, he says. I thought that was why I was placed on earth. There was a girl I dated in college -- we'd even had talks about getting married. Bashista's initial aversion to celibacy is widespread among men of his generation, according to Dean Hoge, a professor of sociology at Catholic University. In a 1985 study of college men, Hoge concluded that making celibacy optional, as it is for Eastern Orthodox and Protestant clergy (celibacy has been required of Catholic priests only since the Second Lateran Council in 1139), would increase the number of candidates fourfold. So far, though, the church hierarchy has shown no interest in such a reform, and with the exception of Bishop Raymond A. Lucker of New Ulm, Minn., who called in a pastoral letter last fall for a dialogue on celibacy, very few American bishops have spoken publicly on the issue. A former architect who practiced for seven years before entering the seminary, Bashista would have been an anomaly 30 years ago, when nearly three-quarters of entering seminarians were under 25. But today he is the norm; 86 percent of seminarians are older than 25 when they enter, and 16 percent are older than 40, meaning that -- with four years of theology in front of them, often preceded by a year or more of pretheology and sometimes interrupted by a mandatory year of ministry or reflection -- some will be 50 or older by the time they become priests. The student body at Mount Saint Mary's includes a doctor, a concert pianist and several military officers -- evidence of the rising number of second career priests who embarked upon secular lives after college, but then experienced spiritual epiphanies that upended those lives and remade them. Tom Fesen, 30, a deacon from Trenton, took a job after college at Chemical Bank in New York, where he commuted each day from his home in New Jersey. There were two buses; one came too late and one came too early, he recalls. So I came early. The bus dropped me off across the street from a church, so I decided, I'll go into this church, get a little peace of mind. Mass would be about 20 minutes. So six months into this, the reader left, and the priest came up to me and said, 'Do you want to read during Mass?' I said: 'No, I don't want to. I'm just here a little early.' Immediately after that, he said, 'Well, do you want to be a priest?' I was so irritated, Fesen continues. Where does he come off? I'm going to be a banker; get married; 2.5 kids, house in the suburbs, dog. But after that I couldn't get the thought out of my mind. Bashista regards celibacy as a crucial aspect of his priesthood, which will not be a job so much as a way of life -- a marriage to the church. 'Some days I'll think: What if I was back at the architecture firm? Would I be a partner now? Married? Have kids?' he says. 'But the match has been made.'\\n\\n\\n\\nFesen's story -- of having his vocation acknowledged by someone else before he knew it himself -- is one you hear repeatedly from seminarians, many of whom fell away from the church at some point in their lives. Michael Dobbins, 32, a husky, mirthful deacon from Arlington and therefore a D.B., or diocesan brother, to Bashista, had the sort of childhood that might have resulted in a fairly direct journey to the priesthood in a prior era. I played Mass as a kid, he says. My sisters were the altar boys. My dad had this old copper chalice for his beer on football Sundays, so I used that. And Wonder Bread, something white, you'd press it down flat and use a glass to cut a circle out. I wasn't very clear on the vestments, so I used a big bedspread. In college, though, Dobbins stopped going to a Catholic church and began attending a Baptist church instead, where he became involved with a Baptist woman. At one point in college, he was briefly engaged. In my last year, he recounts, I was reading my Bible, and I got to John 6. At the end it says, 'And some of his disciples no longer followed him.' I'd read that a thousand times before, but something in that passage hit me like a big brick. And I was like, holy cow -- that's me. I cried like a baby. For some, the conversion experience rescued them from paths that Holloway refers to, in his own case, as serious darkness and sin. A onetime actor and a singer in an alternative-rock band, Holloway had dropped out of college and was living with fellow musicians when his parents persuaded him to attend a weekend conference devoted to the Virgin Mary. At the end, the keynote speaker invited all of those who believed they might have vocations to approach the stage. Holloway remembers: I had an interior experience almost as if Our Lady was standing behind me with her hands on my shoulders, leaning down to say, 'If you will put your vocation in my hands, I will take care of all the things you consider obstacles.' My heart was pounding. And I found myself climbing over this balcony and going down there.\\n\\nne afternoon last November, I went with Bashista to Arlington, and we visited the two-story suburban house where he grew up and where his parents still live, from which his father, an electrical engineer, commutes to his job at the Naval Research Lab in Washington. Modest and immaculate, with lots of carpeting and an abundance of pink and mauve in the decor, the Bashistas' home veritably thrummed with the quiet, vehement faith of his mother, Aileen, who looks like Bashista only fairer, with pale blue eyes and gold-rimmed glasses. Hefty painted statuettes of Christ and the Virgin Mary stood before a window in the kitchen, and in the living room, near a graduation photo of Bashista smiling over a giant bow tie, there was a small table covered with lace, where holy water, candles and a relic -- a bone of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, the first American-born saint -- were on display. I always prayed that the Lord would take my sons to be His holy priests, Aileen Bashista told me. You know it's nothing you deserve. It's God's gift. Bashista's younger brother, Christopher, a drummer until a car injury left him unable to play, now a senior at George Mason University who lives at home, had a different reaction: relief. Mom got her priest, he said. Aileen Bashista makes weekly visits to Seton High School, where Bashista's younger sister, Mary-Beth, is a senior, to teach rosary making. She is also a lay member of an order of Carmelite nuns. She prays that Mary-Beth will become a nun too, though she admitted that the possibility seemed remote for her lively, sociable daughter, who is chairman of her prom committee. He seldom knocks us off a horse like he did Paul, Aileen reflected. If we're always listening to rock music or doing homework and busy with worldly things, you seldom get to hear our Lord. Enough, said Mary-Beth. Brian Bashista's upbringing was not intensely religious, and he and his older brother, John, now married and a father, attended public schools. My mom and dad were not always so strong in their faith, Bashista explained. John and I were never altar boys. When he was in junior high school, his mother plunged more deeply into Catholicism and pressed her son Brian to do the same. In her fervor, it wasn't necessarily an invitation, he said. It was: 'You need to do this. It will help you.' John and I were teen-agers, and we both resisted. 'Say the family rosary, Mom, are you kidding? I'm going out with friends.' These memories may partly explain Bashista's scrupulous effort never to sound overbearing or judgmental. Propose, not impose, is a phrase he often repeats. Lead them to the truth, don't slam them with it. That's not the way Jesus did it. Bashista is more judgmental when describing his own life before he entered the seminary. Our Lord gave me everything I ever wanted, he recalled. I worked for the firm I wanted to work for, I had a lot of friends. But I was my first priority, and if being nice to people helped me, then I did it. I was engrossed in the office gossip: Oh, we shouldn't be saying this, but loving every minute of it. I'd go buy clothes. You don't want to wear the same pants or shirt in one week. ... Are you kidding? I'd get extremely frustrated over the stupidest things, getting ink on a new white $70 shirt and going ballistic.\\n\\n\\n\\nDobbins prepares publicity material for an anti-abortion march.\\n\\nUnderneath, he said, there was a real spiritual poverty. I felt a sense of loneliness and emptiness. Bashista's disquiet culminated one night five years after he'd graduated from college: I was in my apartment, and I was so confused and unhappy. I just felt broken. I was in tears. That night, he said, he turned to God: I said: Lord, I have no other roads to exhaust. I'm going to make a sincere effort to live as You've called me to live. After that night, thoughts of the priesthood began once again to visit Bashista, and finally he made a furtive visit to a chancery office in Charlotte, N.C., where he lived at the time. I thought, I'll just get a book on priesthood, find out what it's all about, he recalled. So the receptionist said, 'Well, let's go up to the library.' Then a priest walked by, and the receptionist goes, 'Wait a minute, that's the vocation director!' I just got a chill. I said, 'Father, I have this friend, ...' and I bombarded him with an hour and a half of questions. At the end he goes, 'You have an awfully inquisitive friend.'  Still, Bashista resisted: My response was not yes; it was, I'll consider it. I call it my one-sided argument with Our Lord; it was about four months long. I said, 'I don't have to be a priest to be holy.' Finally the response came: 'You're right, but this is what I call you to.' And then that was it, I knew I'd lost. Not lost, but won. I'd won the life. Immediately I said, 'Yes.' I was just flooded with peace. The process known as discernment, by which a seminarian determines whether the call to the priesthood is real and lasting, continues until the day of his diaconate ordination, when he makes the promises of celibacy and obedience. On the wall of Dobbins's room is a photograph of his and Bashista's diaconate class four years ago; Dobbins has pasted smiley-face stickers over the heads of the 10 -- out of 42 -- who have left. Some are not actually gone; they're taking pastoral or spiritual years required by their dioceses, or have joined religious orders; others are now married and fathers, including one of Bashista's former roommates. Bashista's views on celibacy have changed. Now he regards it as a crucial aspect of his priesthood, which will not be a job so much as a way of life -- a marriage to the church. (Some priests actually wear wedding rings after their ordinations.) Some days I'll think: What if I was back in the architecture firm? Would I be a partner now? Married? Have kids? he said. But the match has been made. One reason I had thoughts of marriage with this one girl was that connection, that longing to be with this person. And then that feeling was not sustained. It was strong, it was present, but it wasn't deep. And this is deep. I really feel like I'm in love. I'm engaged, and I'm getting ready to get married.\\n\\nn a bright, crisp afternoon last fall, I joined all 159 Mount Saint Mary's seminarians outside McSweeney Hall, the seminary's main building, an eccentric, gabled edifice made of slabs of thickly grouted granite, perched midway up a hill among a patchwork of farms and woods. We boarded buses and rode an hour and a half to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, where the seminarians had been invited to view an exhibit of religious artwork from the Vatican Museums. Mount Saint Mary's is the second-largest seminary in the country, after Mundelein Seminary in Illinois, and is also among the most conservative -- scrupulously adherent to the magisterium, or teaching authority, of the Pope. A man seeking to become a diocesan priest must first be accepted to a diocese, whose bishop usually underwrites his education and chooses the seminary where it will take place; bishops appointed under Pope John Paul II tend to be morally conservative, upholding the Pope's stringent views on such controversial topics as contraception and the ordination of women. But conservative at Mount St. Mary's does not mean sour or grim. A mood of buoyant optimism surges among the men -- a sense, accurate or not, that the bad times are over for the priesthood, and something new and momentous is in the making. There was a period of confusion and uncertainty after the Second Vatican Council, even going into the 80's, the Rev. Kevin Rhoades, the cheerful rector of Mount Saint Mary's, told me. But now we've had 20 years of a very strong pontificate. I think we're at a new era, and these men represent it. Among liberal Catholics, including liberal priests -- many of whom regard John Paul II as authoritarian and reactionary -- there is the perception that new seminarians like those at Mount St. Mary's are rigid and narrow-minded, merely parroting the Pope's views without learning to think for themselves. Certainly there is a passionate devotion to the Pope among the men of Mount St. Mary's. They often quote him -- in particular the phrase, Be not afraid. Bashista put it this way: We're the John Paul II generation. That's a great sign of hope. But at the gallery, the seminarians scrutinized Medieval and Renaissance paintings with a feverish -- and sometimes wistful -- attention to the past, a past that still pertains directly to their lives. Raphael Hall, 42, one of five seminarians at Mount St. Mary's from the Franciscan Missionaries of the Eternal Word in Birmingham, Ala., moved about the gallery in a brown Franciscan habit, the beads of a long wooden rosary clicking softly from his cord belt as he searched for works by Fra Angelico, a 15th-century Franciscan painter who would have dressed almost identically. There were chalices and vestments on display -- the very items that Bashista and the other deacons were in the process of choosing before their ordinations. (It is customary for family members or friends to pay for a seminarian's gold or silver chalice, the cup in which wine and water are believed to be transformed into Christ's blood, and whose essential role in a priest's life is likened to a doctor's stethoscope.)\\n\\n\\n\\nA Mother's Dream: The Bashistas with their son the future priest.\\n\\nThis was the cover of a tax book, one seminarian remarked to me, as he looked at a painted Annunciation by Giovanni di Paolo. Then he added, That's how much religion was a part of life. In mainstream America it is no longer so; indeed, for a young man pursuing a life of celibate devotion to Christ, the world outside the seminary is a minefield of temptations and distractions. Tom Holloway, the former alt-rocker, said once, Every morning when we get out of bed, there's a war going on, and we're right in the middle of it. The world threatens in a multitude of ways; even something as simple as grocery shopping can pose hazards. Lots of magazine covers don't reach Christian modesty, Magat said. I have to pretty much stare straight ahead -- there are half-naked women all over the place! The world threatened, too, during the White House sex scandal, when seminarians had to grapple with whether to read the sexually explicit Starr report. Many did not; some who did went to confession afterward. All whom I spoke to said they prayed for the President, though politically they deplore his support for abortion rights. (In general, their opposition to abortion drives them to the right politically, but not without misgivings -- the Republicans, in their view, do not show enough concern for the poor.) To protect themselves from visual affronts, seminarians employ what they call custody of the eyes. Bashista explained this concept: You just look down. You don't have to make a big deal of it. It's playing with fire. Sometimes these images will bombard your memory. If he begins to feel aroused, Bashista said, you have to channel that energy in productive ways. Doing something for someone else. If you're looking at ladies, getting some thoughts or ideas, just refocus. And yet, many of these men were reared on popular culture and find it difficult to give up. On a lot of TV shows, you know married couples are contracepting, Magat said. And any time Jerry hooked up with some girl in 'Seinfeld,' we knew they were sleeping together. . . . Should I find these things funny? This is the stuff I'm going to be preaching against! Magat stopped watching Seinfeld, but kept track of what was happening on the show to the very end from nonseminary friends. For a long time, Michael Dobbins was a devoted fan of James Taylor. I went to several of his concerts and I had his T-shirts, his CD's -- I was taking guitar lessons so I could learn to play his songs, he said. Then I began to realize that a lot of his lyrics are like, peace, love and butterflies are free -- whatever goes. But whatever goes really isn't the truth, you know? And finally one day I'm listening to this James Taylor concert on the radio, and he says, 'This is a hymn to the goddess Gaya.' I don't know who the goddess Gaya is, but that's not my God. I was just like, That's it. Click -- stopped the radio. Went over to the closet, pulled out my concert shirts and threw them in the trash can. Pulled out my James Taylor CD's -- dunk. See ya, James. Magat summed it up this way: You have to detach from these things, or you become numb to them. We're trying to live as a sign of contradiction in the world. But living as a sign of contradiction is not the same as retreating from the world altogether, and the seminarians struggle to achieve what they regard as the ideal balance: being in the world but not of it, a phrase they often repeat. They see themselves as witnesses -- testifying through their very presence and clerical attire to the Catholic Church and all that it holds true. Bashista provided an example: in the gym at Mount Saint Mary's, college students sometimes play music whose lyrics he finds objectionable. It's an opportunity, he said. It's a time to evangelize. You don't go up and rip the tape out, but you say: 'Can you share with me some of those words? I'm not sure I'm hearing them right.' A lot of times they don't even know what the words are. It's got to be proposing, not imposing, which is the tougher way. It's our Lord's way. Witnessing is crucial, say the seminarians, because the world is starving for the message they represent. And here lies the crux of their sense of mission, and the optimism that fuels it: the so-called freedoms of our secular and relativistic culture have not paid off, they insist; on the contrary, they have created a dangerous and uninhibited world where families are ravaged by divorce, abortion, addiction and violence. Someone who chooses something they know is destructive, that's not freedom -- that's slavery, said Bashista. Freedom is knowing your choices and then choosing the truth. There is another reason to resist being of this world -- not just for seminarians but also for all fervid Catholics. This world is not the end, Bashista reminded me. That communion we're seeking will happen in the next life. Heaven is the subject of rich fantasy among the seminarians; they imagine it as a place unfettered by limitations of time or space, where they will meet and love the many anonymous strangers they pass each day in restaurants and highways. Jim Crisman, a seminarian from Denver who taught for a time in Slovakia, recalled one day: I'd go to a 4:00 Mass every day in Slovakia, and I'd see the old women coming in. I couldn't communicate with them. And I was thinking, I don't know anything about them, but I will someday. This isn't the last time that I'll see them.\\n\\nweek after the museum trip, I joined the seminarians for Mass, which is at 7:00 each morning in Immaculate Conception Chapel, whose putty-colored walls are trimmed with gold and turquoise, and which smelled that morning of incense and after-shave. Many seminarians had been praying in the chapel since 6:15; prayer forms the core of the seminary experience, and the men talk about their prayer lives the way most people talk about their love lives. At times their prayer is strong, full and deep (some seminarians call this feeling the warm fuzzies); at others it is dry and without feeling, reverberating an emptiness through their lives. After morning Mass and breakfast, the seminarians attend classes, which include moral theology, philosophy, scripture and church history. During their fourth year, they practice celebrating the Mass and hearing confession, often from recent graduates, who return to campus and play the penitents, inventing sins for seminarians to hear. The Rev. Mark Moretti, one such volunteer who is now an associate pastor in Alexandria, Va., explained the purpose of such role playing: Are you able to judge what you're hearing? Are you able to give a suitable penance? If you have a little old lady coming in to confess her sins and you hammer her with a novena -- a penance lasting nine days -- you're too extreme. Bashista and the other deacons' first class this day was Marriage and Family, where seminarians were learning to prepare betrothed couples for marriage. After the class recited the Our Father, the teacher, Sister Paula Jean Miller, got down to business: the topic of the day was the theology of sexuality. Drawing on Pope John Paul II's theology of the body, Miller explained that total self-donation, or self-gift, is the goal for human relationships -- and also a way of explaining why married people should not use contraception. Sexual intercourse is a cause of grace within the sacrament of marriage, Miller said. Just as the Father gives himself totally to the Son and the Son gives himself back totally to the father, that's the standard of love for us. Contraception is a holding back of some very critical aspect of ourselves, of who I am. It's saying to you, I want you but I don't want your fertility, at least not right now. And the goal is total self-gift. (Actually, a majority of Catholic theologians disagree with this position.) Only in the last 30 years has the concept of self-gift come to coexist with procreation in the Catholic Church as the criterion for the moral rightness of a sexual act, according to Richard McCormick, professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame. Self-gift, the seminarians are taught, can be used to explain what is wrong with masturbation (it involves no giving to another), lust (it involves taking rather than giving, thus reducing one's partner to the status of an object) and homosexuality (the other is not other, and thus self-gift is not really possible). That an intricate discussion of sex and morality was being conducted by 40 men and one woman who have taken vows of celibacy is a stark reminder of a major difficulty facing the Catholic Church in America: how can a celibate clergy persuade sexually active lay people to allow the church to regulate their sex lives? For while American Catholics tend to believe and accept the church's teaching on most doctrinal issues, according to Gallup polls, more than 80 percent of them, in defiance of doctrine, approve of artificial contraception, two-thirds say that premarital sex is morally acceptable (among Catholics under 35, the figure is as high as 9 out of 10), nearly half say that homosexual activity can be morally acceptable and roughly half say that abortion (excluding late-term partial birth abortions) should be legal in many or all cases. In addition, most American Catholics would support a married clergy, and most approve of the notion of female priests. 'Any time Jerry hooked up with some girl in ''Seinfeld,'' we knew they were sleeping together,' Magat says. 'Should I find these things funny? This is the stuff I'm going to be preaching against!' Magat stopped watching 'Seinfeld,' but kept track of what was happening to the very end from nonseminary friends.\\n\\n\\n\\nDiocesan priests, as liaisons between the church hierarchy and the laity, are caught in a morality gap between the two -- asked to promote unpopular views that in many cases they themselves do not share. According to a 1994 Los Angeles Times survey, nearly half of American priests believe that birth control is seldom or never wrong; even more say the same of masturbation. As a result, few Catholics hear preaching on touchy sexual issues on any given Sunday. This is about to change, say the seminarians at Mount Saint Mary's -- they have every intention of preaching on these topics, and some deacons already have done so in the parishes they were assigned to last summer. If people had the great opportunity we have to learn and to pray and to study, Bashista said, maybe they would come to a consensus with what the church is teaching and think of the beauty of it rather than the Thou Shalt Not. And that is our obligation: to preach and to teach the truth in charity and in love, and to be patient. After asking permission from his pastor, Cook preached against contraception in the parish he was assigned in Omaha, Neb., last summer. I was nervous, he recalled. If I hadn't really prayed on it and done it in a way that I think was not overbearing. ... I said: 'What is the nature of marriage? To give of oneself.' I didn't use the word 'contraception' until the end. People came up to me afterward and said: 'No one ever preaches on that. Thank you.'  Holloway gave me a tape of a lecture he delivered to teen-age boys, in which he told them: Let me be perfectly clear. Sometimes people just won't say this: masturbation is always a seriously disordered act. . . . In itself, it is always wrong. He urged the boys to confess their sins, and afterward, I was told, they did, lining up in scores outside the confessionals. And if they hadn't? If you preach on these topics, you're going to endure a wrath, Bashista said. But if you are indeed teaching the truth -- what the church is saying, that has transcended time -- Christ says, you're going to endure ridicule. Because He did.\\n\\nn a sunny Saturday, I rode with Bashista from Mount Saint Mary's to Blessed Sacrament, the parish in Arlington where he served last summer and now spends two weekends each month. We drove in the low-slung gold Honda Civic that he purchased during his architecture days, and I asked Bashista what has become of that old egotistical, materialistic version of himself. It's there, but it's been transformed, he said. St. Paul said, I'm a new creation. The old self is dead. And in a sense that's true. Now, Bashista said, the energy he once spent serving his own interests is directed toward other people who need his help, both in prayer and in deed; like most seminarians, he keeps lists of people who have asked him to pray for them, or else he prays for them in the moment of promising to do so. According to the Pope's theology of the body, the passionate intensity of sexual love is also the model for celibate love -- the total self-donation of a priest to his people. The needs of the sick and the poor are a particular focus; there is perhaps no setting in America -- neither the halls of government nor the campuses of elite colleges anymore -- where you hear the poor evoked more often, and more sympathetically, than in a Catholic seminary. At Blessed Sacrament, Bashista checked in with the pastor and made some last-minute adjustments to his homily, which he would deliver at Mass that evening. (In contemporary Catholicism, the sabbath begins on Saturday night.) Then he stopped at the chapel to pick up our Lord -- that is, the consecrated Hosts, which he carries to Inova Alexandria Hospital in a gold-plated cylinder called a pyx. At the hospital reception desk, Bashista was given a printed list of Catholic patients to whom he would offer Communion. First we headed for intensive care; he had been told there was a parishioner from Blessed Sacrament there. As usual, Bashista wore his clerics and Roman collar; when people he passed in the hospital halls met his eye, he smiled and said hello, and when they avoided his gaze, he let it pass. The woman in intensive care, who appeared to be in her 50's, was attached to a respirator. It hiked up her chest every few seconds and injected air into her lungs with a gasping noise. Her skin was deeply jaundiced everywhere but her hands, which were bright purple. Bashista stood close to the woman and leaned over her. When he spoke her name, her eyelids parted and she looked up at him. Bashista introduced himself and asked how she was feeling, but she couldn't speak; the respirator attachment filled her mouth. He leaned close and took one of her plum-colored hands in his. You've got a good strong grip, he said. A priest had told Bashista that the woman felt close to a guardian angel, whom she had named. Father told me about Emily, Bashista said now. She's a sweet little angel. She's with you, too. You're not suffering alone, O.K.? We're suffering with you. The woman watched him desperately over her bucking chest. She could not take Communion because of the respirator, so Bashista offered her a spiritual communion instead. He placed the heel of his palm against her forehead and spread his fingers to encompass the front of her skull. As he prayed aloud, she closed her eyes. Watching this, I remembered something Bashista told me once: If the church is your bride, intimacy is what you have caring for the sick. You're giving of yourself, and it's being received. There is nothing more gratifying. When the prayer was done, the woman relaxed into her pillow, as if some tension inside her had been set free. After some minutes, Bashista gently extricated his hand from hers. I'll be back in two weeks, he told her. You'll probably be home by then. I'll come find you. Afterward, he told me: If this life were all there was, I couldn't do that. Suffering and pain are senseless if there's not an afterlife. This woman might see Jesus face to face tonight, and don't get me wrong -- he chuckled -- life is wonderful, it's a gift from God. But we're pilgrims here. This is not our home. Later, the bright, modern church in Arlington was packed for 5:00 Mass, which features 11 white-gloved parishioners, known as dingers, ringing hand bells, and seven singing children. A sprawling, populous complex that serves 3,600 families and runs an elementary school, Blessed Sacrament has a pastor, three associate priests and Bashista, reflecting a bounty of vocations in and around Arlington that is out of keeping with the general trend. Bashista assumed at first that he would join a diocese in greater need of priests, he said, but in that process, some doors open, other doors close. The match seemed to be in Arlington. Bashista may spend as many as 15 years as an associate pastor, whereas in priest-starved dioceses like Denver, where Crisman will be ordained, a new priest might be placed in charge of a parish as soon as two years after ordination -- thrown into a vast organizational and fiscal job (parishes are financially independent, though they may borrow money from their dioceses) that can put a great deal of pressure on an inexperienced priest. After the Mass, parishioners gathered around Bashista and the other priests outside the church. Several complimented Bashista on his homily. One woman had a little boy with her who was afraid to make his first confession; would Bashista talk with him? A young drummer with an Army band thought he might have a vocation; Bashista promised to send him some information. A number of people asked him to pray for them, and he always assented -- and asked them to pray for him, too. (Later, he recorded the names of new parishioners he had met in a small book to help him remember them.) When they'd all gone, Bashista unvested, returning the white alb and patterned green dalmatic to their hangers in the vestry. Clearly, the Mass and the meeting with parishioners afterward elated him. I'm in the honeymoon phase, he said. But what you're seeing is the future -- I wouldn't be here if I didn't believe that. Others in the church anticipate more conflict. The Rev. Richard McBrien, a professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame, told me that the shortage of American priests would deepen the division between clergy and laity. What happens now is that people shop, he said. They go where they can get the best Mass, the best music, the best sermons. But when the day comes that there aren't enough good priests left, I think the people are absolutely going to demand from the government of the church that they have married priests. Progressive Catholic organizations hope that the successor to John Paul II will be less authoritarian and more collegial -- the true spirit of Vatican II, they believe. There is talk of the resentment many bishops are said to feel toward John Paul II, who has centralized authority at their expense. (He treats bishops like altar boys is a phrase I heard more than once from liberal priests and nuns.) Will the man chosen to be the next Pope be willing to give bishops greater autonomy -- thus opening the door for discussion of other changes, like relaxing the moral doctrine and even reconsidering celibacy and the role of women? Whatever happens, the Catholic laity may well continue do as it thinks best in the moral sphere. American Catholics have matured, says William D'Antonio, a research professor at Catholic University. Vatican II has succeeded. The real documents of Vatican II are freedom of conscience and the responsibility of individuals not to blithely follow the leader. According to the University of Maryland Survey Research Center, more than two-thirds of Catholics say that when their conscience is at odds with the Pope, they should follow their conscience.\\n\\nor the seminarians at Mount Saint Mary's, there is little question about what will ultimately happen. We already know the end of the story, Bashista says. God will triumph. The church will triumph. That doesn't mean that the present trials aren't there. Think of fourth-century Aryanism, when two-thirds of the church, including bishops, didn't believe that Jesus was God! But the threats will never succeed. The essentials will never change. How do we know that? Because Christ said so. Still, they admit, the sheer magnitude of what they're up against in their wish to transform a largely indifferent world can be crushing at times. I always think of 'Cliffhanger,' says Magat, referring to the Sylvester Stallone thriller. They have to climb up the cliff with no ropes, going backward. That is our life. There's a lot of skepticism out there, a lot of cynicism. The easiest thing is to say, Forget it, this is not my responsibility. Let someone else do it. And I think that's what a lot of guys are saying when they don't answer the call to the priesthood. Bashista keeps a folder titled Thanks Be to God, in which he places any cards or letters he receives describing the impact he has had on people's lives. When he mentioned the folder to the others at the diner that winter night, each admitted that he, too, was amassing a similar file. There may come a day when I say, Was this all worth it? Holloway explained, as dessert was cleared away. What am I doing here? Has this made any difference to anybody? And if I ever come to that, I'm going to open the folder on that day. And if I get to the end of my life without ever having opened it, that'd be awesome.\\n\\nNEXT ARTICLE\\n\\n\\n\\nSunday, April 4, 1999\\n\\nCopyright 1999 The New York Times Company"}

He supported the black power movement in the '60s and '70s and voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980; his conservative turn, he says, was the inevitable reaction to liberal hypocrisy. Clips of Anita Hill testifying at Thomas's confirmation hearings in 1991 appear in the second half of the film, after the filmmakers have taken care not to disturb their admiring portrait of Thomas as a faithful Christian and doting family man. Hill's recollections of sexual harassment get predictably cast as part of a feminist smear campaign designed to destroy him.\\n\\nBut the overriding tenor of this documentary is triumphant and upbeat. Thomas's journey is intermittently visualized by footage from inside a boat as it makes its way through marshy wetlands before arriving, just as the sun is setting, at a sturdy dock.\\n\\nIf Created Equal is trying to promote the conservative cause, it does so gently, and blandly. The only moment of mild discomfort occurs when the filmmakers ask Thomas about the end of his first marriage. The otherwise voluble Thomas signals that he'll be having none of it, turning momentarily awkward and taciturn: Yeah, it was, you know, you live with it.\\n\\nCreated Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words\\n\\nRated PG-13 for the unavoidable segment on sexual harassment.

The Magnificent Ambersons, Orson Welles's 1942 feature — his second, after Citizen Kane — is one of the most crushing stories in cinema: not because of the movie itself, though it's extraordinarily moving, but because the studio lopped off Welles's original ending and shot a rushed, unconvincing coda. Even an untrained eye can spot the moment when the visual pizazz (courtesy of the cinematographer Stanley Cortez) suddenly stops. The missing footage, if ever located, would be an archivist's holy grail. And despite being compromised, Welles's adaptation of the Booth Tarkington novel routinely ranks among the greatest movies ever made. The moment when Tim Holt's character gets his just deserts (George Amberson Minafer had got his comeuppance. He'd got it three times filled and running over) features some of Welles's best voice-over work.\\n\\n212-529-6998, citycinemas.com/villageeast\\n\\nOZU IN COLOR at the Metrograph (May 27-31).

{"original": "I often wrote about my experience as a mixed-race young adult for class, but would keep these essays hidden from all but the instructor and my grandmother. In one of my grandma's magazines, I discovered the book Black, White, Other — a seminal text for mixed-race scholars of my generation. It was my first purchase from Amazon, the company my uncle soon left the nest to work for. One cousin was bound for art school, another for music school, and I was bound for nowhere but knew I wanted to write.\\n\\nIt would take me years to realize this dream, through a marriage and divorce, undergraduate and grad school — until, at age 38, I packed my bags and moved to Los Angeles.

I told her to go back to bed, but she couldn't make sense of my words without her hearing aids. Instead, she repeated the nonsense phrase she thought she heard: Go that to said?

{"original": "NORSE MYTHOLOGY\\n\\nWritten and read by Neil Gaiman\\n\\n6½ hours. Harper Audio.\\n\\nAdmit it: Wouldn't you love to have Neil Gaiman come to your home and read stories to you? Yeah, you would. Or I would anyway. Ideally in one of those glass-ceilinged igloos in some Scandinavian country. Specifically, I'd like him to read from the material that has so deeply informed the otherworlds of his phenomenal fiction: the Norse myths, those ancient and weird tales.\\n\\nGuess what. You can.\\n\\nIn Norse Mythology, Gaiman brings voice to the old myths so viscerally that listening to the audiobook every night for a week, I thought my bedroom might explode into Valhalla. Here are hammer-handed Thor and one-eyed Odin, tricky Loki, and the mighty goddesses Freya and Idunn. In fact the entire Norse pantheon, including dwarves and giants and demons, plays out as vividly as a novel or film. Honestly I may have to order a breastplate of some sort. As Gaiman puts it in the introduction, the stories feel like a journey from the ice and fire that created the world to the fire and ice that end it.\\n\\nThere is a difference between reading a book and listening to stories, a difference amplified to epic proportions in the case of Norse Mythology. I knew it immediately when all of the hairs on my arm shot up during the retelling of how Odin lost his eye when he traded it for a sip from the well of wisdom. My theory was confirmed when my 16-year-old son passed by my bedroom door one night and could not stop himself from coming in to listen — for an entire hour. Hearing a story aloud, you are seduced by the wonder of an ancient oral tradition.\\n\\nFrom the opening origin myths — about Yggdrasil, a life tree with three roots in three worlds, and the driftwood logs that give rise to the first humans, Ask (named from the ash tree) and Embla (named from the elm) — I was struck by the differences between the stories I'd learned as a child raised Catholic (it didn't take) and a creation story in which humans spring from trees. Hearing again that we might imagine ourselves born of the natural world, an idea shared by many pre-Christian indigenous cultures, made me feel briefly less hopeless."}

She built the mansion on the Rue du Faubourg St.-Honoré that is now the American Embassy. On returning to New Orleans in the 1840s, she oversaw the design and construction of the Pontalba Buildings, two red-brick rowhouse complexes flanking the Place d'Armes, which was renamed Jackson Square after Andrew Jackson at her instigation. One of the chief features of the French Quarter, the rowhouses established the fashion for iron railings throughout the old city."}
{"original": "michael barbaro\\n\\nFrom The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.\\n\\n[music]\\n\\nToday: Why the story of Harry and Meghan matters. It's Thursday, January 23. Mark Landler, looking at the headlines and your byline, I've been wondering how it's been for you over these last few weeks to go from the Brexit beat to the Megxit beat?\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nWell, I guess the first reaction I had was that it's kind of interesting that after 27 years at this newspaper, I have risen up to the exalted position of being a gossip reporter.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nMark Landler is the London bureau chief for The Times.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nBut as I dug into it more and more, I realized that for all the soap opera quality to Harry and Meghan, this story actually does have a deeper dimension and a deeper context.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nHm. And Mark, where in your mind does this story begin?\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nWell, I think it really begins with a fairy tale.\\n\\narchived recording [HORNS]\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nYou have to go back to May of 2018 and the wedding of Prince Harry and his American bride, Meghan Markle. And on one level, this wedding had all the elements that one would expect from a royal wedding.\\n\\narchived recording [SINGING]\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nIt was held at Windsor Castle in the chapel of St. George. The chapel where it was held is actually also the resting place for English kings that literally go back centuries. The couple left afterwards in an open-top carriage. And so you had all of this majesty and pomp. And yet on another level, you had some elements that were strikingly new and different.\\n\\narchived recording [SINGING] Stand by me.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nYou had, for example, a gospel choir —\\n\\narchived recording [SINGING] So darling, darling, stand by me. Ooh —\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\n— that sang Stand By Me during the service.\\n\\narchived recording [SINGING] Hey, yeah. Stand by me. Stand by me.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nYou had an African-American bishop —\\n\\narchived recording (michael bruce curry) Now in the name of our loving, liberating, and life-giving God.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\n— delivered a homily in which he quoted Martin Luther King.\\n\\narchived recording (michael bruce curry) — once said, and I quote, We must discover the power of love.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nThere are a dazzling array of celebrities.\\n\\narchived recording 1 Idris Elba. archived recording 2 Idris Elba, massive celebrity. archived recording 3 Oprah Winfrey.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nOprah Winfrey.\\n\\narchived recording This is a surprise. I don't think people were expecting her. But she is here.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nSo you had this ceremony that really was both a throwback to the grandest old ceremonies of the British royal family and then something genuinely new. And at the center of all of it was this beguiling person, this figure of Meghan Markle.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nAnd what made her, in your words, so beguiling?\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nWell, a couple of things. First of all, she's an outsider. She's an American marrying into the British royal family. But beyond that, she's a very particular type of American.\\n\\narchived recording (meghan markle) I'm Rachel Zane. I'll be giving you your orientation.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nShe's a television actress.\\n\\narchived recording (meghan markle) Good, you've hit on me. We can get it out of the way that I am not interested. archived recording No, I'm sorry —\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nShe's three years older than Prince Harry. She's divorced. She's self-supporting. She's a professional woman. But really above all, she is biracial. She has a white father and an African-American mother. And that, more than anything else made her a very different, very radical new member of a family that really hasn't changed much for centuries.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nAnd Mark, how are the British people thinking about all this and thinking about her as they watch this wedding?\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nWell, among young people, there was just a jolt of excitement. You had this vision of a young person coming into the royal family, which just by itself was exciting. The queen, after all, is in her 90s. Prince Charles, the next king, is in his 70s. And then there was the nature of this person coming into the family.\\n\\narchived recording Their relationship is doing a lot to change the views that, like, the younger black generation will have. Because when I was growing up, I would never have thought this would happen.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nYoung people thought of her as perhaps a vehicle for changing an institution that at some level they revered but probably thought of as somewhat outmoded. But —\\n\\narchived recording I'm just very dubious —\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\n— then there are the older generation.\\n\\narchived recording — that somebody who's made her life in those sorts of films, been married before, comes over and has to become an active member of a very, very traditional family. I, I think that could be quite difficult.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nAnd for them, Meghan Markle was a challenging figure.\\n\\narchived recording She's had a completely different life. She didn't really know the British royal family, or how it operated, or what her life would be like. And she is clearly used to being her own woman, operating —\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nAll the things that made her exciting to young people made her to older Brits more of a threat to the fabric of the royal family, a family they revere as embodying the best of Britain and the greatest times in British history.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nAs understood by a certain type of Brit?\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nIndeed. As understood by someone who thinks of British history in the most traditional way.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nAnd how does this attitude begin to manifest itself?\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nWell, fairly quickly after the wedding. There had been this rapturous coverage of the ceremony. But really within weeks, you began to see coverage and headlines in the British tabloids that started taking a slightly harder, meaner look at Harry and especially at Meghan. And it's worth pointing out quickly that the tabloids are, across the board, conservative publications. These are papers that really play to very traditional ideas of the meaning and the value of the monarchy. So what you begin to see are a series of articles. Some are actually asking valid questions about the lifestyle of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.\\n\\n[music]\\n\\nFor example, during one summer, they took two flights on vacation on private jets. And this raised a reasonable question. Prince Harry's a major campaigner for climate change.\\n\\narchived recording You can't lecture us and the rest of the world on climate change when you're taking private planes everywhere. And this was their —\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nAnd the newspapers pointed out that taking these private jet flights left an enormous carbon footprint. Also, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle embarked on a very expensive renovation of the cottage that they were gifted by Queen Elizabeth on the grounds of Windsor Castle. This is known as Frogmore Cottage. And the couple authorized a $3 million renovation that was paid for by taxpayer money.\\n\\narchived recording She's a multimillionaire from her time as a Hollywood actress. He's a multimillionaire from all the money he's had over the years. Two multimillionaires asking the British public, the taxpayer, to contribute 2.5 million pounds to renovate an entirely different property to the one that they'd been offered, I think is a bit awful and the crucial point as well.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nAnd while some of that was perhaps legitimate, you also began to see just a more petty flavor to the coverage. And it's really perhaps most visible if you look at the coverage of Meghan Markle side by side with that of Kate Middleton, who married Prince Harry's brother, William.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nThen what does that show?\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nWell, for example, The Express covered a very similar incident, which is both women talking about their love of avocados. And the two headlines tell the tale. In the first headline about Kate, it says, Kate's Morning Sickness Cure. Prince William Gifted with an Avocado for Pregnant Duchess. Same story, same newspaper about Meghan Markle, and the headline is Meghan Markle's Beloved Avocado Linked to Human Rights Abuse and Drought. Millennial Shame.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nIt's like literally the polar opposite take on the exact same piece of fruit.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nIt's very hard to actually be that radically different about an avocado. But the British press figured out how to do it. While this is at some level humorous and not extremely serious, it did over time bleed into more sinister types of coverage of Meghan Markle, really around her mixed racial background. So you began to see descriptions of her in the press as, quote, exotic, or headlines that said that Harry's new girl is quote straight outta Compton. In other words, portraying Meghan as a coming up from the mean streets of Los Angeles. And so there is an element of it that is deeper, and more problematic, and gets at out-and-out racism. And certainly portraying her not just as an entitled millennial, but as an altogether more threatening figure.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nSo you're seeing this kind of more conservative aspect of Britain and their view of Markle reflected in the British press.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nThat's right. But it isn't just the press, because there is another very conservative institution here, one that is perhaps even more important. And that's the House of Windsor itself. And Meghan Markle, by all accounts, has a very difficult introduction to the family. There are many reports that Kate Middleton is not particularly welcoming to her new sister-in-law. There is a sense that she is simply not being approved of, her lifestyle. There is a family event where one of the older aunts shows up wearing a brooch that is interpreted as a racial slur against Meghan. And Harry begins to feel a sense of aggrievement on behalf of his wife. And that then causes a rift between Harry and his brother William. One of the first tangible examples of this is when Harry and Meghan announced that they want to move out of Kensington Palace, which they share with Kate and William and his family, and move into their own place. And you begin to see more and more evidence of distance between Meghan and Harry on the one hand, and everybody else in the family on the other hand. So all of this culminates when the couple go on a long tour of southern Africa —\\n\\narchived recording [CHEERING] It was a journey through Africa, but not always the one they expected.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\n— and they bring along a television journalist who they're close to, Tom Bradby, who's making a documentary about this trip. And he has what turns out to be a remarkably revealing interview with each of them during the course of the trip.\\n\\narchived recording (meghan markle) When I first met my now-husband, my friends were really happy because I was so happy. But my British friend said to me, I'm sure he's great, but you shouldn't do it, because the British tabloids will destroy your life.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nSo Tom Bradby asks Meghan Markle —\\n\\narchived recording (tom bradby) I don't know what the impact on your physical and mental health of all the pressure that you clearly feel under —\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\n— how are you doing? Are you O.K.? And she looks visibly moved, visibly emotional.\\n\\narchived recording (meghan markle) You add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed, it's um — yeah well, I guess. And also thank you for asking, because not many people have asked if I'm O.K. But it's, uh, it's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nBradby follows up by saying, would it be fair to say she hasn't been O.K.? And Markle thinks about it for a moment and replies —\\n\\narchived recording (meghan markle) Yes.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nWow, so telling the world, in what sounds a little bit like a cry for help, I am not doing O.K.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nAnd that is very much the way it's interpreted. And I think also, it's the way that Meghan Markle intended for it to be interpreted. She knew she was going to be asked that question. I don't think there was anything accidental about the reply, nor do I think anyone misinterpreted who she meant when she said not many people have asked if I'm O.K. By that she meant members of the royal family. But it doesn't end there.\\n\\narchived recording As this journey wore on, another human story emerged — [CHEERING] — of a man still wrestling with the legacy of his background, of his birth, and the tragic death of his mother.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nTom Bradby then has a very emotional interview with Prince Harry, where he says a couple of things. One, he says that his grief for his mother Diana is still a wound that festers.\\n\\narchived recording (prince harry) Every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear click, every single time I see a flash, it takes me straight back.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nAnd so then later he tells Bradby that he's also grown distant from his brother William.\\n\\narchived recording (prince harry) Part of this role and part of this job and this family being under the pressure that its under, inevitably, you know, stuff happens. But look, we're brothers. We'll always be brothers. We're starting on different paths at the moment. But I will always be there for him and as I know he'll always be there for me.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nHe's openly acknowledging a rift between them. And that is a very powerful thing. Because remember, for the British public, these two brothers are imprinted in memory as the young boys who walked together behind their mother's casket after her death. And so to hear Harry openly acknowledge what perhaps people whispered, that's a very, very big deal in terms of both the emotional dynamic within the royal family, but also the image the royal family has with the British public.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nSo this all seems to set the stage for what happens next.\\n\\narchived recording Tonight, the surprise announcement from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle reportedly blindsiding the queen. After returning from a long trip to Canada, they say they intend to step back as senior members of the royal family.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nThat's right. It sets the stage for what is an epic breakup between Harry, and Meghan, and the royal family, and really between Harry and Meghan and the British people.\\n\\n[music]\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nWe'll be right back. So Mark, what does happen next in this story?\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nWell, so this is the part of the story that most people know. The couple spend several months thinking and planning their new life. They talk it over with members of the royal family. Buckingham Palace slow rolls them, tells them to take their time. It has to be thought through. It's complicated. The tabloids, particularly The Sun newspaper, get wind of the fact that they may be leaving the country. And suddenly, they decide to tell the world that they have this plan for a new lifestyle, and all hell breaks loose.\\n\\n[music]\\n\\narchived recording 1 And I got some breaking news. And it is about Harry and Meghan and a statement — archived recording 2 In a statement, they said, We have chosen to carve out a progressive, new role within this institution. archived recording 3 We intend to, and here is the key bit — step back as senior members of the royal family — archived recording 4 — and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty, the Queen. I mean, it's virtually a letter of resignation, isn't it? archived recording 5 Harry and Meghan didn't consult with any of their relatives before releasing that statement, meaning even their closest family members had no idea how this was going to work. archived recording 6 Buckingham Palace is now in crisis after it was blindsided by Prince Harry and wife Meghan's announcement.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nAnd a few turbulent weeks later after a lot of tense negotiations —\\n\\narchived recording How you could spend half your time in North America and still continue to honor your duty to the queen, the Commonwealth, and all your patronages, I do not know. It is literally impossible to do so.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nThey have actually gone ahead and started this new life.\\n\\narchived recording A smiling Meghan was seen out for a walk with her son and the couple's dogs in leggings and boots. No need to follow a royal dress code.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nSo they pulled it off.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nThey pulled it off. Not without a lot of heartache, and a lot of pain, and a lot of controversy. But in the end, by acting as precipitously as they did, they managed to force the palace to deal with something that it really would have preferred to put off indefinitely. So they really forced the issue successfully.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nAnd in brief, what does this mean about their status within the royal family? How did that shake out? Are they still royals?\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nWell, they are still royals. Prince Harry is still a prince. He's still sixth in line to the throne. They still have the titles of His Royal Highness and Her Royal Highness. But in a very big concession to the queen, they agreed to stop using those titles. They've also agreed to repay the cost of renovating their cottage in England. And they've also importantly agreed to give up direct public funding of their activities. So it's a real break. And it truly does not only liberate the couple, but it will impose some pressure on them to earn enough money to finance a lifestyle that is, by anyone's account, very extravagant.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nMark, what has been the reaction inside Britain to this seismic disruption to the royal family?\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nWell first of all, it's enthralled and riveted the country —\\n\\narchived recording 1 One British newspaper today dedicated the first 17 pages of its edition to this announcement. archived recording 2 Yeah. This is — archived recording 3 —amazing.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\n— with days of banner headlines and breathless TV coverage. But the reaction has very much broken along familiar generational lines.\\n\\narchived recording 1 I understand why Prince Harry and Meghan have done it. I think you can see Prince Harry obviously, his wife is just getting hounded by the press, often in racially dodgy ways. And you go, of course he doesn't want any part of it. I can completely understand that. archived recording 2 If Harry's happy and Meghan's happy, that's all that matters.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nAmong young people, there was a great deal of sympathy for Harry and Meghan. Among the older generation, it's been very different.\\n\\narchived recording All you can say is that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are behaving like spoiled brats, totally entitled —\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nThere's a sense that Prince Harry and Meghan exploited the goodwill of the queen. They blindsided Buckingham Palace by putting out their announcement the way they did, and also that they kind of want to have it both ways.\\n\\narchived recording Robert on email says, if Harry and Meghan want to relinquish their royal status, then get on with it. At the moment, they're behaving like self-indulgent rich kids being supported by the taxpayer. They want to have their cake and eat it.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nIt confirms some of the worst suspicions that people had about Meghan Markle as this relationship first began.\\n\\n[music]\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nMark, at the start of this conversation, you promised that you would tell us why all this matters beyond the human drama, and what it reveals about Britain. So here's your chance.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nYou're right, I did promise that. And here's the greater significance. Harry and Meghan are not just leaving Britain at any old time. They're leaving Britain at the very moment that Britain is leaving the European Union, that it is finally carrying out Brexit.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nAnd I think this timing is crucial to understanding how this debate is playing out in Britain. Because as you see the country charting a new identity, casting off from Europe, there's a great deal of uncertainty, of uneasiness about the future of this country. What kind of a role will it play in the world? Will it be diminished? Will it be isolated? What will the post-Brexit Britain look like? So at this time of national uncertainty, there is a yearning for symbols. There's a, a sort of an urge to reach out to things that symbolize British history and the immutability of the British idea. And there's no greater symbol of that than the monarchy.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nAnd so this idea, that suddenly this brilliant young couple — this shining symbol of the future of the monarchy — would wind up turning their backs on it, and leave Britain, comes at a particularly vulnerable moment for the British people. And as it turns out, the people who are hardest on Meghan Markle are also generally the people who voted for Brexit. And it's one of the great paradoxes of this story. That their resistance to Meghan Markle — their complicity in making her life miserable — has led to this outcome that has convulsed the royal family, has threatened an institution that these people care so deeply about. So I think that's the importance here. It's not just a debate that breaks down along generational lines. It's a debate that breaks down very much along Brexit lines. Did you vote for staying in the European Union or for leaving? How you voted in that case weighs very much in how you feel about Harry and Meghan.\\n\\n[music]\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nSo the same forces that pushed for Britain to leave the E.U., and are now craving its greatest symbols of nationalism in the form of the monarchy, they are the same forces who have inflicted all of this on Meghan and on Harry. And perhaps driven them to leave the monarchy, to weaken the monarchy. It's a, perhaps, classic case of getting what you wanted until you realize that it's not really what you wanted.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nThat's right. And in that regard, it's a lot like the Brexit debate itself. The people who voted to leave imagined some greater Britain. But instead, they may wind up not only with a much diminished country, but with a much diminished monarchy.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nMark, thank you very much.\\n\\nmark landler\\n\\nThank you, Michael.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nWe'll be right back. Here's what else you need to know today.\\n\\narchived recording (adam schiff) Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, Counsel for the President, and my fellow House Managers —\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Democratic House impeachment managers began laying out their case to senators for convicting and removing President Trump from office, accusing him of a corrupt scheme to pressure Ukraine into tarnishing his political rivals.\\n\\narchived recording (adam schiff) If not remedied by his conviction in the Senate and removal from office, President Trump's abuse of his office and obstruction of Congress will permanently alter the balance of power among the branches of government.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nWhile the Senate has so far refused to allow for witnesses, the House impeachment managers brought them to the floor anyway in the form of video clips of current and former officials who have already testified before the House, including former National Security Council official Fiona Hill and European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland.\\n\\narchived recording (gordon sondland) Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing the investigations of the 2016 election, D.N.C. server, and Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the president of the United States. And we knew these investigations were important to the president.\\n\\nmichael barbaro\\n\\nAt one point, the Democrats even played a clip from President Trump himself.\\n\\narchived recording — if foreigners, if Russia, if China, if someone else offers you information on an opponent, should they accept it, or should they call the F.B.I.? archived recording (donald trump) I think maybe you do both. I think you might want to listen. I don't, there's nothing wrong with listening. If somebody called from a country, Norway, we have information on your opponent. Oh, I think I'd want to hear it. archived recording Do you want that kind of interference in our elections? archived recording (donald trump) It's not an interference. They have information. I think I'd take it.\\n\\nmichael barbaro"}
{"original": "To the Editor:\\n\\nRe President Repeats Threat to Target Cultural Sites (news article, Jan. 6):\\n\\nPresident Trump has threatened retaliation against Iran by striking Iranian sites including some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture. If carried out, this threat would constitute a war crime under international instruments such as the 1954 Hague Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, which the United States has joined. The American military has a proud history of avoiding intentional damage to and destruction of cultural sites, which began with President Abraham Lincoln's law of war manual, known as the Lieber Code.\\n\\nCultural heritage represents the record of our shared human achievement, the surviving remains from the past and the places that are sacred to the present. Protected cultural sites include religious and historic structures, cemeteries, libraries, archives, museums and archaeological sites.\\n\\nThe Department of Defense Law of War Manual specifically prohibits acts of hostility … directed against cultural property in the absence of military necessity. Now, the president is threatening to target cultural sites in Iran whose rich cultural heritage spans from the earliest evidence of human domestication of plants and animals to ancient majestic Achaemenid cities and richly tiled Islamic shrines and mosques. Iran is home to 24 World Heritage Sites and thousands of other places that are part of our global shared heritage.\\n\\nThe world community, including the United States, has rightly condemned the intentional destruction of cultural heritage for decades. Hitler's Germany, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Islamic State and the Assad regime in Syria intentionally destroyed cultural heritage in the absence of any military necessity. If Mr. Trump carries out this threat, the United States will join the ranks of these destroyers of the world's cultural legacy."}

They join forces once again and find themselves being den mothers to a hungry young gang at the bottom of the criminal pecking order in Naples, a circumstance that jibes with the show's penchants for junk-strewn locations and ragged formations of motorcycles.\\n\\nThe season starts strong, purring like a well-tuned Ducati, and a stand-alone episode portraying Ciro's temporary exile in Bulgaria (following further gunplay at the end of Season 2) is a prime example of the show's moody, violent romanticism. The energy runs out around the fifth episode, though — the protestations of brotherhood start to sound rehearsed, and the inevitable web of betrayals and bloodshed feels engineered, more outcome-based than character-based. The soundtrack by Mokadelic, with its sensation of a constantly gathering storm, is called on to supply emotion rather than reinforce it. With any luck, Season 4 (almost three years old at this point) will arrive soon and make things better. (HBO Max, Thursday.)\\n\\n'Losing Alice'\\n\\nThis eight-episode series written and directed by Sigal Avin (#ThatsHarassment), shown last summer on the Israeli cable channel HOT, is an ambitious and sometimes absorbing attempt to do something a little different. Avin plays with the conventions of the psychosexual thriller and the backstage drama: Alice (Ayelet Zurer of Munich), a filmmaker who could use a hit, and her actor husband, David (Gal Toren), find themselves collaborating on a darkly erotic script by a young, seductive and possibly sinister writer, Sophie (Lihi Kornowski of False Flag). (A significant character is named Nomy, in what feels as if it must be a shout out to Showgirls.)\\n\\nWhile Alice's and David's fixations on Sophie begin to expose the cracks in their marriage, Alice investigates whether the movie they're making replays violent and possibly criminal events in Sophie's life. The action of Losing Alice, including extensive and authentic depictions of the filmmaking process, flows into and out of scenes from the finished film-within-the-film and Alice's increasingly fevered imaginings. The symbolism can be ripe (rats figure prominently), and some of the plot twists feel mechanical, but Avin pulls off long, complicated scenes few TV dramas would attempt, and Zurer keeps you focused on the smart, sensual and shrewdly manipulative Alice, who is Sophie's equal in every way.

We ended up spending the next two evenings and nights together. Hopeful that we might actually make it stick, I stayed in touch, even once I figured out that he had already — before his visit — entered another relationship. He wrote me heartfelt, regret-filled emails and assured me that he was working on extricating himself from this Plan B. After connecting on and off for months via email, text and phone, I learned not only that he had entered a relationship but also that it was with an old flame, and that he slipped an engagement ring on her finger well before came to see me. I feel great pain and sympathy for his fiancée, who has been as betrayed and disrespected as I have. We are both victims; he selfishly stole a year of my life and caused me emotional trauma sure to haunt me forever, and she is probably preparing to enter a marriage that will be defined by lies. She just doesn't know it. I want this woman to walk down that aisle with her eyes open; but there's a part of me that wonders whether I am just seeking revenge. How do I tell the difference, and where do I draw the ethical line between assuaging my anger and protecting her future? Name Withheld\\n\\nImmanuel Kant begins his Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals by declaring that the only thing that can be called good without qualification is a good will.

But beyond the Kantian worry — that your desire to do the right thing is enmeshed with a desire for revenge — is a psychological one: Your pain and outrage could hamper your assessment of what you ought to do.\\n\\nWe speak of mixed motives as if they were a special case and our motives were normally pure. Maybe it's the other way around. In this instance, you're justly angry about what your ex has done. (I leave aside the issue of whether you have reason to reproach yourself for your own conduct: continuing to pursue a relationship with someone who, you'd learned, was in another one.) Still, it's important that, if you share your experience with the fiancée, you do so out of concern for her and not out of hatred for him. Which makes it important, in turn, that you ask yourself whether telling her will really be for her own good.\\n\\nYou're assuming, of course, that she doesn't already know of his behavior. Either way, she'll no doubt suspect your motives. But then you, too, suspect your motives. One way to make an assessment is to ask yourself whether, had the situation been reversed, you would have wanted to be told by the other woman. Am I right to think that you would? If you tell her your story and she then proceeds with the wedding — perhaps after a confrontation and a resolution — it would presumably be with a clearer sense of what she is letting herself in for: She would be marrying him with a fuller appreciation of his faults, and if the marriage doesn't work out, it won't be even partly your fault. But notice that he didn't, in the end, choose to extricate himself; he chose to make a life with her. His betrayal of you is one truth; it is not the only one that matters."}

{"original": "December 20, 1998\\n\\nTHE OVERVIEW\\n\\nPresident Is Impeached and Faces Senate Trial\\n\\nBy ALISON MITCHELL\\n\\nASHINGTON -- William Jefferson Clinton was impeached on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice Saturday by a divided House of Representatives, which recommended virtually along party lines that the Senate remove the nation's 42d President from office.\\n\\nA few hours after the vote, Clinton, surrounded by Democrats, walked into the South Lawn of the White House, his wife, Hillary, on his arm, to pre-empt calls for his resignation. The man who in better days had debated where he would stand in the pantheon of American Presidents said he would stay in office and vowed to go on from here to rise above the rancor, to overcome the pain and division, to be a repairer of the breach. Later, Clinton called off the bombing in Iraq, declaring the mission accomplished.\\n\\nClinton became only the second President in history to be impeached. At 1:22 P.M., the House of Representatives, after two days of angry and emotional debate, approved, 228 to 206, the first article of impeachment, accusing Clinton of perjury for misleading a Federal grand jury last Aug. 17 about the nature of his relationship with a White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky. [Roll call, page 32.]\\n\\nIn the noisy House chamber, a lone Republican applauded. Five Republicans crossed party lines to vote against impeachment. Five Democrats broke with their party to support it.\\n\\nThe margin was enough to forestall charges that the President's fate might have been different if the vote were delayed to the 106th Congress, which will have five more Democrats.\\n\\nA second article of impeachment, charging Clinton with obstruction of justice, passed on a narrower vote of 221 to 212. It accused him of inducing others to lie in order conceal his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. This time 12 Republicans voted no, while 5 Democrats voted yes.\\n\\nThe President of the United States has committed a serious transgression, said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader.Among other things, he took an oath to God to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, and then he failed to do so, not once, but several times. To ignore this, he said, is to undermine the rule of law. [Excerpts from the debate, pages 31-32.]\\n\\nTwo more charges against Clinton were defeated. An article accusing the President of perjury in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit was rejected, 229 to 205, with 28 Republicans breaking ranks.\\n\\nAnd the House overwhelmingly rejected, 285 to 148, an accusation of abuse of power stemming from Clinton's legalistic answers to 81 questions put to him by the House Judiciary Committee. Eighty-one Republicans defected from their party. Only one Democrat deserted his.\\n\\nThe Senate would conduct only the second impeachment trial of a President in the 209-year history of the Republic. Clinton will be the only elected President put on trial. Andrew Johnson, impeached and acquitted by one vote in 1868, had been elected Vice President and succeeded to the White House on Abraham Lincoln's assassination in 1865.\\n\\nSenator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, announced just after the House vote that senators will be prepared to fulfill their Constitutional obligations.\\n\\nLott said, There are steps that precede the beginning of an impeachment trial. Once the Senate is organized as an impeachment proceeding, there will be pleadings and motions that come before the taking of evidence. That makes it difficult to determine at this time when an actual trial will begin.\\n\\nThe House acted on a crisp pre-Christmas Saturday when American politics seemed to be descending into the very cannibalism that Speaker Newt Gingrich had warned of when he was toppled a month ago.\\n\\nHours before Clinton was impeached for his efforts to cover up his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, Robert L. Livingston, who had been chosen to succeed Gingrich as Speaker, shocked the House by announcing he would leave Congress because of revelations of his own adulterous affairs.\\n\\nStill, it was Livingston today who called for Clinton's resignation from the House floor. Charging that Clinton had undermined the rule of law and damaged the nation, Livingston said, I say that you have the power to terminate that damage and heal the wounds that you have created. You, sir, may resign your post.\\n\\nAs some Democrats shouted back, You resign, the Louisiana Republican said, I was prepared to lead our narrow majority as Speaker and I believe I had it in me to do a fine job. But I cannot do that job or be the kind of leader that I would like to be under current circumstances. So I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow.\\n\\nWith a sex scandal now consuming one of their own, the House's impeachment debate turned more than ever into a discourse on sin and morality in politics.\\n\\nRepresentative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip, who had helped make Livingston the Speaker-designate and has been one of the fiercest critics of Clinton, choked back tears as he praised Livingston. He said his friend understood what this debate was all about.\\n\\nIt was about honor and decency and integrity and the truth, DeLay said, his voice breaking, everything that we honor in this country. It was also a debate about relativism versus absolute truth. He charged that the President's Democratic defenders would lower the standards of society.\\n\\nEqually passionate, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, said men were imperfect, and he asked Livingston not to resign, for a moment drawing a bipartisan standing ovation.\\n\\nOur founding fathers created a system of government of men, not of angels, Gephardt said, his face reddening with emotion as he spoke.No one standing in this House today can pass a puritanical test of purity that some are demanding that our elected leaders take. If we demand that mere mortals live up to this standard, we will see our seats of government lay empty and we will see the best, most able people unfairly cast out of public service.\\n\\nWhen he finished he walked slowly up the Democratic side of the aisle, Democrats applauding him and hugging him as he moved along. The Republicans remained fixed in their seats.\\n\\nSaturday's votes were the penultimate step in the most serious conflict between Congress and a President since Richard M. Nixon resigned in the face of impeachment and certain conviction on Aug. 9, 1974.\\n\\nBut while that case spun out from a 1972 break-in at Democratic headquarters in the Watergate complex, this began with a murky land deal in Arkansas in 1978. Through the efforts of Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel, under the law enacted in the wake of Watergate, the investigation spread to examine Clinton's affair with an intern.\\n\\nClinton, in a finger-wagging performance last January at the White House, told the nation he did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky. He denied sexual relations with her in a deposition in the sexual harassement case brought against him by Paula Corbin Jones.\\n\\nOnly in August, after it became known that Ms. Lewinsky had preserved a blue dress that provided evidence of their affair, did Clinton tell the nation and a grand jury that he had had an inappropriate relationship with her.\\n\\nRepublicans today took great pains to distinguish Clinton's case from Livingston's revelations that on occasion I strayed from my marriage.\\n\\nRepresentative Henry J. Hyde, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who himself saw a past affair come to light as he presided over the House's nine-week impeachment inquiry, said: Infidelity, adultery is not a public act, it's a private act, and the Government, the Congress, has no business intruding into private acts.\\n\\nBut he said that Clinton had become a Commander in Chief who by lying in legal forums trivializes, ignores, shreds, minimizes the sanctity of his oath of office. Representative Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut said there can be no justice without the truth.\\n\\nDemocrats argued back that the President's actions were wrong and deserved censure but did not rise to the level of impeachment. Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the House minority whip, said Republicans were trying to hijack an election and hound the President out of office.\\n\\nMoments before the impeachment votes, Democrats tried to bring to the floor their own proposal to censure Clinton. But after some debate, their motion was held to be not germane to impeachment and ruled out of order by Representative Ray LaHood, an Illinois Republican whom Speaker Gingrich named to preside over the impeachment proceedings.\\n\\nThe Democrats appealed the ruling, expecting to lose because such appeals are considered a challenge to the right of the majority party to run the House. Their motion failed 230 to 204. Two Republicans, Constance A. Morella of Maryland and Peter T. King of Long Island, broke with precedent and crossed party lines to vote with the Democrats.\\n\\nAs their motion failed, the Democrats briefly marched out of the House chamber in protest. But they returned to vote on the four articles of impeachment.\\n\\nFor one year the Lewinsky scandal has preoccupied the capital despite an immense disconnet with public opinion. Since the scandal became public last January, polls have shown the public opposed impeachment and wanted the inquiry brought to an end. Even on Friday night, after a 13-hour debate, a CBS News Poll of 548 persons showed only 38 percent wanted their representative to vote for impeachment; 58 percent wanted a no vote.\\n\\nThe conflict now enters uncharted seas. The Nixon resignation, for one, cut the matter short, and the Andrew Johnson trial occurred more than 100 years ago, in a different America, one without nuclear weapons or cable television or public opinion polls.\\n\\nDespite Lott's recent assurances that he will move ahead, some wonder whether the Senate may yet flinch from a trial because of the popular will. But Republicans have steadfastly ignored the polls all year.\\n\\nRepresentative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma, the newly elected chairman of the House Republican conference, said in debate today, What's popular isn't always right. You say polls are against this.\\n\\nPolls measure changing feelings, not steadfast principle. Polls would have rejected the Ten Commandments. Polls would have embraced slavery and ridiculed women's rights.\\n\\nYou say we must draw this to a close, Watts continued, I say we must draw a line between right and wrong, not with a tiny fine line of an executive fountain pen, but with the big fat lead of a No. 2 pencil. And we must do it so every kid in America can see it. The point is not whether the President can prevail, but whether truth can prevail.\\n\\nYet, for all of the Democrats' charges of excessive partisanship today, enough Republicans did pick and choose among articles of impeachment to send only two of the four that had come out of the House Judiciary Committee on to the Senate.\\n\\nA number of Republicans said they did not think a perjury charge in Ms. Jones's civil case warranted impeachment, particularly since Clinton's deposition had been held by a judge to be immaterial. Many of them also looked dimly at impeaching the President for abuse of power -- a term taken from the proceedings against Nixon in 1974 -- simply because his answers to 81 questions from the Judiciary Committee were legalistic and evasive.\\n\\nRepresentative David Hobson, Republican of Ohio, said he supported impeachment of the President for lying to a grand jury but not in the Jones case. Even if it's true, I worry whether it rises to the same threshold for impeachment, he said. I didn't want to pile on."}

Even before the inaugural ceremony had finished, Archbishop José H. Gomez of Los Angeles, the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, issued an extensive statement criticizing Mr. Biden for policies that would advance moral evils, especially in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender. Cardinal Blase J. Cupich of Chicago, who is known for his alignment with Pope Francis' social and economic priorities, pushed back on Twitter, calling the statement unprecedented and ill-considered.\\n\\nMr. Biden's priorities reflect values that progressive faith leaders have pushed for, and that motivated many to speak out for him during the campaign, said Derrick Harkins, who led interfaith outreach for the Democratic National Committee this past cycle. There is a sense of moral synergy on the left, among not only progressive Christians but also humanists, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs and the spectrum of faith traditions, he said.\\n\\nThe work now has a chance of really having traction, he said. I'm very optimistic about what can unfold.\\n\\nThe grassroots progressive Christian movement is center stage in Mr. Biden's Washington.\\n\\nUnlike four years ago, when many of the participants in the post-inaugural prayer service were conservative evangelicals or prosperity gospel preachers, this year's Thursday service included a broad array of religious progressives, including two transgender faith leaders. Rabbi Sharon Brous of IKAR, a Jewish community in Los Angeles, prayed for the coming of a new America, one built on love, rooted in justice and propelled by our moral imagination.\\n\\nThe Rev. William J.

But those who've braved Round 2 have been rewarded with sunbeams through parting clouds. The papers are signed, leaving the couple free to move on to other partners (Steven Pasquale for her, Becki Newton for him) and, perhaps more important, to become the better people they somehow couldn't muster in each other's company.\\n\\nIt's almost enough to make you wonder if they've been hasty in calling the whole thing off. Alas, it's not over until it's officially over.

But whatever the show's fate, the Season 2 finale, airing Sunday, March 4, offers a bittersweet denouement. Just don't start dressing that carriage just yet, Mr. Church said in a Times interview.

{"original": "In government, that's radical. A quick caveat here: Helping governmental agencies treat their constituents like customers they hope to retain should in no way be translated as advocacy for the privatization of those functions (as seems to be the desire of the current administration). Rather, government can benefit from public-private partnerships that bring some private best practices into public sector work. Brooks said: Trust is our share price. We don't have market pressure, but we do have to deliver on our promise to care for veterans. We're trying to measure how we're doing with our customers just as the private sector has been doing, so we can quickly make improvements where people are getting stuck.\\n\\nAmber Schleuning, deputy director of the V.A. Center for Innovation and a fourth-generation veteran, never thought she'd work at the V.A. But she began to hear from others she served with, her dad (also a veteran) and his friends about the problems they were having interacting with the system.\\n\\nWe decided we had to do something, she told me. I had this idea of talking to veterans and learning what their issues were. I began to learn about things like human-centered design and started with this smushy idea that we didn't know enough, so let's just start talking to people and build some qualitative data to better understand what's going on here.\\n\\nThis endeavor took human-centered design as its starting point, and Schleuning's use of smushy is appropriate. Human-centered design means designing for people by first understanding what they actually need.

{"original": "Season 2, Episode 8: 'The Kingmaker'\\n\\nYou can take the boy out of Yonkers, but you can't take Yonkers out of the boy.\\n\\nThroughout Billions, we've witnessed Bobby Axelrod, a fearsome hedge-fund billionaire, trying to leverage his way into New York's powerful elite, but to only limited success. Nothing makes him happier than bullying an old-money family off their turf, as he did when he snapped up the naming rights to a performing arts building in the first season. But more often, that same aggression and lust for power and credibility makes him seem gauche, a nouveau riche sleaze who may know how to work the angles on Wall Street, but who doesn't speak the language of high society. For all his diabolical brilliance, he often comes across as a Beverly Hillbilly in designer slacks.\\n\\nThis week's episode, titled The Kingmaker, compares Axe's impetuousness with the patrician calm of Jack Foley (David Strathairn), a man who exemplifies the difference between being wealthy and being rich. (Chris Rock defined the terms memorably, albeit to make a point on race.) In the machine politics of Albany, Foley has both hands on the levers, choosing candidates through favors and old-guard relationships and through back-channel political maneuvering. When Chuck's father chides Chuck for not showing proper fealty to Foley by failing to earn his granddaughter a clerkship, Chuck says: We don't have kings, dad. We live in a democracy. But we can see, as the episode unfolds, that Chuck doesn't really believe that now, if he ever did. His profile as a United States attorney may give his political prospects a boost, but there's no going anywhere in New York Democratic politics without Foley's blessing. And Chuck is fortunate enough to operate in that elite circle.\\n\\nNo matter what Axe does, he will always be on the outside looking in. Even if he were interested in making people forget his working-class roots, the manner in which he earned — and continues to maintain — his billionaire status cannot be forgotten. To a certain extent, Axe knows this already, which is why he delights in wearing a heavy-metal T-shirt to formal occasions, thumbing his nose at New York City royalty. Yet no amount of money is enough for him to buy out Foley's scrap metal supplier, who will lose in penalties, fines, and endless governmental harassment whatever he gains upfront. And while Axe's gambit of arranging an animal conservation honor to present to Foley earns him a meeting, Foley uses the opportunity to make it clear that certain pathways to power aren't available to him. Nice try, but don't bother, Foley effectively tells him. There's nothing for you here.\\n\\nWhile Axe made plenty of mistakes in the first season — he tore his own office down to the foundations in the end — one of the strengths of the second season is that it's willing to expose his weak spots and fallibility. He can plot or buy his way out of many sticky situations, and he always seems a step ahead of other hedge-funders and Wall Street sharks. But he's also impulsive and ego-driven, and his hot temperament sometimes gets the better of him. In this episode, even Wags — Wags! — advises him to cool off a little and stop obsessing over Foley's intervention in the Sandicot deal. When the guy who lustily indulges in vaportinis and an empowering cabaret that celebrates the feminine ideal (i.e. lap dances) tells you to slow your roll, maybe it's best to listen."}

{"original": "I called the police and was connected to the dispatch office in the county where the avalanche had occurred. The dispatcher asked for my husband's name. I told her. Hold on a minute, she said. She returned to the line. Well, we don't have his name right here, she said. I will have the coroner call you back one way or the other. That should have been my clue. Either she didn't want to tell me or she wasn't authorized to deliver the news.\\n\\nThe doorbell rang. I opened the door to the three sheriff's deputies. I managed to speak first. It was him, wasn't it? I said. My voice was barely a squeak. My tears started as they asked if they could come in. One of them was a chaplain, who sat on the couch and confirmed my fears. Much after that is a blur. Many other phone calls were made: to a friend who would come over so I wouldn't be alone; to my parents, who would fly out the next day to be with me. The conversation with the deputies came around to informing Chris's mother. She was in Kentucky. One of them called to Lexington. The police there were busy with New Year's Eve festivities. The deputy called a fire chief, who said he didn't feel comfortable with the task. It was left to me.\\n\\nIt was approaching midnight where Chris's mom lived. I wondered: Should I wait until morning? I dreaded causing her the pain I knew was to come. The wretched cry I had heard from my own mother minutes before would surely be multiplied a hundredfold. For a moment I thought that if I could wait until morning maybe I would think of the right words. There are many gaps in my memories of that night. One comment I do remember was this: I'm a father, one of the deputies said. I would want to know now. I made the call. I told her that, yes, his body had been recovered and passed on the coroner's contact information. She responded with tears and devastation and shared in my disbelief of whether this moment was real.\\n\\nChris's urge to be in the mountains was related to his postwar adjustments, and it became central to his regeneration and health. But I didn't blame the war for his death. His drive to pursue his passions outside of his first career gave me the resolve to do the same. Six months after he died, I left the Army, moved across the country and started medical school. Becoming a physician requires years of intensive practice and study, and in this early stage of my career, I know I should be more concerned with learning drug names or the proper quantity of fluid boluses. Yet it's the act of communicating bad news to patients and their families that I often ponder. I came to medical school having served around violence and trauma, and having already received and given a death notification. I've learned that the worst moments in someone's life can be a haze with few distinct memories. In these moments it matters less what you say than how you say it. People in pain remember compassion, like the compassion I received from the deputies who sat on the couch with me and didn't leave until I was no longer alone.\\n\\nI am trying to apply this lesson as I follow Chris's example, knowing that as an emergency-medicine physician, it's inevitable that I will be informing families about a loved one's death. I don't view this as a dreaded duty. It is part of being human and connecting with others. I want to pass this knowledge on."}

The guardian is often a father or husband, but can be a brother or even a son.\\n\\nThe kingdom's day-to-day ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has vowed to make life better for Saudi women. He defanged the once-feared religious police, who harassed women deemed inappropriately dressed, and last year he lifted the ban on women driving. Saudi women can now attend mixed concerts and pursue careers off limits to their mothers.\\n\\n[Read about the challenges that remained for Saudi women after the driving ban was lifted.]\\n\\nWhen asked about guardianship laws last year, the prince said that Saudi Arabia had to figure out a way to treat this that doesn't harm families and doesn't harm the culture.\\n\\nThose moves have increased his popularity among Saudi women, many of whom say guardianship is not a burden because their male relatives take good care of them. Others escape the rules by seeking jobs in neighboring countries like the United Arab Emirates, where social rules are more lax.\\n\\nBut the system's critics say it gives no recourse to women with controlling or abusive guardians.\\n\\nThat's what sent Nourah, 20, fleeing for Australia. Her father had divorced her mother before Nourah was born, and she was raised mostly by her uncles, she said. Her father sometimes abused her, but her efforts to get help fell on deaf ears.\\n\\nLast year, her boyfriend wanted to marry her, but her family refused because they perceived him as coming from a lower social class, said Nourah, who spoke on the condition that only her first name be used for her safety. Her father began to arrange her marriage to a man she did not know and who wanted to bar her from working. In October, a day before her prospective groom arrived, she ran away."}

{"original": "At its most fundamental, a dinner party is an act of generosity: Come to my place; share my bounty. Of course, it's rarely that simple. Historically, the powerful have used these gatherings to flaunt their resources; social and political intimidation in the guise of hospitality. In the potlatch — a ritual practiced during precolonial times by indigenous tribes of the Northwest Coast, including the Tlingit and the Kwakiutl — the high-ranking host plied guests with enormous amounts of food (like fish oil served via quart-size spoons), often until they threw up. Then he extravagantly gave away his most prized possessions — or destroyed them in a bonfire, just to show that he could. To save face, a guest from a rival village might counter with an even bigger feast.\\n\\nIn the hermetic kingdom of the dining room, the host is at once benefactor and dictator. Alfred Hitchcock planted whoopee cushions on seats, dyed food blue and reversed the order in which courses were served, beginning with dessert, all to toy with guests. Less whimsically, during the Renaissance, the aristocratic Borgias were rumored to poison them. Even without the threat of assassination, a dinner party can feel like a series of psychological tests: the table set with tiny implements of inscrutable purpose, the small talk like needles through the eyes. The Oxford Dictionary of Psychology by Andrew M. Colman includes a listing for deipnophobia, fear of dinner parties — defined as irrational, although I'd argue it's a defensive response to our divided modern times.\\n\\nFor if, as some have argued, dinner parties heralded the dawn of civilization, in this brawling era they might soon hasten its end. Anxiety over forced commingling may explain why the trope of the nightmare feast has taken hold in the imaginations of contemporary artists. In the filmmaker Sally Potter's recent farce The Party, guests are at each other's throats before they down a single hors d'oeuvre. Shattering revelations bring a whiff of hell: I smell burning, a guest says. The vol-au-vents, the hostess sighs, momentarily distracted from her disemboweled marriage. Thomas Adès's opera The Exterminating Angel, which had its American premiere this fall, revisits the surrealist Luis Buñuel's 1962 film of the same title, in which socialites at a posh soiree can't muster the will to leave. They stay, trapped by their own ennui, until food and drink run out, until the mask — of who they strive to be in the presence of others — slips, and they wind up slaughtering a sheep and roasting it over a burning cello. (In uncanny synergy, Buñuel's vision has likewise infiltrated both a musical-in-progress by Stephen Sondheim and David Ives, and Darren Aronofsky's vexed 2017 horror movie, Mother!, which ends in cannibalism and an ugly subversion of the Last Supper.)\\n\\nWhy, then, does it seem as if everybody is throwing dinner parties again? We could glibly dismiss it as an offshoot of the current obsession with food; amateur chefs looking to unleash their inner Yotam Ottolenghi on a captive audience. But these days, when our greatest intimacy is with our iPhones and the spectral kinship of social media has supplanted the immediacy of analog conversation, the true hunger is for earnest connection. And so a new strain of dinner party dispenses with formality in favor of sincerity. Gone are the napkins tortured into swans and the postprandial triage that shunted women to the drawing room while men dealt business. Instead, tables might be strewn with tea lights bought by the hundred at Ikea and dessert might be Klondikes from the corner bodega. In a communal, nigh utopian spirit, guests share in the labor and often bring dishes of their own, rehabilitating the idea of the potluck — which has nothing to do, etymologically, with potlatch: It derives from the 16th-century English pot-lucke, in which unexpected guests made do with whatever was already in the pot. For every dinner party that leaves family bonds and lifelong friendships in smoldering ruins, there is another that unites and reaffirms: Yes, we really like each other."}

{"original": "I\\n\\nThe horoscope was confounding. If the famous guerrilla revolutionary Ernesto Che Guevara was born on June 14, 1928, as stated on his birth certificate, then he was a Gemini--and a lackluster one at that. The astrologer, a friend of Che's mother, did her calculations again to find a mistake, but the results she came up with were the same. The Che that emerged was a grey, dependent personality who had lived an uneventful life. There were only two possibilities: Either she was right about Che, or she was worthless as an astrologer.\\n\\nWhen shown the dismal horoscope, Che's mother laughed. She then confided a secret she had guarded closely for over three decades. Her famous son had actually been born one month earlier, on May 14. He was no Gemini, but a headstrong and decisive Taurus.\\n\\nThe deception had been necessary, she explained, because she was three months pregnant on the day she married Che's father. Immediately after their wedding, the couple had left Buenos Aires for the remote jungle backwater of Misiones. There, as her husband set himself up as an enterprising yerba mate planter, she went through her pregnancy away from the prying eyes of Buenos Aires society. When she was near term, they traveled down the Parana River to the city of Rosario. She gave birth there, and a doctor friend falsified the date on her baby's birth certificate, moving it forward by one month to help shield them from scandal.\\n\\nWhen their baby son was a month old, the couple notified their families. Their story was that they had tried to reach Buenos Aires, but at Rosario Celia Guevara had gone into labor prematurely. A baby born at seven months, after all, is not an out-of-the-question occurrence. If there were any doubts, the couple's story and their child's official birth date were quietly accepted by their families and friends, and remained unchallenged for years.\\n\\nIf that child had not grown up to become the renowned revolutionary Che, his parents' secret might well have gone with them to their graves. He must be one of the rare public figures of modern times whose birth and death certificates are both falsified. Yet it seems uniquely fitting that Guevara, who spent most of his adult life engaged in clandestine activities and who died as the result of a secret conspiracy, should have also begun life with a subterfuge.\\n\\nII\\n\\nWhen, in 1927, Ernesto Guevara Lynch first met Celia de la Serna, she had just graduated from the exclusive Buenos Aires Catholic girls' school, Sacre Coeur. She was a dramatic-looking girl of twenty with an aquiline nose, wavy dark hair, and brown eyes. Celia was well read but unworldly, devout but questioning. Ripe, in other words, for a romantic adventure.\\n\\nCelia de la Serna was a true Argentine blue blood of undiluted Spanish noble lineage. One ancestor had been the Spanish royal viceroy of colonial Peru; another a famous Argentine military general. Her paternal grandfather had been a wealthy landowner, and Celia's own father had been a renowned law professor, congressman, and ambassador. Both he and his wife died while Celia was still a child, leaving her and her six brothers and sisters to be raised by a religious guardian aunt. But despite her parents' untimely deaths, the family had conserved its revenue-producing estates, and Celia was due a comfortable inheritance when she reached the legal age of twenty-one.\\n\\nAt twenty-seven, Ernesto Guevara Lynch was both moderately tall and handsome, with a strong chin and jaw. The glasses he wore for astigmatism gave him a deceptively clerkish appearance, for he had an ebullient, gregarious personality, a hot temper, and an outsized imagination. He also possessed Argentine surnames of good vintage: He was the great-grandson of one of South America's richest men, and his ancestors included both Spanish and Irish nobility. But over the years, his family had lost most of its fortune.\\n\\nDuring the nineteenth century Rosas tyranny, the male heirs of the wealthy Guevara and Lynch clans had fled Argentina to join the California gold rush. After returning from exile, their American-born offspring, Roberto Guevara Castro and Ana Isabel Lynch, had married. Ernesto was the sixth of their eleven children. They lived well, but they were no longer landed gentry. While her husband worked as a geographical surveyor, Ana Isabel raised the children in Buenos Aires. They summered at a rustic country house on her inherited slice of the old family seat. To prepare his son for a working life, Roberto Guevara had sent him to a state-run school, telling him: The only aristocracy I believe in is the aristocracy of talent.\\n\\nBut Ernesto still belonged by birthright to Argentine society. He had grown up on his mother's stories of California frontier life, and listening to his father's own terrifying tales of Indian attacks and sudden death in the high Andes. His family's illustrious and adventurous past was a legacy too powerful to overcome. He was nineteen when his father died, and although he went to college, studying architecture and engineering, he dropped out before graduation. He wanted to have his own adventures and make his own fortune, and he used his father's modest inheritance to pursue the goal.\\n\\nBy the time he met Celia, Ernesto had invested most of his money with a wealthy relative in a yacht-building company, the Astillero San Isidro. He worked there for a time as an overseer, but it was not enough to hold his interest. Soon he was enthused about a new project: A friend had convinced him he could make his fortune by growing yerba mate, the stimulating native tea ritually drunk by millions of Argentines.\\n\\nLand was cheap in the yerba-growing province of Misiones, twelve hundred miles up the Parana River from Buenos Aires on Argentina's northern border with Paraguay and Brazil. Originally settled by Jesuit missionaries and their Guarani Indian converts in the sixteenth century, annexed only fifty years earlier by Argentina, Misiones was just then opening up to settlement. Land speculators, well-heeled adventurers, and poor European migrants were flocking in. Guevara Lynch went to see it for himself, and caught yerba mate fever. His own money was tied up in the astillero, but, with Celia's inheritance, they would be able to buy enough land for a yerba mate plantation, and, he hoped, become rich from the lucrative green gold.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, Celia's family closed ranks in opposition to her dilettante suitor. Celia was not yet twenty-one, and under Argentine law she needed her family's approval to marry or receive her inheritance. She asked for it, but they refused. Desperate, for by now she was pregnant, she and Ernesto staged an elopement to force her family's consent. She ran away to an older sister's house. The show of force worked. The marriage was approved, but Celia still had to go to court to win her inheritance. By order of the judge, she was granted a portion of her inheritance, including title to a cattle and grain-producing estancia in central Cordoba province, and some cash bonds from her trust fund--enough to buy a mate plantation in Misiones.\\n\\nOn November 10, 1927, she and Ernesto were wed in a private ceremony at the home of a married older sister, Edelmira Moore de la Serna. La Prensa of Buenos Aires gave the news in its Dia Social column. Immediately afterward, they fled Buenos Aires for the wilderness of Misiones bearing their mutual secret. Together we decided what to do with our lives, wrote Guevara Lynch in a memoir published years later. Behind lay the penitences, the prudery and the tight circle of relatives and friends who wanted to impede our marriage.\\n\\nIII\\n\\nIn 1832, British naturalist Charles Darwin had witnessed the atrocities waged against Argentina's native Indians by gaucho warlord Juan Manuel de Rosas, and predicted: The country will be in the hands of white Gaucho savages instead of copper-coloured Indians. The former being a little superior in education, as they are inferior in every moral virtue.\\n\\nBut even as the blood flowed, Argentina had spawned its own pantheon of civic-minded historical heroes, from General Jose de San Martin, the country's liberator in the independence struggle with Spain, to Domingo Sarmiento, the crusading journalist, educator, and president who had finally wrested Argentina into the modern age as a unified republic. Sarmiento's 1845 book, Facundo (Civilization and Barbarity), had been a clarion call to his compatriots to choose the path of civilized man over the brutality of the archetypal Argentine frontiersman, the gaucho.\\n\\nYet even Sarmiento had wielded a dictator's authority to lead the country, and with his death the Argentine cult of the strongman, or caudillo, had not disappeared. Caudillismo would remain a feature of politics well into the next century as government swung back and forth between caudillos and democrats in a bewildering, cyclical dance. Indeed, as if reflecting the sharp contrasts of the great land they had conquered, there was an unreconciled duality in the Argentine temperament, seemingly balanced in a state of perpetual tension between savagery and enlightenment. At once passionate, volatile, and racist, Argentines were also expansive, humorous, and hospitable. The paradox had produced a flourishing culture and found expression in classic works of literature such as Ricardo Guiraldes's Don Segundo Sombra and the gaucho epic poem Martin Fierro by Jose Hernandez.\\n\\nSince the 1870s, the country had become more stable. And, when the conquest of the southern pampas was finally secured after an officially sponsored campaign to exterminate the native Indian population, vast new lands had opened up for colonization. The pampas were fenced in as grazing and farming lands; new towns and industries sprang up; railroads, ports, and roads were built. By the turn of the century, its population had tripled, swollen by the influx of over a million immigrants from Italy, Spain, Germany, Britain, Russia, and the Middle East who had poured into the rich southern land of opportunity--and still they came.\\n\\nA dismal colonial garrison on the vast Rio de la Plata estuary only a century before, the city of Buenos Aires now had a melting pot's combustive quality, epitomized by the sensuous new culture of tango, its dark-eyed crooner Carlos Gardel giving redolent voice to a burgeoning national pride. Its population spoke their own creole street dialect called lunfardo, an Argentine cockney rich in double entendres, cribbed from Quechua, Italian, and local gaucho Spanish.\\n\\nThe city's docks were bustling: Ships carried Argentina's meat, grains, and hides off to Europe while others docked bringing American Studebakers, gramophones, and the latest Paris fashions. The city boasted an opera house, a stock exchange, and a fine university; rows of imposing neoclassical public buildings and private mansions; landscaped green parks with shade trees and polo fields, as well as ample boulevards graced with heroic statues and sparkling fountains. Electric streetcars rattled and zinged along cobbled streets past elegant, bronzed-doored confiterias and wiskerias with gold lettering on etched glass windows. In their mirrored and marble interiors, haughty white-jacketed waiters with slicked-down hair posed and swooped like vigilant, gleaming eagles.\\n\\nBut while Buenos Aires's portenos, as they called themselves, looked to Europe for their cultural comparisons, much of the interior still languished in nineteenth-century neglect. In the north, despotic provincial caudillos held sway over vast expanses of cotton- and sugar-growing lands. Among their workers, diseases such as leprosy, malaria, and even bubonic plague were still common. In the Andean provinces, the indigenous Quechua- and Aymara-speaking Indians known as coyas lived in conditions of extreme poverty. Women would not be given the vote for another two decades, and legal divorce would take even longer. Vigilante justice and indentured servitude were features of life in much of the hinterland.\\n\\nArgentina's political system had not kept pace with its changing society and had stagnated. For decades, two parties, the Radical and the Conservative, had ruled the country's destiny. The current Radical president, Hipolito Yrigoyen, was aging and eccentric, a sphinxlike figure who rarely spoke or appeared in public. Workers had few rights, and strikes were often suppressed by gunfire and police batons. Criminals were transported by ship to serve terms of imprisonment in the cold southern wastes of Patagonia. But, with immigration and the twentieth century, new political ideas had also arrived. Feminists, socialists, anarchists, and now Fascists began making their voices heard. In the Argentina of 1927, political and social change was inevitable, but had not yet come.\\n\\nIV\\n\\nWith Celia's money, Guevara Lynch bought two hundred hectares (about five hundred acres) of jungle along the banks of the Rio Parana. On a bluff overlooking the coffee-colored water and the dense green forest of the Paraguayan shore, they erected a roomy wooden house on stilts, with an outdoor kitchen and outhouse. They were a long way from the comforts of Buenos Aires, but Guevara Lynch was enraptured. With an entrepreneur's eager eye, he looked into the jungle around him, and he saw the future.\\n\\nPerhaps he believed he could, as his grandfathers had done before him, restore the family fortunes by intrepidly striking out into new and unexplored lands. Whether or not he was consciously emulating his forefathers' experiences, it is clear that for Guevara Lynch, Misiones was his own Wild West adventure. To him, it was not just another backward Argentine province, but a thrilling place full of ferocious beasts, dangerous work, robbery and murders, jungle cyclones, interminable rains and tropical diseases.\\n\\nHe wrote: There, in mysterious Misiones ... everything attracts and entraps. It attracts like all that is dangerous, and entraps like all that is passionate. There, nothing was familiar, not its soil, its climate, its vegetation, nor its jungle full of wild animals, and even less its inhabitants.... From the moment one stepped on its shores, one felt that the safety of one's life lay in the machete or revolver....\\n\\nTheir homestead was in a place named Puerto Caraguatai, named in Guarani after a beautiful native red flower, but its puerto was just a small wooden jetty. Caraguatai was reached by a two-day river journey up from the old trading port of Posadas on the Ibera, a venerable Victorian paddle-wheel steamer that had done prior service carrying British colonials up the Nile. The nearest outpost was the small German settlers' community of Montecarlo, five miles away, but the Guevaras found they had a friendly neighbor who lived a few minutes' walk through the forest. Charles Benson was a retired English railway engineer and an avid angler, and just above the river he had built himself a white, rambling bungalow with its own internal water closet imported from England.\\n\\nFor a few months, the Guevaras spent an enjoyable time settling in and exploring the area. They sportfished, boated, and rode horses with Benson, or else drove into Montecarlo on their mule-drawn buggy. To eight-year-old Gertrudis Kraft, whose parents ran a little hostel on the Montecarlo road, the Guevaras were admirable, rich and elegant people, whose rustic home by the river was a mansion.\\n\\nThe Guevaras' honeymoon idyll, such as it was, did not last long. Within a few short months, Celia's pregnancy was well advanced, and it was time to return to civilization, where she could give birth in greater comfort and security. The couple set out downriver and ended their journey in Rosario, an important Parana port city of three hundred thousand inhabitants. There, Celia went into labor, and their son Ernesto Guevara de la Serna was born.\\n\\nHis doctored birth certificate, drawn up at the civil registrar's office on June 15, was witnessed by a cousin of Guevara Lynch's who lived in Rosario and a Brazilian taxi driver evidently drafted at the last minute. The document says the baby was delivered at 3:05 A.M. on the morning of June 14, in his parent's domicile on Calle Entre Rios 480.\\n\\nThe Guevaras remained in Rosario while Celia recovered from the delivery of Ernestito. They rented a spacious, three-bedroom apartment with servant's quarters in an exclusive new residential building near the city center, at the address given on the birth certificate. Their stay was prolonged when, shortly after his birth, the baby contracted bronchial pneumonia. Ernesto's mother, Ana Isabel Lynch, and his spinster sister Ercilia came to help out.\\n\\nIf the couple's families suspected anything, they kept quiet about it. Che's younger brother Roberto says that his mother told him that Ernesto was born in a clinic in Rosario on the 14 of June 1928. The address that appears on the birth register is where he lived the first days, but not where he was born. Possibly it was the house of a friend, or that of the taxi driver who was a witness....\\n\\nOf course, the truth, as Celia later told Julia Constenla de Giussani (who had arranged for Che's astral chart to be drawn up by their mutual astrologist friend), was that she had actually given birth in May, on the same day, and at the same hour as a striking dockworker nicknamed Diente de Oro (Gold Tooth) died of gunshot wounds.\\n\\nThe yellowing archives of Rosario's daily newspaper La Capital confirm the story. In May 1928, a strike by Rosario's dockworkers had escalated into violence. Almost every day, stabbings and shootings had taken place, most of them carried out by strikebreaking armed scabs working for the stevedores' hiring agency, the Sociedad Patronal. At 5:30 P.M. on Tuesday, May 13, 1928, a twenty-eight-year-old stevedore named Ramon Romero, alias Diente de Oro, was shot in the head during a fracas at the Puerto San Martin. At dawn the next day, May 14, he died in the Granaderos a Caballo Hospital in San Lorenzo, about twenty kilometers north of Rosario.\\n\\nV\\n\\nAfter a whirlwind round of visits with their families in Buenos Aires to show off their infant son, the Guevaras returned to their homestead in Misiones.\\n\\nGuevara Lynch now made a serious attempt to get his plantation off the ground. He hired a Paraguayan foreman, or capataz, named Curtido, to oversee the clearing of his land and the planting of his first crop of yerba mate. But when it came to hiring laborers, he had to confront the system of labor bondage, still practiced widely in the untamed region.\\n\\nIn Misiones, loggers and owners of yerbatales usually hired itinerant Guarani Indian laborers called mensu, who were given binding contracts and cash advances against future work. Paid low wages according to how much they produced, mensu received not cash but private bonds, valid only to purchase basic essentials at the overpriced plantation stores. The system virtually ensured that they could never redeem their original debts. Armed plantation guards called capangas kept vigilant watch over the work crews to prevent escapes, and violent deaths by gunshot and machete were frequent occurrences. Fugitive mensu who escaped the capangas but fell into the hands of police were inevitably returned to their patrones. Guevara Lynch hired mensu himself, but he was no yerba baron, and, horrified at the stories he heard, he paid his workers in cash. It made him a popular patron, and many years later, he was still remembered by local workers as a good man.\\n\\nAs Guevara Lynch worked his plantation, his young son was learning how to walk. To help train him, his father used to send him to the kitchen with a little pot of yerba mate to give the cook for boiling. Invariably stumbling along the way, Ernestito would angrily pick himself up and carry on. Another routine developed as a consequence of the pernicious insects that infested Caraguatai. Every night, while his son lay sleeping in his crib, Guevara Lynch and Curtido crept quietly into his room. While his patron trained a flashlight on his son, Curtido carefully used the burning tip of his cigarette to dislodge the day's harvest of chiggers burrowed into the baby's flesh.\\n\\nIn March 1929, Celia became pregnant again. She hired a young Galician-born nanny to look after Ernestito, who was not yet a year old. Carmen Arias proved to be a welcome new addition to the family; she would live with the Guevaras until her own marriage eight years later, and remain a lifelong family friend. Freed from child-minding, Celia began taking daily swims in the Parana. She was a good swimmer, but one day when she was six month's pregnant, the river's current caught her. She would probably have drowned if two of her husband's axmen clearing the forest nearby hadn't seen her and thrown out liana vines to pull her to safety.\\n\\nGuevara Lynch reprovingly recalled many such near-drowning episodes involving Celia in the early years of their marriage. Already, Celia and Ernesto's very different personalities had begun to collide. She was aloof, a loner, and seemingly immune to fear, while he was an emotionally needy man who liked having people around him, a chronic worrier whose vivid imagination magnified the risks he saw lurking everywhere.\\n\\nBut while the early signs of their future marital discord were already in evidence, they had not yet pulled apart. The Guevaras took family excursions together, either horse rides on the forest trails, with Ernestito riding on the saddle mount in front of his father, or river excursions aboard the Kid, a wooden launch with a four-berth cabin that Guevara Lynch had built at the Astillero San Isidro. Once, they traveled upriver to the famous Iguazu falls, where the Argentine and Brazilian borders meet, and watched the clouds of vapor rise from the brown cascades that roar down from the virgin jungle cliffs.\\n\\nIn late 1929, the family packed up once more for the long trip downriver to Buenos Aires. Their land was cleared and their yerbatal had just been planted, but Celia was about to give birth to their second child, and Guevara Lynch's presence was urgently needed at the Astillero San Isidro. During his absence, business had gone badly, and now one of its investors had withdrawn. They planned to be away only a few months, but they would never return as a family to Puerto Caraguatai. It was the end of what Ernesto Guevara Lynch recalled as difficult but very happy years."}

He was also challenging, indignant about all injustice, and a quiet saboteur of every jejune idea.\\n\\nWhen we talked about Iran, where I'd witnessed the postelection tumult in 2009, he broached human rights, the Iran nuclear threat and the movies of Abbas Kiarostami with effortless authority. What did Iran want? How could its people be brought closer to the world? How might their yearning for liberty be satisfied? Bob probed. He was always ready to learn, even if he always seemed to know more than you. He was the generalist rebuking the specialist. He prodded me, most recently, to write — and then rewrite — a review of Elena Ferrante's work. He liked writers in new territory.\\n\\nAt a memorial service for him this week at the New York Public Library, the immensity of Bob's loss was palpable. Justice Stephen Breyer sent a note, read by the Review's publisher, Rea Hederman. It extolled the importance of Bob's forum for distinguishing sense from nonsense. Ian Buruma captured Bob's particularly Jewish identification with the oppressed and his decency – that word dear to Camus, who observed in his novel The Plague that, It may seem a ridiculous idea, but the only way to fight the plague is with decency. Mark Danner evoked the love of Bob's life, Grace Dudley, and his sense of not knowing who I am after her death late last year. Still, Bob kept working. There were always things to do.\\n\\nYes, it is time to fight with decency the indecency seeping from high office; to reject nonsense; to resist contempt for the persecuted and the refugee; to uphold love lived to its limit; to honor industry over ostentation. Bob was the greatest editor of our time. Editors cut; showmen splurge. And one day the showman is unmasked."}

{"original": "During a recent interview, the German soprano Diana Damrau and the Italian tenor Vittorio Grigolo tried to describe the chemistry they have together onstage. Reading their comments, I worried that they might be overthinking things. After all, they first worked together only last year, appearing as the lovers in Massenet's Manon at the Metropolitan Opera. The couple thrilled audiences and critics with the smoldering intensity they emitted. So this is a new relationship. In talking about their instinctive connection might they risk making it self-conscious?\\n\\nNot to fear. On Saturday night for its New Year's Eve gala, the Met introduced a new production of Gounod's Roméo et Juliette starring Mr. Grigolo and Ms. Damrau as Shakespeare's star-crossed adolescent lovers. In scene after scene, these exciting and charismatic artists disappeared into their characters, emboldening each other to sing with white-hot sensuality and impassioned lyricism.\\n\\nThe production, by the director Bartlett Sher, his seventh for the Met, updates the setting from Renaissance to 18th-century Verona, presenting an essentially traditional staging with some surreal touches that seem a little forced. Still, to whatever degree Mr. Sher shaped the courageous performances of his stars, and this very strong cast, he deserves much credit."}

Mr. Perry tracks the major expenses in onscreen text, and puts synonyms for the movie's principal themes (acrimony, of course, as well as deranged and inexorable) in title cards.\\n\\nA partisan narrator but probably not an unreliable one, Melinda is somehow able to present flashbacks to moments that she didn't see. That's just one of several ways in which Mr. Perry's screenplay feels structurally shaky. Already ungainly in its mix of social realism and parable — Melinda undergoes a series of overwrought, essentially biblical trials in a city vaguely identified as present-day Pittsburgh — Acrimony truly gets muddled once it starts making excuses for its excuse-making antagonist.\\n\\nAfter all, what if Robert really means well? What if this time will be different? In addition to endorsing the logic that keeps spouses Stockholm syndrome'd in bad marriages, Acrimony also offers poor economic advice (Melinda's enduring devotion to Robert is an illustration of the sunk-cost fallacy — except that the movie suggests she hasn't sunk enough). And the less said about the yacht-based climax, featuring some of the least convincing ship-jumping ever filmed, the better.\\n\\nMs. Henson does what she can with a role that keeps her anger at a low simmer until requiring her to go full banshee within basically one scene.

As a composer, Mr. Kirchner demonstrated that one could write works of rigorous complexity employing modernist techniques but in an instinctive, richly expressive, viscerally dramatic way.\\n\\nThough steeped in the dodecaphonic music of his beloved teacher Schoenberg, Kirchner never used the 12-tone system strictly. Just hints of the aesthetic run through this mysterious slow movement from Kirchner's Second String Quartet (1958), beautifully performed here by the Orion Quartet.

Some of our best conversations used to take place in an elevator or on our way out the door. Those random things that are the fabric of our lives are so greatly diminished.\\n\\nDo you compensate virtually?\\n\\nThe computer screen has no texture. Our lives have no texture. That is why we're so drawn to cooking and eating right now. Those things bring smells, texture and physicality into our lives. That feeling of baking bread, of turning over the dough, that doesn't happen on a screen.\\n\\nDoes visiting a museum restore some of that sensation?\\n\\nIt can. Our attendance is pretty strong.

Day's End, our big public art project with David Hammons, will appear in May. It is an open structure, a ghost version of a pier shed that used to exist on the Hudson. In many ways, it is an aspirational project, about reparations. It's symbolic of the resilience of New York. For me it is about the healing of a city and a country that have been battered."}
{"original": "Art can be expected to hold a mirror up to society, but it cannot be expected to hold a mirror up to every individual who is engaging with it. Even with its long running time, there is a lot The Inheritance does not and cannot cover.\\n\\nNo one piece of writing about our complex, sprawling community will ever tell the entire story, and I believe that is a good thing: It creates an unquenchable thirst for more and more narratives — a thirst that has been evident in audiences for The Inheritance and a thirst that the theater, television and film industries have been too slow to satisfy.\\n\\nThe Inheritance was not my attempt at a grand summation of the past quarter century of queer history. What I was attempting was an examination of class, economic inequality, and poverty within the gay community — issues I have rarely seen depicted in theater. I have painted on a broad canvas. It is simply not the canvas others might have chosen.\\n\\nI wanted to write about addiction and alcoholism — a disease I have struggled with, and an epidemic that plagues our community just as perniciously as H.I.V./AIDS did 30 years ago. I also wanted to write about sex: how it can be used as a vehicle for pleasure and intimacy, but how it is also used as a tool to cauterize pain.\\n\\nSuch examinations run counter to our current desire for affirmative representation. But avoidance of uncomfortable truths is not the role of the artist. Healing is impossible if you don't understand the cause of the injury.\\n\\nAnd while I examine race in The Inheritance, it is not one of its central themes. This is a decision for which I have been criticized, but it is a decision that I made consciously as a person of color. It is a consideration that is not asked of white writers, but it is one that writers of color must face with every project we begin.\\n\\nResponsibility to community is the first question we must answer for ourselves. I believe that in writing honestly about my experience as a gay man, I have also contributed one more example of what it means to be a Puerto Rican man."}

{"original": "There are echoes of Beggar Boy in the ironically titled story America the Great Equalizer. Biks, a Nepali graduate student living in Illinois at the time of Michael Brown's shooting in Ferguson, Mo., simultaneously develops a heightened awareness of the racism all around him and learns that his beloved Seema, back in Nepal, has married. The death and the marriage, hardly comparable tragedies, intertwine in his mind, sparking a suspicion that Seema rejected him because of his comparatively dark skin. Feeling himself the victim of a terrible injustice due to prejudice, he begins to identify with African-Americans, taking on what he believes to be black mannerisms, including addressing customers at his new job in a gas station as brothah. It's an uncomfortable charade, barreling right through the boundary between empathy and appropriation, and into offensive stereotypes, a fact Biks is initially incapable of seeing, though others try to point it out. 'Am I your brother because we have the same mother, or am I your brother because you're African-American?' one customer asks him. Then he laughed and said he was just giving Biks a hard time.\\n\\nImage\\n\\nBiks sees through his own masquerade only after reaching some acceptance about his former lover's marriage, a piece of timing that suggests the great degree to which his supposed empathy has been about managing his own emotional wounds. This was not the life he'd envisioned … trying to be blacker than blacks — 'Blacker than thou,' he muttered to himself — when his history didn't compare to theirs, the brutality, the dehumanization, the violence. He was a fraud, trying to pretend to be someone he was not. … 'I am a pretender,' Biks said to himself. 'A poseur. An impostor.'\\n\\nThat is clearly true, but as with Ramesh in Beggar Boy, the pretense has to do with enacting something genuinely felt. And while impostors are commonly thought of as assuming a higher status, to which they have no claim, these characters take on the identities of those they perceive to be of lower status, to whose sufferings they have no claim, in order to engage in a kind of theater of pain. Their behaviors are particularly outlandish and so seem particularly egregious, but the wrong of using other people's troubles to soothe oneself is commonplace, a sin most of us commit at some point, which is perhaps why Upadhyay maintains so empathic a stance toward his characters, even as they transgress.\\n\\nThough he does allow them to be mocked. The specter of foolishness hovers close to many of the people found in Mad Country. The distinction between the questions Who might I actually be? and Just who do you think you are? is repeatedly revealed to be a slippery one. In Freak Street, set in 1970s Nepal, a young American woman decides she is Nepali, changing her name from Sofi to Sukumari, taking to wearing Nepali clothes and calling her landlady Ma. She is ridiculed for doing so, though again, her masquerade is the product of a profound unhappiness. The boy pointed at Sukumari. 'She! She's funny! Look at her. She a kuiriney hippie, but she thinks she's Nepali.' With this drumbeat of mockery, Upadhyay illuminates the unquestioned pressures on us all to remain as we are, a key element in a book about societal constructs, emotional exigencies and identity.\\n\\nStory collections need not be entirely consistent to triumph. Mad Country is brilliant, daring, memorable — and also uneven. The opening piece, Fast Forward, about a newsmagazine in Kathmandu, is a nuanced study of truth-telling under a repressive regime, while the novella Dreaming of Ghana, in which a young man first dreams about the country Ghana and then meets a young black woman whom he rather presumptuously names Ghana, involves disparate plot lines and symbolic representations that never quite add up. The title story, in which a successful businesswoman finds new forms of contentment while baselessly incarcerated, left me unconvinced. But I would not want any pieces excised. Even the less powerful stories here are original and thought-provoking enough to add something of value to the whole."}

{"original": "Season 2, Episode 2: 'Dead Cat Bounce'\\n\\nAmong other things, Billions is a show about American aristocracy, of two men burnishing a legacy that will etch their families' names in the firmament for generations to come. One of the key distinctions between Chuck Rhoades and Bobby Axelrod is that they approach the same goal from different angles: Chuck is an old-money political climber, on a conventional (if currently twisty) path from United States attorney to the governor's office, boosted by his father's reputation and connections. Axe is a nouveau riche brawler from Yonkers, using hedge fund billions to bully his way to the status his name itself cannot afford. Hence the sizable donation necessary to change an august Manhattan performance space into Axelrod Hall last season — the dubious permanence of which I likened to Enron Field in Houston.\\n\\nIn a key scene in tonight's episode, Chuck Rhoades Sr. pays a visit to Wendy's home while her husband is away. For Chuck Sr., there's no more important goal than making certain his son builds upon the Rhoades family legacy in the state of New York. And being the connected person that he is, it was only a matter of time before news of Chuck and Wendy's separation made its way through the grapevine. Chuck Sr. doesn't want to hear Wendy's rationale about the lies and deception that led to the separation, which to him are mere bumps in the road. She needs to think about the children. She needs to think about how much harder it will be for little Kevin Rhoades to meet his station in life. They are the future of my name, he tells her, adding, You'd really rather have your three nights a week than be first lady of the state of New York?\\n\\nHearing Chuck Sr. badger Wendy over her marriage recalled, for me, last year's excellent documentary Weiner, about the former congressman Anthony Weiner's failed campaign to become the mayor of New York City. Among the many casualties of that run — including, in a tangential way, the presidential ambitions of Hillary Clinton — was the marriage between Weiner and Huma Abedin, who also happened to a top Clinton aide. There was a time when Weiner and Abedin were securing their place in the aristocracy: They married the year after Weiner won the first of his seven terms in the House of Representatives — Bill Clinton officiated their wedding — and their union survived the first sexting scandal, nicknamed Weinergate, which led to his resignation from Congress. Weiner chronicles his attempt at a political comeback, which unravels after another round of sexts, sent under the pseudonym Carlos Danger, torpedoes his campaign for good.\\n\\nNobody can know for certain what goes on in a marriage, but political unions like the one between Chuck and Wendy — and Anthony and Huma, and Bill and Hillary — plainly involve considerations other than the boring-old conventions of trust, fidelity and happiness. We saw it last season, when Chuck and Wendy dined with a couple that does everything together and recoiled at their lovey-dovey intimacy. Chuck Sr. may seem like a sinister interloper in a relationship he knows nothing about, but he's there to remind Wendy that she entered into a political marriage and that the arrangement calls for a certain amount of flexibility. A couple of scenes later, when Chuck advises Wendy to tell Oliver Dake the truth (I don't want you to lie for me), it may be the most romantic moment they've ever had on the show. They even hold hands!"}

{"original": "THE CUSTOM OF the Country, Wharton's novel of divorce, was among her favorites. Begun in 1908 and published in 1913, the book took her an uncommonly long time to write. She was distracted by other projects — in those years, she produced Ethan Frome (1911) and The Reef (1912) as well as short stories — but most significantly, Wharton and her husband, Teddy, themselves divorced, after twenty-eight years of marriage, in part because Teddy had stolen significant sums of money from his wife. Although born into an eminent Yankee family with a great deal of wealth, and consequently in a considerably better position than most divorcées (then or now), she nevertheless found herself, as Martin-Wagner puts it, something of a social outcast, and left the United States for France, where she would live until her death in 1937. At the same time, her biographer R. W. B. Lewis writes, she felt propelled out of her metaphorical prison, able to exercise what Henry James had called a fantastic freedom.\\n\\nUndine's repeated unions and their dissolutions — by the novel's end her full name is Undine Spragg Marvell de Chelles Moffatt, though strictly speaking Moffatt should be listed twice — are on the one hand socially unsettling to (though ultimately accommodated by) New York and Paris societies, and on the other constitute for Undine that fantastic freedom. It's perhaps not totally surprising, then, that, as Lewis notes, Undine shares a number of key traits with her creator, including their childhood nickname, Puss. Wharton understood well the personal costs of marriage for women, and the limits society placed upon them. She surely put something of herself into Undine. At the same time, she knew intimately the suffering of poor Ralph Marvell, scion of old New York, who, upon reading about his divorce in the newspapers, felt that the coarse fingering of public curiosity had touched the secret places of his soul, and nothing that had gone before seemed as humiliating as this trivial comment on his tragedy.\\n\\nWharton's genius lies in her novelistic ability to allow her characters their perspectives while seeing the situation from all sides. Both in her lifetime and since, she has been maligned for being born rich (Franzen complains that privilege like hers isn't easy to like; it puts her at a moral disadvantage); and Janet Flanner accused her, in a waspish 1929 New Yorker profile, of lacking sensuality and sympathy, of formally proving that the wages of social sin were social death. But in fact Wharton — who could well have sat around in her fancy houses eating bonbons with her feet up rather than writing wonderfully entertaining, humanly true novels that have stood the test of time — turned her critical eye equally upon transgressors and upholders of convention alike. That's not to excuse her snobbery or to overlook the limitations of accounts of high society; but now, as then, we're fascinated by the lives of the wealthy, and shouldn't project our own secret shame about it onto Wharton. Her sharp wit is hard on all her characters, and crucially, she captures also their redeeming qualities, their humanity. She sees and understands Undine's laser-focused ambition, her parents' trembling and self-sacrificing indulgence, Ralph's highly cultured but weak romanticism, Elmer's robust desire for material success. And she appreciates also Undine's splendor, her vitality and allure, Ralph's delicacy and tenderness, Elmer's frankness and generosity. Like the novel's discreet and cheerful Mrs. Heeny, masseuse and manicurist to the rich, who travels from house to house with her bag full of press clippings, Wharton observes and records it all. In this new Gilded Age, when the disparities between rich and poor are again, and disastrously, as great as they were in Wharton's time, we could do with such a novelist, a cultural anthropologist who might hold up a mirror to our failings and our future, with eagle-eyed clarity and a small measure of compassion.\\n\\nClaire Messud is the award-winning author of eight books, including The Burning Girl and, most recently, Kant's Little Prussian Head and Other Reasons Why I Write: An Autobiography Through Essays."}
{"original": "CHAPTER ONE\\n\\nTo Keep the Waters Troubled\\n\\nThe Life of Ida B. Wells\\n\\n\\n\\nBy LINDA O. McMURRY\\n\\n\\n\\nOxford University Press\\n\\nRead the Review\\n\\nChildhood and Early Adulthood\\n\\nA happy, light-hearted schoolgirl\\n\\nThe remarkable journey of Ida Wells began during the Civil War in the northern Mississippi town of Holly Springs. It was not the most auspicious place for an African American to be born, for Mississippi has been the site of horrific incidents of white racism and violence. In the antebellum period, slaves from other states feared being sold down to Mississippi; later, some of the bloodiest chapters of the civil rights movement would be written there. Nevertheless, Ida B. Wells was born at a time and place in Mississippi that offered African Americans cause for hope as well as discouragement. Her parents also emerged from slavery with more opportunity than many.\\n\\nAlthough slavery was hardly a benevolent institution, as white southerners sought to paint it, some slaves were more privileged than others. Sources of privilege included kinship with the master, acquisition of valuable skills, and the opportunity to be hired out in cities. Ida's father, James Wells, apparently benefited from all three. His master/father owned a plantation in Tippah County and had no children by his white wife, Miss Polly. Like many slave owners, he had a black family with a slave--Peggy. Born in 1840, James Wells was their first child and was cherished by his father, who was relatively old when James was born. Such liaisons were deeply resented by most slave owners' white wives, who felt the bitterness of betrayal and the humiliation of seeing tangible, public proof of their husbands' infidelity in the skin color of the children. These wives' wrath was sometimes unleashed on the slave women who shared their husband's attention, whether or not the bondswomen were willing participants in the relationships. James Wells recalled how Miss Polly had gotten someone to strip and whip Peggy the day after her husband died.\\n\\nBefore his death, James's father had taken him to Holly Springs, in northern Mississippi, to be apprenticed to a carpenter. Thus at age eighteen, James Wells gained a valuable skill and a measure of independence as a hired-out slave living in town. Masters hired out their slaves to other people for a variety of reasons--usually for compensation or for their slaves to acquire certain skills. Hired-out slaves enjoyed a wide range of freedom, and some received very little. Life in cities and towns, however, gave many hired-out slaves some freedom from supervision, and most found more autonomy than the slaves on their masters' plantations.\\n\\nIn Holly Springs, Wells learned carpentry and acquired a mate at the residence of a contractor and builder named Bolling. He fell in love with Elizabeth Warrenton, the cook in the Bolling household. As slaves they could not legally marry, but they lived as man and wife and legalized their vows after emancipation--as many slaves did. Unlike James, Elizabeth (born in 1844) had not been sheltered from bondage's worst abuses. One of ten children born to slaves in Virginia, she vividly recalled receiving beatings from her masters. She also suffered one of the worst abuses of slavery: She and two of her sisters were sold and separated from their family. Such separations were painful reminders of slaves' vulnerability and cut them off from the very people who provided comfort and support to cope with the harsh realities of slavery. Like so many others, Elizabeth sent inquiries back to Virginia after emancipation in a vain attempt to find her lost family.\\n\\nIda Bell Wells was the first child born to the couple. Her birth on 16 July 1862 was in the midst of the Civil War. At first the Union and the Confederacy carefully tried to separate the issue of slavery from their war aims, but the process of the war ultimately destroyed the system of human bondage. When Union troops arrived nearby, many slaves sought to liberate themselves by fleeing behind Union lines. After a period of confusion over the status of these fugitives (at first, slaves were often returned to their Confederate masters), the U.S. Congress directed that escaped slaves of rebel masters could be considered contraband of war and proclaimed free. Nevertheless, when Union troops moved out of a region, some of the newly freed slaves found themselves recaptured in the web of slavery. For many southerners of all shades, the transition from slavery to freedom was chaotic and confusing. Ida Wells's birthplace was the scene of more-than-average confusion.\\n\\nHolly Springs was captured and recaptured by the two armies, changing hands at least fifty-nine times during the war. Its geography and its history made the city's experiences of the war and Reconstruction both typical and atypical of most of the state. When Ida was born, Holly Springs had existed for only a few decades. In 1832 the Chickasaw ceded the region, known as the Chickasaw Cession, to the federal government. Four years later the territory was divided into counties--the largest of which was Marshall County with Holly Springs as its seat. While still carving the city from the wilderness, its settlers sought to make it a cultural center. Even before the town was incorporated, residents voted in a town meeting to establish the Holly Springs Female Institute, the first of a number of educational institutions. By 1850 the county was spending more on higher education than all the rest of the state, excluding the budget of the University of Mississippi. A history of the state noted that in 1891 Holly Springs, called the City of Flowers, was widely known for the hospitality and culture of its people.\\n\\nOne reason for the culture and prosperity in Holly Springs was the arrival of successful cotton planters, who had moved west for more fertile soil, as well as many others who grew cotton on a smaller scale. King Cotton demanded slaves; the 1840 county population of 17,536 included 8,260 slaves and 8 free blacks. As a new town with many land claim cases, the city also was the home to numerous lawyers. Both lawyers and planters tended to join the Whig party, which dominated the town's early politics--until the rise of the slavery issue in national debate. The controversy destroyed the party there as elsewhere and no compromise Democrats rose in power.\\n\\nBy 1860 the county's population had grown to almost 29,000, including 1,295 slave owners and 17,439 slaves; the free black population remained at 8. Now a minority, whites became even more determined to retain slavery as a source of control and power, and Marshall County played an integral role in Mississippi's march toward secession. One of its residents was coauthor of the state's ordinance of secession, and when it was signed on 9 January 1861, the county provided five signatories--more than any other county. Thus a year and a half before Ida Wells's birthday, her parents and the rest of Holly Springs probably waited anxiously for the outcome of the bold move toward disunion.\\n\\nBecause whites were outnumbered, a constant fear of racial revolt lingered in many minds. Such fear was intensified by the uncertainties of war. Early in the hostilities planters summoned home some of their hired-out slaves. The state legislature also moved to control slaves by penalizing masters who granted their bondsmen and bondswomen too much freedom. Even so, rumors spread like epidemics, fanning the fever of fear with lurid descriptions of insurrection plots. Hysteria required no tangible evidence. The month Ida was born, the provost marshal of Natchez reported the hanging of forty African Americans during the preceding year, foreshadowing the postwar terror and murder of black men to retain white control. By the end of the century only the dominant excuse had changed--from insurrection to rape.\\n\\nAt first Holly Springs seemed to have been spared the worst of the hysteria and war. Not until about two weeks before Ida's birth in July 1862 did the first significant Civil War skirmish occur near Holly Springs. A considerable number of Confederate troops remained in the area until later that fall when Union General Ulysses S. Grant began moving troops into northern Mississippi in preparation for the Vicksburg campaign. Before his army reached Holly Springs, Confederate forces partially dismantled the local foundry and retreated to a more defensible position. Grant proceeded to establish a large supply depot in the city. Weapons, ammunition, food, and other materials filled every public building as well as churches, the Masonic Temple, and even a few private homes. While he briefly made his headquarters there, the city's black population celebrated a rare degree of freedom.\\n\\nAs Grant's army moved deeper into slave territory, slaves began coming in larger numbers to the Union camps. To handle the hordes, Grant asked Chaplain John Eaton to establish a camp for the contrabands. Eaton chose Grand Junction, Tennessee, as the camp's location--just across the state line from Holly Springs. Eaton later described the scene of slaves coming garbed in rags or silks, with feet shod or bleeding, individually or in families and larger groups,--an army of slaves and fugitives, pushing its way irresistibly toward an army of fighting men. Although the Wells family and many other slaves chose to remain in Holly Springs, the camp's nearby location had an ameliorating impact on slavery in that city.\\n\\nLate in the fall of 1862, Grant's army moved south, leaving only twenty-five hundred troops in Holly Springs. Until that time Holly Springs had suffered little damage, although the town and the surrounding countryside had changed hands frequently. On a plantation near Holly Springs, eighteen-year-old Cordelia Scales wrote letters describing the changing parade of Union and Confederate troops that camped in her yard. Both seem to have foraged--but not unduly. Some outlying plantations suffered more than others, but major destruction of the town began with the raid by Confederate General Earl Van Dorn on 20 December 1862. Van Dorn's men quickly routed the outnumbered and unsuspecting federal troops in Holly Springs. Knowing they had little time, Confederate soldiers rapidly looted the easily transportable federal supplies. Then, from early morning until 4:00 P.M., they set fire to the many buildings housing the remaining stores. Exploding ammunition caused further destruction and some deaths. J. G. Deupree, a participant, described the scene as\\n\\nwild and exciting: Federals running; Confederates yelling and pursuing; tents and houses burning; torches flaming; guns popping; sabres clanking; negroes and abolitionists begging for mercy; women, in dreaming robes and with disheveled hair floating in the morning breeze, shouting encouragement to the raiders; a mass of frantic, frightened human beings.\\n\\nOf all the frantic, frightened human beings few were more scared than the negroes and abolitionists begging for mercy. James and Elizabeth Wells may well have feared for their six-month-old infant.\\n\\nThe destruction was not yet complete. Two days later federal troops returned. One Iowa soldier watched sadly as every portion of the fated city seemed given over to pillage and destruction and no hand was raised to save anything from the general sack and ruin. He was especially disturbed by the sacrileges committed in a church and the women and children standing in their homes wailing with the most piteous cries. Before Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered on 4 May 1865, Holly Springs had witnessed more than a dozen major skirmishes. After so much chaos and confusion, the county's slaves must have wondered if freedom had actually come to stay, while whites worried about what would replace slavery. Former masters and former slaves warily sought to redefine their new relationships.\\n\\nAfter the war was over, James Wells accepted Bolling's invitation to continue working for him. Like most freed people, Wells sought to test and taste the varied fruits of freedom. He first exercised those rights that white southerners had grudgingly conceded--legalizing his marriage and seeking education for his family. The Wells family continued to grow in the years following the war, and eventually Ida had four brothers and three sisters. Both parents were eager for their children to go to school. Former slaves realized that education had been forbidden because it was a key to freedom and a source of white power. Most slave children had worked at an early age; their freed fathers wanted them to have childhoods more like those of their former masters' children. Ida Wells later recalled, Our job was to go to school and learn all we could.\\n\\nShe began school at such an early age that she could not remember when or where she started. Her earliest recollections were of reading the newspaper to her father and his friends and of her mother going to school with the children until she was able to read the Bible. Students of all ages clustering around a limited number of books in small schools was a common sight to the newly freed slaves during Reconstruction. Whether Ida's father learned to read is unclear. Her reading the newspaper to him and his friends could have represented a father's desire to show off the accomplishments of his offspring or his inability to read for himself. Like many freed heads of households, James Wells was undoubtedly busy and apparently did not attend school with his family. However, he may have learned to read and write from his father or as an apprentice. Regardless, Wells was deeply involved in education because he was one of the trustees of Shaw University, the school Ida attended in Holly Springs.\\n\\nIn addition to exercising their rights to marriage and education, freedmen eagerly embraced the right to vote. For the entire Republican Reconstruction period in Mississippi (1867-1875), African Americans comprised a majority of the county's population and overwhelmingly supported Republicans despite white Democrats' efforts to win their votes. The Democrats used both carrots and sticks to woo black voters. Many used economic intimidation to persuade African Americans to vote for Democrats. James Wells was one victim of such tactics. When Bolling found out that Wells had not voted Democratic, he locked Wells out of his shop. Wells, however, was not easily intimidated. Without saying a word to anyone, he bought his own tools, rented a house, and moved his family out of the dwelling owned by Bolling.\\n\\nSome African Americans followed the path of James Wells, but black voters responded in a variety of ways. Like Wells, a number openly demonstrated their independence--a few attended Democratic barbecues and picnics adorned in caps with the Republican insignia. Others dissembled. One man, threatened with eviction by his white landlord if he voted Republican, won a reprieve with the explanation that he had been forced to vote for Republicans by black threats to run him out of town. Many accepted Democratic gifts and then voted Republican anyway. A few did become Democrats either out of loyalty to former masters or employers or because of economic threats and incentives. The leader of a black Democratic club was rewarded with the gift of a small house by his white fellow Democrats.\\n\\nAlthough a numerical minority in Marshall County, Democrats were able to get most of their candidates elected as late as the election of 1871. To do so, they utilized both intimidation and fraud. Tactics included counterfeiting Republican ballots, attempting to confuse voters by using African Americans to distribute Democratic tickets, hiding in the building to stuff ballot boxes while the election clerks were eating supper, and requiring black voters to present written proof of their age. As a result of reported electoral fraud, the state legislature refused to seat two Marshall County Democrats elected in 1871. In the next election, the Republicans swept all the county's offices. One African American served as state senator and three as representatives. However, two years later in 1875, the Democrats returned to power--permanently. Black Mississippi politician John Roy Lynch later noted, The new order of things was then set aside and the abandoned methods of a few years back were reviewed, reinaugurated, and readopted.\\n\\nIda recalled that her father was interested in politics and remembered the anxious way my mother walked the floor at night when my father was out to a political meeting. Her mother had good reason to be concerned. Whites resented all black political participation but especially loathed the Loyal League, a black political organization founded and often controlled by white Republicans across the South. The Holly Springs branch of the League was established by A. C. McDonald of Shaw University and Nelson Gill of the Freedmen's Bureau. It usually met in Gill's home or in the black Baptist church. During one meeting, members of the local Ku Klux Klan hid under Gill's house listening to the proceedings and waiting for J. L. Holland, who had been chosen among them by lot, to shoot Gill. When Holland finally decided it was time and aimed his pistol, another Klansman had second thoughts and knocked the gun out of Holland's hand just as he fired it. No one was hurt, but all were scared. Afterward, pickets were posted outside during Loyal League meetings.\\n\\nHeated campaigns led to physical assaults and fights--apparently instigated by Democrats. Republican speakers were pelted with sticks and brickbats, had their coattails ripped, were buggy-whipped, and had their legs broken. The most serious incident of violence was the fatal shooting of Tyler Williamson, an African American who was called a very turbulent leader and exceedingly impudent to the white people. Despite that incident, Holly Springs remained more peaceful than many towns and cities during Reconstruction. Ida Wells noted in her autobiography that she could not remember any riots in the city, although there were plenty in other parts of the state.\\n\\nPolitical violence and Klan activities frightened Elizabeth Wells and others, but Reconstruction also brought new hope and opportunity to Mississippi's black population. Although brief, the period of Republican ascendancy in Holly Springs had to be a source of great pride to the Wells's and other black families. Most whites, although they resented black political power, agreed that the city had been blessed with extraordinarily capable and honest black officeholders. Two were singled out for praise: James Hill, who rose from the state legislature to become Mississippi's secretary of state from 1874 to 1878, and Hiram Rhodes Revels, who moved to Holly Springs in the mid-1870s, and became the first African American U.S. senator. Both won white respect by their conciliatory attitudes. But whites also noted that although State Senator George Allbright was a willing and eager tool in the hands of Gill, he was a negro who was above average in intelligence. At the height of black political power in Holly Springs, Ida Wells was a child of about ten. The events she witnessed may have whetted her interest in politics, which remained strong her entire life.\\n\\nAlthough James Wells was known as a race man who was intensely interested in politics, he apparently never held office but stayed busy running a business and taking care of his growing family. As in many households, however, Ida's mother played the biggest role in the day-to-day affairs of the children. A very religious woman, Elizabeth Wells made sure that her children attended church regularly. The Wells family likely belonged to Asbury Methodist Church, where Shaw University classes were first held. Ida was baptized in that faith at the age of twelve. Ida recalled that her mother won the prize for regular attendance at Sunday school, taking the whole brood of six to nine o'clock Sunday school the year before she died. Elizabeth Wells was a strict disciplinarian who kept close watch over her children. She regularly went to their school to check on their progress, taught them how to do household chores, and assigned each tasks around the home. Ida proudly asserted that her mother brought us up with a strict discipline that many mothers who have had educational advantages have not exceeded.\\n\\nLike many African American families, the Wells family was part of a network of kinship. Although Elizabeth Wells had been unable to locate her parents and other siblings, her sister Belle, who had also been sold to Mississippi owners, lived out in the country near Holly Springs. James Wells's mother, Peggy, married a black man (probably named Buffer) after emancipation and also lived nearby. They apparently lived as man and wife during slavery and had a daughter named Margaret and at least one other son. The Butlers tilled a number of acres and brought their corn and cotton to sell in Holly Springs each fall. Utilizing that trip for a family visit, they usually brought gifts, some of which Ida called souvenirs from hog-killing time. On one such visit, Ida recalled her father angrily refusing his mother's request to go see his father's widow, Miss Polly, reminding his mother of how Miss Polly had her whipped and saying, I am never going to see her. I guess it is all right for you to take care of her and forgive her for what she did to you, but she could have starved to death if I'd had my say-so. She certainly would have, if it hadn't been for you. In addition to those visits, Ida sometimes went to stay with her grandmother and aunt and uncle, who helped Peggy and her husband on the farm. Apparently, another uncle and his wife, Fannie Butler, had three children and lived in Memphis, Tennessee.\\n\\nWhen Ida reached her teens, she enrolled at Shaw University (informally called Rust College until 1890, when the name change became official), where she was greatly influenced by the missionary spirit of the school. Under the jurisdiction of the Methodist Episcopal Church, North, Rust was strongly tinged with evangelical Christianity. Students were required to attend daily chapel, weekly prayer meetings, and church on Sunday. W. W. Hooper, who became president of Rust while Ida was a student, was remembered as a religious man who prayed in chapel with his eyes open and would call your name when he got through if you didn't behave. Such an environment reinforced the religious training Ida received at home.\\n\\nRust's curriculum spanned from elementary education to normal school training for teachers--a four-year high school level program. A. C. McDonald founded the school to make former slaves and their children useful, independent citizens. In 1875 he wrote the following:\\n\\nIt is our aim to do no hot-house work, seeking to hurry students through a college curriculum ... sending them into the battle of life only to disgrace themselves and bring reproach upon the cause of education at large, but to take the far more difficult and tedious plan of trying to lay well a foundation for a broad, thorough and practical education.\\n\\nAs in many schools for African Americans of that era, Rust's faculty was predominately white. Most of the teachers were northerners who saw themselves as missionaries. The white women teachers influenced Ida's concept of ideal womanhood and her acceptance of Victorian codes of propriety. At the same time, she may have been inspired by the example of black faculty member Ophelia Smith who wrote, I love my race.\\n\\nWhile a student at Rust, Ida encountered the joys and sorrows of puberty. She experienced her first love and its painful demise. James B. Combs was a Rust student from Georgia, who boarded with a local family. Described in the 1880 U.S. census as mulatto, Combs was about five years older than Wells and apparently was the one to end the relationship. He married someone else and remained in Holly Springs for at least ten years--his presence reminding Wells of the impermanence of love. Throughout her twenties Ida remained skittish of committing herself to just one man.\\n\\nOther relationships caused difficulties for Wells at Rust. In late 1885, she referred to her tenure at Rust as my darkest days. Ida's fiery temper often got her in trouble, and a confrontation with President Hooper apparently led to her dismissal sometime in 1880 or 1881. For years she resented him tremendously for her expulsion, but in June 1886 she admitted to herself that her own tempestuous, rebellious, hard headed wilfulness was to blame. She rued her disposition to question his authority and asserted, I no longer cherish feelings of resentment, nor blame him that my scholastic career was cut short.\\n\\nIn 1878 Ida B. Wells encountered the next painful chapter of her life while on a visit to her grandmother. That year witnessed a devastating yellow fever epidemic in the Mississippi Valley. The region had undergone previous epidemics of yellow fever, but none was as extensive or deadly as the 1878 outbreak. An unusually mild winter, an early spring, and a blistering hot summer had allowed the mosquitoes, which served as the fever's agent of transmission, to breed prolifically and over a wide range of territory. Thus the fever spread to areas that had never experienced an epidemic; therefore, most residents of those regions had no acquired immunities to yellow fever. Compounding these factors, the strain of virus that year was particularly deadly, which caused higher mortality rates even in areas previously infected. In some regions the mortality rates exceeded 50 percent.\\n\\nLacking a good understanding of how the fever was spread, most Holly Springs residents believed their town to be immune, so the city opened its doors to people from other infested cities. The first refugees were housed in a small brick building that had served as the original land office. Within a week one of the refugees had died, which was only the beginning of the terrible toll the fever would exact in Holly Springs. On 4 September 1878, the New Orleans Picayune reported fifty cases of yellow fever in Holly Springs and two deaths; an epidemic was declared and panic began, causing a frenzied effort at flight from the unseen terror so that streets were jammed with every conceivable type of vehicle loaded with baggage and human beings. By the next day a different scene was described: The hurry and confusion of panic is gone. No hurried footsteps sound along the forsaken streets unless they seek help or a doctor. Hollow echoes mock their passing. The mass exodus reduced the town's population from about thirty-five hundred to fifteen hundred, comprised of three hundred whites and twelve hundred African Americans. One who remained telegraphed on 5 September, The stores are all closed.... Physicians are broken down.... Many cases will die today.... Gloom, despair, and death rule the hour, and the situation is simply appalling. Only a few dozen of those who stayed escaped the fever; by the end of the epidemic, 215 whites and 89 African Americans had died.\\n\\nWhile Holly Springs was reeling from yellow fever, Ida was safe at her grandmother's house and presumed that the rest of the family had evacuated the city and gone to stay with her mother's sister Belle. When no word came from them, she assumed delivery of the mail had been disrupted. Then three men from Holly Springs brought her a letter, which she scanned until, as she later recalled, four sentences caught her eye: Jim and Lizzie Wells have both died of the fever. They died within twenty-four hours of each other. The children are all at home and the Howard Association has put a woman there to take care of them. Send word to Ida. She immediately fainted and came to in a house of mourning surrounded by her grandmother, aunt, and uncle. Her father had died on 26 September and her mother the next day.\\n\\nWells was concerned about her younger siblings in Holly Springs. Two years earlier the next oldest child, Eugenia, had developed severe scoliosis that had bent her spinal column until she became paralyzed below the waist. Next in order of birth were her brothers James, age eleven, and George, age nine. Her two youngest sisters were five-year-old Annie, and Lily, about two. The youngest sibling was a nine-month-old baby named Stanley. Another brother, Eddie, had died a number of years earlier of spinal meningitis. Wells wanted to go to the children immediately, but her relatives would not allow her to leave until they received a letter from a doctor saying that she should come.\\n\\nWhen Ida arrived at the house, she found out that all the children except Eugenia had been stricken with the fever. Although most had slight cases, the baby had died on 3 October, and two still remained in bed. Eugenia told her what had happened since the fever struck, recounting their father's contribution to the emergency. To protect his family while he built coffins and comforted the sick, James Wells left home but came daily as far as the gate to bring food and to check on them. Elizabeth, however, was the first of the family to be stricken. An Irish woman was sent to nurse her, and James came home to help--only to come down with the fever himself.\\n\\nJames Wells had been a master Mason, which in the black community often operated as a safety net for its members and their families. Thus once the epidemic had passed, a group of Masons gathered at the Wells home to discuss what was to become of the children. After many hours of discussion, they had come to an agreement on the arrangements. They decided that Ida was old enough to take care of herself, but the others would have to be parceled out. Two of the Masons' wives each agreed to take one of the younger girls, Annie and Lily. The two boys were to be apprenticed to two different men--one of whom was a local white who was familiar with their father's work and hoped his son shared Wells's carpentry skills. The big problem was Eugenia. Because of her paralysis, no one wanted the responsibility of caring for her, so she was to be sent to a poorhouse.\\n\\nWhile the men were divvying up the children, Ida had sat quietly. When they finished, however, she calmly announced that her parents would turn over in their graves to know their children had been scattered like that and she did not intend to let it happen. She would care for them if the Masons would help her find work. Although they initially scoffed at the idea, Ida was adamant and they relented--probably relieved to be rid of the responsibility. Wells later subtly altered the past and her experiences at Rust University by recollecting, After being a happy, light-hearted schoolgirl I suddenly found myself at the head of a family. Actually, her days there were less than idyllic, and she continued to attend Rust between school terms until her expulsion some two years later.\\n\\nAt age sixteen, Ida B. Wells was able to keep her family together because her father had been industrious and frugal. He had left them a house free of debt and accumulated savings of at least three hundred dollars. That met their needs for awhile, but Ida needed to find work. On the suggestion of the Masons, she sought a teaching job in a country school. She successfully passed the examination and was assigned to a school six miles outside of Holly Springs with a salary of twenty-five dollars a month. While she waited for school to open, Wells lengthened all her skirts for the transition from schoolgirl to schoolmarm.\\n\\nUntil that time, Wells had been sheltered by her parents, who were very protective. She had not been allowed to be in the presence of men unchaperoned, and her contacts with boys had been limited to what she called children's parties. She was naive and society was suspicious of women living without the protection of a father, husband, or male relative. The result was a pattern of rumors that would plague her until she married. After she insisted on staying in the family home with her siblings, the word spread that Wells wanted the house for illicit assignations with a white man. She was dimly aware that such arrangements existed, but she was deeply shocked and hurt that people believed her capable of such action.\\n\\nAlthough Wells was listed as the head of the household in the 1880 U.S. census, she received help in meeting her responsibilities from her extended family and friends. Mr. and Mrs. James Hall, family friends who were in their early thirties, served as guardians. After fallacious rumors that Wells was having an affair with a white doctor, her grandmother, Peggy, came from the country to stay with them. Although she was in her seventies, she tried to help out by working during the day. However, one night Peggy collapsed with a paralytic stroke, and her daughter took her back to the country to care for her until she died?\\n\\nOnce Wells started to work at the country school, she needed someone to watch the children during the week. An old friend of her mother's (probably Rachel Rather) agreed to do so. Rather was from Virginia, twenty-four years older than Elizabeth, and may have served as a surrogate mother to her. She took care of the children until Ida would come home every Friday, riding the six miles on the back of a big mule. Before she returned on Sunday afternoon, Wells did all the laundry and housecleaning for the week. She also cooked for the children, often using eggs and butter that people near her school had given her. Fortunately, she did not have to keep up this frantic pace for too long. Gradually, she was relieved of the responsibility for some of the children. By 1880, her brother James, who the family called Jim, had left home and had become apprenticed to a carpenter. Although he was no longer under her direct supervision, Wells still worried about Jim. She later called him her problem child because he was constantly getting into minor difficulties, especially with women. He would then go to Ida, who would help him out of the trouble. George was quieter and also became a carpenter's apprentice, eventually moving to Kansas.\\n\\nWells taught for three years in Marshall County and Tate County schools and for six months in a school in Cleveland County, Arkansas. In 1881 Wells accepted the invitation of her aunt, Fannie Wells, to come to Memphis. Fannie lived there with her three small children, having been widowed by the yellow fever epidemic. Wells brought her two youngest sisters with her to Memphis, while Eugenia went to live with their Aunt Belle on her farm. After she arrived in the city at the age of nineteen, Wells continued to teach--first in the nearby town of Woodstock, and after 1884 in the city schools of Memphis.\\n\\nForced into an early adulthood by her parents' deaths, in Memphis Wells began to feel the pull of conflicting duties and desires that marked her entire life. As she struggled to balance her responsibilities to her family and her race, Wells also sought to fulfill her personal needs for independence and security. Her quest for self-identity was complicated by a temperament that made it difficult for her accept the gender and racial roles expected of her. After much seeking and struggling, Wells became both a woman and an activist in Memphis."}

{"original": "In a crucial early scene of Janacek's Katya Kabanova, the title character, a young woman trapped in a stultifying marriage to a timid merchant in a town on the Volga, recalls memories of her carefree childhood. As a girl, Katya tells Varvara, her adopted sister-in-law, she would rise early on summer days, wash in the stream and tend to every flower in her house. Going to church was like falling into a trance, Katya says; she imagined rising to heaven to watch angels fly.\\n\\nJanacek's restless music suggests that this nostalgic confession is fraught with Katya's instability. The emotional complexities came through strongly on Friday night when the Juilliard School opened a production of Katya Kabanova by the director Stephen Wadsworth at the Peter Jay Sharp Theater — and not just because the soprano Felicia Moore, as Katya, sang so expressively.\\n\\nThe dramatic impact was enhanced because the opera was performed in an English translation of Janacek's original Czech libretto. It used to be common, if never the prevailing practice, for operas to be translated into the language of the audience, especially in the United States. This was especially true for less familiar works, though I have wonderful early memories of hearing staples like The Marriage of Figaro and La Bohème performed in English.\\n\\nThis practice involves a trade-off. Great composers wrote vocal lines that hewed to the sounds and flow of the words in the libretto, and that bond is hard to mimic even in the best translations. The advantage is the direct communication between singers and audiences that can result."}

So it should be to all of us. You are probably financially dependent on your mother — and will be, to some extent, when you go to college.

Keep that (and your best interests) in mind.\\n\\nI applaud your mom for wanting a regular spiritual component in your life. But that needn't be church (in my irrelevant opinion) for one disinclined and on the cusp of adulthood. Suggest a weekly commitment to serving those in need — at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter, maybe — in lieu of church. She may go for a switcheroo with a moral and compassionate flavor.

This offends me. These conversations aren't about me explaining my choices, but others imposing their (often incorrect) views on me. I am a peace-loving person, but I would like a saucy comeback.

{"original": "FIRE SERMON\\n\\nBy Jamie Quatro\\n\\n208 pp. Grove Press. $24\\n\\nTHERE ARE BOOKS with front doors, through which the reader walks right in, and there are books with side doors. Side door books take more interpretive work, but yield special pleasures. Jamie Quatro's fantastic new novel, Fire Sermon, is a side door book. The novel delivers its story through a variety of methods: first-person confessions, fictional third-person descriptions, letters sent and unsent, emails, questionnaires, Socratic dialogues with the self. Roiling, raw and sensual on the surface, this mazy novel rewards a second reading.\\n\\nThe plot is simple: A married woman is trying to forget her lover. The woman, Maggie Ellmann, a contented mother of two grown children, meets James, a married poet, at a conference. They spend two years falling into a long-distance emotional affair. The affair culminates in a single, searing night together in Chicago, after which they part for good. In the unsent letters she writes to James during this embargo, Maggie struggles to find a theological framework for her longing and her pain. In one such letter, she admires the Buddhist notion of death as the ultimate lack of attachment, noting, What relief there would be in no longer longing to feel, again, your whiskers on my inner thighs. Her antagonist is time — so slow when she is trying to forget, so quick when she reflects on the simpler years with her husband and children, before the erotic disruption.\\n\\nThe novel dips back through time to track life before the affair. The mores of the Ellmanns' lives are exceedingly conventional, as are many of the novel's touchstones — weddings, baptisms, the death of pets. But the way this slim book condenses these happenings in the context of the affair gives them poetry. Lyrical lists of domestic detritus contain the sweetness of child rearing, as well as a mysterious sense of loss: Parent meetings, medical forms, class photos, permission slips. Organelles. Passive versus active transport. Quatro cuts gorgeous topiaries into the domestic landscape. Maggie's little daughter mispronounces nail polish as pale nolish; her son fashions a makeshift loincloth from his father's old T-shirt, with a wrapping-paper tube for a spear. But over the years, invasive plants encroach, privet and wisteria, thistle and honeysuckle. The backyard steadily shrinks. Even before she meets James, Maggie is aware of a lack of feeling, an inattentiveness to self — this nothing. This nothing can partly be traced back to two difficult childbirths, and the habitual surrendering of her own body to others, most especially during sex, into which her usually benign husband manipulates and bullies her. Middle age looms. The children grow into complicated teenagers, then leave for college. In other words, Maggie has been in a personal stasis for a long time. Enter James. She first becomes aware of him through reading his poetry, which she admires. I think I'm going to write to him, she announces to her husband, Thomas.\\n\\nImage\\n\\nPoor Thomas. He surely has his side of the story, but we don't get it here. Instead we are told: Thomas is, in fact, a good husband. Syntactically, the sentence says so much. The fact of the husband's goodness becomes a sidebar. Maggie is aware of, but helpless against, the greed for more love, when she already has more than most. The marriage has its problems, but the biggest one is its earthly limitations, the waning of interest and desire — its mortality. Only if a person were married to God would she or he have a partner who would never suffer from overfamiliarity."}
