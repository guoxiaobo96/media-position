(actually, a majority of catholic theologians disagree with this position.) only in the last 30 years has the concept of self-gift come to coexist with procreation in the catholic church as the criterion for the moral rightness of a sexual act, according to richard mccormick, professor of theology at the university of notre dame. self-gift, the seminarians are taught, can be used to explain what is wrong with masturbation (it involves no giving to another), lust (it involves taking rather than giving, thus reducing one's partner to the status of an object) and homosexuality (the other is not other, and thus self-gift is not really possible).", "augmented": []}

(a religious-order priest like a franciscan or jesuit makes an additional promise of poverty, and commits his life to his religious community and its particular mission.) in exchange for these sacrifices, a diocesan priest typically receives from his diocese a room, board, a place to retire when he is too old or sick to serve any longer and around $10,000 a year. it is perhaps not surprising that in contemporary america, with its focus on individualism and personal achievement, not to speak of wealth, the number of men seeking out this sort of existence has plummeted.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "joyce met proust once and they exchanged scarcely a word, even though they shared a cab together (neither had read the other). beckett wrote a small critical book about proust; woolf admired proust so intensely that she felt swamped by his genius. gide's bitterest regret was that as a founder of a fledgling but already prestigious publishing house, he turned down swann's way, the first volume of proust's masterpiece (he thought of proust as a superficial snob and a mere reporter of high-society events). genet began to write his first novel, our lady of the flowers, after reading the opening pages of proust's within a budding grove. genet was in prison and he arrived late in the exercise yard for the weekly book exchange; as a result he was forced to take the one book all the other prisoners had rejected. and yet once he'd read the opening pages of proust he shut the book, wanting to savor every paragraph over as long a period as possible. he said to himself; now, i'm tranquil, i know i'm going to go from marvel to marvel. his reading inspired him to write; he hoped to become the proust of the underclass.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "to clarify, senator moynihan did not introduce crack to the united states. he wrote a report, in 1965, titled the negro family: the case for national action, also known as the moynihan report. in it, he argued that black families had been battered and harassed by discrimination, injustice, and uprooting and were in a state of crisis. because the report made no formal policy recommendations, it was widely misunderstood to put blame on black families themselves, rather than broader systems of racial discrimination. (updated) representative tom malinowski, democrat from new jersey, told the times that when he worked for him in 1988, mr. moynihan proselytized senators that year about how the crack epidemic was devastating low-income communities, serving as a proponent of the antidrug legislation passed that session.", "augmented": []}
