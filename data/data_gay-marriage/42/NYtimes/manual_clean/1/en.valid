Such examinations run counter to our current desire for affirmative representation. But avoidance of uncomfortable truths is not the role of the artist. Healing is impossible if you don't understand the cause of the injury.
Other judges have faced consequences for similar stances on L.G.B.T. issues. A judge in Wyoming was censured in March for refusing to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies, and an Alabama judge was suspended in September for ordering probate judges to defy federal orders to issue marriage licenses.
I'm the last person in the world who's going to help the parties resolve their doctrinal differences, said Mr. Feinberg, who assisted in the church's mediation on a pro bono basis.
Some critics called for Judge Nance to resign or face ethics charges after Thursday's order. Chris Hartman, director of the Fairness Campaign, an L.G.B.T. advocacy group, said the order displayed clear discrimination.
No one piece of writing about our complex, sprawling community will ever tell the entire story, and I believe that is a good thing: It creates an unquenchable thirst for more and more narratives — a thirst that has been evident in audiences for The Inheritance and a thirst that the theater, television and film industries have been too slow to satisfy.
The Inheritance was not my attempt at a grand summation of the past quarter century of queer history. What I was attempting was an examination of class, economic inequality, and poverty within the gay community — issues I have rarely seen depicted in theater. I have painted on a broad canvas. It is simply not the canvas others might have chosen.
I wanted to write about addiction and alcoholism — a disease I have struggled with, and an epidemic that plagues our community just as perniciously as H.I.V./AIDS did 30 years ago. I also wanted to write about sex: how it can be used as a vehicle for pleasure and intimacy, but how it is also used as a tool to cauterize pain.
Responsibility to community is the first question we must answer for ourselves. I believe that in writing honestly about my experience as a gay man, I have also contributed one more example of what it means to be a Puerto Rican man.
The Family Foundation, a Lexington-based group that says it seeks to strengthen Kentucky families, offered praise for Judge Nance's decision, saying, Judges have a right of conscience like everyone else.
Conservatives, who seemed to have the upper hand after the vote tightening a ban on same-sex marriage, would get $25 million once their new denomination is formed and incorporated. All current clergy and lay employees of the denomination, even if they affiliate with the traditionalists, will get to keep their pension plans.
Despite the deep doctrinal disputes that led to the split, the negotiations were largely secular: process, governance, finances, said Kenneth R. Feinberg, the lawyer who helped craft the thorny settlements that arose from the 2010 BP oil spill and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
Critics of same-sex parenting have frequently pointed to a 2012 study by a University of Texas sociologist that suggests children of gay and lesbian parents are significantly different from children raised by heterosexual couples. That study has been roundly criticized by others in academia.
Local churches will choose whether to join any new traditionalist denomination or remain in the United Methodist Church. Several people interviewed on Friday believed that most American churches would stay, though there has not been any formal survey.
And while I examine race in The Inheritance, it is not one of its central themes. This is a decision for which I have been criticized, but it is a decision that I made consciously as a person of color. It is a consideration that is not asked of white writers, but it is one that writers of color must face with every project we begin.
The solution that we received is a welcome relief to the conflict we have been experiencing, said the Rev. Tom Berlin, who represented groups that opposed discrimination against L.G.B.T. people in the mediation. I am very encouraged that the United Methodist Church found a way to offer a resolution to a long conflict.
There's really no difference, which is actually quite remarkable when you think about the additional layer of stigma these children are growing up with, she said.
Judge Nance's decision to recuse himself comes less than two years after Kim Davis, a county clerk in Kentucky, defied federal court orders to issue same-sex marriage licenses because it went against her Christian beliefs. She was jailed for her refusal and became a symbol of the resistance to same-sex marriage.
The factions agreed to allocate $39 million to support communities historically marginalized by the sin of racism, according to the agreement. That sum includes $13 million the traditionalists contributed instead of receiving as part of their portion.
Art can be expected to hold a mirror up to society, but it cannot be expected to hold a mirror up to every individual who is engaging with it. Even with its long running time, there is a lot The Inheritance does not and cannot cover.
It is not everything that we would have hoped for, but we think it is a good agreement that gets us out of the decades-long conflict that we have experienced and enables us to focus on ministry in a positive way, said Tom Lambrecht, vice president of Good News, one of the conservative groups.
If we are going to let liberal judges write their personal biases and prejudices into law, as we have done on issues of marriage and sexuality, then, in the interest of fairness, we are going to have to allow judges with different views to at least recuse themselves from such cases, Martin Cothran, a spokesman for the group, said in a statement.
