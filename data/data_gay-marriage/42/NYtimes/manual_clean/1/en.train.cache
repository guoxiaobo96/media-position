I don't know who the goddess Gaya is, but that's not my God. I was just like, That's it. Click -- stopped the radio. Went over to the closet, pulled out my concert shirts and threw them in the trash can. Pulled out my James Taylor CD's -- dunk. See ya, James. Magat summed it up this way: You have to detach from these things, or you become numb to them. We're trying to live as a sign of contradiction in the world. But living as a sign of contradiction is not the same as retreating from the world altogether, and the seminarians struggle to achieve what they regard as the ideal balance: being in the world but not of it, a phrase they often repeat. They see themselves as witnesses -- testifying through their very presence and clerical attire to the Catholic Church and all that it holds true. Bashista provided an example: in the gym at Mount Saint Mary's, college students sometimes play music whose lyrics he finds objectionable. It's an opportunity, he said. It's a time to evangelize. You don't go up and rip the tape out, but you say: 'Can you share with me some of those words? I'm not sure I'm hearing them right.' A lot of times they don't even know what the words are. It's got to be proposing, not imposing, which is the tougher way. It's our Lord's way. Witnessing is crucial, say the seminarians, because the world is starving for the message they represent.
People do one of three things, Holloway says. Suddenly they get really nice, and they want you to think they're really good people. Somebody my age, they're calling me Sir. The second one is, people get very stony, like they're mad at you. They just glare. The third one is my favorite: you walk in and they do a double take and they look really scared, like, Why is he dressed like that? He knows my secrets! The sight of a Roman collar, the seminarians go on to explain, can have the power to flush profanity from conversations, douse lovers' fights and halt the scolding of children. Airplane rides are notorious for inspiring long queries from seatmates, Catholic and non-Catholic alike, even when the seminarian isn't wearing clerics; the sight of a breviary is often enough to set things off. (Priests regularly hear confessions on airplanes, I'm told, finding two back seats for that purpose whenever possible.) Jerome Magat, a brainy, energetic 26-year-old of Filipino descent, is a second-year seminarian, so he wears clerics off-campus only when attending a formal, ecclesiastical event or when visiting hospitals, homeless shelters, prisons and schools, which is part of the seminary program. It's that supernatural element, Magat says of the reactions his clerics provoke. There's a mystery about the priesthood. Some of that mystery inheres in the very nature of the Catholic priesthood.
The textbooks cover the same sweeping story, from the brutality of slavery to the struggle for civil rights. The self-evident truths of the founding documents to the waves of immigration that reshaped the nation.
Jerry Brandt, a promoter and entrepreneur who owned two nightclubs, the Electric Circus and the Ritz, that were attention-getting parts of New York's music scene in their day, died on Jan. 16 in Miami Beach. He was 82.
Karen Pence, the second lady of the United States, returned to teaching art this week, accepting a part-time position at a private Christian school that does not allow gay students and requires employees to affirm that marriage should only be between a man and a woman.
The vaccination rate picked up considerably last week, after the holiday period ended, and a number of governors announced plans to allow a broader swath of citizens to get shots. But states that expand the availability of the inoculations — announcing that people over 70, for example, can now get the vaccine — are finding demand so intense that online registration portals quickly overload and crash, call lines get flooded and available supply is exhausted in a matter of hours. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced Friday that he would release almost all available vaccine immediately after taking office on Jan. 20, rather than conserving half of it to ensure everyone who gets a first dose will also get a second a few weeks later. Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican, said on Sunday that whether doses should be conserved was a really interesting debate, because of concerns over whether production can be stepped up to get second shots to people in time. I just want to make sure we get as many out as fast as possible, without endangering people with regard to the second dose, he said on CNN's State of the Union. The Biden team is to announce this week a plan for ramping up the vaccination rate, including setting up vaccination sites run by the federal government in places like sports stadiums and high school gymnasiums. But Dr. Gottlieb said pharmacies, too, needed to quickly start offering the vaccine to their customers.
Ms. Michels, who goes by Mindy, was with a Canadian friend, and so Ms. Hartman, who lives in Amsterdam, thought she was also Canadian. Ms. Hartman was taken by her curly hair.
The differences between state editions can be traced back to several sources: state social studies standards; state laws; and feedback from panels of appointees that huddle, in Sacramento and Austin hotel conference rooms, to review drafts.
The result, according to Grofman, was that white less well-educated voters didn't desert the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party deserted them.
She told me, 'You have to leave,' he said. I remember coming home in the rain one day and finding all of my things on the front lawn. He was in his late teens at the time.
The Texas edition goes further to highlight criticism of federal efforts to subsidize the green energy industry: Republicans accuse the government of wasting taxpayers' money, for example by supporting the failed solar manufacturer Solyndra. The Solyndra controversy was a fixation for conservatives in 2011, when the company went bankrupt after accepting half a billion dollars in federally guaranteed loans.
Buttigieg has campaigned frequently with his husband, embracing him onstage, and has mentioned his marriage in debates. And he doesn't shy away from questions about his sexual orientation, which he didn't publicly acknowledge until the age of 33, shortly before his election to a second term as mayor of South Bend, Ind.

Covid-19 has deepened the challenges of adopting through the foster care system. Floyd Scott at home in The Dalles, Ore., where he lives with his adoptive family along with his siblings, Mesha and Jermain. Credit... Michael Hanson for The New York Times The last step in the long journey to adopt a child through the foster care system is the courtroom finalization. It's traditionally provided an important opportunity for loved ones to gather and pose for pictures as a judge blesses the creation of a new forever family with a smack of the gavel. But, like so many other things in the Covid-19 era, this tradition has gone virtual. We finalized our adoption over the phone, said Celeste Scott, who last May adopted her three youngest children — who were 4, 5 and 6 when they first came to live with her in the spring of 2019. It was kind of anticlimactic. Still, Scott, of The Dalles, Ore., knows she is fortunate to have finalized the adoptions at all. If she lived elsewhere in the country, she could very well still be waiting. The pandemic has created new challenges in the foster care system and worsened old ones — creating delays in placements and adoptions and forcing some older youth to exit the system amid a public health and economic crisis. The child welfare system is extremely complex and can vary widely by state, and even by county, said Celeste Bodner, executive director and founder of FosterClub, an advocacy organization for foster youth.
Caldwell's book is noteworthy for being a conservative account that effectively reinforces a liberal ideological narrative. It is usually liberals who argue that on every new culture-war battlefield their side is just extending Martin Luther King Jr.'s vision, while conservatives respond that the civil rights acts were supposed to correct a specific historical injustice and their application to debates over gender or marriage or abortion or the rights of illegal immigrants warps that purpose. Caldwell shrugs off this idea as a pleasant illusion; in his account the original critics of civil rights legislation were probably correct to warn against its revolutionary implications, which include the steady subsequent advance of cultural progressivism, an enormous expansion of deficit spending and the economic abandonment and cultural vilification of the white male working class.
This is about morals, said Steven Drahozal, the chair of the Dubuque County Democrats in Iowa. He said voters in Iowa, the critical early primary state, will actually appreciate a candidate who recognizes and acknowledges previous shortcomings. But he said Democratic candidates need to be acutely sensitive to those who in the past have been left behind. Not intending to offend is not an excuse,'' he said.
The eighth item on the application's Articles of Employment, which requires applicants to sign their initials next to a list of beliefs, outlines Immanuel Christian's definition of marriage and stances on sexual identity.
Why a Priest The number of men studying for the priesthood has plummeted, and the resulting shortage is a major problem for the Catholic Church. But for those enrolled at Mount Saint Mary's Seminary, it isn't the church that has to change -- it's the world. By JENNIFER EGAN Photographs By GRETA PRATT

Re Bermuda Revokes Same-Sex Marriage (news article, Feb. 9):
In this respect, as in so many others, Marcel was the opposite of his hearty, healthy brother, Robert, born two years later, on May 24, 1873, in more prosperous and settled times. The two brothers were perfect companions as children and remained very close all their lives, although it was the robust younger brother, Robert, who often played the role of protector to the asthmatic Marcel. Like his father, Robert became a doctor--and a womanizer--yet the two brothers never quarreled, and lived their whole lives in the most complete harmony. In the 1890s both brothers were Dreyfusards. At the end of his life Marcel asked Robert to intervene and secure for him the Legion of Honor and, once this honor was obtained, to confer it on him. Robert was at Marcel's bedside when he died, and after his death it was Robert who oversaw the publication of the last two volumes of his masterpiece as well as his selected correspondence.

Christopher Federico, a professor of political science and psychology at the University of Minnesota, described the key roles of education and employment opportunity in the right-wing mobilization of less-educated white men:
responded to the housing crisis with bailouts of the lenders and interlinked financial institutions, not of the folks losing their homes. And the stagnation of wages and income for the middle and bottom of the income distribution continued under Obama. And the various Covid aid packages, while they include payments to the unemployed, are also helping big businesses more than the small businesses that have been and will be permanently going out of business due to the lockdowns (and they include various forms of pork.
On Monday, he used his speech to laud Mr. Brown's tenure; the mention of his predecessor's name drew a standing ovation. But Mr. Newsom left little doubt that he had a broader view of government than the moderate Mr. Brown. The departing governor inherited a $28 billion deficit and left Mr. Newsom a $14 billion surplus; he also created an $18 billion so-called rainy day fund to help the state get through what is widely viewed as an inevitable coming recession.
Lena Dunham reviews Meg Wolitzer's The Female Persuasion for this week's cover. Five years ago, Liesl Schillinger reviewed The Interestings and considered Wolitzer's place in American fiction. Below is an excerpt.
Hundreds of differences — some subtle, others extensive — emerged in a New York Times analysis of eight commonly used American history textbooks in California and Texas, two of the nation's largest markets.
Mr. Teague's story is featured at the end of a chapter on recent immigration, alongside accounts from a Vietnamese immigrant and a second-generation Mexican-American.
Pastor Thomas says that releasing feelings of shame and unworthiness takes time and the support of a loving community. He adds, however, that being ostracized by religion can be a blessing in disguise if it pushes one to develop a more authentic personal faith.
As the gay rights movement spread from San Francisco and New York in the 1970s, Mr. Baker was often asked by friends aware of his creative talents to make banners for protests and marches. His creations, like others during that time, often included the pink triangle, which protesters had claimed as an icon after its initial use by the Nazis to identify gay men in concentration camps during World War II.
n a sunny Saturday, I rode with Bashista from Mount Saint Mary's to Blessed Sacrament, the parish in Arlington where he served last summer and now spends two weekends each month. We drove in the low-slung gold Honda Civic that he purchased during his architecture days, and I asked Bashista what has become of that old egotistical, materialistic version of himself. It's there, but it's been transformed, he said. St. Paul said, I'm a new creation. The old self is dead. And in a sense that's true. Now, Bashista said, the energy he once spent serving his own interests is directed toward other people who need his help, both in prayer and in deed; like most seminarians, he keeps lists of people who have asked him to pray for them, or else he prays for them in the moment of promising to do so. According to the Pope's theology of the body, the passionate intensity of sexual love is also the model for celibate love -- the total self-donation of a priest to his people. The needs of the sick and the poor are a particular focus; there is perhaps no setting in America -- neither the halls of government nor the campuses of elite colleges anymore -- where you hear the poor evoked more often, and more sympathetically, than in a Catholic seminary. At Blessed Sacrament, Bashista checked in with the pastor and made some last-minute adjustments to his homily, which he would deliver at Mass that evening.
The original Queer Eye was like a stealth mission to straight America's vanity cabinets, built on the idea of gay men as arbiters of cool. It had its own political context. The fall after its premiere, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriage legal. In the next year's midterm election, a host of ballot initiatives banning such marriages passed.
Still, recent textbooks have come a long way from what was published in past decades. Both Texas and California volumes deal more bluntly with the cruelty of the slave trade, eschewing several myths that were common in textbooks for generations: that some slave owners treated enslaved people kindly and that African-Americans were better off enslaved than free. The books also devote more space to the women's movement and balance the narrative of European immigration with stories of Latino and Asian immigrants.

Peppered throughout California books are passages on topics like same-sex families under slavery and early sex reassignment surgery in the 1950s — text that does not appear in Texas versions.
Larger than each work is the engaging impression created by Ms. Kent's dancers. They carry the evening. They aren't, however enriched or extended by it.
McGraw-Hill, the publisher whose annotated Bill of Rights appears differently in the two states, said it had created the additional wording on the Second Amendment and gun control for the California textbook. A national version of the pages is similar to the Texas edition, which does not call attention to gun rights, the company said in a written statement.

But even as he acknowledges the faults of populism, Lind treats the class-war aspect of polarization as a potentially positive development, because he hopes that it will create a real political coalition for the losers of neoliberal era — a socially conservative, economically left-leaning constituency that's numerous but often homeless. Making such a coalition constructive rather than just disruptive may be impossible, but it's the only way he sees to escape neoliberal oligarchy and bring our class war to an end with a negotiated peace.
I'm grateful to the religious community that I grew up in because the challenges that they presented have brought me to the place I am today, he said. I'm also thankful for my sexual orientation because it has opened me to deeper ways of being in relationship to God.
(It is customary for family members or friends to pay for a seminarian's gold or silver chalice, the cup in which wine and water are believed to be transformed into Christ's blood, and whose essential role in a priest's life is likened to a doctor's stethoscope.)
The textbook companies are not gearing their textbooks toward teachers; they're gearing their textbooks toward states, she said.
Graham Greene once wrote: Proust was the greatest novelist of the twentieth century, just as Tolstoy was in the nineteenth.... For those who began to write at the end of the twenties or the beginning of the thirties, there were two great inescapable influences: Proust and Freud, who are mutually complementary. Certainly Proust's fame and prestige have eclipsed those of Joyce, Beckett, Virginia Woolf and Faulkner, of Hemingway and Fitzgerald, of Gide and Valery and Genet, of Thomas Mann and Bertolt Brecht, for if some of these writers are more celebrated than Proust in their own country, Proust is the only one to have a uniformly international reputation. The young Andrew Holleran, who would go on to publish the most important American gay novel of the seventies, Dancer from the Dance, wrote a friend eight years earlier: Robert, much has happened: That is, I finally finished Remembrance of Things Past and I don't know what to say--the idea that Joyce ended the novel is so absurd; it's Proust who ended the novel, simply by doing something so complete, monumental, perfect, that what the fuck can you do afterwards?
In New York during the 1970s one popular T-shirt, using the Yiddish word for a female gossip, brandished the slogan Proust Is a Yenta!
None of these forces diminishes the key role of racial animosity and racism. Instead, they intensify racial resentment.
Mr. Gabbard, who has been a state lawmaker since 2006, has been an outspoken anti-gay activist. In addition to the Alliance for Traditional Marriage, he also ran a group called Stop Promoting Homosexuality America and hosted an anti-gay radio show called Let's Talk Straight Hawaii, according to Honolulu Civil Beat, a news organization.
Political strategists and crisis communication experts said the sensitivity speaks to how quickly the center of gravity has shifted for Democrats on key issues. As recently as 2006, national Democrats including former President Barack Obama expressed wariness about immigrants' ability to assimilate into American culture and did not openly embrace gay marriage — two talking points that would probably be deeply damaging for any 2020 candidate.
One of Proust's ex-lovers and his most constant friend, Reynaldo Hahn, the composer, recalled that soon after he met Proust they were walking through a garden when suddenly Proust stopped dead before a rosebush. He asked Hahn to continue walking without him. When at last Hahn circled back, after going around the chateau, I found him at the same place, staring at the roses. His head tilting forward, his face very serious, he blinked, his eyebrows slightly furrowed as though from a passionate act of attention, and with his left hand he was obstinately pushing the end of his little black mustache between his lips and nibbling on it.... How many times I've observed Marcel in these mysterious moments in which he was communicating totally with nature, with art, with life, in these `deep minutes' in which his entire being was concentrated.... Typically, Proust also invoked this very scene, but said that inhaling the moment was ineffectual; only the sudden, unprompted awakenings of memory, triggered by something illogical and unforeseen (the madeleine, for example), could invoke the past in its entirety.
Mr. Brown and Mr. Gomes both create stage worlds that contain same-sex partnering as well as conventionally heterosexual duets; both allow for those same-sex relationships to be interpreted in sexual terms. Although Mr. Brown is much the least experienced dance-maker of this program's three, he's the one with the strongest sense of structural suspense. One group of four (one woman, three men) is juxtaposed with another of six (three male-female couples); and what he does with each group keeps you wondering what will happen next. A sustained duet for two men looks natural: a study of intimate cooperation.
These additions are part of the reason California books are almost always longer than their Texas counterparts.
An ocean of innuendo has always surrounded Mr. Johar's sexuality. He has done more than anybody to introduce the idea of homosexuality into the Indian home. It would seem no closet door was better primed to spring open than his. And yet when he tries the latch, he finds it sticks. The only time I'm tight-lipped is when I'm asked about my sexuality, he writes in his recently published memoir, An Unsuitable Boy. It's the only part of me I feel I've caged.
But Texas students will read that some critics dismissed the quality of literature produced.
The website of the school, Immanuel Christian School, which enrolls kindergartners through eighth graders at its campus in Springfield, Va., details its religious beliefs and expectations of both students and their parents, as well as those who wish to work there. The school's employment application requires candidates to describe their faith in Jesus Christ, affirm that they are a born-again Christian and vow to adhere to specific standards in their personal and professional lives.
The pope's doctor has died of Covid-19 complications. Pope Francis with Dr. Fabrizio Soccorsi right, his personal physician, in an undated photo. Credit... Osservatore Romano, via EPA/Shutterstock Pope Francis's personal physician, Dr. Fabrizio Soccorsi, died on Saturday as a result of the coronavirus, the Vatican said. Dr. Soccorsi, 78, had been in hospitalized at the Gemelli Hospital in Rome and was being treated for cancer, but died because of complications from Covid-19, according to Vatican News, the Vatican's online news portal. Francis selected Dr. Soccorsi to be his personal physician in 2015. Dr. Soccorsi specialized in internal medicine, and served for a time as the chairman of the hepatology department at the San Camillo Hospital in Rome. He also taught immunology at the Rome and Lazio Region Medical School. The Vatican newspaper, l'Osservatore Romano, wrote in an obituary published on Saturday that Dr. Soccorsi had been profoundly affected, by the premature death of his daughter, Cristiana, in June 2017. Social distancing measures and other pandemic safety protocols were imposed in Vatican City in March. Since then, several senior church figures, including cardinals, have tested positive for the virus. In all, twenty-seven residents of Vatican City, out of a total population of roughly 800, have tested positive, according to a New York Times database. In a television interview scheduled for broadcast in Italy Sunday evening, the pope said he would be vaccinated as soon as this week, and he called on everyone to get vaccinated when possible, calling it an ethical choice to do so.
Marcel Proust was the son of a Christian father and a Jewish mother. He himself was baptized (on August 5, 1871, at the church of Saint-Louis d'Antin) and later confirmed as a Catholic, but he never practiced that faith and as an adult could best be described as a mystical atheist, someone imbued with spirituality who nonetheless did not believe in a personal God, much less in a savior. Although Jews trace their religion through their mothers, Proust never considered himself Jewish and even became vexed when a newspaper article listed him as a Jewish author. His father once warned him not to stay in a certain hotel since there were too many Jewish guests there, and, to be sure, in Remembrance of Things Past there are unflattering caricatures of the members of one Jewish family, the Blochs. Jews were still considered exotic, even oriental, in France; in 1872 there were only eighty-six thousand Jews in the whole country. In a typically offensive passage Proust writes that in a French drawing room a Jew making his entry as though he were emerging from the desert, his body crouching like a hyena's, his neck thrust forward, offering profound `salaams,' completely satisfies a certain taste for the oriental.
But others said it had become clear that for conservative Christians, the cultural and political issues that define modern conservative politics mattered at least as much as moral piety. That was why, they suggested, Mr. Bentley was able to cling to his job for nearly 13 months after his reputation as a paragon of probity came under fire.
But now we've had 20 years of a very strong pontificate. I think we're at a new era, and these men represent it. Among liberal Catholics, including liberal priests -- many of whom regard John Paul II as authoritarian and reactionary -- there is the perception that new seminarians like those at Mount St. Mary's are rigid and narrow-minded, merely parroting the Pope's views without learning to think for themselves. Certainly there is a passionate devotion to the Pope among the men of Mount St. Mary's. They often quote him -- in particular the phrase, Be not afraid. Bashista put it this way: We're the John Paul II generation. That's a great sign of hope. But at the gallery, the seminarians scrutinized Medieval and Renaissance paintings with a feverish -- and sometimes wistful -- attention to the past, a past that still pertains directly to their lives. Raphael Hall, 42, one of five seminarians at Mount St. Mary's from the Franciscan Missionaries of the Eternal Word in Birmingham, Ala., moved about the gallery in a brown Franciscan habit, the beads of a long wooden rosary clicking softly from his cord belt as he searched for works by Fra Angelico, a 15th-century Franciscan painter who would have dressed almost identically. There were chalices and vestments on display -- the very items that Bashista and the other deacons were in the process of choosing before their ordinations.
Southern whites resisted Reconstruction, according to a McGraw-Hill textbook, because they did not want African-Americans to have more rights. But the Texas edition offers an additional reason: Reforms cost money, and that meant higher taxes.
His worst flaw here, one from which Mr. Gomes's work also suffers, is cuteness. Dancers flirt with the audience and jokily vie for attention in ways that shatter the stage reality they've been building together. The music is Rossini's unusually scored but appealing Duet for Cello and Double Bass in D major. If Mr. Brown can pare away his immaturities, he may yet become a choreographer.
But for recent California editions, publishers wrote thousands of words of new text in response to the FAIR Education Act, a law signed by Governor Brown in 2011. It requires schools to teach the contributions of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and disabled Americans.
While I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country, turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate, he said. Wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldn't have happened two elections ago lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day, even if they are nothing like me in their experience.
Proust's father, Adrien, thirty-five years old when Marcel was born, came from a far more humble background, though he rose to great heights in the medical profession. His father had been a grocer in Illiers (the name is derived from that of Saint Hilaire), a village near the cathedral town of Chartres, south of Paris; Marcel gave the village the name of Combray, and today it is known officially as Illiers-Combray and has become a major goal for Proust pilgrims from all over the world. (The local bakeries are all grinding out madeleines in Proust's honor, and the house where he and his family summered has become a museum. Perhaps in another century the name Illiers will be dropped altogether as life completely surrenders to the tyranny of art.)
We would not have Trump as president if the Democrats had remained the party of the working class. The decline of labor unions proceeded at the same rate when Democrats were president as when Republicans were president; the same is, I believe, true of loss of manufacturing jobs as plants moved overseas.
There have always been infertile straight couples in need of donor sperm, but with the legalization of gay marriage and the rise of elective single motherhood, the market has expanded over the last decade. About 20 percent of sperm bank clients are heterosexual couples, 60 percent are gay women, and 20 percent are single moms by choice, the banks said.
Many lines of conflict mutually reinforce each other rather than crosscut: Less educated whites tend to be more Evangelical and more racist, and they live in geographical spaces with less economic momentum.
A picture caption with an article on Saturday about the United Methodist Church's plan to split over same-sex marriage misstated the location of two churches shown in a collection of images. The church in the top-right image is in Winona, Minn., not Homer, Ark.; the church in the bottom right photo is in Highland Falls, N.Y., not High Falls, N.Y. The caption also referred incorrectly to the United Methodist Church. It is the second-largest Protestant denomination in the United States, not in the world.
One recent morning, Mr. Prager was recording an Ultimate Issues Hour radio segment. He's written eight books (one is The Ten Commandments: Still the Best Moral Code), and since 1999 has hosted The Dennis Prager Show on the conservative Christian radio syndicate Salem.
Gilbert Baker, a self-described gay Betsy Ross who in 1978 hand-dyed and stitched together eight strips of vibrantly colored fabric into a rainbow flag, instantly creating an enduring international symbol of gay pride, was found dead on Friday at his home in New York City. He was 65.
The California edition does not mention Solyndra or the other nations. However, it does include a section on the threat to American states and cities from rising sea levels, noting that the impact on tourism in Florida could hurt that state's economy, and that transportation networks and buildings could be threatened.
This rang true even for young local voters, who in the week leading up to the inauguration described feeling elated. Jean Peterson, a paralegal in Denver who turns 26 this week, described watching Mr. Polis's November victory speech with her girlfriend, tears in her eyes.
Brice Thomas, the lead pastor, says he first grasped religion's capacity for harm when his father, a Pentecostal faith healer, died of a treatable skin cancer because the church did not believe in going to doctors. After a stint in the military, Mr. Thomas, who is gay, became ordained in the United Church of Christ, one of the first denominations to affirm marriage equality, and took up his duties in Nashville last year. Together with Jennifer Strickland, a licensed therapist, he is setting up a Recovering from Religious Trauma Syndrome group at the church.
In September 2016, Renate Hartman attended the Association for Women's Rights in Development International Forum conference in Bahia, Brazil. Also called Feminist Futures, it drew 2,000 people from around the world working for women's and L.G.B.T.Q. rights.
Texas policymakers feel strongly about giving students a positive view of the American economy; since 1995, state law has required that high school economics courses offer an emphasis on the free enterprise system and its benefits. That emphasis seems to have made its way into the history curriculum as well.
When it comes to politicians, he said he marks a sharp divide between political life and personal life, and he argues that the president's personal behavior is irrelevant to his public message.
At the same time, though, and here I will quote Grofman at length:
Racism is the key construct here in understanding why this sort of violence is possible. The other explanations would be the pathways through which racism creates these conditions. An individual experiences their standing in society as relative and comparative, so sometimes the gains of other groups feel like losses to Whites. Whites in the last 60 years have seen minoritized folks gain more political power, economic and educational opportunity. Even though these gains are grossly exaggerated, Whites experience them as a loss in group status.
As hospitals overflow with Covid patients, ambulance teams face tough decisions. An ambulance near downtown Atlanta. You've got to worry — is there a breaking point? said the director for emergency services in one Georgia county. Credit... Dustin Chambers for The New York Times As the coronavirus has surged through the winter, some ambulance crews have struggled to keep pace with the number of patients requiring emergency care, and staffing and bed shortages at hospitals have led to hours of waiting to unload patients. Ambulance crews have been transporting the relentless tide of Covid-19 patients as the post-holiday surge accelerated: The United States reported 300,594 new cases on Friday and more than 4,100 deaths on Thursday, both single-day records. Hospitalizations remained at near-record levels, with 130,777 patients on Saturday, according to the Covid Tracking Project, while the nation's vaccine rollout is off to a slow start. In the Augusta, Ga., area, all three major hospitals were out of beds last week, said Steven Vincent, the vice president of Gold Cross EMS in Augusta. Waiting until a bed is available can sometimes take hours, he said, so ambulance crews have often opt to continue driving to other hospitals or trauma centers many miles away. Some hospitals have erected medical tents outside so that emergency medical service crews can split up, one member waiting with the patient and while the ambulance leaves to answer another call. Right now, our hospitals are completely full, Mr. Vincent said.
She said she objected to students being taught that homosexuality is normal and natural and feared that the anti-bullying resolution would mean inviting homosexual-advocacy organizations into our schools to promote their agenda to our vulnerable youth, according to The New Yorker.
White resistance to black progress is covered differently in the two states. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Continuity and Change, California, P. 505 California notes the suburban dream of the 1950s was inaccessible to many African-Americans. McGraw-Hill, United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 436 Texas does not.
Many people also want smart sperm. That's why some big banks are near elite colleges. They have sperm collection centers in Palo Alto, Calif., near Stanford University, and Cambridge, Mass., near Harvard. College men are one of the most reliable groups to see the potential chaos of creating maybe 50 biological children around the world in exchange for about $4,000 over several months — and decide it is a good deal.
Critics of California's approach say that making state standards and textbooks longer and more inclusive can be overwhelming to teachers trying to move quickly through hundreds of years of material.
Here's another example: Teenagers in both states will learn about the Harlem Renaissance and debates about the movement's impact on African-American life.
He got the job. Four years later, the location change paid off handsomely.
Will the man chosen to be the next Pope be willing to give bishops greater autonomy -- thus opening the door for discussion of other changes, like relaxing the moral doctrine and even reconsidering celibacy and the role of women? Whatever happens, the Catholic laity may well continue do as it thinks best in the moral sphere. American Catholics have matured, says William D'Antonio, a research professor at Catholic University. Vatican II has succeeded. The real documents of Vatican II are freedom of conscience and the responsibility of individuals not to blithely follow the leader. According to the University of Maryland Survey Research Center, more than two-thirds of Catholics say that when their conscience is at odds with the Pope, they should follow their conscience.

Fesen's story -- of having his vocation acknowledged by someone else before he knew it himself -- is one you hear repeatedly from seminarians, many of whom fell away from the church at some point in their lives. Michael Dobbins, 32, a husky, mirthful deacon from Arlington and therefore a D.B., or diocesan brother, to Bashista, had the sort of childhood that might have resulted in a fairly direct journey to the priesthood in a prior era. I played Mass as a kid, he says. My sisters were the altar boys. My dad had this old copper chalice for his beer on football Sundays, so I used that. And Wonder Bread, something white, you'd press it down flat and use a glass to cut a circle out. I wasn't very clear on the vestments, so I used a big bedspread. In college, though, Dobbins stopped going to a Catholic church and began attending a Baptist church instead, where he became involved with a Baptist woman. At one point in college, he was briefly engaged. In my last year, he recounts, I was reading my Bible, and I got to John 6. At the end it says, 'And some of his disciples no longer followed him.' I'd read that a thousand times before, but something in that passage hit me like a big brick. And I was like, holy cow -- that's me. I cried like a baby.
That an intricate discussion of sex and morality was being conducted by 40 men and one woman who have taken vows of celibacy is a stark reminder of a major difficulty facing the Catholic Church in America: how can a celibate clergy persuade sexually active lay people to allow the church to regulate their sex lives? For while American Catholics tend to believe and accept the church's teaching on most doctrinal issues, according to Gallup polls, more than 80 percent of them, in defiance of doctrine, approve of artificial contraception, two-thirds say that premarital sex is morally acceptable (among Catholics under 35, the figure is as high as 9 out of 10), nearly half say that homosexual activity can be morally acceptable and roughly half say that abortion (excluding late-term partial birth abortions) should be legal in many or all cases. In addition, most American Catholics would support a married clergy, and most approve of the notion of female priests. 'Any time Jerry hooked up with some girl in ''Seinfeld,'' we knew they were sleeping together,' Magat says. 'Should I find these things funny? This is the stuff I'm going to be preaching against!' Magat stopped watching 'Seinfeld,' but kept track of what was happening to the very end from nonseminary friends.
Like some American colleges, it is testing people extensively and even sifting through sewage for traces of the virus. The goal, Professor Tan said, is to make sure there are no infections among the students, faculty and staff members at N.U.S.
The U.S. vaccine rollout needs to 'hit the reset,' an ex-F.D.A. chief says. Health workers prepared doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for mass inoculations at the Arizona State Fairgrounds in Phoenix this month. Credit... Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times Warning that vaccines are the only backstop the country has against fast-spreading new variants of the coronavirus, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said Sunday that federal and state leaders need to hit the reset and adopt a new strategy to get far more shots into arms as soon as possible. Speaking on Face the Nation on CBS News, Dr. Gottlieb said the 40 million doses currently available could go a long way toward protecting the nation's 50 million residents who are 65 and older in particular. I think we need to take an all-of-the-above approach and push it out through different channels, Dr. Gottlieb said, including the big-box stores, including federal sites that the Biden administration is talking about standing up. We need to try everything right now to create multiple distribution points. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 22.1 million doses had been sent to states as of Friday but only about 6.7 million people had received the first of two necessary doses. That data lags the most recent allocations by at least a few days.
Proust's mother was pregnant with him during the Franco-Prussian War and the difficult aftermath of France's defeat, the period when Napoleon III was chased from the throne and a socialist commune was briefly declared in Paris before the Third Republic was at last established. During the months of war and the internecine street fighting, coal and wood supplies ran out and houses went unheated. In Paris the starving populace ate dogs and cats, even the animals in the zoo. As a result, Jeanne Proust was so weakened from hunger and anxiety that when Marcel was born he was sickly and fragile and at first not expected to live.
We analyzed some of the most popular social studies textbooks used in California and Texas. Here's how political divides shape what students learn about the nation's history.
Everyone had a sharp memory to share. Jean Cocteau, the poet-playwright-impresario-filmmaker (Beauty and the Beast), recalled Proust's voice: Just as the voice of a ventriloquist comes out of his chest, so Proust's emerged from his soul. The writer Leon-Paul Fargue remembered seeing Proust towards the end of his life, completely pale, with his hair down to his eyebrows, his beard, so black it was blue, devouring his face.... Fargue noticed the long sleeves covering frozen hands, the Persian, almond-shaped eyes. He looked like a man who no longer lives outdoors or by day, a hermit who hasn't emerged from his oak tree for a long time, with something pained about the face, the expression of suffering that has just begun to be calmed. He seemed possessed by a bitter goodness. A young aristocratic woman recalled that when she was a girl she was supposed to be presented to him at a ball, but the great writer, livid and bearded, wearing the collar of his overcoat turned up, stared at her with such intensity that when they were finally introduced she was so frightened she nearly fainted.
Stephanie Kugler, an eighth-grade history teacher in West Sacramento, Calif., said she had expanded an idea mentioned briefly in her classroom's textbook, about women who dressed as men to fight in the Civil War and continued to live as men, into an entire lesson on troops who today would be considered transgender. The students read accounts of those soldiers' lives alongside more traditional sources, such as letters written by a black Union soldier and a Confederate soldier.
The new governor also said he would propose in his new budget, due out later this week, mandating that all Californians obtain health care insurance, in direct response to the Republican tax bill last year that removed the mandate from the Affordable Care Act. Such a mandate in California would require approval of the Legislature, which is far from assured.
Immigration and nativism are major themes in American history textbooks. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Continuity and Change, California, P. 736 California includes an excerpt from a novel about a Dominican-American family. McGraw-Hill, United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 609 In the same place, Texas highlights the voice of a Border Patrol agent.
very consistent and compelling evidence to suggest the some of what we have witnessed this past week is a reflection of the angst, anger, and refusal to accept an America' in which White (Christian) Americans are losing dominance, be it political, material, and/or cultural. And, I use the term dominance here, because it is not simply a loss of status. It is a loss of power. A more racially, ethnically, religiously diverse US that is also a democracy requires White Americans to acquiesce to the interests and concerns of racial/ethnic and religious minorities.
She's with you, too. You're not suffering alone, O.K.? We're suffering with you. The woman watched him desperately over her bucking chest. She could not take Communion because of the respirator, so Bashista offered her a spiritual communion instead. He placed the heel of his palm against her forehead and spread his fingers to encompass the front of her skull. As he prayed aloud, she closed her eyes. Watching this, I remembered something Bashista told me once: If the church is your bride, intimacy is what you have caring for the sick. You're giving of yourself, and it's being received. There is nothing more gratifying. When the prayer was done, the woman relaxed into her pillow, as if some tension inside her had been set free. After some minutes, Bashista gently extricated his hand from hers. I'll be back in two weeks, he told her. You'll probably be home by then. I'll come find you. Afterward, he told me: If this life were all there was, I couldn't do that. Suffering and pain are senseless if there's not an afterlife. This woman might see Jesus face to face tonight, and don't get me wrong -- he chuckled -- life is wonderful, it's a gift from God. But we're pilgrims here. This is not our home. Later, the bright, modern church in Arlington was packed for 5:00 Mass, which features 11 white-gloved parishioners, known as dingers, ringing hand bells, and seven singing children.

It paves the way for L.G.B.T.Q. Bermudians to become society's scapegoat, to be blamed for any slide in foreign tourism and negative impact on the country's economy.

In terms of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' of watching people become more Trumpian, these moral icons becoming shills, he is way up there, said Charlie Sykes, the author of How the Right Lost Its Mind, and a former radio host who used to occasionally substitute on Mr. Prager's show. Now you have to put PragerU in the category of other very successful meme machines and low-rent conservative grifting.
He won that election, and then another in 2014. But Dianne Bentley filed for divorce the next year. Months later, an ousted state official accused Mr. Bentley of having an affair with Rebekah Caldwell Mason, a top aide and former beauty pageant contestant whom he had taught in Sunday school in Tuscaloosa. Lurid audio recordings became public, and on Friday, a special counsel concluded that the governor had committed an array of misdeeds to try to cover up the inappropriate relationship that had led to Mr. Bentley and Ms. Mason leaving their congregation.
When the prosecutors appealed, they argued, with a straight face, that what had happened to J.T. was so outrageous and illegal that the New Orleans district attorney could not be held responsible. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court.

A coronavirus infection at an air traffic control center near Washington causes delays. The Washington Air Traffic Control Center in Leesburg, Va., in 2001. Credit... Paul Hosefros/The New York Times Delays were reported at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport after an air traffic control center that serves the area reported a coronavirus infection and closed for cleaning on Sunday, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center, located in Leesburg, Va., was closed from 11:45 a.m. to 1:45 p.m. for cleaning. It is one of 20 such centers in the United States, which generally provide service to aircraft while they are en route, as opposed to airport control towers, which handle takeoffs and landings. While the center was closed, the controllers worked from an alternate location, the F.A.A. said, and airplanes were routed around the airspace or handled by underlying facilities. Reagan airport attributed delays of more than 45 minutes to the Washington Center's closure but no others in the region did. The delays appear to have been resolved by midafternoon. There have been at least 13 prior reported cases at the center, according to the F.A.A. It was not immediately clear if any of those had resulted in closures of the facility. Other air route traffic control centers have similarly closed for cleaning after infections were discovered over the past few months, resulting in widespread delays. In December, the one in Memphis was closed for cleaning after an employee tested positive, resulting in slight delays.
(In contemporary Catholicism, the sabbath begins on Saturday night.) Then he stopped at the chapel to pick up our Lord -- that is, the consecrated Hosts, which he carries to Inova Alexandria Hospital in a gold-plated cylinder called a pyx. At the hospital reception desk, Bashista was given a printed list of Catholic patients to whom he would offer Communion. First we headed for intensive care; he had been told there was a parishioner from Blessed Sacrament there. As usual, Bashista wore his clerics and Roman collar; when people he passed in the hospital halls met his eye, he smiled and said hello, and when they avoided his gaze, he let it pass. The woman in intensive care, who appeared to be in her 50's, was attached to a respirator. It hiked up her chest every few seconds and injected air into her lungs with a gasping noise. Her skin was deeply jaundiced everywhere but her hands, which were bright purple. Bashista stood close to the woman and leaned over her. When he spoke her name, her eyelids parted and she looked up at him. Bashista introduced himself and asked how she was feeling, but she couldn't speak; the respirator attachment filled her mouth. He leaned close and took one of her plum-colored hands in his. You've got a good strong grip, he said. A priest had told Bashista that the woman felt close to a guardian angel, whom she had named. Father told me about Emily, Bashista said now. She's a sweet little angel.
Conservatives have fought for schools to promote patriotism, highlight the influence of Christianity and celebrate the founding fathers. In a September speech, President Trump warned against a radical left that wants to erase American history, crush religious liberty, indoctrinate our students with left-wing ideology.
On Thursday night, Mr. Gabbard said all of that was in his daughter's past.
But Mr. Brandt's successes, especially with the Ritz, caught their cultural moment and propelled it forward. At the Ritz, he not only booked an expansive range of bands; he also brought new technologies into the mix.
A priest is called to be an alter Christus, to stand in the Person of Christ and perform the sacraments, through which grace is conferred by God. Nowadays, though, the distance between the Catholic priesthood and the surrounding culture has given it a near occult mystique. As America hurtles forward unblinkingly into the consumer-driven, technological and environmental unknown, the Catholic priesthood remains becalmed in a zone of otherworldly preoccupations relatively unbuffeted by present-day vicissitudes. Today, as, say, 500 years ago, a man -- and only a man -- who senses he has a vocation, or a call from God to the priesthood, hands over his life irrevocably to the church, promising celibacy and obedience. Now, as centuries ago, he answers to the bishop of his diocese, celebrates the Mass, performs the sacraments and, if he has been appointed a pastor, oversees and maintains the solvency of his parish. (A religious-order priest like a Franciscan or Jesuit makes an additional promise of poverty, and commits his life to his religious community and its particular mission.) In exchange for these sacrifices, a diocesan priest typically receives from his diocese a room, board, a place to retire when he is too old or sick to serve any longer and around $10,000 a year. It is perhaps not surprising that in contemporary America, with its focus on individualism and personal achievement, not to speak of wealth, the number of men seeking out this sort of existence has plummeted.
atch people's faces when we come in the door, Tom Holloway says. Holloway is a 29-year-old fourth-year Catholic seminarian at Mount Saint Mary's Seminary, and on this stunningly cold winter night, he and six other seminarians have driven to a diner not far from Emmitsburg, Md., where the seminary is situated, to have dessert. Holloway and two others in their fourth and last year, Brian Bashista and Damien Cook, are wearing clerical attire, or clerics, as they call them: black slacks, black shirts, Roman collars. They have already been ordained as deacons; they've made solemn promises of celibacy and obedience, and can perform baptisms and preside at marriages, as well as preach. They will be ordained as priests later this spring. As they enter the diner, a collective awareness seizes the room, much the way it might in the presence of someone famous. People either look up, or resolutely avoid looking up. After the seminarians settle in at a round table, Holloway, a slight, fair-haired man from Peoria, Ill., expands upon the reactions I've just seen -- a phenomenon seminarians refer to as the head-turn effect. Jennifer Egan writes frequently for the magazine. Her last article was about homosexuals in the military.
For Mr. Miller, who grew up in Colorado's more conservative, red-leaning Western Slope, the election of a gay governor was all the more satisfying for being in his own state. For me, on election night, seeing Jared and Marlon up on that stage and him giving his victory speech — I so much would have loved to have known what that would have felt like back when I was in high school, he said.
Reliable numbers are tough to find in Sperm World. Researchers cite data collected in the 1980s to estimate the number of children born by donor sperm in the United States at anywhere from 30,000 to 60,000 a year, though advocates push back even on that range, saying there are no dependable figures because there is no regulation. Sperm banking itself was about a $4 billion industry in 2018.

Ms. Green said she preferred to assign primary sources that encourage students to explore history on their own. But she said she would welcome textbooks that contain more historical documents and a greater diversity of voices and themes from the past.
And this is where Caldwell's account becomes unpersuasive in its turn. He depicts federal economic policymaking after the civil rights era as a hugely expensive attempt at integrating Americans by race and sex, a project paid for after Ronald Reagan by deficits rather than transfers. But as Wesley Yang points out in a review of The Age of Entitlement for The Washington Examiner, there's little evidence that American public policy actually transfers lots of money from whites to minorities; the spending that Reagan's deficits funded was for the military and old-age entitlements, both of which flowed far more into white pocketbooks than black ones. Nor were the economic policies that have arguably harmed working class whites the most somehow a necessary extension of civil rights legislation: China's entry into the World Trade Organization, to choose one signal example, was not somehow foreordained when L.B.J. set pen to paper.
California's curriculum materials, by contrast, sometimes read like a brief from a Bernie Sanders rally. The yawning gap between the haves and have-nots and what is to be done about it is one of the great questions of this time, says the state's 2016 social studies framework.
We're trying to get creative, because it is rough right now. The intensity has taken an emotional and physical toll on the emergency medical workers, he said. They are stressed, they are overworked. It's been a struggle, no doubt about it. In Habersham County, in the state's northeast, the average number of calls per day for emergency medical service crews has been far higher than usual, said Chad Black, the director for emergency services for the county and the board chairman of the Georgia E.M.S. Association. About every other call is related to Covid, he said, and ambulances have had to wait upward of two hours to unload patients. The county has had staffing problems for years, he said, a complication aggravated when employees contract the virus and must isolate. Some days, ambulances are at 50 percent staffing, Mr. Black said. They know when they come in, in the morning, that there's a great chance they're going to be up for 24 straight hours, Mr. Black said about the ambulance workers. You've got to worry — is there a breaking point? And in the Atlanta area, Mr. Black said, emergency crews are often hospital shopping — calling multiple facilities in the metro area and driving around until one agrees to admit their patient. In Arizona, which has a higher rate of new cases per capita than any other state, according to a New York Times database, E.M.S.
Lawmakers may have been exposed to the coronavirus while sheltering during the Capitol riot, a doctor says. Members of the House of Representatives leaving the floor on Wednesday. Credit... J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press While sheltering in a secure location as a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday, House lawmakers may have been exposed to someone who was infected with the coronavirus, Congress's Office of the Attending Physician said on Sunday. In an email sent to lawmakers, Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician, said that while the time in this room was several hours for some and briefer for others, during that period, individuals may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infection. He told lawmakers to obtain a P.C.R. test as a precaution and continue taking preventive steps against the spread of the virus. Congress has long struggled to stem the spread of the virus within its ranks, with mixed guidance and a delayed testing regimen. Dozens of lawmakers, staff members and reporters took shelter in the secure room on Wednesday, but a handful of Republicans refused to wear masks, one person there said, even as Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester, Democrat of Delaware, tried to pass out masks.
Jane Yunhee Junn, a professor of political science at the University of Southern California, was outspoken in her view:
In the same place, the Texas edition of the textbook contains only a blank white space.
In a 1985 study of college men, Hoge concluded that making celibacy optional, as it is for Eastern Orthodox and Protestant clergy (celibacy has been required of Catholic priests only since the Second Lateran Council in 1139), would increase the number of candidates fourfold. So far, though, the church hierarchy has shown no interest in such a reform, and with the exception of Bishop Raymond A. Lucker of New Ulm, Minn., who called in a pastoral letter last fall for a dialogue on celibacy, very few American bishops have spoken publicly on the issue. A former architect who practiced for seven years before entering the seminary, Bashista would have been an anomaly 30 years ago, when nearly three-quarters of entering seminarians were under 25. But today he is the norm; 86 percent of seminarians are older than 25 when they enter, and 16 percent are older than 40, meaning that -- with four years of theology in front of them, often preceded by a year or more of pretheology and sometimes interrupted by a mandatory year of ministry or reflection -- some will be 50 or older by the time they become priests. The student body at Mount Saint Mary's includes a doctor, a concert pianist and several military officers -- evidence of the rising number of second career priests who embarked upon secular lives after college, but then experienced spiritual epiphanies that upended those lives and remade them.
People of color in political office, women controlling their fertility, L.G.B.T.Q. people getting married, using their bathrooms, and having children go against the state of nature defined by white heteropatriarchy. This is a domain in which men and white men in particular stand at the apex of power, holding their rightful position over women, nonwhites, perhaps non-Christians (in the U.S.), and of course, in their view, sexual deviants such as gay people.

Here's another example: Teenagers in both states will learn about the Harlem Renaissance and debates about the movement's impact on African-American life.
Countercultural is not a word one would readily pin to the amiable, clean-cut young men who are enjoying a rare night out at the diner for ice cream and cheesecake. And yet in America today, a man whose personal heroes are martyr-saints, who invokes God often in conversation, who worries intensely about the poor and believes that contraception and masturbation are always morally wrong is, to put it mildly, outside the mainstream. He stands apart. Sometimes it's hard to talk about Jesus Christ, says Damien Cook, 25, a friendly, Falstaffian-looking deacon from Omaha. I remember in high school, you feel odd bringing Him up. You're told by the culture that Christianity oppresses people. Like all counterculturalists, seminarians and priests can provoke suspicion, even hostility, from a society whose values they seem, by their very presence, to challenge. Seminarians say they're frequently approached by strangers who disagree with the church's position on women's ordination or, more often, celibacy. They go: 'Father, you can't get married, right? Well, I don't agree with that,' Brian Bashista, who is 34 and from Arlington, Va., recounts. You try to explain, but some of them don't want to hear it. Maybe I took offense the first couple of times, but it happens so much that I say, Lord, you must be doing something. Maybe this is an opportunity to try to help teach. Seminarians often confront the suggestion that a high proportion of them are homosexual.
Critical language about nonwhite cultural movements also appears in a Texas book from McGraw-Hill. It is partly a result of debates, in 2010, between conservative and liberal members of the Texas Board of Education over whether state standards should mention cultural movements like hip-hop and country music. Their compromise was to ask teachers and textbook publishers to address both the positive and negative impacts of artistic movements.

Federal officials said last week that they would accelerate the start of a program in which some 40,000 pharmacy locations will give vaccines to people in high-risk groups, such as the elderly and frontline workers. Only a few thousand will be involved at the start, though. A lot of senior citizens aren't going to want to go to a stadium to get an inoculation, Dr. Gottlieb said. They're going to want to go to a local pharmacy or doctor's office. So we need to provide more opportunity for people to get vaccinated where they're comfortable getting it.
Marcel Proust was born on July 10, 1871, to well-to-do middle-class parents. His mother was Jeanne Weil, a twenty-one-year-old Parisian, daughter of Nathe Weil, a rich stockbroker. Her great-uncle Adolphe Cremieux was a senator and received a state funeral; he was also president of the Universal Israelite Alliance. Her mother, Adele, was (like the Narrator's grandmother in Remembrance of Things past) a cultured woman who loved, above all other literature, the letters of Madame de Sevigne, one of Louis XIV's courtiers and a woman who was almost romantically in love with her own daughter (the one-sided Sevigne mother-daughter relationship inspired Thornton Wilder when he wrote The Bridge of San Luis Rey). This intense intimacy was in fact characteristic of Marcel and his own mother, who were inseparable, who fought frequently (usually over his laziness and lack of willpower) but always fell into each other's arms as soon as they made up. Mother and son shared a love of music and literature; she could speak and read German as well as English. She had a perfect memory and knew long passages from Racine by heart; her dying words were a citation from La Fontaine: If you're not a Roman, at least act worthy of being one. Marcel inherited her taste for memorizing poetry and knew long passages from Victor Hugo, Racine, and Baudelaire.
The scene captures how the new Queer Eye, now on Netflix, deals with the baggage America has accumulated in its closets since 2003. It doesn't look away from the new culture clashes. But for the most part, it wears them lightly.
Pearson said in a written statement that the differences between the books could be attributed mostly to the fact that the California book was published several years later, and that concerns over coastal flooding have become more heightened in recent years.
Mr. Newsom's agenda is likely to be costly, and thus likely to face obstacles as the new governor prepares to offer a new budget. Mr. Brown, among others, has warned that California is heading into a recession, and there are concerns in the business community and among some moderate Democrats that the former San Francisco mayor might take a decidedly different approach to spending than Mr. Brown.
Coming days will determine how far this goes, but for the moment the nation faces, for all intents and purposes, the makings of a civil insurgency. What makes this insurgency unusual in American history is that it is based on Trump's false claim that he, not Joe Biden, won the presidency, that the election was stolen by malefactors in both parties, and that majorities in both branches of Congress no longer represent the true will of the people.
There were hurdles, of course. At 8, Mr. Ratelle moved with his mother to Miami and, eventually, to Houston, where church attendance remained central to his life. He bridled at the rituals. I would say, 'No, I don't feel like washing that person's feet during communion.'
Here is how the politics of American history play out in California and Texas textbooks, on subjects like race, immigration, gender, sexuality and the economy.
Mr. Brandt made a career of trying to catch whatever wave was cresting on the pop-culture scene. With the Electric Circus, which he opened in 1967 on St. Marks Place in the East Village, it was psychedelia. With the Ritz, opened in 1980 a few blocks away, it was the exploding music scene of the MTV decade, with the shows he staged there — Parliament-Funkadelic, U2, Tina Turner, Ozzy Osbourne, Frank Zappa and countless others — reflecting the exploratory energy of the time.
The Texas book also states that American action on global warming may not make a difference if China, India, Russia and Brazil do not also act.
I really feel like I'm in love. I'm engaged, and I'm getting ready to get married.
In The Interestings, Jules Jacobson poses a broad question, asking herself what the boys (now men) and girls (now women) she has lionized since her teens, and emulated throughout her adult life, have lost through their persistent, rarely rewarded efforts to opt in. She wonders if all of them have inaccurately defined success, believing they would only matter if they were extraordinary.
week after the museum trip, I joined the seminarians for Mass, which is at 7:00 each morning in Immaculate Conception Chapel, whose putty-colored walls are trimmed with gold and turquoise, and which smelled that morning of incense and after-shave. Many seminarians had been praying in the chapel since 6:15; prayer forms the core of the seminary experience, and the men talk about their prayer lives the way most people talk about their love lives. At times their prayer is strong, full and deep (some seminarians call this feeling the warm fuzzies); at others it is dry and without feeling, reverberating an emptiness through their lives. After morning Mass and breakfast, the seminarians attend classes, which include moral theology, philosophy, scripture and church history. During their fourth year, they practice celebrating the Mass and hearing confession, often from recent graduates, who return to campus and play the penitents, inventing sins for seminarians to hear. The Rev. Mark Moretti, one such volunteer who is now an associate pastor in Alexandria, Va., explained the purpose of such role playing: Are you able to judge what you're hearing? Are you able to give a suitable penance? If you have a little old lady coming in to confess her sins and you hammer her with a novena -- a penance lasting nine days -- you're too extreme. Bashista and the other deacons' first class this day was Marriage and Family, where seminarians were learning to prepare betrothed couples for marriage.
Underneath, he said, there was a real spiritual poverty. I felt a sense of loneliness and emptiness. Bashista's disquiet culminated one night five years after he'd graduated from college: I was in my apartment, and I was so confused and unhappy. I just felt broken. I was in tears. That night, he said, he turned to God: I said: Lord, I have no other roads to exhaust. I'm going to make a sincere effort to live as You've called me to live. After that night, thoughts of the priesthood began once again to visit Bashista, and finally he made a furtive visit to a chancery office in Charlotte, N.C., where he lived at the time. I thought, I'll just get a book on priesthood, find out what it's all about, he recalled. So the receptionist said, 'Well, let's go up to the library.' Then a priest walked by, and the receptionist goes, 'Wait a minute, that's the vocation director!' I just got a chill. I said, 'Father, I have this friend, ...' and I bombarded him with an hour and a half of questions. At the end he goes, 'You have an awfully inquisitive friend.' Still, Bashista resisted: My response was not yes; it was, I'll consider it. I call it my one-sided argument with Our Lord; it was about four months long. I said, 'I don't have to be a priest to be holy.' Finally the response came: 'You're right, but this is what I call you to.'
In the partially autobiographical novel Jean Santeuil, written while his parents were still alive, Marcel portrays his father as a brute (What a vulgar man, thinks Jean Santeuil), someone whose peasant ways had not been amended by a lifetime of honors. In his correspondence Marcel later told his editor that his father had tried to cure him of his effeminacy and neuroses by sending him to a whorehouse. But by the time he came to write Remembrance of Things Past, after his parents' death, he idealized both of them and disguised his father as a wise, indulgent minister of state.
Mr. Prager is 6-foot-4 and imposing, in a white button-down shirt, hunched over the microphone.
These insults, many of them handed out by people who on alternate days adored Proust, were neutralized by an issue of La Nouvelle Revue Francaise, France's best literary magazine at the time, that was entirely dedicated to Proust. It came out in 1923, just a year after Proust's death, and contained photos of the dead master, previously unpublished snippets from his pen, and evaluations from critics, French but also from nations all over the world. Most touching were the many personal testimonies. The poet Anna de Noailles, herself a monument to egotism, praised Proust for his ... modesty. (The duc de Gramont, one of Proust's highest-born friends, once remarked that aristocrats invited Proust for country weekends not because of his art but because he and Anna de Noailles were the two funniest people in Paris.)
The idea that moral hypocrisy hurts you among evangelical voters is not true, if you're sound on all of the fundamentals, said Wayne Flynt, an ordained Baptist minister and one of Alabama's pre-eminent historians. Being sound on the fundamentals depends on what the evangelical community has decided the fundamentals have become. At this time, what is fundamental is hating liberals, hating Obama, hating abortion and hating same-sex marriage.
California Texas Takeaway Texas says that white Southerners opposed Reconstruction because of tax increases as well as racial resentment. California instead includes primary-source quotations from black historical figures about white resistance to civil rights. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Growth & Conflict, California, P. 586; McGraw-Hill, United States History to 1877, Texas, P. 555 Both states say that breaches of racial etiquette led to lynchings after Reconstruction. But only California, whose edition was written more recently, makes clear that the perpetrators of lynchings also hoped to discourage black political and economic power. HMH, American History: Reconstruction to the Present, California, P. 245; HMH, The Americans: United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 288
One Monday in 2014, Christopher Justin Hanson sat down for a job interview at the headquarters of Covington & Burling, a law firm in Washington. As the interviewer, who was stationed in front of windows overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue, thumbed through Mr. Hanson's résumé, he noticed that Mr. Hanson didn't have any experience in Washington. Mr. Hanson lived in Wisconsin at the time. Why, the interviewer asked, did Mr. Hanson want to start practicing in Washington?
Pearson, the publisher whose Texas textbook raises questions about the quality of Harlem Renaissance literature, said such language adds more depth and nuance.
And then that was it, I knew I'd lost. Not lost, but won. I'd won the life. Immediately I said, 'Yes.' I was just flooded with peace. The process known as discernment, by which a seminarian determines whether the call to the priesthood is real and lasting, continues until the day of his diaconate ordination, when he makes the promises of celibacy and obedience. On the wall of Dobbins's room is a photograph of his and Bashista's diaconate class four years ago; Dobbins has pasted smiley-face stickers over the heads of the 10 -- out of 42 -- who have left. Some are not actually gone; they're taking pastoral or spiritual years required by their dioceses, or have joined religious orders; others are now married and fathers, including one of Bashista's former roommates. Bashista's views on celibacy have changed. Now he regards it as a crucial aspect of his priesthood, which will not be a job so much as a way of life -- a marriage to the church. (Some priests actually wear wedding rings after their ordinations.) Some days I'll think: What if I was back in the architecture firm? Would I be a partner now? Married? Have kids? he said. But the match has been made. One reason I had thoughts of marriage with this one girl was that connection, that longing to be with this person. And then that feeling was not sustained. It was strong, it was present, but it wasn't deep. And this is deep.
I didn't understand why, it was just an awful feeling I had being in that church, that there was something wrong with me, he said. He winced recalling his mother's reaction when she learned he was gay.
In defending Dreyfus, Proust not only angered conservative, Catholic, pro-army aristocrats, but he also alienated his own father. In writing about the 1890s in Remembrance of Things Past, Proust remarks that the Dreyfus case was shortly to relegate the Jews to the lowest rung of the social ladder. Typically, the ultraconservative Gustave Schlumberger, a great Byzantine scholar, could give in his posthumous memoirs as offensive a description of his old friend Charles Haas (a model for Proust's character Swann) as this: The delightful Charles Haas, the most likeable and glittering socialite, the best of friends, had nothing Jewish about him except his origins and was not afflicted, as far as I know, with any of the faults of his race, which makes him an exception virtually unique. It would be misleading to suggest that Proust took his controversial, pro-Dreyfus stand simply because he was half-Jewish. No, he was only obeying the dictates of his conscience, even though he lost many highborn Catholic friends by doing so and exposed himself to the snide anti-Semitic accusation of merely automatically siding with his co-religionists.
He hosted a rally at his church to protest the killing of Trayvon Martin. Last year, he wrote a letter to the mayor of St. Louis suggesting that if police practices were not reformed, his denomination could take its annual convention — and the millions of dollars that come with it — elsewhere. And at a gathering of black congressional leaders, his raspy voice grew louder as he declared that black people needed to take charge of our destiny.
Before a gay pride parade in 1978 in San Francisco, Harvey Milk, a city supervisor and gay rights leader who was assassinated that year, joined others in asking Mr. Baker to create an emblem to represent the movement.

Emily G. Jacobs, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of California-Santa Barbara, argued that all the rights revolutions — civil rights, women's rights, gay rights — have been key to the emergence of the contemporary right wing:
The church has been to some degree disengaged, said the Rev. Dr. W. Franklyn Richardson of Grace Baptist Church in Mt. Vernon, N.Y. Churches that have social consciousness are pushed by this anniversary into a place of reflecting on how far we have come or not come, and have we abandoned what he gave his life for?
Diocesan priests, as liaisons between the church hierarchy and the laity, are caught in a morality gap between the two -- asked to promote unpopular views that in many cases they themselves do not share. According to a 1994 Los Angeles Times survey, nearly half of American priests believe that birth control is seldom or never wrong; even more say the same of masturbation. As a result, few Catholics hear preaching on touchy sexual issues on any given Sunday. This is about to change, say the seminarians at Mount Saint Mary's -- they have every intention of preaching on these topics, and some deacons already have done so in the parishes they were assigned to last summer. If people had the great opportunity we have to learn and to pray and to study, Bashista said, maybe they would come to a consensus with what the church is teaching and think of the beauty of it rather than the Thou Shalt Not. And that is our obligation: to preach and to teach the truth in charity and in love, and to be patient. After asking permission from his pastor, Cook preached against contraception in the parish he was assigned in Omaha, Neb., last summer. I was nervous, he recalled. If I hadn't really prayed on it and done it in a way that I think was not overbearing. ... I said: 'What is the nature of marriage? To give of oneself.' I didn't use the word 'contraception' until the end.
A California panel asked the publisher McGraw-Hill to avoid the use of the word massacre when describing 19th-century Native American attacks on white people. A Texas panel asked Pearson to point out the number of clergy who signed the Declaration of Independence, and to state that the nation's founders were inspired by the Protestant Great Awakening.
Mr. Newsom, 51, had been the state's lieutenant governor — largely a ceremonial position — for eight years under Mr. Brown. Before that, he served as mayor of San Francisco, where he positioned himself, for the most part, on the liberal side of the spectrum. He was an early promoter of same-sex marriage and the legalization of recreational marijuana.
Every subsequent culture-war battle, in Caldwell's account — the debates over feminism and gay marriage, transgender rights and immigration — follows the lines of this constitutional division. The new constitutionalists are constantly discovering new rights and empowering courts and bureaucracies to enforce them; the old constitutionalists object, win a few elections on the objection and then find themselves defeated nonetheless. And this pattern of defeat is responsible, he implies, for the Trumpian turn: After so many failures to defend the old Constitution, Trump-era conservatives are embracing the logic of the new one, choosing white-identity politics because in the new constitutional dispensation that began in 1964, group identities are the only ones that count.
Whole paragraphs on redlining and restrictive deeds appear only in the California editions of textbooks, partly as a result of different state standards. Texas' social studies guidelines do not mention housing discrimination at all.
An article on Sunday about the impact that the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran might have on the fight against ISIS referred incorrectly to the American whose death helped precipitate the Trump administration's strike on General Suleimani. The American was a civilian contractor, not a soldier.
Studying him, of course, can have a disastrous effect on a young writer, who either comes under the influence of Proust's dangerously idiosyncratic and contagious style or who feels that Proust has already done everything possible in the novel form. Even Walter Benjamin, who became Proust's German translator, wrote the philosopher Theodor Adorno that he did not want to read one more word by Proust than was actually necessary for him to translate because otherwise he would become addictively dependent, which would be an obstacle to his own production.
H. L. Mencken once wrote that his definition of happiness included a comfortable feeling of superiority to the masses of one's fellow men. And yet his quest to be exceptional didn't appear to make him all that happy. But does the compulsion to excel make anybody happy?
She warned that any who stayed home without permission would not be paid, raising the prospect of a heightened clash with the union, which has suggested it may strike if teachers are not permitted to stay home if they want to. This is probably the most contentious and unpleasant reopening, in terms of how the different sides are interacting with each other, said Emily Oster, an economics professor at Brown University who has collected data on coronavirus cases in schools and has argued that reopening schools is safe under many circumstances. Interviews with parents and officials in Chicago indicate that many families are torn between concerns that their children are losing out educationally and fears that they will bring the virus home. Katrina Adams, who lives on the South Side, said she wanted to send her oldest daughter, who is in the fourth grade, back to school, but said she didn't think the district was ready to open. Ms. Adams said her views had not been influenced by the teachers' union, but she acknowledged feeling unsettled by many teachers' concerns about in-school transmission of the coronavirus. If they don't feel safe coming back, most definitely that's an alert, to a parent or anyone, she said.
But Texas students will read that some critics dismissed the quality of literature produced.
Were there any particular obstacles he might face in a general election?
A major development since the end of the Great Compression of the 30 years or so after World War II, when there was less inequality and relatively greater job security, at least for white male workers, is that the differential rate of return on education and training is now much higher.
In Texas textbooks, mentions of L.G.B.T.Q. issues tend to be restricted to coverage of events in recent decades, such as the Stonewall uprising, the AIDS crisis and debates over marriage rights.
Those remarks didn't have the effect he intended. Some African-Americans accused him of equating very different kinds of discrimination, and polls show that his support from black Democrats remains abysmal. When they appraise Buttigieg, they notice a whole lot beyond his sexual orientation, including worrisome friction between him and some black residents of South Bend and a path of extraordinary privilege (Harvard, a Rhodes scholarship, a job with McKinsey) that brought him to this point.
Mr. Gomes uses Dvorak's American String Quartet (No. 12 in F major, Op. 96) to tell a tale of social relations in small-town America. One man wants to leave (with suitcase) despite his powerful affection for the woman we may assume is his wife. Two pairs of male-female lovers spend time together, with one couple reaching the marriage ceremony as the ballet ends (veil, bouquet, trousseau, confetti); but one of these two men is keener on the other man than on his own girlfriend, and so sulks when his devotion is rejected.
Another congregation that is working with those grappling with religious trauma is the Holy Trinity Community Church in Nashville, with a membership that is over 80 percent L.G.B.T.
Mr. Brown's insistence on holding onto state revenues was a source of continued friction with Democratic allies in the Legislature, who wanted to use the money to restore spending cuts that had been in place during the Great Recession.
There are also differences in approach. Pastors often want to work within the system to effect change, while many activists try to disturb and upend the system.
ne afternoon last November, I went with Bashista to Arlington, and we visited the two-story suburban house where he grew up and where his parents still live, from which his father, an electrical engineer, commutes to his job at the Naval Research Lab in Washington. Modest and immaculate, with lots of carpeting and an abundance of pink and mauve in the decor, the Bashistas' home veritably thrummed with the quiet, vehement faith of his mother, Aileen, who looks like Bashista only fairer, with pale blue eyes and gold-rimmed glasses. Hefty painted statuettes of Christ and the Virgin Mary stood before a window in the kitchen, and in the living room, near a graduation photo of Bashista smiling over a giant bow tie, there was a small table covered with lace, where holy water, candles and a relic -- a bone of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, the first American-born saint -- were on display. I always prayed that the Lord would take my sons to be His holy priests, Aileen Bashista told me. You know it's nothing you deserve. It's God's gift. Bashista's younger brother, Christopher, a drummer until a car injury left him unable to play, now a senior at George Mason University who lives at home, had a different reaction: relief. Mom got her priest, he said. Aileen Bashista makes weekly visits to Seton High School, where Bashista's younger sister, Mary-Beth, is a senior, to teach rosary making. She is also a lay member of an order of Carmelite nuns.
To this day, he said, his mother has no clue what her son does for a living. The idea of me putting a black man in a dress and having him prance around the world like that. … To her, that would be blasphemy.
None of the voters at his rallies in Iowa brought it up when I asked them what drew them to Buttigieg. They mostly raved about his intelligence.
And yet Proust was not always so appreciated, and even his chief defenders were capable of making snide remarks about him. Robert de Montesquiou (whose arch manners and swooping intonations Proust loved to imitate and whose life provided Proust with the main model for his most memorable character, the baron de Charlus) said that Proust's work was a mixture of litanies and sperm (a formula that he considered to be a compliment). Gide accused him of having committed an offense against the truth (Gide was irritated that Proust never acknowledged his own homosexuality in print nor ever presented homosexual inclinations in an attractive light). Lucien Daudet, a young writer with whom Proust had an affair (Proust liked artistic young men with mustaches and dark eyes: that is, those who resembled himself), at one point told Cocteau that Proust was an atrocious insect. Lucien's father, Alphonse Daudet, one of the most celebrated writers of the generation before Proust's, though now largely forgotten, announced, Marcel Proust is the devil! He might well have taken such a position, since it was Proust's seven-volume novel, Remembrance of Things Past (in recent editions, translated more literally as In Search of Lost Time), that surpassed--indeed, wiped out--the fiction written in the two decades before him. Who today reads Anatole France, Paul Bourget, Maurice Barres, or even Alphonse Daudet? Paul Claudel, the arch-Catholic poet and playwright, described Marcel as a painted old Jewess.
If these three words have acquired the force of absolution, it is because Karan Johar is by miles the most famous Indian ever to almost be openly gay. Since he burst onto the scene in the late 1990s, this 44-year-old director-producer has reached vast audiences with his movies. His name is a byword for family entertainment, his films by his own admission synonymous with popcorn, bubble gum and frivolity. All the stars are his friends, and the brightest of them appear on his immensely popular talk show Koffee With Karan. He has some 10 million followers on Twitter and almost three million on Instagram.
In 2003, J.T. sued the prosecutors who had hidden the evidence in his case for failing to train their lawyers on the importance of turning over favorable evidence. The jury, considering the blatant destruction of evidence in J.T.'s case, awarded him $1 million for every year he was on death row — $14 million in total.
In Florida's vaccine free-for-all, one state site is closing Monday for a football game. Frontline health care workers and people 65 and older waited in line outside the East County Regional Library in Lehigh Acres, Fla., last month. Credit... Octavio Jones for The New York Times The state of Florida's coronavirus testing and vaccination site at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens — the recent scene of long lines of people awaiting vaccination — will be shut down for much of Monday to make way for the College Football Playoff national championship game. No testing will be done on Monday, and vaccinations will end at noon, the Florida Division of Emergency Management announced on Sunday. The pandemic is in an alarming new upward spiral in Florida, with nearly 20,000 new cases of the virus reported there on Friday and more than 15,000 on Saturday. But the state's well-intended effort to throw open the doors of the vaccine program to everyone 65 and older has led to long lines, confusion and disappointment. The temporary closure of the Hard Rock Stadium site to accommodate a football game seemed likely to complicate things further for Miamians. Experts say Florida is an example of what happens when officials attempt to distribute a vaccine that is still in very limited supply to a broad spectrum of the population. In a state with about 4.4 million people 65 and older, more than 402,000 doses had been administered as of Friday, according to federal data, the fourth-highest total in the nation.
As Ms. Hartman,50, a manager of international projects at COC Nederland, a Dutch L.G.B.T.I. advocacy group, entered a massive, crowded room, she felt relief when she spotted a Nigerian activist friend. She led Ms. Hartman to a table with her friends. One of them was Melinda Michels, 49, the director of the Emergency Assistance Program at Freedom House, a program in Washington that supports human rights defenders who are targeted by repressive governments.
The difference between economic winners and losers, captured by income inequality, poverty, and illiteracy rates within the dominant white ethnicity, is much greater than in most other Western countries, and there is no dense welfare state safety net to buffer the fall of people into unemployment and poverty.
People were looking for something that was more grandfatherly, something that was more wise and trustworthy and less politically slick, said Angi Stalnaker, who was Mr. Bentley's campaign manager. They wanted someone that they could see themselves having Sunday dinner with, and, of the candidates in 2010, Robert Bentley was the one you could see inviting over for fried chicken and cornbread.
Chicago classrooms are reopening Monday, but will most teachers show up? A playground at an elementary school in Chicago, where schools reopen Monday. Credit... Taylor Glascock for The New York Times Across the country, many big cities like New York have struggled to resume even limited in-person instruction, while a number, including Los Angeles, have simply given up on the idea, choosing to stick with all-remote education into the spring. Few places have seen as much acrimony over the issue as Chicago, whose public school system is the nation's third-largest. Now, with 6,000 prekindergarten and special education students preparing to return to the city's public school buildings on Monday for the first time since March, a question looms: How many of their teachers will be there to greet them? Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago has argued that giving parents the option of sending their children to school in person is critical to preventing some of the city's mostly poor and Black and Latino students from falling permanently behind. But the teachers' union has fiercely resisted the plan, arguing that schools are not safe while the coronavirus is surging. Over the past week, fewer than 60 percent of the roughly 2,000 teachers who were expected to return to their buildings to prepare for the arrival of students actually showed up. Janice K. Jackson, the chief executive of the school system that serves about 350,000 students, said on Friday that she was optimistic that most teachers would go to work on Monday.
Bernard Grofman, a political scientist at the University of California, Irvine, put it this way in an email:
These portraits already suggest the outlines of Proust's extraordinary personality. He was attentive to his friends to the point of seeming a flatterer, though he thought friendship was valueless and conversation represented the death of the mind, since he believed only passion and suffering could sharpen the powers of observation and the only word of any value was the written. He could stare transfixed at a rose--or at anything else or anyone who was on his peculiar wavelength--but though he read everything and was deeply cultivated, he had little interest in disembodied ideas. He wasn't an intellectual, though he was supremely intelligent. He applied his attention to flowers and people and paintings, but not to theories about botany nor to psychology nor aesthetics. He never read a word of Freud, for instance (nor did Freud ever read a word of Proust). He was hilariously funny and entertaining, but he emanated a calm spirituality except, perhaps, when he was doubled up with a crazy bout of laughter (his famous choking fit of hilarity, his fou rire, which could go on so long it struck strangers as weird, even slightly mad). He was such a presence that many people spoke of him as tall, but in fact he stood just five feet six inches.
At the end of the day, it's a political process, said Jesús F. de la Teja, an emeritus professor of history at Texas State University who has worked for the state of Texas and for publishers in reviewing standards and textbooks.
In a written statement, McGraw-Hill said the full-page Border Patrol narrative was not included in the California edition because it would not fit beside the literary excerpt. And at the time the Texas edition was produced, six years ago, state standards called for students to analyze both legal and illegal immigration to the United States.
For candidates seeking to lead the party into its post-Obama era, their hope is that the base is more concerned with defeating President Trump and Republicans than holding every candidate to rigid standards of ideological purity.
It was really moving, she said, to see him point to his partner and all the support that his partner gave him, to have someone acknowledge their partner … We were both kind of crying.
Indeed, in her video apology Ms. Gabbard said her views had significantly changed.
California Texas Takeaway Only California states that Levi Strauss was a German Jewish immigrant. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Growth & Conflict, California, P. 416; McGraw-Hill, United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 417 California tells the story of Wong Kim Ark, whose 1898 Supreme Court case established birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants; Texas's edition, which is older, does not mention this case, but does cover the Chinese Exclusion Act. HMH, American History: Reconstruction to the Present, California, P. 247; HMH, The Americans: United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 289
Ms. Gabbard alluded to her conservative upbringing and her father's work on Thursday in her video, but did not go into detail about her own anti-gay advocacy as a young person. She was the youngest person ever elected to the Hawaii State Legislature.
Adrien Proust was originally intended for the priesthood and he brought a nearly religious zeal to his work as a doctor. It was he who made famous--and effective--the idea of a cordon sanitaire, a sanitary zone circling Europe in order to keep out cholera. In order to put his principles to work Dr. Proust traveled to Russia, Turkey, and Persia in 1869 and figured out the routes by which cholera in previous epidemics had entered Russia and thereby Europe. For this successful investigation and the resulting efficacious sanitation and quarantine campaign Dr. Proust was awarded the Legion of Honor. He became one of the most celebrated professors of medicine and practicing physicians of his day. Whereas Marcel would be willowy, artistic, asthmatic, and obsessed with titled ladies, his father was the very model of the solid upper-middle-class citizen, fleshy, bearded, solemn, and, thanks to his wife's fortune, rich. He was also, unbeknownst to his son, an inveterate ladies' man. His extramarital adventures were never noticed by Marcel's mother--or if she did know something about them, she was too discreet to mention it.
California and Texas textbooks sometimes offer different explanations for white backlash to black advancement after the Civil War, from Reconstruction to housing discrimination in the 20th century.
Despite Proust's silences and lapses on the subject of his mother's religion, it would be unfair, especially in light of the rampant anti-Semitism of turn-of-the-century France, to say that he was unique or even extreme in his prejudice against Jews. And yet his anti-Semitism is more than curious, given his love for his mother and given, after her death, something very much like a religious cult that he developed around her. His mother, out of respect for her parents, had remained faithful to their religion, and Proust revered her and her relatives; after her death he regretted that he was too ill to visit her grave and the graves of her parents and uncle in the Jewish cemetery and to mark each visit with a stone. More important, although he had many friends among the aristocracy whom he had assiduously cultivated, nevertheless when he was forced to take sides during the Dreyfus Affair, which had begun in 1894 and erupted in 1898, he chose to sign a petition prominently printed in a newspaper calling for a retrial.
The United States had a civil war over slavery in the 19th century and a continuous history of structural racism and white oligarchical rule until the 1960s, and in many aspects until the present. Europe lacks this legacy.
California's Board of Education adopted an expansive 842-page social studies framework in 2016. Two years later, Texas' school board streamlined its social studies standards, which are now laid out in 78 tightly compressed pages.
n a bright, crisp afternoon last fall, I joined all 159 Mount Saint Mary's seminarians outside McSweeney Hall, the seminary's main building, an eccentric, gabled edifice made of slabs of thickly grouted granite, perched midway up a hill among a patchwork of farms and woods. We boarded buses and rode an hour and a half to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, where the seminarians had been invited to view an exhibit of religious artwork from the Vatican Museums. Mount Saint Mary's is the second-largest seminary in the country, after Mundelein Seminary in Illinois, and is also among the most conservative -- scrupulously adherent to the magisterium, or teaching authority, of the Pope. A man seeking to become a diocesan priest must first be accepted to a diocese, whose bishop usually underwrites his education and chooses the seminary where it will take place; bishops appointed under Pope John Paul II tend to be morally conservative, upholding the Pope's stringent views on such controversial topics as contraception and the ordination of women. But conservative at Mount St. Mary's does not mean sour or grim. A mood of buoyant optimism surges among the men -- a sense, accurate or not, that the bad times are over for the priesthood, and something new and momentous is in the making. There was a period of confusion and uncertainty after the Second Vatican Council, even going into the 80's, the Rev. Kevin Rhoades, the cheerful rector of Mount Saint Mary's, told me.
The books have the same publisher. They credit the same authors. But they are customized for students in different states, and their contents sometimes diverge in ways that reflect the nation's deepest partisan divides.
How Textbooks are Produced 1 Authors, often academics, write a national version of each text. 2 Publishers customize the books for states and large districts to meet local standards, often without input from the original authors. 3 State or district textbook reviewers go over each book and ask publishers for further changes. 4 Publishers revise their books and sell them to districts and schools.
In Lind's account, Caldwell's story about the advance of social liberalism through bureaucratic and judicial power is just a subsidiary of the more important story, the post-1970s consolidation of economic power by a managerial upper class. The liberalism of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama isn't an ideology of white disempowerment, in his account, so much as a solvent that weakens any institution — from churches and families to union shops and local industries — that might grant real power to groups outside the gilded city, the Silicon Valley bubble, the Ivy League gate. And together with its center-right partner in crime, Reagan-Thatcher libertarianism, this liberalism's policy choices — economic and social permissiveness, effectively conjoined — created a new class divide, between thriving meritocratic hubs and a declining and demoralized heartland, that explains both the frequency of populist irruptions and their consistent futility.
When William Blake Hoffman, an architect and designer at Architecture, Incorporated in Reston, Va., matched with Mr. Hanson on Tinder in September 2018, he didn't have grand visions of romance. Mr. Hoffman had moved to Washington a couple of years earlier, for what he intended to be only a few years. He didn't plan to plant roots. So he suggested to Mr. Hanson that they meet for a drink at a beer garden located right on Mr. Hoffman's way home from work. It was a Wednesday night.
While both states devote many pages to the women's movement, Texas books, in general, avoid discussions of sex or sexuality.
Tom Fesen, 30, a deacon from Trenton, took a job after college at Chemical Bank in New York, where he commuted each day from his home in New Jersey. There were two buses; one came too late and one came too early, he recalls. So I came early. The bus dropped me off across the street from a church, so I decided, I'll go into this church, get a little peace of mind. Mass would be about 20 minutes. So six months into this, the reader left, and the priest came up to me and said, 'Do you want to read during Mass?' I said: 'No, I don't want to. I'm just here a little early.' Immediately after that, he said, 'Well, do you want to be a priest?' I was so irritated, Fesen continues. Where does he come off? I'm going to be a banker; get married; 2.5 kids, house in the suburbs, dog. But after that I couldn't get the thought out of my mind. Bashista regards celibacy as a crucial aspect of his priesthood, which will not be a job so much as a way of life -- a marriage to the church. 'Some days I'll think: What if I was back at the architecture firm? Would I be a partner now? Married? Have kids?' he says. 'But the match has been made.'
Donald Trump may not have terrific micro values, but I think he has terrific macro values, Mr. Prager said.
The left has pushed for students to encounter history more from the ground up than from the top down, with a focus on the experiences of marginalized groups such as enslaved people, women and Native Americans.
Ms. Gabbard, an Army National Guard veteran who was twice deployed to the Middle East, was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2012. She was the first Hindu and the first American Samoan elected to that chamber.
I understand that the term 'marriage' has only one meaning; the uniting of one man and one woman, it reads, adding that certain moral misconduct would be disqualifying, such as heterosexual activity outside of marriage (e.g., premarital sex, cohabitation, extramarital sex), homosexual or lesbian sexual activity, polygamy, transgender identity, any other violation of the unique roles of male and female.
California is one of many states to ask teachers and textbooks in recent years to cover the contributions of specific immigrant groups, including Asian-Americans, Pacific Islanders, European-Americans and Mexican-Americans.
[Listen to The Argument podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]
As a result, California textbooks are more likely to celebrate unionism, critique the concentration of wealth and focus on how industry pollutes the environment.
As a little boy Marcel could not go to sleep without his mother's kiss; this necessity would become a major theme of Combray, the first section of Remembrance of Things Past. Quite understandably she was worried by these signs of her son's total dependence on her and would attempt to cure him by refusing to indulge him in his whims, but he would become so hysterical if denied a kiss or his mother's tenth good night visit to his bedroom that usually she gave in--or her less rigorous husband would urge her to do so. Not only did Proust not outgrow his dependence; it became the template for his adult loves, since for Proust passion was a nagging need that became only more demanding the more it was denied. Indeed, Proust would drive away all his lovers (in his fiction as in his life) through his unreasonable demands.
After the class recited the Our Father, the teacher, Sister Paula Jean Miller, got down to business: the topic of the day was the theology of sexuality. Drawing on Pope John Paul II's theology of the body, Miller explained that total self-donation, or self-gift, is the goal for human relationships -- and also a way of explaining why married people should not use contraception. Sexual intercourse is a cause of grace within the sacrament of marriage, Miller said. Just as the Father gives himself totally to the Son and the Son gives himself back totally to the father, that's the standard of love for us. Contraception is a holding back of some very critical aspect of ourselves, of who I am. It's saying to you, I want you but I don't want your fertility, at least not right now. And the goal is total self-gift. (Actually, a majority of Catholic theologians disagree with this position.) Only in the last 30 years has the concept of self-gift come to coexist with procreation in the Catholic Church as the criterion for the moral rightness of a sexual act, according to Richard McCormick, professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame. Self-gift, the seminarians are taught, can be used to explain what is wrong with masturbation (it involves no giving to another), lust (it involves taking rather than giving, thus reducing one's partner to the status of an object) and homosexuality (the other is not other, and thus self-gift is not really possible).
So if Caldwell's book supplements and corrects Klein's, by giving a clearer sense of the ideological stakes involved in post-1960s polarization, his account needs to be corrected and supplemented in its turn. And a third new book, Michael Lind's The New Class War: Saving Democracy From the Managerial Elite, does an important part of that work, by explaining an aspect of our present polarization that can't be traced to specifically American racial fears or constitutional debates: Namely, the way that our populist-era divisions increasingly mirror Europe's, with the same exodus of downscale voters from left-of-center parties, the same polarization by education and class.
Texas struck that requirement in 2018, but its most recent textbooks, published in 2016, will reflect it for years to come.
More religious and less well-educated whites see Donald Trump as one of their own despite his being so obviously a child of privilege. He defends America as a Christian nation. He defends English as our national language. He is unashamed in stating that the loyalty of any government should be to its own citizens — both in terms of how we should deal with noncitizens here and how our foreign policy should be based on the doctrine of America First. He speaks in a language that ordinary people can understand. He makes fun of the elites who look down on his supporters as a basket of deplorables and who think it is a good idea to defund the police who protect them and to prioritize snail darters over jobs. He appoints judges and justices who are true conservatives. He believes more in gun rights than in gay rights. He rejects political correctness and the language-police and woke ideology as un-American. And he promises to reclaim the jobs that previous presidents (of both parties) allowed to be shipped abroad. In sum, he offers a relatively coherent set of beliefs and policies that are attractive to many voters and which he has been better at seeing implemented than any previous Republican president. What Trump supporters who rioted in D.C. share are the beliefs that Trump is their hero, regardless of his flaws, and that defeating Democrats is a holy war to be waged by any means necessary.

Each of these systems is navigating the pandemic on its own, meaning the experience of a child in one county can be completely different from the one right next to it. Soon after the pandemic took hold, for instance, Florida's child welfare system began conducting the bulk of the work certifying foster parents and placing children in their homes remotely. In New York, the system ground to a halt. For a long while, the courts here were just not doing anything virtually, said Shantell Lewis, a recruiter with the Wendy's Wonderful Kids program, which focuses on finding placements for older foster youth, at a Brooklyn nonprofit called MercyFirst. Though New York has more recently allowed work to be conducted virtually, the state has a considerable backlog. Many child welfare professionals are also concerned about older youth emancipating from foster care, when local governments are no longer bound to provide financial assistance. This abrupt transition into adulthood, between 18 and 21 depending on the state, in the very best of times represents a significant challenge for roughly 20,000 young people each year. But today, those aging out of foster care are aging in to a country gripped by an ongoing pandemic and crippled economy. When a young person ages out of the system, we have in many ways already failed them, said Rita Soronen, president and chief executive of the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption.
workers worry about being exposed to the virus, then bringing it home to their families and getting severe symptoms, said Brian Moore, the central region director of the Arizona Ambulance Association. This whole thing has put a lot of fear in folks who are on the front lines, Mr. Moore said. Emergency medical service dilemmas are particularly acute in Los Angeles County, where understaffed hospitals are overwhelmed and a Covid-related death happens every eight minutes. The nation's most populous county has urged ambulance crews not to take people they cannot resuscitate to hospitals. The county's memo on the matter reflected a relatively small change from its previous policy, which already discouraged emergency personnel from transporting most people whose heartbeats could not be restored. But after the memo gained widespread attention, medics felt compelled to post on social media to try to quell anxieties that they believed were unfounded. Kari Dickerson, a paramedic in Kentucky who tweets as @MedicTrommasher, said the memo had particularly alarmed people of color, who have been disproportionately harmed by the pandemic. She said she worried that her fellow workers could face wrenching situations whenever they broke the news that someone had died, perhaps causing families to wonder: Did they do this on purpose, did they not work as hard as they would have for somebody that looks like them? An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the day the United States reported its single-day record for Covid-19 deaths. It was Thursday. Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio and

While representing the prosecutors when the case went to the Supreme Court, Mr. Duncan was serving as what he later called solicitor general of Louisiana, a position that does not exist. He devised the argument that, although the district attorney had withheld evidence in many cases involving innocent men, there was no need to train lawyers in his office because they would have learned about their obligation in law school.
As the anniversary of the world's first coronavirus lockdown nears, China scrubs the history of any mistakes. Visitors attend the museum at Wuhan Parlor Convention Center Dec. 31, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Credit... Tingshu Wang/Reuters At a museum in Wuhan, China, a sprawling exhibition paints a stirring tale of how the city's sacrifices in a brutal 76-day lockdown led to triumph over the coronavirus and, ultimately, rebirth. But the exhibition may be most striking for what is not included about the experiences of the city where the virus first came to the world's attention. For example, visitors are invited to lay a virtual chrysanthemum at a wall of martyrs that includes Li Wenliang, the ophthalmologist at a Wuhan hospital whose death from the virus led to nationwide mourning. But missing from his brief biography is a crucial fact: that Dr. Li was reprimanded by the government for warning colleagues about the virus. China has spent much of the past year trying to spin a narrative of the coronavirus pandemic as an undisputed victory led by the ruling Communist Party. As life in the city, and most of the country, has returned to normal, the state-run news media has largely ignored the government's missteps.
Following the repeal of marriage equality in Bermuda, where same-sex couples are now limited to domestic partnership, many in the United States and Western Europe are calling for a boycott (#BoycottBermuda). The demand for this boycott is not coming from grass-roots organizations in Bermuda, and in fact such a boycott stands to harm and not help L.G.B.T.Q. Bermudians.
This was the cover of a tax book, one seminarian remarked to me, as he looked at a painted Annunciation by Giovanni di Paolo. Then he added, That's how much religion was a part of life. In mainstream America it is no longer so; indeed, for a young man pursuing a life of celibate devotion to Christ, the world outside the seminary is a minefield of temptations and distractions. Tom Holloway, the former alt-rocker, said once, Every morning when we get out of bed, there's a war going on, and we're right in the middle of it. The world threatens in a multitude of ways; even something as simple as grocery shopping can pose hazards. Lots of magazine covers don't reach Christian modesty, Magat said. I have to pretty much stare straight ahead -- there are half-naked women all over the place! The world threatened, too, during the White House sex scandal, when seminarians had to grapple with whether to read the sexually explicit Starr report. Many did not; some who did went to confession afterward. All whom I spoke to said they prayed for the President, though politically they deplore his support for abortion rights. (In general, their opposition to abortion drives them to the right politically, but not without misgivings -- the Republicans, in their view, do not show enough concern for the poor.) To protect themselves from visual affronts, seminarians employ what they call custody of the eyes. Bashista explained this concept: You just look down.

In contrast, California textbooks are more likely to note when a historical figure was an immigrant. And they include more detail on the role immigrants such as Japanese and Filipino farmworkers played in labor movements.
Well, Mr. Hanson said, I read in The New York Times that it's the No. 1 place to live, if you're a gay man, to meet people. That's why I'm applying here.
Instead, the media and the international community should listen to L.G.B.T.Q. Bermudians and elevate their priorities, not set their own misguided agendas.
For pastors like Bishop Blake, that means embracing the parts of the movement he agrees with — ending police violence and empowering black entrepreneurs, for instance. But it also means holding the line on church teachings that young activists disagree with.

What makes Mr. Johar's case so much of a piece with this particular moment in India is that while he has been circumspect on his sexual orientation, he has, both in his life and his work, been breathtakingly explicit about sex: In 2013, he gave the Indian screen a smoldering gay kiss in Bombay Talkies; two years later, as roast master in a comic event that millions saw on YouTube, he joked before a live audience, with his mother present, of being the recipient of anal sex; in his new book, that same curious mixture of reticence and candor pervades. Mr. Johar will not use the male pronoun, but he writes openly and often movingly about everything from the pain of unreciprocated love to the aridity of having to pay for sex.

To meet this demand, men provided sperm at a steady rate for years, some banks said. But the coronavirus changed things. Existing donors were scared to go in. New donor sign-ups stopped for months during lockdown and never really bounced back at some banks. Several banks said that they had a lot of old frozen sperm in storage, but that it could last only so long.
The pandemic has reshaped a heated market for sperm donations. Yael Helin, a biological analyst at the Seattle Sperm Bank, returning sperm samples to deep storage after preparing some for shipment. Credit... Grant Hindsley for The New York Times Sperm banks are running low on supplies because of an overwhelming demand for pandemic babies, so women are trying something unconventional: joining unregulated Facebook groups to find donors. People are fed up with sperm banks, said Kyle Gordy, 29, who lives in Malibu, Calif. He invests in real estate but spends most of his time donating his sperm, free (except for the cost of travel), to women. He also runs a nearly 11,000-member private Facebook group, Sperm Donation USA, which helps women connect with a roster of hundreds of approved donors. His donor sperm has sired 35 children, with five more on the way, he said. There have always been infertile straight couples in need of donor sperm, but with the legalization of gay marriage and the rise of elective single motherhood, the market has expanded over the last decade. About 20 percent of sperm bank clients are heterosexual couples, 60 percent are gay women, and 20 percent are single moms by choice, the banks said. To meet this demand, men provided sperm at a steady rate for years, some banks said. But the coronavirus changed things. Existing donors were scared to go in.

It took Alison Stevenson eight months to find a pandemic friend with benefits. Along the way, she had an intense, short-lived texting relationship that ended when the man on the other end told her he was getting back together with his ex. Then came two disappointing outdoor dates, including one with a guy who made fun of her for asking him to keep his mask on. I needed a 'situationship,' said Ms. Stevenson, a 31-year-old comedian and writer in Los Angeles. A person I can rely on and trust to hang out with once a week. The effort could mean setting boundaries and conditions from the outset, like regular testing (keep in mind that tests can show false negatives, especially if the amount of the virus in the body is too small to be detected, and that whoever is taking the test could be infected while waiting for results), quarantining before meeting and sticking to a single partner. As they negotiate, people are finding that the key to dating now is what it's always been: trust. And ultimately for many single people, hooking up has been worth the increased risk of contracting the virus. Everything I enjoy doing has been taken away from me, said Emmy Nicholson, a 26-year-old publicist in Brooklyn. But there's one thing they can't take away, and that's having sex.
Requests from textbook review panels, submitted in painstaking detail to publishers, show the sometimes granular ways that ideology can influence the writing of history.
That's the question that preoccupies Jules Jacobson, the ambitious protagonist of Meg Wolitzer's remarkable novel, The Interestings, whose inclusive vision and generous sweep place it among the ranks of books like Jonathan Franzen's Freedom and Jeffrey Eugenides's Marriage Plot. The Interestings is warm, all-American and acutely perceptive about the feelings and motivations of its characters, male and female, young and old, gay and straight; but it's also stealthily and undeniably a novel of ideas. Wolitzer has been writing excellent fiction for 30 years, and it has always been this astute. From the start, her subject has been the practical, emotional and sexual fallout of women's liberation, particularly as it affects mothers and children. But here she has written a novel that speaks as directly to men as to women.

Instead, the media cites China's response as proof of the superiority of the country's authoritarian system, especially compared with that of the United States and other democracies, which are still struggling to contain raging outbreaks And now, as the Jan. 23 anniversary of Wuhan's lockdown nears, the government has deployed an army of censors to scrub the internet of critical coverage of the Wuhan outbreak. A recent propaganda directive explicitly banned coverage of the anniversary of the outbreak, according to journalists at state-run news outlets who were briefed on the order. Instead, propaganda agencies have pushed feel-good videos and adulatory articles that depict Wuhan as a city reborn. The government underscored its message to the media last month when it sentenced Zhang Zhan, a 37-year-old citizen journalist who documented Wuhan's ordeal, to four years in prison. She is the first person known to have faced trial for chronicling China's outbreak. Amy Qin and

Mr. Duncan is best known for his work in Washington, D.C., as the former general counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a conservative organization that defends religious liberty for all. He played a leading role in opposing the provision of the Affordable Care Act requiring employers to provide insurance coverage for contraceptives. Mr. Duncan also defended North Carolina's photo ID law that the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit wrote had targeted black voters with almost surgical precision. He also defended Louisiana's ban on gay marriage in several different courts before the Supreme Court prohibited state bans on gay marriage.
These are some of the thousands of people who have been immunized against the coronavirus at hospitals affiliated with Columbia University, New York University, Harvard and Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, even as millions of frontline workers and older Americans are waiting their turns. Some of the institutions were among the first recipients of the limited supplies in the United States. The C.D.C. never intended to include workers who don't interact with patients, like administrators and graduate students, in the first tier of priority vaccinations, said Dr. Stanley Perlman, an immunologist at the University of Iowa and a member of the committee that issued the recommendations. This all got so confusing, he said. In retrospect, I think it probably needed to be a little more exact on what we were thinking, because we were never thinking about hospital administrators.
Elite hospitals have vaccinated workers who were supposed to wait. Frontline workers waited in line to receive the Covid-19 vaccine at a hospital in Arlington, Va., last month. Credit... Michael A. McCoy for The New York Times At leading research hospitals in the United States, administrators and young graduate students have been inoculated with some of the earliest supplies of coronavirus vaccines, in a contradiction of federal and state guidelines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued recommendations intended to ensure that the nation's vaccines first reach those at highest risk: health care workers who interact with Covid-19 patients, and residents and staff members at nursing homes, followed by people 75 and older and certain essential workers. Each state has established its own version of the guidelines, but with the rollout proceeding at a glacial pace, pressure has been growing for a more flexible approach. Officials at the C.D.C. and the Food and Drug Administration have recently suggested that it might be wiser to simply loosen the criteria and distribute the vaccine as widely as possible. But a handful of the nation's most prestigious academic hospitals have already taken the notion much further. A 20-something who works on computers. A young researcher who studies cancer.

Proust never refers to his Jewish origins in his fiction, although in the youthful novel he abandoned, Jean Santeuil (first published only in 1952, thirty years after his death), there is a very striking, if buried, reference to Judaism. The autobiographical hero has quarreled with his parents and in his rage deliberately smashed a piece of delicate Venetian glass his mother had given him. When he and his mother are reconciled, he tells her what he has done: He expected that she would scold him, and so revive in his mind the memory of their quarrel. But there was no cloud upon her tenderness. She gave him a kiss, and whispered in his ear: `It shall be, as in the Temple, the symbol of an indestructible union.' This reference to the rite of smashing a glass during the Orthodox Jewish wedding ceremony, in this case sealing the marriage of mother to son, is not only spontaneous but chilling. In an essay about his mother he referred, with characteristic ambiguity, to the beautiful lines of her Jewish face, completely marked with Christian sweetness and Jansenist resignation, turning her into Esther herself--a reference, significantly, to the heroine of the Old Testament (and of Racine's play), who concealed her Jewish identity until she had become the wife of King Ahasuerus and was in a position to save her people. The apparently gentile Proust, who had campaigned for Dreyfus and had been baptized Catholic, was a sort of modern Esther.
In 1998, according to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University, there were 47,582 active priests in America -- about 10,000 fewer than in 1975. The average age of a diocesan priest is now 58, and nearly a quarter of all priests are older than 70, the average age of retirement. Perhaps no institution in America faces a more severe personnel crisis than the Catholic Church. And it is likely to get worse. The total number of graduate seminarians in America last year was the lowest on record: 2,622, a drop of almost 70 percent from the 8,159 in 1967-8. This decline comes at a time when the number of Catholics in America, where they represent by far the largest religious denomination, has ballooned from 48.7 million in 1975 to 61.6 million today, largely as a result of Latin American and Asian immigration and population growth. The drop in vocations has been under way since the 1970's, when seminaries emptied precipitously, in part because of a disillusionment with celibacy. Meanwhile, families of Italian, Irish and Central European descent -- the old Catholic ghetto that, earlier in this century, was a major source of American priests -- have shrunk in size and risen to the middle class, broadening opportunities for their sons. More recently, the pedophilia scandals of the late 80's and early 90's have been a public relations catastrophe for the church.
Most important, Marcel and his mother both loved to laugh--gently, satirically--at the people around them, and in her letters to him she sends up the other guests at a spa or hotel with the same spirit of wickedly close observation and good-natured if prickly fun that was to inspire so many of his best pages.
Perhaps Colette had been initially irritated because the young flatterer had already divined her bisexuality. By 1917, after Proust had begun to publish Remembrance of Things Past, she could see him in another light. He was very ill, he weighed no more than one hundred pounds, and he seldom emerged from his cork-lined room. He had become a martyr to art (and she herself was one of his few living rivals as a stylist). She saw him at the Ritz during the war with a few friends, wearing a fur coat even indoors over his evening clothes: He never stopped talking, trying to be gay. Because of the cold, and making excuses, he kept his top hat on, tilted backwards, and the fan-like lock of hair covered his eyebrows. Full-dress uniform, but disarranged by a furious wind, which, pouring over the nape of his hat, rumpling the calico and the free ends of his cravat, filling in with a grey ash the furrows of his cheeks, the hollows of his eye-sockets and the breathless mouth, had hunted this tottering young man of fifty to death.
A donor would usually go to a bank once or twice a week over months to produce enough sperm to sell to dozens of families.
When they'd all gone, Bashista unvested, returning the white alb and patterned green dalmatic to their hangers in the vestry. Clearly, the Mass and the meeting with parishioners afterward elated him. I'm in the honeymoon phase, he said. But what you're seeing is the future -- I wouldn't be here if I didn't believe that. Others in the church anticipate more conflict. The Rev. Richard McBrien, a professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame, told me that the shortage of American priests would deepen the division between clergy and laity. What happens now is that people shop, he said. They go where they can get the best Mass, the best music, the best sermons. But when the day comes that there aren't enough good priests left, I think the people are absolutely going to demand from the government of the church that they have married priests. Progressive Catholic organizations hope that the successor to John Paul II will be less authoritarian and more collegial -- the true spirit of Vatican II, they believe. There is talk of the resentment many bishops are said to feel toward John Paul II, who has centralized authority at their expense. (He treats bishops like altar boys is a phrase I heard more than once from liberal priests and nuns.)
The Dreyfus Affair is worth a short detour, since it split French society for many years and it became a major topic in proust's life--and in Remembrance of Things Past. Alfred Dreyfus (1859-1935) was a Jew and a captain in the French army. In December 1894 he was condemned by a military court for having sold military secrets to the Germans and was sent for life to Devil's Island. The accusation was based on the evidence of a memorandum stolen from the German embassy in Paris (despite the fact that the writing did not resemble Dreyfus's) and of a dossier (which was kept classified and secret) handed over to the military court by the minister of war. In 1896 another French soldier, Major Georges Picquart, proved that the memorandum had been written not by Dreyfus but by a certain Major Marie Charles Esterhazy. Yet Esterhazy was acquitted and Picquart was imprisoned. Instantly a large part of the population called for a retrial of Dreyfus. On January 13, 1898, the writer Emile Zola published an open letter, J'accuse, directed against the army's general staff; Zola was tried and found guilty of besmirching the reputation of the army. He was forced to flee to England. Then in September 1898 it was proved that the only piece of evidence against Dreyfus in the secret military dossier had been faked by Joseph Henry, who confessed his misdeed and committed suicide. At last the government ordered a retrial of Dreyfus.
The allure of hooking up has not been quashed by the pandemic. A couple in Barcelona. At a time when social norms around physical touch and closeness have been altered, those looking to hook up are having to rewrite the rules. Credit... Nacho Doce/Reuters If you're in a relationship (or haven't been out much since March), it may be news to you that despite a raging pandemic, people are meeting up, cuddling, making out and having sex with new partners, often weighing their emotional and physical needs against safety concerns. Some have gone about their private lives quietly, out of fear that those in their social circles — especially established couples — would judge their choices. Others have been more conspicuous when hooking up. In November, New York sheriffs broke up an 80-person party at a sex club in Queens. That same month, a swingers' convention in New Orleans led to 41 people testing positive for the coronavirus. Going on dates has involved a mental calculus not unlike the kind applied to other social interactions in the Covid-19 era: Will I feel safe? What is the likelihood of infection? How many people could this hurt? But hookups have been viewed with particular scrutiny. Even pre-pandemic, there was a lot of stigma around sexuality and sex in general, said Dr. Oni Blackstock, the former assistant commissioner at the New York City Department of Health's Bureau of H.I.V. With the pandemic, there's another layer of expectations and judgment.
Not all his big bets paid off. Perhaps his best-known debacle was Jobriath, a gay performer whom Mr. Brandt backed with a lavish promotional campaign in 1973 and '74, hoping to create an American version of David Bowie's androgynous Ziggy Stardust persona. The concertgoing and record-buying public soundly rejected the attempt to manufacture a star, and Jobriath, whose real name was Bruce Campbell, faded quickly.

All the members of the California panel were educators selected by the State Board of Education, whose members were appointed by former Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat. The Texas panel, appointed by the Republican-dominated State Board of Education, was made up of educators, parents, business representatives and a Christian pastor and politician.
It was a candid, nonchalant answer. Mr. Hanson remembered the hiring partner being a little flabbergasted by it — though, he added, they definitely appreciated my frankness.
The result, Federico notes, is that group consciousness is likely to emerge on the basis of education and training and when those with less education see themselves as being culturally very different from an educated stratum of the population that is more socially liberal and cosmopolitan, then the sense of group conflict is deepened.
Joyce met Proust once and they exchanged scarcely a word, even though they shared a cab together (neither had read the other). Beckett wrote a small critical book about Proust; Woolf admired Proust so intensely that she felt swamped by his genius. Gide's bitterest regret was that as a founder of a fledgling but already prestigious publishing house, he turned down Swann's Way, the first volume of Proust's masterpiece (he thought of Proust as a superficial snob and a mere reporter of high-society events). Genet began to write his first novel, Our Lady of the Flowers, after reading the opening pages of Proust's Within a Budding Grove. Genet was in prison and he arrived late in the exercise yard for the weekly book exchange; as a result he was forced to take the one book all the other prisoners had rejected. And yet once he'd read the opening pages of Proust he shut the book, wanting to savor every paragraph over as long a period as possible. He said to himself; Now, I'm tranquil, I know I'm going to go from marvel to marvel. His reading inspired him to write; he hoped to become the Proust of the underclass.
A lot of their recruiting goes on around fraternities, but fraternities aren't getting together, said Rosanna Hertz, chair of women's and gender studies at Wellesley College and co-author of Random Families, a book on donor conception. People want college-educated sperm, so to speak.
She prays that Mary-Beth will become a nun too, though she admitted that the possibility seemed remote for her lively, sociable daughter, who is chairman of her prom committee. He seldom knocks us off a horse like he did Paul, Aileen reflected. If we're always listening to rock music or doing homework and busy with worldly things, you seldom get to hear our Lord. Enough, said Mary-Beth. Brian Bashista's upbringing was not intensely religious, and he and his older brother, John, now married and a father, attended public schools. My mom and dad were not always so strong in their faith, Bashista explained. John and I were never altar boys. When he was in junior high school, his mother plunged more deeply into Catholicism and pressed her son Brian to do the same. In her fervor, it wasn't necessarily an invitation, he said. It was: 'You need to do this. It will help you.' John and I were teen-agers, and we both resisted. 'Say the family rosary, Mom, are you kidding? I'm going out with friends.' These memories may partly explain Bashista's scrupulous effort never to sound overbearing or judgmental. Propose, not impose, is a phrase he often repeats. Lead them to the truth, don't slam them with it. That's not the way Jesus did it. Bashista is more judgmental when describing his own life before he entered the seminary. Our Lord gave me everything I ever wanted, he recalled.
Jared is particularly interesting because it shows where America has come to, he said, and that America is a much, much more tolerant place than it was.

Despite the high profile of the scandals involving the sexual abuse of minors by Catholic priests, there is no evidence that the incidence of sexual misconduct is greater among priests than among clergy of other denominations or the population at large. But this is of little comfort to Catholic clergy or parishioners -- nor is it likely to alter the widely held perception that men who choose to live celibate lives have psychological problems they wish to conceal. This perception is not lost on the seminarians. Magat was dating a woman before he entered the seminary, but he avoided telling her that he was considering a vocation until the last possible moment. I was afraid, he says. If I decided not to go to the seminary and I'd told her in advance, then I'm out of the vocation and I'm out of her. Because I knew she would have dropped me like a hat. For a long time, Bashista says, he was critical of the fact that priests cannot marry, and celibacy was a big impediment for many years as he struggled with the idea of becoming a priest. I really felt that I was called to be a father and a husband, he says. I thought that was why I was placed on earth. There was a girl I dated in college -- we'd even had talks about getting married. Bashista's initial aversion to celibacy is widespread among men of his generation, according to Dean Hoge, a professor of sociology at Catholic University.
In England not long ago a survey of writers and critics revealed that the twentieth-century novelist they most admired--and who they thought would have the most enduring influence on the next century--was Marcel Proust. Certainly the madeleine moistened by herbal tea has become the most famous symbol in French literature; everyone refers to sudden gusts of memory as Proustian experiences. Snobs like to point out that if the Prousts had been better-mannered and not given to dunking, world literature would have been the poorer for it. Even those who haven't read Proust speak of him freely and often.

That's quite a soap opera to pile onto poor Dvorak's wonderful and large-spirited quartet. Mr. Gomes is not short of ideas; but almost none of them feel organic. There are forcefully folksy handclaps where the music doesn't call for them; later, when the music develops a folk atmosphere, Mr. Gomes ignores it. Though I believe that there are many such small-town stories to tell, I don't believe the way Mr. Gomes tells this one. He keeps nudging us to notice the same points about the same relationships. The long pas de deux between the husband and wife creates its own clichés.

On gender and sexuality, California textbooks include history that is not in Texas editions. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Growth & Conflict, California, P. 624 California states that the federal government failed to recognize nonbinary gender identities and female leaders in its early relations with Native Americans. McGraw-Hill, United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 111 Texas does not mention gender roles or gender identity in its discussion of efforts to Americanize Native Americans.

In a country that cannot come to a consensus on fundamental questions — how restricted capitalism should be, whether immigrants are a burden or a boon, to what extent the legacy of slavery continues to shape American life — textbook publishers are caught in the middle. On these questions and others, classroom materials are not only shaded by politics, but are also helping to shape a generation of future voters.
I worked for the firm I wanted to work for, I had a lot of friends. But I was my first priority, and if being nice to people helped me, then I did it. I was engrossed in the office gossip: Oh, we shouldn't be saying this, but loving every minute of it. I'd go buy clothes. You don't want to wear the same pants or shirt in one week. ... Are you kidding? I'd get extremely frustrated over the stupidest things, getting ink on a new white $70 shirt and going ballistic.
That shift may resonate most strongly with those who have known the country as it was.
As the voices of women, people of color, and other traditionally marginalized communities grow louder the frame of reference from which we tell the story of American is expanding. The white male story is not irrelevant but it's insufficient, and when you have a group of people that are accustomed to the spotlight see the camera lens pan away, it's a threat to their sense of self. It's not surprising that QAnon support started to soar in the weeks after B.L.M. QAnon offers a way for white evangelicals to place blame on (fictional) bad people instead of a broken system. It's an organization that validates the source of Q-Anoners insecurity — irrelevance — and in its place offers a steady source of self-righteousness and acceptance.
For some, the conversion experience rescued them from paths that Holloway refers to, in his own case, as serious darkness and sin. A onetime actor and a singer in an alternative-rock band, Holloway had dropped out of college and was living with fellow musicians when his parents persuaded him to attend a weekend conference devoted to the Virgin Mary. At the end, the keynote speaker invited all of those who believed they might have vocations to approach the stage. Holloway remembers: I had an interior experience almost as if Our Lady was standing behind me with her hands on my shoulders, leaning down to say, 'If you will put your vocation in my hands, I will take care of all the things you consider obstacles.' My heart was pounding. And I found myself climbing over this balcony and going down there.

When Mr. Bentley ran for governor in 2010, Christian voters saw extraordinary promise in the obscure lawmaker from Tuscaloosa who liked to tell people about how Bear Bryant, the revered University of Alabama football coach, had been one of his patients.

Even after people leave religions where they have suffered abuse, they can still harbor the emotional conviction that they are basically sinful and wrong, says Marlene Winell, a human development expert who coined the term religious trauma syndrome in a series of articles in 2011.
He read some promos for his sponsor Blinds.com. He took calls from listeners. He talked about the importance of children respecting parents (very important) and about how parents should not want their children to be the smartest in the class, but rather the most moral.
Public opinion was bitterly divided between the leftist Dreyfusards, who demanded justice and truth, and the anti-Dreyfusards, who led an anti-Semitic campaign, defended the honor of the army, and rejected the call for a retrial. The conflict led to a virtual civil war. In 1899 Dreyfus was found guilty again, although this time under extenuating circumstances--and the president pardoned him. Only in 1906 was Dreyfus fully rehabilitated, named an officer once again, and decorated with the Legion of Honor. Interestingly, Theodor Herzl, the Paris correspondent for a Viennese newspaper, was so overwhelmed by the virulent anti-Semitism of the Dreyfus Affair that he was inspired by the prophetic idea of a Jewish state.
consistent with the decline in the odds of marriage between high school dropouts and those with more education since the 1970s, a period over which the real wages of men in this education group declined.
The great Colette completely failed to sense his value when she first ran into Proust (they were both very young and just starting out as writers). She'd even gone so far, in one of her early Claudine novels, as to call him a yid (youpin), but her husband urbanely crossed out the insult and replaced it with boy (garcon). Even cleaned up, the passage doesn't make for very pleasant reading. It states that at a literary salon, I was pursued, politely, all evening by a young and pretty boy of letters. Because of her cropped hair, unusual for the period, he kept comparing her to the young god Hermes or to a cupid drawn by Prud'hon. My little flatterer, excited by his own evocations, wouldn't leave me alone for a second.... He gazed at me with caressing, long-lashed eyes.... At the same time, in 1895, she wrote Proust a letter in which she acknowledged that he had recognized a crucial truth: The word is not a representation but a living thing, and it is much less a mnemonic sign than a pictorial translation.
Anthony Rendon, the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly, said in an interview Monday morning that while he supported some of Mr. Newsom's initiatives, he had strong reservations about raising taxes to pay for them, as Mr. Newsom's aides have suggested.
The decline of male status in the family is more sharply articulated than in Europe, hastened in the U.S. by economic inequality (men fall further under changing economic circumstances) and religiosity (leading to pockets of greater male resistance to the redefinition of gender roles).
He carefully threaded the needle for listeners as he made the argument for Mr. Trump as a values leader. There are two types of values, micro and macro, he argued. One seems to do with the minutiae of one's life (marital fidelity, religiosity, respect); the other, he says, is more important and relates to the general effect of one's life.
How the National University of Singapore has kept the coronavirus off campus. Students and staff at the National University of Singapore move within their designated zones on campus in November. Universities in Singapore have avoided coronavirus cases in part by using technology. Credit... Ore Huiying for The New York Times Every day, Tan Eng Chye, the president of the National University of Singapore, scans his online dashboard to see how crowded the cafeterias are. If the real-time map shows that one cafeteria is too packed, he has administrators send out an advisory to avoid it and to remind students that there are campus-run food delivery services, free of charge. Following the government's lead, universities in Singapore, a semi-authoritarian city-state of almost six million people, have taken a top-down approach to managing the coronavirus. The result: Since the start of the pandemic last year, not one person has been found to have contracted the virus at any of Singapore's three major universities. While Singapore's universities have benefited from a generally low caseload in its broader population, their experience and stringent measures stand in stark contrast to many campuses across the United States. A number of American universities experienced an explosion in cases almost as soon as students returned last fall. The National University of Singapore, or N.U.S., describes its strategy as containment, decongestion and contact tracing. The university has harnessed technology to enforce social distancing measures, assigned students to different zones on campus and imposed tough penalties for flouting the rules.
Here's one example: On this annotated Bill of Rights, a California textbook explains that rulings on the Second Amendment have allowed for some gun regulations.
or the seminarians at Mount Saint Mary's, there is little question about what will ultimately happen. We already know the end of the story, Bashista says. God will triumph. The church will triumph. That doesn't mean that the present trials aren't there. Think of fourth-century Aryanism, when two-thirds of the church, including bishops, didn't believe that Jesus was God! But the threats will never succeed. The essentials will never change. How do we know that? Because Christ said so. Still, they admit, the sheer magnitude of what they're up against in their wish to transform a largely indifferent world can be crushing at times. I always think of 'Cliffhanger,' says Magat, referring to the Sylvester Stallone thriller. They have to climb up the cliff with no ropes, going backward. That is our life. There's a lot of skepticism out there, a lot of cynicism. The easiest thing is to say, Forget it, this is not my responsibility. Let someone else do it. And I think that's what a lot of guys are saying when they don't answer the call to the priesthood. Bashista keeps a folder titled Thanks Be to God, in which he places any cards or letters he receives describing the impact he has had on people's lives. When he mentioned the folder to the others at the diner that winter night, each admitted that he, too, was amassing a similar file. There may come a day when I say, Was this all worth it? Holloway explained, as dessert was cleared away.

You don't have to make a big deal of it. It's playing with fire. Sometimes these images will bombard your memory. If he begins to feel aroused, Bashista said, you have to channel that energy in productive ways. Doing something for someone else. If you're looking at ladies, getting some thoughts or ideas, just refocus. And yet, many of these men were reared on popular culture and find it difficult to give up. On a lot of TV shows, you know married couples are contracepting, Magat said. And any time Jerry hooked up with some girl in 'Seinfeld,' we knew they were sleeping together. . . . Should I find these things funny? This is the stuff I'm going to be preaching against! Magat stopped watching Seinfeld, but kept track of what was happening on the show to the very end from nonseminary friends. For a long time, Michael Dobbins was a devoted fan of James Taylor. I went to several of his concerts and I had his T-shirts, his CD's -- I was taking guitar lessons so I could learn to play his songs, he said. Then I began to realize that a lot of his lyrics are like, peace, love and butterflies are free -- whatever goes. But whatever goes really isn't the truth, you know? And finally one day I'm listening to this James Taylor concert on the radio, and he says, 'This is a hymn to the goddess Gaya.'
Publishers are eager to please state policymakers of both parties, during a challenging time for the business. Schools are transitioning to digital materials. And with the ease of internet research, many teachers say they prefer to curate their own primary-source materials online.
And here lies the crux of their sense of mission, and the optimism that fuels it: the so-called freedoms of our secular and relativistic culture have not paid off, they insist; on the contrary, they have created a dangerous and uninhibited world where families are ravaged by divorce, abortion, addiction and violence. Someone who chooses something they know is destructive, that's not freedom -- that's slavery, said Bashista. Freedom is knowing your choices and then choosing the truth. There is another reason to resist being of this world -- not just for seminarians but also for all fervid Catholics. This world is not the end, Bashista reminded me. That communion we're seeking will happen in the next life. Heaven is the subject of rich fantasy among the seminarians; they imagine it as a place unfettered by limitations of time or space, where they will meet and love the many anonymous strangers they pass each day in restaurants and highways. Jim Crisman, a seminarian from Denver who taught for a time in Slovakia, recalled one day: I'd go to a 4:00 Mass every day in Slovakia, and I'd see the old women coming in. I couldn't communicate with them. And I was thinking, I don't know anything about them, but I will someday. This isn't the last time that I'll see them.
American history is not anymore the story of great white men, said Albert S. Broussard, a history professor at Texas A&M University and an author of both the Texas and California editions of McGraw-Hill's textbooks.
Bishop Blake is not someone to be found on protest lines or shouting down law enforcement; he tends to advocate through more formal channels. He departs from some activist ministers in his social conservatism, opposing same-sex marriage and abortion. Yet he tries to strike a welcoming posture in an era of activists who can feel like the church is judging them.
A sprawling, populous complex that serves 3,600 families and runs an elementary school, Blessed Sacrament has a pastor, three associate priests and Bashista, reflecting a bounty of vocations in and around Arlington that is out of keeping with the general trend. Bashista assumed at first that he would join a diocese in greater need of priests, he said, but in that process, some doors open, other doors close. The match seemed to be in Arlington. Bashista may spend as many as 15 years as an associate pastor, whereas in priest-starved dioceses like Denver, where Crisman will be ordained, a new priest might be placed in charge of a parish as soon as two years after ordination -- thrown into a vast organizational and fiscal job (parishes are financially independent, though they may borrow money from their dioceses) that can put a great deal of pressure on an inexperienced priest. After the Mass, parishioners gathered around Bashista and the other priests outside the church. Several complimented Bashista on his homily. One woman had a little boy with her who was afraid to make his first confession; would Bashista talk with him? A young drummer with an Army band thought he might have a vocation; Bashista promised to send him some information. A number of people asked him to pray for them, and he always assented -- and asked them to pray for him, too. (Later, he recorded the names of new parishioners he had met in a small book to help him remember them.)
Magat, who worked as a health-care consultant before entering the seminary, learned that some colleagues were wondering if he was gay after he divulged his intention to be a priest. At first I felt emasculated, he says. I had a nave view of what people thought about priests; in my home environment and my family, priests are upheld as pillars of the community. In fact, there is a concern among some within the church that the proportion of gay men entering the priesthood has risen sharply. Magat and Bashista claim that they are not aware of gay men at Mount Saint Mary's, but say that it shouldn't matter if some seminarians have homosexual inclinations, since anyone seeking to become a Catholic priest, straight or gay, is striving to live a celibate life. The conversation drifts to another, darker presumption about the sexuality of priests. Magat recalls an encounter he had recently in a supermarket. I was standing in line in my clerics, he says. The woman in front of me was checking out her groceries, and her young son in the shopping cart, probably 2 or 3, he was kind of looking at me, interested. I waved and said, 'Hi, how's it going?' and she pulled him out of the cart and away from me. I was just mortified.
you can have dignity, but it must be earned through market or entrepreneurial success (as the Reagan/Thatcher center-right would have it) or the meritocratic attainment of professional status (as the center-left would have it). But obviously, these are not avenues available to all, simply because society has only so many positions for captains of industry and educated professionals.
The two spent some time together, and a couple of months later, they saw each other again at the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association world conference in Bangkok. While they felt a strong attraction at both gatherings, Ms. Hartman was up front with Ms. Michels about already having a partner, though that relationship was rocky. Their budding friendship remained platonic.

But Florida has used only about 30 percent of the vaccine doses it has received, a smaller proportion than 29 other states. How do you do something this huge and roll it out? said Dr. Leslie M. Beitsch, the chairman of the behavioral sciences and social medicine department at Florida State University. It's not in any way surprising — to anyone who followed it closely, for sure — that there would be halting kind of progress and missteps getting something of this magnitude underway initially, whether we're talking about Florida or the entire country. With states and counties left by the federal government to sort out logistics largely by themselves, the rollout has gone anything but smoothly. In Florida, images of seniors camped on sidewalks overnight in Fort Myers and Daytona Beach for first-come, first-served vaccines drew national attention. Health department offices that tried to offer scheduled appointments saw their phone systems and websites crash; at least one now accepts requests only by mail. Each of our 67 counties seems to be taking a slightly different pathway — and that's remarkable, because we have a single department of health that is supposed to cover the entire state, Dr. Beitsch said.

At his inauguration on Tuesday, the Denver Gay Men's Chorus warmed up with True Colors (Cyndi Lauper, who first recorded it, was booked for the inaugural ball that night) before remarks from local grandees and faith leaders and the new officials were sworn in. Mr. Polis sat with Mr. Reis and their children behind a pane of bulletproof glass, a precaution one veteran Colorado reporter noted he hadn't seen in five previous inaugurations. But when Mr. Polis got up to speak — after a quick selfie with the crowd — he addressed divisiveness and diversity only briefly.
What is less clear is whether what works in a primary will be harmful in the general election and whether the cascade of apologies risks making Democrats look like the hypersensitive, politically correct crowd Republicans make them out to be — especially when compared with President Trump, who often insults and offends people and almost never apologizes for anything.
People came up to me afterward and said: 'No one ever preaches on that. Thank you.' Holloway gave me a tape of a lecture he delivered to teen-age boys, in which he told them: Let me be perfectly clear. Sometimes people just won't say this: masturbation is always a seriously disordered act. . . . In itself, it is always wrong. He urged the boys to confess their sins, and afterward, I was told, they did, lining up in scores outside the confessionals. And if they hadn't? If you preach on these topics, you're going to endure a wrath, Bashista said. But if you are indeed teaching the truth -- what the church is saying, that has transcended time -- Christ says, you're going to endure ridicule. Because He did.
Before the mob breached the Capitol, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, overseeing the certification of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory and debate over a Republican effort to subvert those results in certain states, admonished Republicans for having too many people on the floor and for some objectors refusing to wear masks as they spoke. As the 117th Congress reconvened a week ago, multiple lawmakers tested positive for the coronavirus after taking their oath. Late Wednesday, one Republican, Representative Jake LaTurner of Kansas, received positive test results after voting on the House floor to overturn Arizona's results and did not return for a second vote early Thursday. It was unclear where Mr. LaTurner was sheltering in place as the mob tried to break into the House chamber, but in a statement issued shortly before 3 a.m. on Thursday, his office said he was not experiencing symptoms. Because lawmakers qualified for early access to the coronavirus vaccine, many have received at least one shot of a two-dose vaccine, with some receiving both doses. Some congressional aides have been authorized to receive the two-dose vaccine.

The zero tolerance on issues of race also played out in the almost immediate demands by nearly all the Democratic presidential candidates that Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia resign over a racist yearbook photo. (Mr. Northam began with an apology but pivoted to a new defense when he triggered a crush of calls for him to resign.)
But those within the church say that the increasingly secular nature of American life has taken the biggest toll on vocations. This is the world of advanced science and physics -- what are priests doing in this world? asks the Rev. Lorenzo Albacete, a theology professor at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers. Those that come into the seminary today are taking a radical stand. They are countercultural.
