{"original": "august 27, 1974 obituary daring lindbergh attained the unattainable with historic flight across atlantic by alden whitman in paris at 10:22 p.m. on may 21, 1927, charles augustus lindbergh, a one-time central minnesota farm boy, became an international celebrity. a fame enveloped the 25-year-old american that was to last him for the remainder of his life, transforming him in a frenzied instant from an obscure aviator into a historical figure. the consequences of this fame were to exhilarate him, to involve him in profound grief, to engage him in fierce controversy, to turn him into an embittered fugitive from the public, to accentuate his individualism to the point where he became a loner, to give him a special sense of his own importance, to allow him to play an enormous role in the growth of commercial aviation as well as to be a figure in missile and space technology, to give him influence in military affairs, and to raise a significant voice for conservation, a concern that marked his older years. all these things were touched off when a former stunt flier and airmail pilot touched down the wheels of his small and delicate monoplane, the spirit of st. louis, on the tarmac of lebourget 33 1/2 hours after having lifted the craft off roosevelt field on long island.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "thousands--no one knows how many--trampled through fences and over guards to surround the silvery plane and to acclaim, in a wild outburst of emotion, the first man to fly the atlantic solo nonstop from the united states to europe--a feat that was equivalent in the public mind then to the first human step on the moon 42 years later. icarus had at last succeeded, a daring man alone had attained the unattainable. what enhanced the fear for many was that lindbergh was a tall, handsome bachelor with a becoming smile, an errant lock of blond hair over his forehead and a pleasing outward modesty and guilelessness. he was the flawless el cid, the gleaming galahad, frank merriwell in the flesh. the delirium that engulfed paris swirled out over the civilized world. banner headlines heralded the event. medals galore were bestowed on lindbergh. he was gushed over, adulated, worshiped, feted in france, belgium and britain. president calvin coolidge sent the cruiser memphis, flagship of the united states european fleet, to bring him and the spirit of st. louis back to the united states and later awarded him the medal of honor, previously reserved only for military heroes. and already a captain in the united states officers reserve corps, lindbergh was jumped to a full colonel. as the cruiser steamed up chesapeake bay, she was met by four destroyers, two army blimps and 40 airplanes from the army, navy and marine corps.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "debarking at washington in a civilian's blue serge suit, lindbergh was glorified by the president, who said that the trans- atlantic flight was the same story of valor and victory by a son of the people that shines through every page of american history. the panoplied washington reception, which was topped by an award--the first in the nation's history--of the distinguished flying cross, was followed by an even noisier outpouring in new york, where four million people spilled into the streets. ticker tape and confetti rained on the broadway parade, and the day was climaxed by a banquet for 4,000 guest. we measure heroes as we do ships, by their displacement, the bewhiskered charles evans hughes told the multitude. colonel lindbergh has displaced everything. and then there were triumphal parades and receptions, seemingly endless, in other cities. lindbergh eventually flew the spirit of st. louis to every state in the union. everywhere he went a throng collected. even a supposedly private visit to orville wright, co-inventor of the airplane, was noised about and crowds appeared. lindbergh, at one point, was so filled up with listening to this hero guff that i was ready to shout murder. what the parades, the pandemonium, the oratory, the hero worship obscured was that lindbergh's epic flight was a most minutely planned venture by a professional flier with 2,000 air hours amassed over five years. why shouldn't i fly from new york to paris?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he had asked himself in september, 1926. i have more than four years of aviation behind me. i've barnstormed over half of the 48 states. i've flown my mail through the worst of nights. there had been two previous atlantic flights--both in 1919, the first when one of three navy craft flew from newfoundland to the azores; and the second when john alcock and arthur brown made it from newfoundland to ireland. but no one had made the crossing alone, or from continent to continent. once he conceived the notion of the flight, lindbergh, with characteristic energy, began to elaborate the details. he helped design the plane to his specifications, calculating every ounce that went into it. he laid out his route. every foreseeable circumstance was checked out. two elements could not be figured: the weather and his ability to stay awake. with the weather he took a calculated risk. fighting off sleep proved a problem, and only his indomitable determination overcame that, although he conceded there were moments of touch-and-go. one of the attractions for the paris flight was a $25,000 prize, for which there were several competitors, among them clarence chamberlin and adm. richard e. byrd. lindbergh, though, was confident he could be first and be successful. he was motivated, he told this writer in later years, by a desire to improve his standing as a pilot as well as by an eagerness to win the prize.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and although there was great interest in him before take-off time (his hope and that of his rivals to fly the atlantic had excited wide newspaper coverage), lindbergh had not calculated the response to his achievement, the degree to which he would be lionized or the extent to which he would be regarded as public property, especially by reporters and photographers, whom he came quickly to detest. 'extraordinary situation' the situation i encountered was extraordinary in the extreme, and often fantastic, he recalled, and cited, as an example, a woman who wanted to rent the hotel room i was leaving so she could take a bath in the same tub. overwhelmed, without precedents to guide him, pressed by dizzying demands on his time, lindbergh was happy to accept an invitation from harry guggenheim, a very rich and very conservative financier who was connected with the daniel guggenheim fund for the promotion of aeronautics, to escape for a while to his long island estate. the invitation was at the suggestion of dwight morrow, the morgan banker, who told mr. guggenheim, harry, almost everyone in the country is after this young fellow, trying to exploit him. isn't there something you and the fund can do, to save him from the wolves? at falaise, the guggenheim castle, which was perhaps the most opulent private home he had stayed in, the aviator was able to catch his breath for three weeks and rewrite the ghostwritten manuscript that became the book we.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he also retained henry breckinridge, a conservative wall street lawyer, to help handle his affairs. many of his new associates held conservative views, which his father, a neo-populist republican, spent 20 years fighting. lindbergh was not conceived of then as a possible political figure, but rather as a nice young man, perhaps a little unpolished socially, who deserved the best that could be provided. his new friends were considerate of his strong individualism. they did not impose flattery, they were respectful and, above all, helpful. the income from we and from his flight articles in the new york times made him a millionaire--a considerable eminence for a man accustomed to thinking hard before he spent $5. his friends helped him invest his fortune. and after lindbergh made his goodwill flights around the country and to latin america in the spirit of st. louis, his friends saw to it that he got a job in keeping with his interest in aviation and his status. the position was as an adviser in both pan american world airways and the predecessor of trans world airlines in laying out transatlantic, transcontinental and caribbean air routes for the commercial aviation that his paris flight had done so much to popularize.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the conservative views that lindbergh later articulated, the remarks about jews that proved so startling when he was opposing american entry into world war ii, his adverse opinion of the soviet union, his belief in western civilization--these were all a reflection of a world view prevalent among his friends, which he absorbed over the years. an engineer and aviator of genius, he was, however, not an intellectual, nor a consistent reader, nor a social analyst. the assumption of this elitism accounted for his conviction that america should lead the world in the development of flight, that a conflict between english and german groups of nations would [be] a fratricidal war, that race was a valid judgmental concept and that to accomplish an objective one should deal with the top people. it also accounted for what many people thought was his anti-semitism. lindbergh did not regard himself as an anti-semite. indeed, he was shocked a couple of years ago when this writer put the question to him. good god, no, he responded, citing his fondness for jews he had known or dealt with. nor did he condone the nazi treatment of german jews, much less hitler's genocidal policies. on the other hand, he accepted as fact that american jewish groups were among those promoting united states involvement in world war ii.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he voiced these views in a speech in des moines, iowa, on sept. 11, 1941. after asserting that those groups responsible for seeking american entanglement in european affairs were the british, the jewish and the roosevelt administration, he went on to say: it is not difficult to understand why jewish people desire the overthrow of nazi germany. the persecution they suffered in germany would be sufficient to make bitter enemies of any race. no person with a sense of the dignity of mankind can condone the persecution the jewish race suffered in germany. but no person of honesty and vision can look on their prowar policy here today without seeing the dangers involved in such a policy, both for us and for them. instead of agitating for war, the jewish groups in this country should be opposing it in every possible way, for they will be among the first to feel its consequences. tolerance is a virtue that depends upon peace and strength. a few far-sighted jewish people realize this and stand opposed to intervention. but the majority still do not. their greatest danger to their country lies in their large ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio and our government. the speech evoked a nationwide outcry. lindbergh, it was said, had not only impugned the patriotism of american jews, but also had used the word race, a word many jews considered both pejorative and inaccurate. lindbergh never withdrew his remarks, which he considered statements of obvious fact.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the violence of the reaction to my naming these groups was significant and extremely interesting, he said 25 years later. in hindsight, i would not change my action. lindbergh's attitude toward the jews was matched by an adamantine stubbornness on other matters. these together sometimes cast him in an unfavorable public light. one example of his unwillingness to concede that he might have acted unwisely involved the service cross of the german eagle, a civilian medal that was awarded him in 1938 by hermann goering, the nazi leader, at the direction of hitler. the presentation, a surprise to lindbergh, was made at a stag dinner in the home of the american ambassador to berlin and was, he was told, in recognition of his services to aviation, especially his 1927 flight. the award was reported briefly in the newspapers and stirred little criticism. however, the night of the award mrs. lindbergh told her husband that it was the albatross, and she urged him to return it. lindbergh took the position then and later that to do so would affront the ambassador and goering, as well, who was technically his host in germany. although he never wore the medal (he gave it to the lindbergh collection of the missouri historical society in st. louis, along with other awards and trophies), it became an issue when he opposed american war involvement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it led, among other things, to his being called a fascist sympathizer, particularly when he declined a suggestion in 1942 to repudiate it; and the medal plagued his reputation for the rest of his life. he disdained the criticism, however, saying: personally, i am not at all concerned about any damage that may have been done to my reputation by the presentation of the medal. i felt the throwing back of the medal was like taking part in a child's spitting contest. if i must fight, i'll fight; but i prefer not to spit at my enemy beforehand. also, i felt goering had given me the medal with good intent and in friendship. regardless of how much i disagreed with him about other things, or later on, i did not want to throw it back in his face. nonetheless, lindbergh, in his later years, was defensive in reciting the medal episode and sensitive in having it known that his wife was among his critics. like most people, lindbergh was a bundle of unresolved contradictions. stubborn, proud, unable to see how jews might be offended by obvious facts, blind to the villainies of hitlerism, he was, in his relationships with his few close friends, a considerate, delightful, sensitive, helpful, unpretentious person who did not obtrude his social and political views, nor make agreeing with them a condition of steadfast friendship. although he was the object of much flattery and one who succumbed to some of it, he did not like a fuss made over him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he sometimes sounded pompous in print, but he was not in person. indeed, he was a man of genuinely simple tastes who was happier in a sleeping bag than in a luxury hotel, who preferred eating wild boar with his fingers in the jungle to dining in expensive restaurants, who found more inner satisfaction with primitive than with sophisticated people and who was more at ease in knockabout attire than in street dress. lindbergh's life, like his personality, was full of shadows and enigmas. born feb. 4, 1902, in detroit, he was the son of c. a. lindbergh, a prosperous little falls, minn., lawyer and land speculator, and his second wife, evangeline lodge land. the elder lindbergh's first wife had died, leaving him two daughters. charles augustus lindbergh jr. was born in detroit because his mother's uncle was a physician there. he was returned to little falls six weeks later and lived in that small town, the center of a farming and timbering community, with few interruptions until he was 18. his paternal antecedents were swedes, who changed their name from mansons to lindbergh when they emigrated from sweden in 1860. they had a history of independence and vigor. the lands, of irish and english background, arrived in the united states shortly after 1812. lindbergh's maternal grandfather was c. h. land, a dentist and inventor. both dr. land and c. a. lindbergh were strong advocates of free inquiry and individual initiative, and both impressed on young charles the merits of personal independence.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lindbergh's youth was spent close to nature. his deep feeling for it was encouraged by his father, and these early attitudes surfaced toward the end of his life when he devoted much of his fantastic energies to the cause of conservation. also early in life, he showed a marked aptitude for mechanical contrivances. when he was 8 or 9, he worked out an ingenious and complicated system for getting ice from the icehouse into the icebox. charles's world was jolted when his father was elected to the house of representatives, where he served from 1907 to 1917. he went to washington, his first venture into a metropolis, and disliked it. about that time, his mother and father ceased living together, although for appearance's sake there was no legal separation and both parents took care to give the child a sense of security. apart from saying that the separation was a tragic situation for his parents, lindbergh shut his lips about the situation and shied from talking about the psychic hurts that he bore. he was equally taciturn on other personal matters. the future aviator's interest in flying was sparked in 1908 or '09, when, one day, he heard a buzzing in the sky and climbed out of a dormer window onto the roof of his home to witness a frail biplane skimming through the clouds.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the fun of flying afterward, i remember lying in the grass and looking up at the clouds and thinking how much fun it would be to fly up there among those clouds, he recalled in later years, adding: i didn't think of the hazards--i was just interested in getting up there in the clouds. but he was torn for a time by a strong yearning to go to alaska, a land pictured as wild frontier and the source of mythic gold rush tales. for him alaska was also the scene of robert w. service's verse, some of which he memorized so thoroughly that he could recite it faultlessly in old age. although lindbergh sr. led an active and exciting political life as a maverick republican who battled (and helped to overthrow) the entrenched establishment in the house, led an assault on the money trust and voted against american entry into world war i, his son was bored by politics and all the speeches. the issue that his father espoused in congress and later as a farmer-laborite supporter of robert lafollette failed, so the son said, to make any impressions on him. his mother, too, eschewed political thinking. in world war i, lindbergh operated the family farm, leaving it in the fall of 1920 to study engineering at the university of wisconsin.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "his grades were poor and he left after a year and a half, but not before learning how to shoot quarters out of the outstretched fingers of his friend at 50 feet with a rifle. from wisconsin, he motorcycled to the nebraska aircraft corporation in lincoln, which was then producing an airplane and giving flying lessons to promote the product. i can still smell the odor of dope [cellulose acetate or nitrate] that permeated each breath, he said years later in recalling his first close-up view of an aircraft. lindbergh took his first flight april 9, 1922. in succeeding months he learned to fly, to wing- walk and to parachute. of equal importance, he absorbed all there was to know about the planes of that day and the various styles of flying. and he made friends with fliers who passed through lincoln and with harlan a.

{"original": "it was all seat-of-the-pants flying and lindbergh gloried in it; but he gave it up to enlist in the army in march, 1924, so he could attend the army flying school at brooks field, san antonio, tex. for the first time, he found some joy in textbooks and classes. chief pilot on mail run indeed, he was graduated as the top man in his class, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the army air service reserve in march, 1925. he was by this time an experienced flier. he spent some time as an air circus stunt flier at county fairs and the like before being hired by the robertson aircraft company of st. louis as the chief pilot on the mail run to chicago. he made the first run in april, 1926. it was the only paycheck job in the normal sense of the word that he ever held. meantime, he had made a further commitment to the military by joining the missouri national guard, where he taught other pilots and became a first lieutenant. on one of his flights to chicago in september, 1926, he was musing about the possibilities of long-distance trips, and he startled himself by thinking i could fly nonstop between new york and paris. in many ways, lindbergh's life was a series of responses to imperatives. when he became convinced that he ought to do something--he ought to oppose entry into world war ii, he ought to speak out for conservation--he reacted with vigor and dispatch.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and virtually immediately he began to plan the details of the trip--getting financial backing, getting a specially designed plane, mapping the route, seeking to eliminate any chance of failure. ultimately, he persuaded a group of st. louis businessmen to put up $15,000, which was one reason why the plane was called the spirit of st. louis. after many racking incidents, the ryan company, with lindbergh's help, designed and built a craft tailored for him and the wright company built an engine of 223 horsepower to accommodate the plane. for several years after the paris flight, lindbergh lived in the glare of publicity and popping camera flashbulbs. the public would not let him alone. i recall steeping out of a building on wall street, and having almost everyone on the street turn and follow me, he said. he was regarded as a sort of oracle, and his opinion was solicited on every conceivable subject. he was, moreover, linked falsely in the press with a number of girls. his interest, however, was in anne spencer morrow, the beautiful blue-eyed daughter of dwight morrow, then ambassador to mexico. the couple met in mexico city at christmastime in 1927, when miss morrow, then a smith student, went there for the holidays. they were married in a private ceremony in the morrow home in new jersey on may 27, 1929. the marriage was union of opposites. sensitive, retiring, a poet, mrs. lindbergh wanted nothing so much as a life of peace and quiet.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "seldom coddling her, her husband proved hyperactive, happy as a nomad who was rarely at home for long periods. yet despite some moments of tension, the marriage was an enduring and affectionate one. for a while mrs. lindbergh accompanied her husband on many of his trips--to the caribbean, where he was laying out air routes; to europe and to asia. he had taught her to fly, and she learned to navigate and to operate a morse code radio. north to the orient is her chronicle of one of these flights. their first child, charles augustus 3d, was born june 24, 1930. twenty months later, when mrs. lindbergh was pregnant with her second child, the baby was kidnapped from his nursery crib in his parent's home in hopewell, n. j. the date was march 1, 1932. on may 12 the baby's body was found in a shallow grave not far from the house. in between, there was a bizarre hunt for the child that included payment of a $50,000 ransom at a cemetery in the bronx and a cast of characters that ranged from dr. john f. (jafsie) condon, a school principal, to gaston b. means, a swindler. there were false leads and sensations galore, through all of which lindbergh bore himself with great public stoicism. his private emotions were never disclosed, and about the only references that he made in later years to the kidnapping and murder were fleeting mentions of that new jersey business.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if public attention glared on lindbergh during the hunt for his son, it positively poured down on him with the arrest and trial of bruno richard hauptmann, a bronx carpenter, in 1934. the trial, which lindbergh attended daily, was reported with diligence and sensationalism. lindbergh received up to 100,000 letters a week, and the hopewell estate, which he had long since left, was overrun with curiosity seekers, one of whom dug up and lugged off the earth where the baby was found buried. a move to england after a six-week trial, in which a web of circumstantial evidence was women about hauptmann, he was found guilty and executed. although there were doubts (hauptmann, the german-born father of a son about the age of lindbergh's son, denied he was guilty), lindbergh was satisfied that hauptmann did the thing. meantime, there were new threats to kidnap lindbergh's second son, jon, and the family was living an abnormal existence. lindbergh was telling friends that americans exhibited a morbid curiosity over crimes and murder trials and lacked respect for law, or the rights of others. against this background, lindbergh took his family to england to seek a safe, secluded residence away from the tremendous public hysteria that surrounded him in the united states. one result of the case was passage of the so-called lindbergh law, which made kidnapping a federal crime.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "part of the statute was ruled unconstitutional in 1967. before departing, lindbergh completed a scientific project on which he had been working with dedication and enthusiasm since 1930. it was the design and building of a tissue-perfusion apparatus at rockefeller institute (now university) in new york. he was introduced to the project by dr. alexis carrel, who had won the nobel prize for physiology and medicine in 1912 for development of blood vessel transplant procedures. the french-born carrel was interested in the thirties in living organs outside the body, and the problem was to devise an instrument to perfuse these organs and keep them alive. for me, lindbergh recalled, that began an association with an extraordinarily great man. to me, his true greatness lay in the unlimited penetration, curiosity and scope of his mind, in his fearlessness of opinion, in his deep concerns about the trends of modern civilization and their effect on his fellow man. in addition to perfecting a pump--an important breakthrough in its time--lindbergh invented a quick way of separating serum from whole blood by means of a centrifuge. the lindbergh- carrel friendship lasted for 14 years, until the scientist's death in 1944. a brilliant investigator, carrel tinkered with philosophy and other matters; and his thoughts in these areas were sometimes quirky. he believed, for example, in extrasensory perception. he also spoke against industrial civilization and suggested that we ought to try to produce a certain number of individuals above the mental stature we observe in the best.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he said, moreover, that only the elite make the progress of the masses possible. some of these notions rubbed off on lindbergh and were reflected in his little-known book, of flight and life, in which he inveighed against scientific materialism. in this 1948 book, he said, i believe the values we are creating and the standards we are now following will lead to the end of our civilization, and that if we do not control our science by a higher moral force, it will destroy us with its materialistic values. in his plea for the recognition of metaphysical values, lindbergh wrote: to progress, even to survive, we must learn to apply the truth of god to the actions and relationships of men, to the direction of our science. we must learn from the sermons of christ, the wisdom of laotzu, the teachings of buddha. but lindbergh, in this book, also espoused a doctrine of american superiority in the world. for americans, the doctrine of universal equality is a doctrine of death, he wrote. if we ever become an equal people among other peoples of the world, our civilization will fall. when lindbergh went abroad to live, first in britain and then in france, he was 33 years old. he was immediately treated with courtesy and respect--and given the privacy he so much desired. his new friends were in the upper reaches of british society and tory politics.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "moreover, as a distinguished aviator, he was invited to visit airplane factories in france by the french air ministry. he was also invited by the german government to inspect the luftwaffe and warplane factories in the reich. he received red-carpet treatment, visited many factories and was told repeatedly that the nazis were eager to create an air force second to none. he visited germany several times before 1938 and was increasingly impressed with the quality of the air force. it seemed to him all the more fearsome by comparison with the air arm in britain, france and the soviet union. by 1939 he had concluded that the power of the luftwaffe was overwhelming, and that the air forces of other european countries were comparatively insignificant. in off-the- record conversations with the leaders of these countries, the soviet union excepted, he sought to warn them of the perils they were facing. neither then nor later did lindbergh, according to his journals, believe that german air power would be the decisive factor in a war so much as it would be an essential element. and he sought to impress on france, britain and the united states the need to bestir themselves. lindbergh and his family returned to the united states in 1939 shortly before world war ii broke out. he felt he ought to do all he could to prevent american involvement. not a pacifist nor an isolationist, he was a noninterventionist.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "my opposition to world war ii resulted from the growing conviction that such a war would probably devastate europe, kill millions of men and possibly result in the end of western civilization, he told this writer a few years ago, adding: under the circumstances of prewar europe, i concluded that germany could not be defeated without the active intervention of the united states. i doubted that germany could be defeated even with american intervention. obviously this depended a great deal on the relationship between germany and russia. but if germany were defeated, it seemed to me almost certain that russia would be the real victor and that a stalin-dominated europe would be even worse than a hitler-dominated europe. i felt that the wisest policy for western powers would be to arm, stay neutral and let germany and russia clash--and thereafter to feel their way according to changing circumstances. i still think this would have been the wisest policy. lindbergh made his first antiwar speech--a radio talk--on sept. 17, 1939. it was arranged by fulton lewis, a well-known conservative commentator.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the reason, he replied, was that lindbergh was a defeatist, and he went on to compare him with representative clement l. vallandigham, a civil war congressman from ohio, the chief spokesman of a group called the copperheads, who said the north could never win. roosevelt's attack was perhaps set off by a lindbergh magazine article that declared, while our leaders have shouted for peace, they have consistently directed us toward war. 'insult from roosevelt' considering his honor impugned, lindbergh resigned his commission. if i did not tender my resignation, he said in the published version of his wartime journals, i would lose something in my own character that means even more to me than my commission in the air corps. no one else would know it, but i would. and if i take this insult from roosevelt, more, and worse, will probably be forthcoming. thirty years later lindbergh still felt wronged by the president, and professed not to see that he himself had questioned roosevelt's integrity. with pearl harbor, america first collapsed and lindbergh sought to join the armed forces. now that we are at war i want to contribute as best i can to my country's war effort, he wrote. it is vital for us to carry on this was as intelligently, as constructively, and as successfully as we can, and i want to do my part. his bid to soldier was rebuffed, however, an action for which he blamed roosevelt personally.", "augmented": []}

(goddard, who had been ridiculed for his ideas, has since been recognized as a space flight pioneer.) lindbergh was always proud of his association with goddard and of having raised money to fund his experiments. for 16 years until his death in 1945, goddard, also a loner, received lindbergh's help and encouragement; and goddard's basic rocketry patents were used in the development of united states missiles after the war.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the aviator's crucial assistance to goddard did not become well known until goddard's biography was published in 1963, a book for which lindbergh wrote an introduction. for more than 15 years after the war lindbergh virtually disappeared from the news. he was a member of army ordnance's chore project at the university of chicago; he was consultant to the secretary of the air force; he took part in the reorganization of the strategic air command; and he was a member of scientific ballistic-missile committees of the air force and the defense department. in 1954, he was commissioned a brigadier general in the air force reserve. much of the aviator's work in these years dealt with security-classified projects; but it is believed that he was active in rocketry and space flight programs, where his technical expertise was valuable. he enjoyed top-secret clearance, and spoke of his tasks as having to do with security. in this period, lindbergh completed his autobiographical account of his 1927 flight, which had been written in bits and pieces in various parts of the world over 14 years. the spirit of st. louis, published in 1953, won the pulitzer prize for biography in 1954 and was made into a movie three years later, with james stewart as the lead. the book was intended to supersede we, which, written in haste, had never satisfied the aviator as an accurate account of his flight. starting sometime after the war, he rejoined pan american as a consultant for the nominal fee of $600 a month.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the job, which eventually led to his working on the design specifications for the boeing 747, allowed him great freedom to travel and to develop any interest he chose. and travel he did, seemingly having no settled abode. in africa, in 1964, he found an interest that was to occupy his last years and to bring him out of his public reticence and reclusiveness. the issue was conservation. lying under an acacia tree with the sounds of the dawn around me, he recalled, i realized more clearly the facts that man should never overlook: that the construction of an airplane, for instance, is simple when compared to the evolutionary achievement of a bird; that airplanes depend on an advanced civilization, and that where civilization is most advanced few birds exist. i realized that if i had to choose, i would rather have birds than airplanes. he concluded, he said, that i ought to do something. concern for environment that imperative, which unfolded slowly, led him to activity in conservation organizations, to having a large hand in saving the humpback and the blue whales, to concern for endangered species and to public advocacy of steps to save the world's environment. he made his first public speech in 1968--the first since 1941--to the alaska legislature. the following year he granted what amounted to his first newspaper interview in 35 years. this was to the new york times and this writer, the occasion being his conservation activity in the philippines.", "augmented": []}

(it is worth noting that mr. allen's character undergoes an epiphany while seeing duck soup, perhaps a signal of resurgent marxism.) and those women, played by barbara hershey and dianne wiest as well as ms. farrow, are examples of the kind of complex, serious women who would eventually disappear from mr. allen's films, replaced by romantic foils and melodramatic fantasies.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "what's the power you have when you are playing a role? how do you think about that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what i realized early on, when you're in school and someone humiliates themselves or trips and falls or is embarrassed publicly, your age doesn't permit you to be mature enough to really embrace that person. instead, you want to distance yourself and laugh and like, oh, i'm glad i'm not that idiot who just fell down or whatever. but once people mature — and i think that's college and above — and you see someone in a vulnerable situation or embarrassed or humiliated, the great thing about human beings is that they don't feel they want to point the finger. they don't want to separate. what they feel is they want to embrace that person. they want to protect that person. and it's a really lovely human trait. well, if you can understand that and put that layer of vulnerability in your characters, that will happen to an audience, viscerally, when they sense that. they will emotionally wrap their arms around the character. and so i look for those opportunities to develop sympathies from the audience by way of vulnerability.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yeah, they lean into it, as opposed to distance themselves.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "is that different when you're on stage, versus in a tv series?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you approach the character the same way, as far as developmental qualities. you have to be insatiably curious and enjoy the research. you have to have talent to be able to bring it out. you have to use your imagination to string together any elements of a character that you have not had personal experience with. and the last part, the fourth part, is that you must be willing and able to open up the cavity of your own emotions to pull out what is appropriate, and that is to make yourself look good, bad. it's rage. it's public or physical vulnerability. like in breaking bad, i wanted the character to be soft and pudgy and overweight, so i wanted the love handles to spill out over my underwear. i wanted that. i needed the audience to feel sorry for this guy, that he's gone to seed, that he's lost his desire and his hope and his drive. and that's the whole point of the story is that he gets that back once he makes his decision to do his evil deeds. so he transforms his body and his look and his attitude and his ability to intimidate and his level of confidence, and all those things completely change.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yeah, so that was by design. as far as working on stage compared to film, the work itself is very different. in a play, you go through a beginning, middle, and end every single performance. whereas in film and television, you do bits and pieces. you might have a day where it's emotional, and then the next seven days, it's not. so it's much more tiring for me to do a play on a long run than it is to do film. you have moments when you can shut down and relax and rest.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so do you have trouble turning it off? i don't mean going home and doing an lbj accent. but you ever catch yourself acting the role of bryan cranston with your family or friends?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i suppose you do it, only if you're really troubled, if you're having difficulty getting a character to move into you and your soul and your being. that's a hard way to describe it. but basically, for an actor, when you start developing a character, it's outside of yourself. and the more research, the more thought, the more attention you put on that, the more you start to understand how he thinks and feels. and then you're inviting that character into yourself. and then almost like through osmosis, it comes in. and from that point on, you think and feel and act based on the filter of that character. well, if it's frustrating for you and it's not coming, it's not coming, which happens at times, yeah, i could see you going home and living with it and barking at the dog or whatever.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yeah. what's been the most difficult character for you to do that, of the most recent ones?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i guess the most difficult to date was lbj. i went down to the lbj library a couple of times and spent countless hours just trying to absorb the sense of him visually, vocally. there's copious amounts of books about him, which were all very helpful and endless. so you could just get completely absorbed, and i did. i got completely absorbed in developing the character that by the time i got to the art in harvard to do the out-of-town part of it, i was not prepared for the massive amount of dialogue that i was saying. i was so into developing the character that we did the table read, and i read through it, and i went, oh my god, i haven't started memorizing any of this. and i was panicked. i was really panicked that i wouldn't get it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you have a stack ranking of how you decide what roles to take and to turn down, correct? you have a list of how you —", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i do. i give everything a numerical rating. so i actually transfer my emotions into a kind of mathematical equation, which helps me look at it from a more objective viewpoint. because if you stay subjective to it and emotional to it, it's hard to make a decision because you might be swayed by the emotions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "right, right. so you have numbers?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "no, i give a numerical value to — number one is the story. i give it from one to five on the value of just the story. did it move me? was it important? did it resonate? did it stay with me? from there, i go to the written word, which i separate from the story. because you can have a great story, and you read it, and it's like, oh, i don't think the writer really got it. so i have to give that a separate rating. and the third thing is the character because i truly believe that it's the story and the power of the written word first that inspires a character. and i say this with all great respect to meryl. i say, if you gave meryl streep c-level material, she could get it to a b. her ability is unbelievable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i saw her in prom, and i'm like, she's still fantastic, and this is very light.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "let me ask you, then, so i can get it with a big role. so lbj, all the others, this recent one and your honor and breaking bad, those are all top numbers, i'm assuming. but i want you to explain how you scored these roles, if you don't mind, if you'll indulge me — rear admiral lyle haggerty in contagion, ramrod straight — by the way, prescient.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yeah, very prescient. the story was very good. scott burns wrote a really terrific script, so that got high marks. the character itself wasn't as high a mark for me. but then the fourth category, the director, was very high, steven soderbergh. so all of a sudden, the collective, cumulative score was very high.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "all right, i'm going to give you the harder one, ned in why him? and i saw why him?. i don't why i watch all of james franco's movies, but i do. i cannot explain it to you.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "yeah, it was too thin. and i thought, well, this is not right. but i knew that i needed to do and wanted to do a comedy. i was doing drama after drama after drama. and my whole structure of my approach to the career, long term, is to keep twisting and turning — do comedy, do drama, do stage, do film, do adult theme, do a children's show, whatever. so i knew i needed to do comedy, and it was time to do a big studio comedy, where i'm one of the two stars. but this was just so thin. i thought, i don't know. so i actually called paul rudd, and i said, paul, the premise is so thin. he goes, this is the way those comedies are. when you get on the set, they rely heavily on improvisation. you get these people together, and you start improving and improving and improving. and they cull the story out of that. and he said, i think you'll have a great time. and i can honestly say, i don't think i've had a better time on any film set than why him? in my career. it was hilarious.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "i was a working actor since the time i was 25. i made a living as my career. that's the professional achievement i'm most proud of is that i crossed a threshold — somehow, some way — when i got a job in new york city, moved from la to new york to be on a soap opera for two years.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "no, no. i'm not a worrier by nature, so i don't focus on any of that. it's just a reality. i'm very proud of breaking bad, of course, and it changed the trajectory of my career. and so i'm exceedingly happy that i did it. and what a great series. no, if that is the pinnacle of my career, as far as what the critics and the audiences know, then i'm perfectly happy with it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what would you think the greatest strength of walter white is? because i'd love to go through some of your recent characters like that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think his power was determination. he's faced with the idea of his demise within two years. he has a son with special needs. he as a child on the way and a wife, and he has no means of supporting them. when he's on his way out, his body will diminish. his wife will have to wipe his drool and empty his bedpan. his children will only know him as that skinny, sickly man in the other bedroom, and then he's gone. and that's just not what he wants. so his determination to change the text of his life was what drove him. and then what he discovers, purely accidentally, is that he's really good at it, and his ego came in and took control. you played the clip where he says, say my name — and you're goddamn right. he's now fully embraced with that new persona. it was dormant within him, apparently, and that had awakened.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's an interesting dichotomy because i want to talk about lyndon johnson, then, in all the way because he was blocked everywhere he went. it was different groups pulling at him at all sides. so what was your approach to figuring out his power?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, he had tremendous goals and ambition to do right, to do good, to leave a legacy. conversely, he also suffered from deep depression and tremendous insecurities, and so he would swing widely — all the way up, we're going to do this, nothing can be stopped to i can't do this, i'm going to go home. and his lady bird was absolutely essential to his success. without her, i do not believe he would have been as prolific in his work and accomplishments as he was.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i found him to be a very sympathetic character, which i did not expect. i think that's the part i was surprised by because he's such a cartoon character of kind of a bully, but he really isn't, in a lot of ways.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but remember, the sympathetic part is that he has this tremendous ambition to do good, to be a righteous man, and remember what you talked about, his deep insecurities. well, doesn't bullying come from insecurity, really? so that's where that stems from, his fear of failing and oh my god, i'm going to be known as the worst president. it drives him to force his will upon people and give him what was called the johnson treatment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, howard beale is very different. i saw you in network. i loved it. i was not sitting on the stage. my mother was sitting on the stage for one of the performances — she loved. he's a newscaster who famously said, i'm mad as hell, and i'm not going to take it anymore. it was a very famous movie. he threatens to kill himself on live tv. tell me about howard beale's relationship to power because he's powerless at the beginning of the show, really. i mean, he's been this newscaster, in a traditional sense, and has to shift.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think we all make compromises. certainly, in journalism, social graces force you to adjust. you're at a holiday dinner table, and what you feel is the direct opposite of what this person's saying. do you open your mouth? well, maybe. sometimes restraint is the better part of valor, and you pick and choose when to fight your battles. howard beale has been toeing the line for a long, long time. and it got to a point where it became intolerable, and he had a breaking point and then realized, i just don't care anymore. and he decides, to hell with it, i'm going to say exactly what i feel when i feel it. when i think it, i'll say it with no filter. and it has a resonance to donald trump's reign in some ways. and in other ways, howard beale had a lot more content.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "would you like to play donald trump?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i mean, as of right now, no. he's too much in the public eye. every single talk show host does an impersonation of him. he is ubiquitous to the point of overkill, and that's not good for an actor to take on a character that's so indelible. i was once offered to do the scarecrow, a play version of the wizard of oz. and i thought, oh my gosh, that'll be exciting. how fun will that be? until i thought about it and realized, wait a second, that character is so specific and indelible in the minds of everyone who's ever watched wizard of oz. if i didn't do an impersonation of ray bolger doing the scarecrow, i'd be booed because people would go, oh, that's not the scarecrow. so it didn't leave any room for the actor to carve out my impression or my sensibility of where the scarecrow could be. you had to stand in line and march exactly to the drumbeat of what that movie role did. so then i realized, oh, no, that's a trap. i don't want to do that role. and i think the same thing is right now for trump until 10 years from now. if you ask me that five to 10 years from now, hopefully when he's no longer in the public eye —", "augmented": []}

{"original": "from the mid-nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth, a succession of english-speaking intellectuals converted to catholicism. since the reformation almost no english-language writers of any influence had tried to advance the cause of the catholic church. when the church began to reassert itself in the nineteenth century, it used converts as its principal advocates. outspoken, intellectually gifted, and impressed by their own example, catholic converts said that they would show up the fallacies of protestants and religious skeptics, end the long schism in christendom, and place catholics once more at the center of western intellectual life.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "some of the names of these convert intellectuals are widely familiar, and among them john henry newman, g. k. chesterton, isaac hecker, orestes brownson, graham greene, evelyn waugh, thomas merton, and dorothy day have all been the subject of more than one major biography. around newman, day, and merton, indeed, academic subfields have formed, and the existence of the chesterton review suggests that the memory of this prolific londoner is also well tended. but no one has yet written a study of the general impact of converts on catholic intellectual life in this era or the distinctive style of catholicism they helped to create. nor has anyone investigated the extensive transatlantic contacts among these english-speaking catholic writers. such is the purpose of this book.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "many of their contemporaries regarded the idea of a catholic intellectual as a contradiction in terms, believing that the repressive roman church prohibited freedom of thought. the converts were eager to prove otherwise; their work in history, science, literature, and philosophy was designed to substantiate their belief that catholicism was intellectually liberating rather than restrictive, despite the church's dogmatic style and hierarchical structure. they wrote partly for a catholic audience, to be sure, but more for their protestant and skeptical contemporaries, hoping to vindicate their own conversions by persuading others to follow them. to win more converts they knew that they would have to improve intellectual standards within catholicism. history written in the form of pious hagiography and retrospective justification of every catholic position, for example, would never convince protestants and skeptics; it was annoying rather than persuasive to all but the most devout believer. catholic history would henceforth have to be deeply researched, impartial in evaluating evidence, stylistically elegant, and vigorously argued. the same would have to be true in all other disciplines too. in urging such changes and in trying to set an example in their own work, however, convert intellectuals did not mean to abandon apologetics. rather, they introduced a more circumspect apologetics, calculated to attract other intellectuals by appealing to them in their own idiom.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sharing a common language and literary heritage, the british and american catholic converts followed each other's progress closely. in both countries catholics were a numerical minority, more or less resented by the protestant majority and sometimes victimized by anti-catholic uprisings, anti-catholic political organizations such as the know-nothings, and a general cultural antipathy to all aspects of popery. because catholicism was a minority religion in the english-speaking nations, its adherents tended to cleave to one another and to respect their clergy. anticlericalism, a fact of life in italy, france, and mexico, was very rare in britain and america, although english-speaking catholics had good reason to think that the catholic hierarchy in rome did not understand the situation in their nations. they sometimes found it vexing to act upon vatican directives that had no relevance to their situation. convert intellectuals responded to their shared problems by encouraging and aiding one another. a regular traffic developed as they crossed and recrossed the atlantic to confer, teach, and spread the word in each other's nations.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as they tried to make a place for themselves in the catholic church and a case for this church in the wider intellectual world, the first generation of converts found little catholic literature in english on which to build. they had to start almost from scratch in trying to show what catholic science or catholic history as serious intellectual enterprises would be like. we catholics have no philosophy, wrote john acton, an english cradle catholic, in a letter of 1854 to the american convert writer orestes brownson. you alone can prepare us for the great controversies by founding among us a school and arming it with the principles of a sound philosophy. for brownson and his fellow converts catholicism was something quite new, but at the same time they were aware that it was far more ancient than its christian rivals and that they had inherited a vast intellectual patrimony. they set to work, exploring and reinterpreting the catholic past, trying to recover it from the obloquy of protestant historiography as well as from the syrup of catholic hagiography.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this paradoxical antiquity and novelty of catholicism was complemented by another paradox: the converts' sense that catholicism was both different from their former faiths and yet also very similar. they accepted their new faith as adults, having spent their youth and years of education outside the catholic fold. in many cases a long intellectual preparation for conversion took place within other churches. the best-known british convert, john henry newman, for example, converted from anglicanism at the age of forty-four after more than two decades of study and writing in patristics. for many years he believed that the church fathers were the precursors of anglicanism, but at last in 1845, he admitted to himself that if they pointed in any direction, it was to rome. conversion changed his explicit allegiance and had immense consequences for the course of his life, but it did not overturn his pattern of thinking. the continuities in his thought before and after conversion are in many ways more striking than the discontinuities. the same was true a generation later of g. k. chesterton, who converted at the age of forty-six. his book orthodoxy (1908), written while he was still an anglican, became a favorite among his catholic admirers, who in this way acknowledged the continuity. intellectually, then, conversion was often incremental, but institutionally (as well as perceptually, to outside observers), the jump was immense, from the establishment into the wilderness.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the catholic church saw itself as embattled against the rest of the world and tried to recruit its converts as polemicists, but they, more often than not, retained heavy intellectual debts to their protestant past and could not repudiate their personal and intellectual heritage. paradoxically, then, catholicism was both totally different from its rivals and yet, at the same time, remarkably continuous with them. it was a paradox that frequently caused friction between the new and old catholics.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the outcome of the convert intellectuals' labors was not what they themselves had hoped. although for three or four generations they were highly influential within the catholic church, playing a crucial role in transforming english-language catholicism, they were powerless to halt or reverse the dominant intellectual trends of their era. the church was certainly unable to resume the central place in western intellectual life which it had enjoyed prior to the reformation. while the new catholics challenged non-catholic scholars on the vital issues of the era, the non-catholics rarely deigned even to notice them in return and made little effort to incorporate their insights into their work. for example, william george ward, a friend of newman's and a fiery controversialist, converted in 1845 and later became editor of the dublin review, one of the leading british catholic journals. his biographer (and son) describes at length ward's fifteen-year correspondence with john stuart mill, giving the impression that ward had a large effect on the utilitarian philosopher's outlook. but no biographer of mill has found evidence of this supposed influence, and it is likely that the wards indulged in wishful thinking when they came to assess the importance of the correspondence to mill's own life and work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the flow of conversions in britain and america between the mid-1840s and the late 1950s was sufficient to indicate the continuing allure of catholicism, but it was hardly large enough to throw non-catholic intellectuals into a panic. although newman was widely admired and stimulated other members of the oxford movement to follow his example, he was unable to lead his own brother into the catholic fold, and most of his erstwhile followers, including the other movement leaders, nathan pusey and john keble, remained staunch anglicans. as in britain, so in the united states. orestes brownson, a member of the transcendentalist circle, carried his family and a few friends into the embrace of rome in 1844 but not his twin or his other siblings. most of his new england cronies, accustomed to brownson's frequent changes of opinion, treated him as a mercurial spirit who had finally stepped off the edge of the world rather than as a role model. among them, only isaac hecker and the group who later founded the paulist fathers went with brownson to rome.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "at times events in other churches could prompt a new spate of conversions. in the early 1890s, for example, a group of high church anglicans led by lord halifax raised the question of corporate reunion, the collective readmission of the church of england into the catholic church. hopes ran high among anglo-catholics for a time, but in 1896 pope leo xiii made a categorical declaration in the papal bull apostolicae curae that anglican orders were invalid and that, in effect, there was nothing to discuss. in reaction a cluster of anglican clergymen who had seen themselves as members of the worldwide catholic communion and had been hoping for a different answer, resigned from their livings and converted to catholicism. a push came for american episcopal priests in 1908 when their church decided to inaugurate an open pulpits policy, permitting all varieties of protestant ministers to preach in episcopal churches. american episcopalians who saw themselves as anglo-catholics revolted at the prospect, and here too the result was a large handful of conversions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there were, however, plenty of good reasons for not converting. quite apart from the religious wrench of conversion, becoming a catholic in britain or the united states often prompted accusations of disloyalty to the nation, its protestant heritage, even its sense of common decency. when thomas arnold (matthew arnold's brother) converted, his wife wrote a furious letter to newman, accusing him of persuading her husband to ignore every social duty and become a pervert. she added, from the bottom of my heart i curse you for it. in 1848 the poet christina rossetti refused an offer of marriage from a young artist, james collinson, because he had converted. she accepted him when he reverted to anglicanism but canceled their wedding plans when he went over to rome for a second time. collinson's parents disowned him, and he was reduced to begging from his friends in the pre-raphaelite brotherhood.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "conversion usually entailed a jolting loss of social status. george tyrrell, a young anglican from a poor but genteel irish family, was intellectually convinced by catholic arguments, but his biographer notes, he recoiled from `the dirt and tinsel, and flashy gew gaws' in the catholic chapels, from the `essential commonness' of romanism, and when he overcame his distaste and announced his conversion to his parents, what pained his mother was `that a son of mine should go to mass with the cook.' moreover, as david newsome writes, the convert became, as it were, an exile in his own land.... in addition to the humiliation of social ostracism, the pain of severed friendships and the torment of past memories, there was the inescapable problem of beginning life again within an alien community, while recognizing that all one's past distinctions and achievements counted for nothing. it is difficult to find any example of an intellectual who derived either social or monetary gain from conversion. for many, on the contrary, the material and prestige losses were considerable. the many anglican and episcopalian priests who converted were especially hard hit. being, in many cases, married, they were ineligible to join the catholic priesthood and so faced an economically precarious future. one such married clergyman, t. w. allies, reported extreme depression of spirits due to the utter destitution of my temporal fortunes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he longed to produce some work for the glory of god but was condemned to the most anxious thoughts as to what i shall eat and what i shall drink, wherewithal i shall be clothed, i and mine, and to the drudgery of teaching dunces. such cases strongly suggest that the motive for conversion was genuine religious conviction. there are few plausible ulterior motives to explain it, though it may be true that certain character types were more receptive to the demands of catholic life than others.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the converts' position was doubly difficult because the catholic church received them with mixed feelings, an uneasy blend of gratitude and disdain. catholic bishops were understandably glad that brilliant and influential men and women had decided that rome represented the one true church, and delighted to learn that they were willing to put their skills at the service of catholicism. but the bishops soon discovered that converts, intellectually adventurous and unused to clerical censorship, were likely to take speculative excursions that challenged orthodoxy rather than fortifying it. one part of the history of these converts is, accordingly, the story of conflicts with their bishops over what was or was not intellectually permissible. newman, whose superiors often viewed him with suspicion for his ideas on the development of doctrine, the role of the laity, and the nature of religious certainty, once told lord acton that in the hierarchy's view all converts are dangerous. his fellow oxford convert richard simpson, coeditor of the rambler, the leading liberal catholic journal of the mid-nineteenth century, had a long succession of conflicts with the hierarchy, which threatened to close the journal down as a hazard to the religion of the faithful. isaac hecker, the american transcendentalist and brook farm communard who converted in 1844, also ran into official disapproval when his book aspirations of nature (1857) appeared to maintain that by nature human beings were good, minimizing the power of original sin, and hence the need for grace, well beyond what his superiors found admissible.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "on the other hand, another group of converts, the ultramontanes, became such fervent romanizers that they dismayed the pragmatic old catholics of england. henry manning and william george ward, for example, two oxford converts, were among the leaders of the movement to declare the pope infallible on questions of faith and morals at the first vatican council (1869-1870) and some of the most passionate defenders of the pope's temporal power, which was threatened by the unification of italy. these converts' views dismayed english old catholics who, over three centuries or more, had gradually adapted their faith to indigenous conditions. the converts were, then, anything but unanimous among themselves but tended toward radical or extreme positions in one direction or another, arousing resentment from their new coreligionists in either instance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries showed unmistakably that the catholic church had decided to climb out of the river of contemporary intellectual life rather than swim along in midstream, despite the hopes of newman, brownson, hecker, and many other converts. the papal hammer fell frequently on efforts to modernize catholic thinking, an enterprise in which converts were often closely involved. for example, pope pius ix (1846-1878) issued the syllabus of errors in 1864, condemning many of the principles upon which contemporary scientists, social scientists, and biblical critics outside the catholic church were then working. it concluded by condemning the proposition that the roman pontiff can and ought to reconcile himself to, and come to terms with, progress, liberalism, and modern civilization. the condemnation brought the work of several convert intellectuals under scrutiny, and it discouraged them from showing the consonance of their work with contemporary philosophy and science. among the converts affected was the english evolutionary biologist st. george mivart, who was ultimately excommunicated for his assertion that the catholic doctrine of hell was untenable. the seemingly antiintellectual animus of the syllabus also disillusioned some converts, among them thomas arnold, who reverted to anglicanism when he learned of it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "six years later pius ix organized the declaration of papal infallibility at the first vatican council (1870), declining to countenance historical evidence (provided by newman, among others) which showed that papal supremacy itself, let alone papal infallibility, was based on several centuries of development out of an early church that had been constituted quite differently. papal infallibility, whatever its other consequences, represented a disastrous reversal for catholic historians, who had dedicated themselves to close analysis of the early church. the pontificate of leo xiii (1878-1903) promised them some relief, but his encyclical letter aeterni patris (1879) aimed to revive scholasticism, keeping new philosophical and historical approaches at arm's length. its successor, providentissimus deus (1893), set sharp limits on catholic participation in historical-critical study of the bible.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a third abrupt check for adventurous catholic intellectuals came in 1907 when pope pius x's decree lamentabili (1907) and the encyclical pascendi (1907) sweepingly condemned modernism in theology; in response, one english convert, george tyrrell, s.j., courted excommunication. in the following years seminaries and catholic colleges in britain and america were purged of all traces of modernism. outsiders regarded these episodes as further evidence that catholic intellectuals were hamstrung by intrusive, censorious, and often ignorant authorities. this was the age in which andrew dickson white, first president of cornell university, wrote his influential history of the warfare of science with theology in christendom (1896), casting the scientists as truth-loving heroes through the ages and the catholic church as an antiintellectual villain trying to squeeze the life out of them. white made enormous capital out of the famous galileo case and treated it as typical of catholicism at all times. converts who remained committed to contemporary intellectual principles found themselves walking a tightrope between the guardians of orthodoxy on their right and their former friends and colleagues to their left.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it should not be supposed that intellectual converts to catholicism were reliably more liberal in their outlook than born catholics. the convert who is more punctilious in his new faith than the lifelong communicant is a familiar figure in catholic lore, and the nineteenth and twentieth centuries provided plentiful examples of such characters. the most notable was henry manning, the anglican archdeacon of chichester, who converted in 1851 and rose in the next fifteen years to leadership of england's catholic community, becoming archbishop of westminster in 1865 (cardinal from 1875). manning supported papal infallibility, as did newman's former oxford colleagues william george ward and frederick faber, and the american convert augustine hewit. subsequent catholic historians, most of them opposed to the ultramontane position, have given manning in particular a bad press and found newman's antiinfallibilist views much more palatable. but we should remember that to manning ultramontanism seemed to be the most liberating position. like many of the converts, he hated the subordination of the church of england to the civil state; indeed, he left it in protest over the gorham case of 1851, in which the state overruled an anglican bishop and installed as parish priest a man he considered a heretic. setting up the papacy as a powerful counterweight to the state seemed to ultramontanists the surest way of assuring themselves of religious and intellectual freedom.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "ultramontanists placed their faith in thomism. in an effort to assure intellectual coherence between disciplines and a foundation for all studies in theology, the popes who reigned in the second half of the nineteenth century placed a renewed emphasis on the work of thomas aquinas and his scholastic successors. scholasticism and natural law theory have many strengths, among them an orderly rationalism and a conceptual framework into which every discrete item of information can be fitted, showing its connection to the whole and to the divine will from which it springs. but scholastic philosophy and natural law encountered a succession of powerful challengers in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, including pragmatism, vitalism, existentialism, and logical positivism, each of which debunked scholasticism's claims to intellectual respectability. similarly, in the physical sciences and in the study of history, the developing academic orthodoxy in britain and america, strongly empirical and increasingly based on evolutionary, probabilist, and materialist assumptions, was at variance with the scholastic framework, which, while granting science some autonomy, linked worldly phenomena to their supernatural origins. the scholastic criticism of materialism and positivism was not so much refuted as blithely ignored by most of the scientists. protestant conservatives were also polemicizing against the new secular sciences, but for religious and traditional reasons, catholic and protestant objectors to secular scholarship were unable to make common cause.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "meanwhile, the development of a catholic ghetto, especially in the united states, with its own set of self-segregating schools, colleges, and journals, made ignoring the catholics easier than if they had been forcing their attention upon their antagonists from adjoining offices. non-catholics rarely investigated the work of intellectuals in the catholic church unless they were searching for polemical ammunition.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "after vatican i, and especially after pascendi, english and american convert intellectuals tended to stay away from strictly theological questions altogether and work in the safer realms of literature, history, and the social sciences. like their nineteenth-century predecessors, however, they too aimed to draw more converts into the faith that had won them. a succession of british converts, including hugh benson, ronald knox, g. k. chesterton, and others, tried to dazzle their readers with wit, erudition, and ostentatious orthodoxy. even so the experience of their earlier lives made their view of the outside world different from that of born catholics and enabled them to make distinctions that sometimes escaped their born-catholic fellows. these converts usually had relatives still outside the church; their own education outside catholicism had formed their minds; and they found it difficult to demonize a non-catholic society with which they were still intimately connected. their chief line of attack was to criticize the premises of non-catholic philosophy and science, to demonstrate its epistemological vulnerability, and to expose its links to a callow idealization of progress, sometimes with wry admissions that they too had once been deceived by its charms. they also brought their catholic insight to bear on the political changes of their era, arguing that without the guidance of faith the world was out of control. the first world war gave their critique of progress a new plausibility.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the train of conversions continued during and after the war. men and women disabused of their faith in progress as a force immanent in history found consolation in catholicism. in the interwar years a distinguished group of british novelists converted to catholicism, including compton mackenzie, graham greene, and evelyn waugh, and began to make lasting contributions to the canon of english literature. in the 1850s newman had lamented that the great classics of english literature were protestant to the core and that english was in effect a protestant language. now for the first time since the reformation, english literature enjoyed a significant catholic leavening. convert writers took turns touring the united states, teaching at georgetown, fordham, and notre dame and trying to encourage a catholic literary revival across the sea. they were joined by another group of gifted and prolific controversialists, including shane leslie, arnold lunn, and christopher hollis, who took up the mantle of chesterton and tried to carry on his message that catholicism was synonymous with urbanity, erudition, and wit. aptly enough, the first holder of the stillman chair in catholic studies at harvard divinity school was the english convert christopher dawson.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a new generation of converts in the united states joined the catholic church in the interwar years. the best known, dorothy day and thomas merton, each gradually won a wide and sympathetic audience in the non-catholic world, eventually becoming spiritual celebrities. less celebrated but equally important, a succession of converts from the ranks of academia--among them the historians carlton hayes, ross hoffman, and elizabeth kite, and the sociologist eva ross--brought a measure of intellectual respectability to catholic education. this generation of converts was made up of white anglo-saxon protestants. they had enjoyed an education in the leading american graduate schools--hayes at columbia and hoffman at the university of pennsylvania, for example--and they felt none of the immigrant insecurities and defensive belligerence still common among their ethnically assimilating catholic contemporaries. they were as much a part of the american establishment as the convert sons of english anglican bishops were part of the british establishment. they brought to catholic academic life a new sense of ease and possession. demonstrating a high level of technical skill in their disciplines, they began to win more sympathetic attention from non-catholic academics. they also ran graduate programs, training young cradle catholics to high standards, with the eventual effect of reducing the prominence of converts. many non-catholics found their critique of science and their philosophical antitotalitarianism germane to the total war of the 1940s and the cold war of the 1950s.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "in the first flush of success, catholic intellectuals who had been pressing for reforms--an end to censorship and the exclusive reliance on sholasticism--celebrated victory over the bad old days. enough time has now passed since the second vatican council that we can evaluate the rights and wrongs of this history in a new way, temper the exuberance of the modernizers, and pay at least a guarded tribute to the convert intellectuals and their work. in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the promethean self-confidence of the new sciences had seemed likely to sweep everything before it. darwinism and the principle of evolutionary development had been applied widely to other phenomena and appeared irresistibly compelling to several generations of scientists, historians, philosophers, and social scientists. evolutionists had scornfully dismissed the fixed principles and the unchanging universe of scholasticism and regarded it as easy to refute, if they bothered to look at it at all. marxism, another developmental theory, which enjoyed its greatest vogue in the english-speaking countries between about 1890 and 1950, was no less scornful of catholic thought, treating it either as an opiate for the oppressed or as the instrument of domination which a master class wielded against its subordinates. by now, however, these rival orthodoxies have, in their turn, worn thin. evolution is still a central theory in biology but hardly in economics, anthropology, political science, or psychology, where it once ruled imperiously. from evolution sprang eugenics, the science of population manipulation, whose horrific face hitler displayed to the world.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in the same way marxism, for complex political and intellectual reasons, lost its allure; its predictions were falsified, its scientific pretensions exposed as a sham, and it too became closely linked with a brutal tyrant, stalin, whose career in scientific politics was almost enough to give political science itself a bad name. the failure of the alternatives does not, in itself, demonstrate the correctness of the catholic faith, to be sure, but it lends credence to the catholic opposition to marxism and eugenics. it seems now that dogmatic catholics enjoyed an insulation against some of the utopian currents that swept the western nations in the first half of this century. it would be rash today to say that catholicism was wrong when its adversaries were right. our age, more jaded and skeptical in the face of successive disappointments, can pay it at least backhanded compliments, acknowledge its strengths as well as its weaknesses, and recognize that it provided the standpoint from which to make a telling critique of its secular rivals.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a project of this kind, covering more than a century and two nations (with frequent glances at ireland, germany, france, spain, canada, and italy), is obliged to move rapidly or become impossibly long. my approach is to single out the most influential figures from each generation and explain their work, rather than attempt to give a comprehensive account of all convert writers, though at times i have tried to rescue from obscurity characters who seem to me to deserve more fame than history has granted them, including richard simpson (chapter 4), elizabeth kite (chapter 7), and bertram windle (chapter 8). influence is, of course, an elusive phenomenon, not really amenable to accurate measurement. such figures as newman, brownson, hecker, dawson, and chesterton get comparatively thorough treatment not because they are typical of anything but because of their exceptional qualities; few of their fellow converts could rival them for insight or write so much and so well. in general i aim to demonstrate qualitative rather than quantitative changes throughout, arguing that the converts, who were never more than 2 or 3 percent of the catholic population in either nation, were disproportionately represented in the ranks of catholic writers, lecturers, editors, and professors, that their ideas often set the agenda for other catholic intellectuals working within the tradition, and that non-catholics looked to the more persuasive convert writers when they wanted to find the catholic position on a controversial issue.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "another elusive yet important issue for a project of this kind is the question of the relationship between truth and intellectual respectability. the convert intellectuals were aware, in many cases, that what they believed to be true was not regarded by non-catholics as plausible or reasonable or, indeed, respectable. on some points both groups could agree, of course, and the convert writers' intention was to make a closer fit between catholic truth and intellectual respectability. at any given moment in the era from about 1825 to 1962, catholic intellectuals knew that a range of ideas was considered respectable in the two nations. they also knew that some catholic ideas sat comfortably inside this area and others remained well beyond its boundaries. their job, as they saw it, was to drag the recalcitrant catholics into the realm of the respectable, while trying to shift the zone of respectable ideas in the society at large, in order that catholic truth and respectable ideas might coincide more fully. they wanted to convince protestant and atheist contemporaries that much of their work was in error or based on fallacious premises, encouraging them to become more catholic and more intellectually respectable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but the general trend bore the range of intellectually respectable ideas steadily away from religion in general and catholicism in particular. this trend, often labeled secularization, appeared for decades to be unstoppable, so that many convert intellectuals, far from reversing its momentum, found their own views gradually moving outside the realm of what other intellectuals considered plausible. the consequence was marginalization, and convert intellectuals in general lost influence with the passing decades, so that none in the twentieth century could have an effect on his or her non-catholic contemporaries to match that of newman and brownson in the mid-nineteenth. certain writers, such as chesterton or christopher dawson, could still find admirers, but neither created a major school of thought, and non-catholic admirers saw their religion as a colorful aberration rather than a central element in their work. in that sense this book is the history of a momentous and protracted failure.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "in defending dreyfus, proust not only angered conservative, catholic, pro-army aristocrats, but he also alienated his own father. in writing about the 1890s in remembrance of things past, proust remarks that the dreyfus case was shortly to relegate the jews to the lowest rung of the social ladder. typically, the ultraconservative gustave schlumberger, a great byzantine scholar, could give in his posthumous memoirs as offensive a description of his old friend charles haas (a model for proust's character swann) as this: the delightful charles haas, the most likeable and glittering socialite, the best of friends, had nothing jewish about him except his origins and was not afflicted, as far as i know, with any of the faults of his race, which makes him an exception virtually unique. it would be misleading to suggest that proust took his controversial, pro-dreyfus stand simply because he was half-jewish. no, he was only obeying the dictates of his conscience, even though he lost many highborn catholic friends by doing so and exposed himself to the snide anti-semitic accusation of merely automatically siding with his co-religionists.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "i was introduced to athill through her memoir somewhere towards the end. published when she was 91, it was a meditation on the mixed bag that is aging. while athill was quick to point out the injustices of growing older, chief among them giving up sex (athill loved sex in her very british way, decreeing that every woman should have a few good love affairs), her tone was almost defiantly peppy — never saccharine, but refusing to give in to the weighty fear with which we tend to face the great unknown. i had my first existential crisis (that's putting it generously) at age 13, and sat with the pain for years afterward. my primary literary bedfellows in the ensuing years were death obsessives like philip roth and robert lowell, or poets who were far too successful in its pursuit (sylvia plath, who was less enthusiastic about her life in the london literary scene than athill, her counterpart who was born more than a decade before her and survived her by more than 50 years). i figured if i couldn't solve the mystery around mortality then i could at least wallow with some of the greats. i was on year 15 of this strategy when i found myself in possession of athill's slim book in consideration of the topic.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "this book is a call to action for all who refuse to accept our demographic demise as inevitable. it is a demand for a new jewish state of mind capable of challenging the conventional wisdom that judaism is more adaptive to persecution and discrimination than it is to an open, free, and welcoming society--that jews paradoxically need enemies in order to survive, that anti-semitism is what has kept judaism alive. this age-old perspective on jewish survival is illustrated by two tragic stories involving respected rabbinical leaders.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the first story takes place in 1812, when napoleon was battling the czar for control of the pale of settlement (the western part of czarist russia), where millions of jews were forced to live in crowded poverty and under persecution and discrimination as second-class subjects. a victory for napoleon held the promise of prosperity, first-class citizenship, freedom of movement, and an end to discrimination and persecution. a victory for the czar would keep the jews impoverished and miserable. the great hasidic rabbi shneur zalman--the founder of the lubavitch dynasty--stood up in his synagogue on the first day of rosh hashanah to offer a prayer to god asking help for the leader whose victory would be good for the jews. everyone expected him to pray for napoleon. but he prayed for the czar to defeat napoleon. in explaining his counterintuitive choice, he said: should bonaparte win, the wealth of the jews will be increased and their [civic] position will be raised. at the same time their hearts will be estranged from our heavenly father. should however our czar alexander win, the jewish hearts will draw nearer to our heavenly father, though the poverty of israel may become greater and his position lower.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this remarkable story is all too typical of how so many jewish leaders throughout our history have reasoned about jewish survival. without tsuris--troubles--we will cease to be jewish. we need to be persecuted, impoverished, discriminated against, hated, and victimized in order for us to retain our jewishness. the chosen people must be denied choices if judaism is to survive. if jews are given freedom, opportunity, and choice, they will choose to assimilate and disappear.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the story recurs, with even more tragic consequences, on the eve of the holocaust. another great eastern european rabbi, elchanan wasserman--the dean of the rabbinical college in baranowitz, poland--was invited to bring his entire student body and faculty to yeshiva college in new york or to the beis medrish letorah in chicago, both distinguished orthodox rabbinical colleges. he declined the invitations because they are both places of spiritual danger, for they are run in a spirit of freethinking. the great rabbi reasoned, what would one gain to escape physical danger in order to then confront spiritual danger? rabbi wasserman, his family, his students, and their teachers remained in poland, where they were murdered by the nazis.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i call the approach taken by these rabbis the tsuris theory of jewish survival. under this theory, the jews need external troubles to stay jewish. nor has this fearful, negative perspective on jewish survival been limited to ultra-orthodox rabbis. many jewish leaders, both religious and secular, have argued that jews need enemies--that without anti-semitism, judaism cannot survive. theodor herzl, the founder of political zionism and a secular jew, believed that our enemies have made us one ... it is only pressure that forces us back to the parent stem. in a prediction that reflects an approach to the survival of judaism strikingly similar to that of the founder of the lubavitch hasidim, herzl warned that if our christian hosts were to leave us in peace ... for two generations, the jewish people would merge entirely into surrounding races. albert einstein agreed: it may be thanks to anti-semitism that we are able to preserve our existence as a race; that at any rate is my belief. jean-paul sartre, a non-jew, went even further, arguing that the sole tie that binds [the jewish people together] is the hostility and disdain of the societies which surround them. he believed that it is the anti-semite who makes the jew.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if the tsuris theory of jewish identity, survival, and unity is true, then jews are doomed to live precariously on a pendulum perennially swinging in a wide arc between the extremes of persecution and assimilation. as the pendulum swings away from the scylla of persecution, it inevitably moves toward the charybdis of assimilation. in this reactive view, jews have little power over their ultimate destiny. our enemies always call the shots, either by persecuting us, in which case we fight back and remain jewish, or by leaving us alone, in which case we assimilate. the only other alternative--the one proposed by herzl--is for all jews to move to israel, where they control their own destiny. but most jews will continue to ignore that option, certainly if our hosts continue to leave us in peace in our adopted homelands. in this respect, aliyah (emigration) to israel has also been largely determined by our external enemies, since most jews who have moved to the jewish homeland have done so in reaction to anti-semitism and persecution in their native countries.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "historically, therefore, there has been some descriptive truth to this pendulum view of persecution alternating with assimilation. jews have retained their jewish identity, at least in part, because of tsuris. our enemies herded us into ghettos, created pales of settlement, discriminated against us, excluded us from certain livelihoods while pressing us into others. we stuck together and remained jews, resisting as best we could the persecution by our enemies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but there is more--much more--to jewish identity than collective self-defense. there is something important that is worth defending. after all, until anti-semitism changed from religious bigotry to racial bigotry--roughly near the end of the nineteenth century--persecuted jews generally had the option of conversion. unlike hitler, our religiously inspired persecutors--the crusaders, the inquisitors, martin luther, and the pogromists--did distinguish between jews who converted to christianity and jews who did not. indeed, it was precisely their religious mission to convert the jews, by whatever methods it took.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "many jews did convert--some at knifepoint, others to advance themselves. the story about professor daniel chwolson illustrates the latter phenomenon. chwolson, a russian intellectual of the nineteenth century, had converted from judaism to russian orthodoxy as a young man, but he continued to fight against anti-semitism. this led a jewish friend to ask him why he had converted: out of conviction, the great man said. what conviction? his jewish friend inquired. chwolson responded: out of a firm conviction that it would be far better to be a professor in st. petersburg than a hebrew school teacher in shklop. yet despite the material advantages of conversion, most jews resisted it. clearly, those jews--who sacrificed so much--remained jewish not only in reaction to their enemies. more than our fabled stiff-neckedness was involved. there are substantive principles that jews have been so stubborn about--that we have been willing to fight and even die for. for jews who define their jewishness in theological terms, it is easy to find that principle: it is god's will. for the large number of jews who are skeptical about being god's chosen people, the principle is more elusive, but it is palpable to most of us, though difficult to articulate. it is a disturbing reality, however, that for a great many jews, their jewish identity has been forged and nurtured by our external enemies who have defined us as victims of their persecution.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, after two millennia of persecution and victimization, we may well be moving into a new era of jewish life during which we will not be persecuted or victimized. if this comes to pass, we will need to refocus our attention on defining the positive qualities of jewish life that ought to make us want to remain jews without help from our enemies. we must become positively jewish instead of merely reacting to our enemies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if herzl's and sartre's entirely negative view of the reason for jewish survival were to persist even as we enter this new era of equality and acceptance, then judaism would not deserve to endure. if jewish life cannot thrive in an open environment of opportunity, choice, freethinking, affluence, success, and first-class status--if we really do need tsuris, czars, pogroms, poverty, insularity, closed minds, and anti-semitism to keep us jewish--then jewish life as we know it will not, and should not, survive the first half of the twenty-first century. we have been persecuted long enough. the time has come to welcome the end of our victimization without fear that it will mean the end of our existence as a people. we must no longer pray for the czar's victory out of fear that the end of our collective tsuris and the success of individual jews will mean the failure of judaism.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i believe that jewish life can thrive in the next century, not despite the end of institutional anti-semitism, the end of jewish persecution, and the end of jewish victimization, but because of these positive developments. the ultimate good news may be that the denouement of negative judaism--jewish identification based largely on circling the wagons to fend off our enemies--compels us to refocus on a more positive and enduring jewish identification, which will be more suitable to our current situation and the one we will likely be facing in the twenty-first century, when jews will have the unconstrained choice whether to remain jewish or to assimilate. we may be entering a true jewish golden age, during which we will prove, once and for all, that jews do not need enemies to survive. to the contrary: we can thrive best in an open society where we freely choose to be jews because of the positive virtues of our 3,500-year-old civilization.", "augmented": []}

(kaddish is the prayer for the dead.) but reports of the death of judaism may be premature--if we can change the way we think, and act, about jewish survival. if we refuse to change, if we accept the current demographic trends as intractable, then jewish life in america may indeed be doomed.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "in the final chapter, i propose a series of steps that i believe we must take in order to safeguard the jewish future. we must change the nature of american jewish life in fundamental ways if we are to survive the new threats to our continuity as a people. these changes must make us more adaptive to the reality that we can no longer define ourselves--and our children--by reference to our past victimization and persecution. we must adopt a new, more positive, jewish identity based on a 3,500-year-old tradition of education, scholarship, learning, creativity, justice, and compassion. but first we must figure out a way to make this diverse library of jewish knowledge accessible and useful to generations of jews who are abysmally ignorant of their remarkable tradition. the famed yiddisher cup (khop)---jewish head--is only half full: the typical jewish college graduate is extraordinarily well educated about general subjects, but goes through life with a kindergarten understanding of judaism. we must begin to fill the yiddisher cup with the kind of useful jewish knowledge that will assure both our success and our survival. to do this, we will have to loosen the monopolistic hold that rabbis now have over jewish education, so that we can begin to compete effectively in the marketplace of ideas for the minds and hearts of our jewish youth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "unless we begin to make use of our competitive advantage--as teachers, communicators, scholars, advocates, and strategists--we will lose our children and grandchildren to the seductive drift toward assimilation and away from jewishness. the fundamental changes we must make will require a reordering of our priorities away from an almost exclusive focus on defending jews against external enemies and toward new ways of defending ourselves and our children against self-destruction through assimilation. we will have to educate our children differently, allocate our charitable giving differently, select our leaders differently--even define our very jewishness differently. jewish life will have to become less tribal, more open, more accepting of outsiders, and less defensive.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "well, what you're describing is similar, in some ways, to what protesters and activists and reformers are asking for — a social worker at a scene instead of a police officer, a therapist at a scene instead of a police officer. i hear you saying that that is at odds with defunding and dismantling police. but help me understand why. if a social worker takes the place of a police officer, if a group of therapists is on call instead of a traditional police officer, then why do you need more money for policing? don't you need less money for policing?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "i think, to many ears, there's going to be some skepticism to the idea there's not a lot of money spent on policing. and the question becomes, how is that money spent on policing? for example, let's go back to the therapist or the social worker who might go out and deal with a police call. are you suggesting that a police officer needs to be with that social worker. does there need to be two people at that scene? what if there's one? and if there's one, do we need that police officer? i guess one of the interesting questions of this moment is, are you all called too much? is the system built too heavily around the idea that you dial those three digits, 911, and a police officer with a gun shows up? is that not what we need? what do you think?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's a good question, because thinking back, there are scenarios where, yeah, we weren't needed. and maybe we shouldn't have gotten the call. but unfortunately —", "augmented": []}

{"original": "i mean, again, i don't believe that would be a systematic, across-the-board defunding. i think if we start doing that — let's say that using your argument, that that works out. everybody starts to now call — they see a homeless person talking to themselves, instead of calling law enforcement, they call the therapist number. that person goes out. everything goes real good. they get that person some place to live, or figure out how to get them safe. and those calls for service go down, and that leaves law enforcement to handle the real, i guess, emergencies?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yeah, i think if you put that in practice, and then you start doing a cost analysis on it, it could actually lower the budgets. and i'm not even saying now that the budgets shouldn't be looked at, and seeing if there's another way to do that. because look, a lot of officers, we're social workers. we're marriage counselors. we're doctors sometimes. we're more than actually what we were trained to be. i mean, we try to train for everything that we can, but we just can't be. and then, but you then expect us to. not you; i'm just saying as a society —", "augmented": []}

{"original": "what do you mean? i know you came out right away and you said that firing officer rolfe was rushed. do you still feel that way after reading the charges, after watching the news conference from the district attorney, the videos — all the information that has come out?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yeah, and i even feel more so. we've said from day one, we the union, that looking at the videos and everything, we're not saying whether it was a good shoot or a bad shoot. we don't have enough evidence to say that. normally how this situation goes in officer-involved shootings, the g.b.i., georgia bureau of investigation, does the investigation. the officer is either put on administrative leave with or without pay, and then the results are turned to the d.a. or to the city. but the district attorney here decided to do his own investigation that he normally doesn't do. and then, after he did his press conference, we found — i guess, to be politically correct, misspoken — misspokens, if you will, or lies that he did. and we haven't even been entitled to all of the investigative material. so yeah, we still believe that it was a rushed investigation, and it was politically motivated.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i want to make sure i understand what you are referring to. when you say that there are cases where the district attorney may have misspoken, what do you mean?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in his press conference, the district attorney came out and stated that officer brosnan, the second officer on the scene, had turned state witness, and he was going to testify against officer rolfe. that ended up not being true. less than 10 minutes after that statement came out, the attorney for officer brosnan said that had never happened. he was not going to testify against the other officer. he never said he would turn state witness. he's never pled guilty to any charges. and he has cooperated with the d.a. — meaning answering questions and stuff — but he's never said that he would be state witness. so the question then becomes, if you're not telling the truth now or you're having inconsistencies, how can we believe your report? or, did you just do a shoddy investigation? if that's the case, you should have allowed what we consider the professionals — which is an unbiased outside agency from atlanta, the g.b.i. they're the state organization that does this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ok, so those issues aside — and i understand why you have raised them — i wonder what you make of the evidence that has been presented, knowing that it may not be entirely complete? to summarize what the district attorney has said in his public presentation, he said that that officer rolfe's life was never in danger, that he shot rashard brooks in the back when brooks was running away, and that after brooks was shot, officer rolfe kicked him as he lay dying. do you dispute any of that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yeah. as far as, ok, the first one that you talked about — that officer rolfe's life was never in danger — well, let's not forget, there was a fight ensued. one officer did go to the hospital with a concussion. and i guess it depends on whether you subscribe to that a taser is not a deadly weapon.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but the taser is considered a deadly weapon under georgia law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you're referring to the fact that rashard brooks grabbed the officer's taser and shot it twice.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, i watched the district attorney's news conference. and what he said was that at the time that rashard brooks was shot twice in the back by officer rolfe, he had twice shot the taser in such a way that it was essentially empty and unusable. and that this would be something that an officer like officer rolfe would know — having carried a taser, used a taser — that it contained two taser shots. so in that case, does that complicate the point that you're making here?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "no, because the taser isn't considered unusable after the two shots. the taser also has a method or a way to use it in a drive-stun situation. and what that means is you can actually walk up to a person — like the old stun guns that arc in between and you used to touch people with them — the taser still has that effect. so it's still an active weapon.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "here's the — you're walking down the road, and i understand the questioning. but here's the problem that i see, how i see it. a lot of people are going to have this argument about race and systemic racism in law enforcement. the statistics don't prove it. and you go and pull nationwide, and you pull in certain cities and states law enforcement records. and i just did this, because i had to do this in front of the city council in chattanooga, tennessee. in 2019, use of force, 59 percent were white, 39 percent were black. if you start looking nationwide, you start seeing similar percentages. so the issue is, statistically, the argument isn't there. my opinion — my opinion only — the statistics are not the issue. what the issue is, is the perception from the black community that that is what's going on. so where we in law enforcement fall short is we don't change and help change that perception.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i want to counter what you have just described in those statistics and the idea that this is a question of perception rather than conduct in patterns. i'm sure you know some of this. local and federal investigations have found what they describe as systemic racial bias in the chicago police department, in the baltimore police department, in the ferguson police department. now, in ferguson, what they found was that black drivers were more than twice as likely to be searched after being stopped as white drivers were. in new york city, where i live, data makes clear that police stopped and frisked black and latino new yorkers at significantly higher rates than they actually represent in the city. about 83 percent of the stops during about a decade-long period involved black and hispanics, even though they make up about 50 percent of the city's residents. so 83 percent of stops, 50 percent of the city's residents. and in minneapolis, just a few weeks ago, data showed that use of force against black people in that city was seven times greater than it was against white people in the city. so the idea that it's just perception, rather than a documented, data-based conclusion about conduct, does not seem accurate. because all of that data seems to point to a pattern of racial discrimination.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm not going to dispute the fact of what you're saying. one, i haven't pulled the stats. i'll take your word for the stats. you said three or four cities. i said one city. so the thing is, you can go to your state's and pull yours. i can go to my state's and pull mine. now, is there departments that actually may have it? i'm not going to argue that point. you're probably — yes, that could be absolutely right. i just think that trying to go to our respective corners, if you would, and make our arguments is not going to do it. we in law enforcement have to admit that in the black community, this is how they feel. how do we prevent them from feeling that way?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you keep saying feel, and i believe that is a deliberate word choice. but when a black american is hurt or is killed in one of these interactions, in many cases by a white police officer, do you understand why that doesn't feel like a perception? it's an experience, a reality.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yeah, sure. sure, i can understand that. and i understand what you were saying. but we can do this all day long, but that's not helping anything. what we need to do is fix why it is the way that it is, and why people feel that way. because if we try to prove and try to change that and make it better to where it's not that way, isn't it the same, whether it's a perception or reality?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "in lind's account, caldwell's story about the advance of social liberalism through bureaucratic and judicial power is just a subsidiary of the more important story, the post-1970s consolidation of economic power by a managerial upper class. the liberalism of bill clinton and barack obama isn't an ideology of white disempowerment, in his account, so much as a solvent that weakens any institution — from churches and families to union shops and local industries — that might grant real power to groups outside the gilded city, the silicon valley bubble, the ivy league gate. and together with its center-right partner in crime, reagan-thatcher libertarianism, this liberalism's policy choices — economic and social permissiveness, effectively conjoined — created a new class divide, between thriving meritocratic hubs and a declining and demoralized heartland, that explains both the frequency of populist irruptions and their consistent futility.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but even as he acknowledges the faults of populism, lind treats the class-war aspect of polarization as a potentially positive development, because he hopes that it will create a real political coalition for the losers of neoliberal era — a socially conservative, economically left-leaning constituency that's numerous but often homeless. making such a coalition constructive rather than just disruptive may be impossible, but it's the only way he sees to escape neoliberal oligarchy and bring our class war to an end with a negotiated peace.", "augmented": []}

(priests regularly hear confessions on airplanes, i'm told, finding two back seats for that purpose whenever possible.) jerome magat, a brainy, energetic 26-year-old of filipino descent, is a second-year seminarian, so he wears clerics off-campus only when attending a formal, ecclesiastical event or when visiting hospitals, homeless shelters, prisons and schools, which is part of the seminary program. it's that supernatural element, magat says of the reactions his clerics provoke. there's a mystery about the priesthood. some of that mystery inheres in the very nature of the catholic priesthood.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a priest is called to be an alter christus, to stand in the person of christ and perform the sacraments, through which grace is conferred by god. nowadays, though, the distance between the catholic priesthood and the surrounding culture has given it a near occult mystique. as america hurtles forward unblinkingly into the consumer-driven, technological and environmental unknown, the catholic priesthood remains becalmed in a zone of otherworldly preoccupations relatively unbuffeted by present-day vicissitudes. today, as, say, 500 years ago, a man -- and only a man -- who senses he has a vocation, or a call from god to the priesthood, hands over his life irrevocably to the church, promising celibacy and obedience. now, as centuries ago, he answers to the bishop of his diocese, celebrates the mass, performs the sacraments and, if he has been appointed a pastor, oversees and maintains the solvency of his parish. (a religious-order priest like a franciscan or jesuit makes an additional promise of poverty, and commits his life to his religious community and its particular mission.) in exchange for these sacrifices, a diocesan priest typically receives from his diocese a room, board, a place to retire when he is too old or sick to serve any longer and around $10,000 a year. it is perhaps not surprising that in contemporary america, with its focus on individualism and personal achievement, not to speak of wealth, the number of men seeking out this sort of existence has plummeted.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in 1998, according to the center for applied research in the apostolate at georgetown university, there were 47,582 active priests in america -- about 10,000 fewer than in 1975. the average age of a diocesan priest is now 58, and nearly a quarter of all priests are older than 70, the average age of retirement. perhaps no institution in america faces a more severe personnel crisis than the catholic church. and it is likely to get worse. the total number of graduate seminarians in america last year was the lowest on record: 2,622, a drop of almost 70 percent from the 8,159 in 1967-8. this decline comes at a time when the number of catholics in america, where they represent by far the largest religious denomination, has ballooned from 48.7 million in 1975 to 61.6 million today, largely as a result of latin american and asian immigration and population growth. the drop in vocations has been under way since the 1970's, when seminaries emptied precipitously, in part because of a disillusionment with celibacy. meanwhile, families of italian, irish and central european descent -- the old catholic ghetto that, earlier in this century, was a major source of american priests -- have shrunk in size and risen to the middle class, broadening opportunities for their sons. more recently, the pedophilia scandals of the late 80's and early 90's have been a public relations catastrophe for the church.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "diocesan priests, as liaisons between the church hierarchy and the laity, are caught in a morality gap between the two -- asked to promote unpopular views that in many cases they themselves do not share. according to a 1994 los angeles times survey, nearly half of american priests believe that birth control is seldom or never wrong; even more say the same of masturbation. as a result, few catholics hear preaching on touchy sexual issues on any given sunday. this is about to change, say the seminarians at mount saint mary's -- they have every intention of preaching on these topics, and some deacons already have done so in the parishes they were assigned to last summer. if people had the great opportunity we have to learn and to pray and to study, bashista said, maybe they would come to a consensus with what the church is teaching and think of the beauty of it rather than the thou shalt not. and that is our obligation: to preach and to teach the truth in charity and in love, and to be patient. after asking permission from his pastor, cook preached against contraception in the parish he was assigned in omaha, neb., last summer. i was nervous, he recalled. if i hadn't really prayed on it and done it in a way that i think was not overbearing. ... i said: 'what is the nature of marriage? to give of oneself.' i didn't use the word 'contraception' until the end.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "indeed. as understood by someone who thinks of british history in the most traditional way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and how does this attitude begin to manifest itself?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, fairly quickly after the wedding. there had been this rapturous coverage of the ceremony. but really within weeks, you began to see coverage and headlines in the british tabloids that started taking a slightly harder, meaner look at harry and especially at meghan. and it's worth pointing out quickly that the tabloids are, across the board, conservative publications. these are papers that really play to very traditional ideas of the meaning and the value of the monarchy. so what you begin to see are a series of articles. some are actually asking valid questions about the lifestyle of prince harry and meghan markle.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for example, during one summer, they took two flights on vacation on private jets. and this raised a reasonable question. prince harry's a major campaigner for climate change.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "archived recording you can't lecture us and the rest of the world on climate change when you're taking private planes everywhere. and this was their —", "augmented": []}

{"original": "archived recording she's a multimillionaire from her time as a hollywood actress. he's a multimillionaire from all the money he's had over the years. two multimillionaires asking the british public, the taxpayer, to contribute 2.5 million pounds to renovate an entirely different property to the one that they'd been offered, i think is a bit awful and the crucial point as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and while some of that was perhaps legitimate, you also began to see just a more petty flavor to the coverage. and it's really perhaps most visible if you look at the coverage of meghan markle side by side with that of kate middleton, who married prince harry's brother, william.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, for example, the express covered a very similar incident, which is both women talking about their love of avocados. and the two headlines tell the tale. in the first headline about kate, it says, kate's morning sickness cure. prince william gifted with an avocado for pregnant duchess. same story, same newspaper about meghan markle, and the headline is meghan markle's beloved avocado linked to human rights abuse and drought. millennial shame.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's like literally the polar opposite take on the exact same piece of fruit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's very hard to actually be that radically different about an avocado. but the british press figured out how to do it. while this is at some level humorous and not extremely serious, it did over time bleed into more sinister types of coverage of meghan markle, really around her mixed racial background. so you began to see descriptions of her in the press as, quote, exotic, or headlines that said that harry's new girl is quote straight outta compton. in other words, portraying meghan as a coming up from the mean streets of los angeles. and so there is an element of it that is deeper, and more problematic, and gets at out-and-out racism. and certainly portraying her not just as an entitled millennial, but as an altogether more threatening figure.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so you're seeing this kind of more conservative aspect of britain and their view of markle reflected in the british press.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that's right. but it isn't just the press, because there is another very conservative institution here, one that is perhaps even more important. and that's the house of windsor itself. and meghan markle, by all accounts, has a very difficult introduction to the family. there are many reports that kate middleton is not particularly welcoming to her new sister-in-law. there is a sense that she is simply not being approved of, her lifestyle. there is a family event where one of the older aunts shows up wearing a brooch that is interpreted as a racial slur against meghan. and harry begins to feel a sense of aggrievement on behalf of his wife. and that then causes a rift between harry and his brother william. one of the first tangible examples of this is when harry and meghan announced that they want to move out of kensington palace, which they share with kate and william and his family, and move into their own place. and you begin to see more and more evidence of distance between meghan and harry on the one hand, and everybody else in the family on the other hand. so all of this culminates when the couple go on a long tour of southern africa —", "augmented": []}

{"original": "bradby follows up by saying, would it be fair to say she hasn't been o.k.? and markle thinks about it for a moment and replies —", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wow, so telling the world, in what sounds a little bit like a cry for help, i am not doing o.k.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that is very much the way it's interpreted. and i think also, it's the way that meghan markle intended for it to be interpreted. she knew she was going to be asked that question. i don't think there was anything accidental about the reply, nor do i think anyone misinterpreted who she meant when she said not many people have asked if i'm o.k. by that she meant members of the royal family. but it doesn't end there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "archived recording as this journey wore on, another human story emerged — [cheering] — of a man still wrestling with the legacy of his background, of his birth, and the tragic death of his mother.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "he's openly acknowledging a rift between them. and that is a very powerful thing. because remember, for the british public, these two brothers are imprinted in memory as the young boys who walked together behind their mother's casket after her death. and so to hear harry openly acknowledge what perhaps people whispered, that's a very, very big deal in terms of both the emotional dynamic within the royal family, but also the image the royal family has with the british public.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "well, so this is the part of the story that most people know. the couple spend several months thinking and planning their new life. they talk it over with members of the royal family. buckingham palace slow rolls them, tells them to take their time. it has to be thought through. it's complicated. the tabloids, particularly the sun newspaper, get wind of the fact that they may be leaving the country. and suddenly, they decide to tell the world that they have this plan for a new lifestyle, and all hell breaks loose.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "archived recording 1 and i got some breaking news. and it is about harry and meghan and a statement — archived recording 2 in a statement, they said, we have chosen to carve out a progressive, new role within this institution. archived recording 3 we intend to, and here is the key bit — step back as senior members of the royal family — archived recording 4 — and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support her majesty, the queen. i mean, it's virtually a letter of resignation, isn't it? archived recording 5 harry and meghan didn't consult with any of their relatives before releasing that statement, meaning even their closest family members had no idea how this was going to work. archived recording 6 buckingham palace is now in crisis after it was blindsided by prince harry and wife meghan's announcement.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "archived recording a smiling meghan was seen out for a walk with her son and the couple's dogs in leggings and boots. no need to follow a royal dress code.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they pulled it off. not without a lot of heartache, and a lot of pain, and a lot of controversy. but in the end, by acting as precipitously as they did, they managed to force the palace to deal with something that it really would have preferred to put off indefinitely. so they really forced the issue successfully.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and in brief, what does this mean about their status within the royal family? how did that shake out? are they still royals?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, they are still royals. prince harry is still a prince. he's still sixth in line to the throne. they still have the titles of his royal highness and her royal highness. but in a very big concession to the queen, they agreed to stop using those titles. they've also agreed to repay the cost of renovating their cottage in england. and they've also importantly agreed to give up direct public funding of their activities. so it's a real break. and it truly does not only liberate the couple, but it will impose some pressure on them to earn enough money to finance a lifestyle that is, by anyone's account, very extravagant.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mark, what has been the reaction inside britain to this seismic disruption to the royal family?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "archived recording 1 i understand why prince harry and meghan have done it. i think you can see prince harry obviously, his wife is just getting hounded by the press, often in racially dodgy ways. and you go, of course he doesn't want any part of it. i can completely understand that. archived recording 2 if harry's happy and meghan's happy, that's all that matters.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "among young people, there was a great deal of sympathy for harry and meghan. among the older generation, it's been very different.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "archived recording all you can say is that meghan markle and prince harry are behaving like spoiled brats, totally entitled —", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there's a sense that prince harry and meghan exploited the goodwill of the queen. they blindsided buckingham palace by putting out their announcement the way they did, and also that they kind of want to have it both ways.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "archived recording robert on email says, if harry and meghan want to relinquish their royal status, then get on with it. at the moment, they're behaving like self-indulgent rich kids being supported by the taxpayer. they want to have their cake and eat it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it confirms some of the worst suspicions that people had about meghan markle as this relationship first began.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mark, at the start of this conversation, you promised that you would tell us why all this matters beyond the human drama, and what it reveals about britain. so here's your chance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you're right, i did promise that. and here's the greater significance. harry and meghan are not just leaving britain at any old time. they're leaving britain at the very moment that britain is leaving the european union, that it is finally carrying out brexit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i think this timing is crucial to understanding how this debate is playing out in britain. because as you see the country charting a new identity, casting off from europe, there's a great deal of uncertainty, of uneasiness about the future of this country. what kind of a role will it play in the world? will it be diminished? will it be isolated? what will the post-brexit britain look like? so at this time of national uncertainty, there is a yearning for symbols. there's a, a sort of an urge to reach out to things that symbolize british history and the immutability of the british idea. and there's no greater symbol of that than the monarchy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so this idea, that suddenly this brilliant young couple — this shining symbol of the future of the monarchy — would wind up turning their backs on it, and leave britain, comes at a particularly vulnerable moment for the british people. and as it turns out, the people who are hardest on meghan markle are also generally the people who voted for brexit. and it's one of the great paradoxes of this story. that their resistance to meghan markle — their complicity in making her life miserable — has led to this outcome that has convulsed the royal family, has threatened an institution that these people care so deeply about. so i think that's the importance here. it's not just a debate that breaks down along generational lines. it's a debate that breaks down very much along brexit lines. did you vote for staying in the european union or for leaving? how you voted in that case weighs very much in how you feel about harry and meghan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so the same forces that pushed for britain to leave the e.u., and are now craving its greatest symbols of nationalism in the form of the monarchy, they are the same forces who have inflicted all of this on meghan and on harry. and perhaps driven them to leave the monarchy, to weaken the monarchy. it's a, perhaps, classic case of getting what you wanted until you realize that it's not really what you wanted.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that's right. and in that regard, it's a lot like the brexit debate itself. the people who voted to leave imagined some greater britain. but instead, they may wind up not only with a much diminished country, but with a much diminished monarchy.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "throughout billions, we've witnessed bobby axelrod, a fearsome hedge-fund billionaire, trying to leverage his way into new york's powerful elite, but to only limited success. nothing makes him happier than bullying an old-money family off their turf, as he did when he snapped up the naming rights to a performing arts building in the first season. but more often, that same aggression and lust for power and credibility makes him seem gauche, a nouveau riche sleaze who may know how to work the angles on wall street, but who doesn't speak the language of high society. for all his diabolical brilliance, he often comes across as a beverly hillbilly in designer slacks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this week's episode, titled the kingmaker, compares axe's impetuousness with the patrician calm of jack foley (david strathairn), a man who exemplifies the difference between being wealthy and being rich. (chris rock defined the terms memorably, albeit to make a point on race.) in the machine politics of albany, foley has both hands on the levers, choosing candidates through favors and old-guard relationships and through back-channel political maneuvering. when chuck's father chides chuck for not showing proper fealty to foley by failing to earn his granddaughter a clerkship, chuck says: we don't have kings, dad. we live in a democracy. but we can see, as the episode unfolds, that chuck doesn't really believe that now, if he ever did. his profile as a united states attorney may give his political prospects a boost, but there's no going anywhere in new york democratic politics without foley's blessing. and chuck is fortunate enough to operate in that elite circle.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "no matter what axe does, he will always be on the outside looking in. even if he were interested in making people forget his working-class roots, the manner in which he earned — and continues to maintain — his billionaire status cannot be forgotten. to a certain extent, axe knows this already, which is why he delights in wearing a heavy-metal t-shirt to formal occasions, thumbing his nose at new york city royalty. yet no amount of money is enough for him to buy out foley's scrap metal supplier, who will lose in penalties, fines, and endless governmental harassment whatever he gains upfront. and while axe's gambit of arranging an animal conservation honor to present to foley earns him a meeting, foley uses the opportunity to make it clear that certain pathways to power aren't available to him. nice try, but don't bother, foley effectively tells him. there's nothing for you here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "while axe made plenty of mistakes in the first season — he tore his own office down to the foundations in the end — one of the strengths of the second season is that it's willing to expose his weak spots and fallibility. he can plot or buy his way out of many sticky situations, and he always seems a step ahead of other hedge-funders and wall street sharks. but he's also impulsive and ego-driven, and his hot temperament sometimes gets the better of him. in this episode, even wags — wags! — advises him to cool off a little and stop obsessing over foley's intervention in the sandicot deal. when the guy who lustily indulges in vaportinis and an empowering cabaret that celebrates the feminine ideal (i.e. lap dances) tells you to slow your roll, maybe it's best to listen.", "augmented": []}
