Eileen Gadsden, who runs a tech start-up and heard about the rally from a local City Council member, said she was undecided and had come to learn more about Mr. Bloomberg. I'm from Philly, Biden is native to us, she said, but I need somebody who's going to win.
Pastor Thomas says that releasing feelings of shame and unworthiness takes time and the support of a loving community. He adds, however, that being ostracized by religion can be a blessing in disguise if it pushes one to develop a more authentic personal faith.
Both noticed how well they worked together as colleagues, and a friendship began between Mr. Desai, a Mumbai native who left his homeland to live abroad at 20, and a self-described California girl. As she got to know him, Ms. Umeda started to confide in Mr. Desai about the difficulties in her marriage.
What do you mean? I know you came out right away and you said that firing Officer Rolfe was rushed. Do you still feel that way after reading the charges, after watching the news conference from the district attorney, the videos — all the information that has come out?
Now, Howard Beale is very different. I saw you in Network. I loved it. I was not sitting on the stage. My mother was sitting on the stage for one of the performances — she loved. He's a newscaster who famously said, I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore. It was a very famous movie. He threatens to kill himself on live TV. Tell me about Howard Beale's relationship to power because he's powerless at the beginning of the show, really. I mean, he's been this newscaster, in a traditional sense, and has to shift.
Cherubino, a horny pageboy sung by a woman in adolescent male drag, was one of Ms. Graham's calling cards in the 1990s. To hear a superb rising artist in the role, 24 hours after hearing Ms. Graham limn the stages of a woman's life, was a poignant juxtaposition, but also a lovely one. The kids are all right, these performances made clear, and so are the parents.
It's a progressive Protestant church. We primarily go upstate, where we have a house in a town called New Paltz. They've got a rainbow flag up front. It's a very welcoming community.
But that he was participating in the investigation and would be a witness against Officer Rolfe.
So I have a three-part test for sending troops into harm's way. Number one, it needs to advance a vital American interest or avert a humanitarian catastrophe. Number two, it has to have a clearly defined timeline where we can look troops in the eyes and say, It's going to take this long and you're going to be able to accomplish our mission and then you're going to be able to come home. And not some boardroom self-delusion, like you actually believe that you're going to get it done and then be able to bring them home in that time frame. And number three, we're not going in alone; there are allies joining us in the mission. If those three things are in place, then I would consider sending our troops into harm's way.
Philip K. Dick was a writer of modest accomplishment when he met Anne Rubenstein in late 1958. By the time the couple broke up less than six years later, Dick had written more than a dozen novels and was well on his way to eminence as one of the most influential of postwar American writers.
Talking about the year in film, meanwhile, Greta Gerwig, who is nominated for two Oscars at the Academy Awards ceremony this Sunday as the writer and director of Lady Bird, noted the way Mr. Allen's movies, Manhattan among them, have informed me as an artist.
The bills, which will be introduced as a package, would place New York in the same rank as other liberal bulwarks like California and Washington, at a time when Democrats are seeking to enhance voter involvement.
It would take me years to realize this dream, through a marriage and divorce, undergraduate and grad school — until, at age 38, I packed my bags and moved to Los Angeles. As my grandma's mind deteriorated, I felt myself holding on to her by becoming the woman we both wanted to be.
Since my husband's arrival, I had been bumping up against the uncomfortable understanding that the way I wanted to live as a woman in my 50s was starkly different from how he thought life in his late 20s should look. My middle-aged friends bored him. My insistence on living in a clean and orderly house was, to him, senseless. And the hours he lost to Facebook, to watching European football, seemed pointless to me.
The academy's old guard has resisted a dogged push by Netflix to join the best picture club, arguing that, since the streaming service does not release its films in a traditional theatrical manner, its offerings should be better considered by Emmy voters. (Helen Mirren, onstage at the most recent National Association of Theater Owners convention, used an expletive to refer to the company.) Some longtime academy members say that Netflix's campaigning has turned them off, in part because it reminds them of the days when Harvey Weinstein solicited Oscar votes with no-stone-unturned vigor.
He had had various health problems, including several heart attacks late last year, the environmental group Friends of the Earth, on whose board he served, said in announcing his death.
I mean, ultimately, I'm asking all these questions because I think a lot of people's reaction to this incident, above all, is, why did a man who was found asleep in a Wendy's drive-through — a man who was not armed when this interaction began, and a man who really just wanted to go home — why did he end up dead at the end of this encounter and at the hands of police?
The tone and milieu of this book put me in mind of two excellent earlier memoirs, Anatole Broyard's Kafka Was the Rage (1993), about bohemian Greenwich Village in the late 1940s, and Joyce Johnson's Minor Characters (1983), about the women among the Beat writers, as well as Sylvia Plath's novel, The Bell Jar (1963).
Mr. Yang previously ran a successful test prep company and created the nonprofit Venture for America, which he argues is a strength, offering him fresh perspective and critical distance from the workings of Washington.
What's the power you have when you are playing a role? How do you think about that?
Hm. And Mark, where in your mind does this story begin?
Analysis: The idea of the border wall, which advisers to Mr. Trump said they initially created to remind Mr. Trump to talk tough on immigration during his campaign, has boxed in the president. He's now struggling to find a way to please both his core supporters and conservative skeptics who see the wall as ineffective.
Mr. Yang has proposed what he describes as a W.T.O. for data and has argued that data ownership should be made a property right. Some argue that such an organization could enable more partnership among countries in setting standards for artificial intelligence and data.
Darien Monk doesn't wish a broken espresso machine on anybody, but once upon a time she wouldn't have minded if the ones at the Coffee & Tea Exchange in Chicago, where she works, were out of order a little more often.

There has been a continuing controversy over Hong Kong's law banning masks to target anti-government protesters. One court ruling found it unconstitutional, but a later ruling temporarily reinstated it.
In the same place, the Texas edition of the textbook contains only a blank white space.
But his songs boldly told the stories of his communities, and he made no effort to avoid social issues. Perhaps his biggest hit was Todii, a cautionary song about the perils of H.I.V. from the 1997 album Tuku Music. Powered by a melancholy chorus of background singers and the gravelly lament of Mr. Mtukudzi's lead vocal, it warned listeners of the virus that by then had infected a quarter of Zimbabwe's population.
Speaking on Meet the Press after Azar, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo blamed the Trump administration for failing to act decisively and for giving little guidance to states.
The Scream is fading. And tiny samples of paint from the 1910 version of Edvard Munch's famous image of angst have been under the X-ray, the laser beam and even a high-powered electron microscope, as scientists have used cutting-edge technology to try to figure out why portions of the canvas that were a brilliant orangeish-yellow are now an ivory white.
A half-century later, all of it — her extraordinary clarity and imperfect femininity, her unstinting account of the struggle to reconcile art and life — still lands. The construct of memoir (and its stylish young cousin, autofiction) involves the organizing filter of retrospection, lending the impression that life is a continuous narrative reel of action and consequence, of meanings to be universalized. Ditlevsen's refusal to present her failings as steps on the path to some mythical plane of self-awareness reminds me of how potent the form can be when stripped of that pretense. Only at the conclusion of her memoirs, where we find her as she was when she wrote them — clinging to scraps of herself, a stranger to her children, gingerly returning to the page, the hunger lingering in her veins — did I really understand what occasioned these rare and indelible texts: the desire to be rid, finally, of her shame. Ditlevsen's voice, diffident and funny, dead-on about her own mistakes, is a welcome addition to that canon of women who showed us their secret faces so that we might wear our own.
I think it's actually unfortunate that I get asked about those sorts of questions, in the sense that I feel like men should leave the room and let women decide what to do with your bodies. I have a feeling I know what you would decide, and then we could come back and say, Hey, what did you decide? I also think that if men got pregnant, this would be a very, very different conversation. And we'd have a completely different approach to these issues. So, I don't have a short list of Supreme Court justice appointees, but safeguarding women's reproductive rights and having an evolving sense of the law would be very important.
The Rockwells' residence is in the northwestern suburbs, out to Blackthorn: Twenty minutes. I had Johnny Macatitch stay in the car while I went around the back way like I normally would when paying a call. I was coming by the side of the house and I paused. To step on my cigarette. To breathe. And I could see them, in through the leaded windows and past the potted plants of the kitchen, Miriam and Colonel Tom, dancing. Dancing the twist, slow, and without a whole lot of bend in the knees, to the lecherous saxophone frying like the dinner in the pan. They clinked glasses. Red wine. Up above the moon throbbed full, and the clouds it raced through seemed to be the moon's clouds rather than our clouds. Yes, an unforgettably beautiful night. And that beauty was part of this story. As if staged for my benefit, like the picture framed by the kitchen window: A forty-year marriage that still had fucking in it. Under a night so sweet it looked like day.
He carefully threaded the needle for listeners as he made the argument for Mr. Trump as a values leader. There are two types of values, micro and macro, he argued. One seems to do with the minutiae of one's life (marital fidelity, religiosity, respect); the other, he says, is more important and relates to the general effect of one's life.
In 2017, Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York's subway and pledged $1 billion for improvements. The editorial board has repeatedly called for action to make the subways workable for this paper's millions of readers.
They would say: 'Unless you ask us not to come, we'll be there,' Ms. Chau said. Even Hong Kong's strict quarantine protocol, a mandatory period of three weeks of isolation in a government designed hotel, didn't dissuade them.
Listening to the tape, we have no idea what this means.
I mean, the question is what trade-offs you're willing to make, really. The N.S.A. is going to be able to recruit the tech talent that he can recruit and you want to try and ramp that up. So one thing ——
Representative David Hobson, Republican of Ohio, said he supported impeachment of the President for lying to a grand jury but not in the Jones case. Even if it's true, I worry whether it rises to the same threshold for impeachment, he said. I didn't want to pile on.
MG: So, if you become president, what government secret are you most excited to learn about?
With the words Hung on You painted in oversize letters on its storefront and a large mural inside, the shop became a groovy place to be seen, especially if rockers and other celebrities were known to have bought clothing there.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the federal government commissioned a series of experiments to look at how guaranteed income effects labor participation. Researchers discovered that a program like U.B.I. doesn't have the drastic effect on work that some might predict; households overall reduce their workload by roughly 13 percent, according to a paper in the Canadian Public Policy journal.
Most curmudgeonly protagonists, my own included, are barely eligible for senior discounts and ought to be booking cycling trips across Asia instead of shuffling about in their bedroom slippers (yes, I mean you, Ove). So it's refreshing that Doris, the Swedish heroine of Sofia Lundberg's debut novel, The Red Address Book, is truly old at 96 and depicted with an unflinching eye toward the realities of advanced age. Housebound and alone, she isn't about to rise up and go on life-changing adventures. Death is, she says, waiting in every little wrinkle, clinging to my body.
archived recording (meghan markle) When I first met my now-husband, my friends were really happy because I was so happy. But my British friend said to me, I'm sure he's great, but you shouldn't do it, because the British tabloids will destroy your life.
Things had changed in 2001, when she was arrested yet again, this time charged with 39 counts of fraud. At the time, she was using a different surname, Rosian — she was living with a man named Vladimir Rosian on the Upper West Side — and the stakes were much lower. She had been charging immigrants $2,000 to $2,700 each, falsely telling them that she had influence on immigration legislation and could help them gain permanent resident status.
He also retained Henry Breckinridge, a conservative Wall Street lawyer, to help handle his affairs. Many of his new associates held conservative views, which his father, a neo-Populist Republican, spent 20 years fighting. Lindbergh was not conceived of then as a possible political figure, but rather as a nice young man, perhaps a little unpolished socially, who deserved the best that could be provided. His new friends were considerate of his strong individualism. They did not impose flattery, they were respectful and, above all, helpful. The income from We and from his flight articles in The New York Times made him a millionaire--a considerable eminence for a man accustomed to thinking hard before he spent $5. His friends helped him invest his fortune. And after Lindbergh made his goodwill flights around the country and to Latin America in the Spirit of St. Louis, his friends saw to it that he got a job in keeping with his interest in aviation and his status. The position was as an adviser in both Pan American World Airways and the predecessor of Trans World Airlines in laying out transatlantic, transcontinental and Caribbean air routes for the commercial aviation that his Paris flight had done so much to popularize.
That's all in the Lardner, but Mr. Lithgow adds another emotional channel by showing us how the barber, himself a good old boy, is implicated in the nastiness he pretends only to describe. An astonishing collection of laughs — whinnies, giggles, squeals, snorts, heaves — gradually colors the narrative, until this seemingly harmless man becomes, in effect, not just a witness to savagery, but also an accessory.
The pond was close enough to the highway that trucks mashing down Route 285 would roll down their windows to yell his name. To each passer-by, he raised his thumb and pinkie in a trademark shaka sign of good will.
AK: The president at the moment is at a NATO summit, or he might've left ——
Many people also want smart sperm. That's why some big banks are near elite colleges. They have sperm collection centers in Palo Alto, Calif., near Stanford University, and Cambridge, Mass., near Harvard. College men are one of the most reliable groups to see the potential chaos of creating maybe 50 biological children around the world in exchange for about $4,000 over several months — and decide it is a good deal.
'APPLYING IT LIBERALLY' at Abrons Arts Center, Underground Theater (April 8, 4:45 p.m.). Keisha Zollar and Andrew Kimler are an interracial married couple who both skew liberal when it comes to their politics, but that doesn't mean their viewpoints always gel cohesively — their banter on the podcast they produce together can attest to that. As part of this year's NYC PodFest, they're hosting a live taping, and Abbi Crutchfield and Allison Kilkenny are joining them, for what they describe in part as a candid autopsy of a modern American marriage.
So, right now, the government is like this flopping appendage behind a lot of this stuff. I mean, honestly. The Office of Technology Assessment was eliminated in 1995. So our legislature is literally 24 years behind the curve on technology, and they don't understand. They're totally outgunned. They don't know what's going on.
I am not guilty, she told reporters outside the immigration detention center on Tuesday. I put out a statement about L.G.B.T. and I am being deported because of L.G.B.T.
JI: Sure. But to Binya's point, it's still a trade-off. So, if I'm on food stamps, I'm getting less of a benefit than, say, Jesse, who's not on food stamps.
At the last debate, I proposed a world data organization, because to me, China's in position to leapfrog us in artificial intelligence. They're investing tens of billions in a way that our government is not. It's a national effort. And they've now separated their technology ecosystem from the West's and they're trying to sell their software and operating systems to other countries with very limited success right now, but this parallel tech universe, to me, is something that we can actually use to bring China back to the table.
Biden and Harris introduced members of their White House science team. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 2:23 - 0:00 transcript Science Is About 'Hope,' Biden Says President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris introduced key members of their White House science team on Saturday. We know that science is discovery, it's not fiction. It's also about hope, and that's America. It's in the DNA of this country, hope. We're on the cusp of some of the most remarkable breakthroughs that will fundamentally change the way of life for all life on this planet. We can make more progress in the next 10 years, I predict, than we've made in the last 50 years. Today, I'm proud to announce a team of some of the country's most brilliant and accomplished scientists to lead the way. The opportunities we have and the challenges we face are greater than ever before. The president-elect knows that science and technology will be crucial in meeting this moment. And he has tasked us in this letter, and I don't mean, just his scientific advisers, I mean, the whole scientific community and the American public with answering important questions about how science and technology can best be used to advance our health, our economic welfare, and our national security. Perhaps never before in living memory have the connections between our scientific world and our social world been quite so stark as they are today. The Covid-19 crisis has inflicted extraordinary suffering.
'ABOUT ALICE' at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center (in previews; opens on Jan. 20). Based on what The New York Times Book Review called a slim but walloping book, this Theater for a New Audience play by Calvin Trillin relates his long, fine romance with his wife, Alice, who died in 2001. Under Leonard Foglia's direction, Jeffrey Bean and Carrie Paff portray Calvin and Alice.
BA: But that just brings us to the other side of it, where what you're proposing is not to give as much more money to the people who need it the most. You're saying, if you get food stamps, the amount by which your government benefits increase will be less than for me or you.
In Leigh Silverman's lopsided world-premiere production, the friends make a cracking ensemble, each fully human and with her own comic charge: the aggressively chipper Sandy (Mia Barron); timid Beth (Kate Wetherhead), with her failed marriage and disheveled lawn; tough-talking Pam (Danielle Skraastad), as fierce as the stilettos she wears to coffee (costumes are by Kaye Voyce); and Renee (Nikiya Mathis), an editor at a gardening magazine. She thrills to Diane's radical landscaping plans — and the possibility of a fling with her.
Mr. Yang has argued that more legislative oversight on reproductive issues should come from physicians rather than politicians. He tweeted: I personally don't think male legislators should be weighing in on women's reproductive rights and freedoms.
For all these reasons, starting with smaller classes, I banned laptops, and it improved the students' engagement. With constant eye contact, I could see and feel when they understood me, and when they did not. Energized by the connection, we moved faster, further and deeper into the material. I broadened my rule to include one of my large upper-level courses. The pushback was real: A week before class, I posted the syllabus, which announced my policy. Two students wrote me to ask if I would reconsider, and dropped the class when I refused. But more important, after my class ends, many students continue to take notes by hand even when it's not required.
I put aside the CSSS layout I'd been staring at and I did my face. Too, I buzzed Linda, asking her to greet the elevator and bring the Colonel right on in.
HOW DEMOCRACIES DIE, by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt. (Broadway, $15.) Think beyond the coups d'état: The backslide from democracy into autocracy can be brought about by elected officials who upend the processes that empowered them. The authors, political scientists at Harvard, describe four criteria to identify authoritarian leaders. Donald Trump has met all of them.
Indonesian immigration officials detained the woman, Kristen Gray, 28, overnight Tuesday and said she was being deported for spreading information that could unsettle the public. They also accused her of carrying out dangerous activities and endangering public order by not obeying rules and laws.

She and her husband bought a three-bedroom, two-bath cottage on Diamond Street for $580,000. Like so many homes on Balboa Island, where candy-colored houses are packed tightly on streets named for gemstones, and pedestrians stroll in via a bridge or ride in on the ferry, it was small but charming, with easy access to Marine Avenue and the community's long, paved boardwalk. It became the family's summer home.
The numbers. So keep in mind, I didn't just wake up and say, Hey, technology is changing the world. I spent seven years working in Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis, Baltimore and other cities that have been blasted by the waves of automation.
Phil Spector died Saturday as an inmate in California, convicted of the 2003 murder of Lana Clarkson. By then, other facts had emerged about his volatile, erratic, gun-toting behavior, notably in Ronnie Spector's 1990 memoir, Be My Baby, which detailed his abuses during their seven-year marriage. Some listeners may well decide that all of his music is poisoned. But it is also inextricable from pop history.
Uber is literally advertising to schoolteachers saying, Hey, we've figured out schoolteachers make really good Uber drivers. And if you look at that situation, the headline unemployment rate says, Check, this person is employed. Heck, this person might be employed twice. The headline unemployment rate when Donald Trump was running for president, he castigated it as fake news, and then he got into office and all the sudden it became real news. He was right the first time. The number is almost intentionally designed to obscure any of the difficulties in the labor market. If I drop out of the labor market, I no longer count. I actually help the number.
You're assuming, of course, that she doesn't already know of his behavior. Either way, she'll no doubt suspect your motives. But then you, too, suspect your motives. One way to make an assessment is to ask yourself whether, had the situation been reversed, you would have wanted to be told by the other woman. Am I right to think that you would? If you tell her your story and she then proceeds with the wedding — perhaps after a confrontation and a resolution — it would presumably be with a clearer sense of what she is letting herself in for: She would be marrying him with a fuller appreciation of his faults, and if the marriage doesn't work out, it won't be even partly your fault. But notice that he didn't, in the end, choose to extricate himself; he chose to make a life with her. His betrayal of you is one truth; it is not the only one that matters.
Chuck Barris, the Gong Show creator, songwriter and novelist who sought to add to his already eclectic résumé with a made-up — or was it? — story about being an assassin for the C.I.A., died on Tuesday at his home in Palisades, N.Y. He was 87.
Binyamin Appelbaum: Yes. After every invention basically since the plow, people have found new uses for the time saved by new technologies. You've argued that this time, this won't happen quickly enough. Why will this time be different? What gives you the confidence that we're confronting something new in all of human history?
In 1995, she convinced her family to stay on her beloved island during a visit to California. They rented a small house on Garnet Avenue, and it took only a few days of watching the electric Duffy boats on the harbor and strolling along the shops on Marine Avenue, Balboa Island's main drag, for Ms. Maly to make up her mind.
In a written statement, McGraw-Hill said the full-page Border Patrol narrative was not included in the California edition because it would not fit beside the literary excerpt. And at the time the Texas edition was produced, six years ago, state standards called for students to analyze both legal and illegal immigration to the United States.
Court packing isn't a violation of any part of the Constitution, but it is widely debated with critics pointing out that it would trigger severe political backlash.
Well, Mr. Hanson said, I read in The New York Times that it's the No. 1 place to live, if you're a gay man, to meet people. That's why I'm applying here.

That's a fun exercise, too. I haven't gotten into the judicial appointment shortlist yet, but safeguarding women's reproductive rights would be one clear criteria. Because women's reproductive rights are fundamental human rights in my mind.
And again, all you have to do to look at it is to say, stock market prices and G.D.P. record highs, life expectancy declining. Like, that sums it up. You know? You don't need any clearer divergence than that.
A pair of mesmerizing and eccentric story collections would make excellent additions to your reading list. Carmen Maria Machado's inventive, sexually exuberant debut, Her Body and Other Parties — which includes a novella-length section outlining 272 speculative, alternative views of Law & Order: SVU episodes — reveals characters with crystalline consciousnesses clouded by their fabulist circumstances. In Kōno Taeko's Toddler-Hunting and Other Stories (published in Japan throughout the 1960s and translated by Lucy North and Lucy Lower), it is the women themselves — alienated, but composed — who push past boundaries to enact lucid waking nightmares.
He also called the Abraham Accords — agreements that the Trump administration helped broker for Israel to warm relations with Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates — a good thing.
The Animators covers familiar debut-novel territory: the search for identity, the desire for success, the bewildering experiences of small-town misfits leaving home for the bright lights of New York City. But Whitaker turns these motifs on their heads simply by changing the direction of the road and populating it with women. New York success is left behind in favor of rural America — where a man will hit a woman in public just as easily as he'll open the door for her — a place sketched out with convincing ease by Whitaker, a Kentucky native. Sharon, who begins as an updated version of Sal Paradise or Nick Carraway, manages to draw herself (literally) into the starring role of her life and work, instead of simply chronicling the lives of those around her.
But at the moment that Officer Rolfe shot Mr. Brooks, he wasn't in close range, and it wasn't capable of being a stun gun. So I just want to be very clear on the question of in what way Officer Rolfe would have believed that his life was in danger in that moment. You're painting a scenario where something could have changed. Someone might have done something. Brooks might have turned around, might have come back at him. But at that very moment, 18 feet away or so, when the cartridges had been spent and it's only role was as a stun gun, how was Officer Rolfe's life in danger?
I mean, that's not solely an American decision. NATO expansion is something that is fraught and elevates tensions with Russia in particular. I think we should explore it. I'm sympathetic, but it's not a decision we can make alone.
California's Board of Education adopted an expansive 842-page social studies framework in 2016. Two years later, Texas' school board streamlined its social studies standards, which are now laid out in 78 tightly compressed pages.
Here his voice gave a kind of hiccup of fright. And I thought he must be imagining her last moments. It took him a few swallows, and then he continued:
As their motion failed, the Democrats briefly marched out of the House chamber in protest. But they returned to vote on the four articles of impeachment.

Detroit is a city of 680,000 people. Its peak population was 1.7 million. If you look this direction, you can see a thriving neighborhood, and then you turn 90 degrees and you see abandoned buildings as far as the eye can see. If we were adapting, you would see not multidecade low rates of interstate migration, which we have right now. You would not be seeing 80 percent of the country have multidecade low levels of business formation, which we have right now. You would not be seeing historic lows of business formation among young people, which we have right now. You would not see labor force participation at 62.9 percent, a multidecade low which we have right now. You would not see record-high levels of drug overdoses and suicides to the point that America's life expectancy has declined for three years in a row, which we have right now.
gender differences were the result of biology (and thus unlikely to change) or societal norms. More than half of Republicans said biology determined differences in how men and women parented, expressed feelings or spent their free time. About two-thirds of Democrats described society as the primary driver of these differences.

Many Jews did convert--some at knifepoint, others to advance themselves. The story about Professor Daniel Chwolson illustrates the latter phenomenon. Chwolson, a Russian intellectual of the nineteenth century, had converted from Judaism to Russian Orthodoxy as a young man, but he continued to fight against anti-Semitism. This led a Jewish friend to ask him why he had converted: Out of conviction, the great man said. What conviction? his Jewish friend inquired. Chwolson responded: Out of a firm conviction that it would be far better to be a professor in St. Petersburg than a Hebrew school teacher in Shklop. Yet despite the material advantages of conversion, most Jews resisted it. Clearly, those Jews--who sacrificed so much--remained Jewish not only in reaction to their enemies. More than our fabled stiff-neckedness was involved. There are substantive principles that Jews have been so stubborn about--that we have been willing to fight and even die for. For Jews who define their Jewishness in theological terms, it is easy to find that principle: It is God's will. For the large number of Jews who are skeptical about being God's chosen people, the principle is more elusive, but it is palpable to most of us, though difficult to articulate. It is a disturbing reality, however, that for a great many Jews, their Jewish identity has been forged and nurtured by our external enemies who have defined us as victims of their persecution.
It was all seat-of-the-pants flying and Lindbergh gloried in it; but he gave it up to enlist in the Army in March, 1924, so he could attend the Army flying school at Brooks Field, San Antonio, Tex. For the first time, he found some joy in textbooks and classes. Chief Pilot on Mail Run Indeed, he was graduated as the top man in his class, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army Air Service Reserve in March, 1925. He was by this time an experienced flier. He spent some time as an air circus stunt flier at county fairs and the like before being hired by the Robertson Aircraft Company of St. Louis as the chief pilot on the mail run to Chicago. He made the first run in April, 1926. It was the only paycheck job in the normal sense of the word that he ever held. Meantime, he had made a further commitment to the military by joining the Missouri National Guard, where he taught other pilots and became a first lieutenant. On one of his flights to Chicago in September, 1926, he was musing about the possibilities of long-distance trips, and he startled himself by thinking I could fly nonstop between New York and Paris. In many ways, Lindbergh's life was a series of responses to imperatives. When he became convinced that he ought to do something--he ought to oppose entry into World War II, he ought to speak out for conservation--he reacted with vigor and dispatch.
BA: But you're not proposing to fix any of that. People don't just work to make money; they do work for a sense of self-worth. They work so that they can develop skills, they work so they have the possibility of earning more money someday. You're proposing to replace a portion of the income they may have lost, but not any of those other things. Why is that a solution?
You're referring to the fact that Rashard Brooks grabbed the officer's taser and shot it twice.
In an essay published by the Gotham Gazette, Kimberly Watkins alleged that Mr. Yang fired her from Manhattan Prep because he did not think she would continue working as hard after getting married. Mr. Yang appeared on The View shortly after and said there was zero truth to Ms. Watkins's account. After publication, Ms. Watkins reached out to the editorial board, noting the question contained an error — she testified before a New York City hearing on pay equity, but, as she wroteto us , I have on multiple occasions drawn contrast to 'pay equity,' with what I experienced, which concerns long term economic stability. The reality that my economic future was destroyed by Yang, right after my marriage, after an unblemished six-year commitment to this company, has been the focus of my story, not pay inequity…Yang's response [also] grossly overstates the investigative process and draws a false conclusion.
Mr. Zeller made his Broadway debut in 2016 with The Father, for which Frank Langella won a Tony Award for best actor. Another work of his, The Mother, starring Isabelle Huppert, is to begin performances Off Broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company on Feb. 20.
So the radio cars and the beat cops were there, and the science crew and the medical examiners were there, and Tony Silvera and Oltan O'Boye were there--inside. And some neighbors. But them you look right through. These uniformed figures were churning under the dome lights. And I knew they swayed to sudden priorities. It was like in the Southern when you keyed the mike and said there was an officer down. Down, in some cases, meaning fucked up forever, in a cross-alley after a chase, on a warehouse floor, or reeling alone around a vanished drug corner with both his hands over his eyes. When somebody close to the murder police starts crafting overtime for the murder police, then special rules apply. This is racial. This is an attack on every last one of us.
Nominations are made by an independent council and approved by the governor general. Hundreds of Australians receive the Order of Australia every year, and it has four tiers. The Companion award is the highest tier, and it is bestowed on only a handful of people each year. In 2020, just five people received it.
So if you cannot learn from the experiences of other countries, what can you learn from? We have to take a policy that actually works, and what those countries and every other developed country have determined works, is a value added tax. Because a value added tax is impossible to game your way out of. If you're a trillion-dollar technology company — you know, I was just in New Hampshire campaigning yesterday, and you know what I say to them? I say to everyone around the country, Amazon, a trillion-dollar technology company sucking up $20 billion in business every year, closing 30 percent of your stores and malls, paying zero in taxes, how do you feel about that? You know? And they are angry. They say, how the heck can Amazon be paying zero in taxes? And I was like, I know. And it's up to you, the people of New Hampshire, to change it. So if you look at other countries ——

His daughter, Ida Ashworth, said the cause was cancer.
With such a public subject, what could there be left to tell? Maher, a journalist based in Karachi, answers that question handily, and originally. A Woman Like Her is a model of how to report on celebrity: by focusing on the seedy characters who feed and exploit it, and by harvesting the details, especially at the seam between public and private, that more conventional journalists leave behind. Maher has an often thrillingly slant gaze, an eye alert to the absurdities, ironies and small tragedies at play in the manufacture of images and personas. Her book is full of unforgettable scenes and vignettes — Baloch, pretending to be a clueless urbanite, her stilettos sinking into the mud on a reality show set in a village like the one where she was raised; a television talk show blurring her cleavage-spot to capitalize on her risqué image, even though she is wearing nothing revealing. This tension over who is in control of Baloch's life drives the book.
His office also announced that he would create a surgeon general position for the state by executive order. His aides said the governor's first budget would seek to expand Medi-Cal coverage to undocumented youths up to age 26.
Along parallel lines, a far lower percentage of Republicans than Democrats believe that changing gender roles have made it easier for marriages to be successful (26 percent of Republicans compared with 47 percent of Democrats). Similarly, 36 percent of Republicans compared with 58 percent of Democrats believe changing gender roles have made it easier for women to lead satisfying lives. Fewer Republicans than Democrats (30 to 48 percent) believe changing gender roles have made it easier for men to lead satisfying lives.
Her death was confirmed by her grandson Beryl Gilothwest.
Her current memoir comes from a much darker place. It begins in the summer of 2012. Ronan is dying, and Black is actively considering a jump from the Rio Grande Gorge bridge. Her marriage has imploded — exploded, really — after the corrosive effects of too many days and nights of anger, guilt, resentment, exhaustion and, above all, a never-ending, all-consuming grief. Black's coping mechanism has been desperate self-numbing — compulsive extramarital sex, extreme exercise, any sort of tangible, identifiable, physical pain. Her husband has fled into rage. Their self-immolation and ultimate split amount to a rupture that a crater of any size in any ground and beneath any sky failed to accurately depict, and in the aftermath, she has been left feeling mentally fractured, she writes. My mind was shifting and molting as my life broke slowly apart, like some strange and painful rebirth, but with no imaginable future — for what mother can imagine a future without her child?
Dan Gurney, whose storied career as a racecar driver included numerous firsts, and who went on to become equally successful as a team owner and car builder, died on Sunday in Newport Beach, Calif. He was 86.
She warned that any who stayed home without permission would not be paid, raising the prospect of a heightened clash with the union, which has suggested it may strike if teachers are not permitted to stay home if they want to. This is probably the most contentious and unpleasant reopening, in terms of how the different sides are interacting with each other, said Emily Oster, an economics professor at Brown University who has collected data on coronavirus cases in schools and has argued that reopening schools is safe under many circumstances. Interviews with parents and officials in Chicago indicate that many families are torn between concerns that their children are losing out educationally and fears that they will bring the virus home. Katrina Adams, who lives on the South Side, said she wanted to send her oldest daughter, who is in the fourth grade, back to school, but said she didn't think the district was ready to open. Ms. Adams said her views had not been influenced by the teachers' union, but she acknowledged feeling unsettled by many teachers' concerns about in-school transmission of the coronavirus. If they don't feel safe coming back, most definitely that's an alert, to a parent or anyone, she said.
Donald Trump does not speak for every non-politician or nonmilitary officer. But there is a deep need, and you've seen this, because you spent time in D.C., the D.C. establishment will not generate big solutions.
I mean, again, I don't believe that would be a systematic, across-the-board defunding. I think if we start doing that — let's say that using your argument, that that works out. Everybody starts to now call — they see a homeless person talking to themselves, instead of calling law enforcement, they call the therapist number. That person goes out. Everything goes real good. They get that person some place to live, or figure out how to get them safe. And those calls for service go down, and that leaves law enforcement to handle the real, I guess, emergencies?
This contrasts with General Suleimani's public image, both at home and abroad, which, since 2013, has been propped up by a vast media campaign. I followed some of his media team during my research and saw how they produced films, documentaries and even music videos, in both Persian and Arabic, lionizing his feats against the Islamic State. Inside Iran, he consistently polled as one of the most popular figures in the regime. The fact that most of his activities took place outside Iran helped preserve his reputation in the often fractious politics of the Islamic Republic.
In hindsight, this was not an accurate assessment of the next question.

Anne Beau Cox was born on Dec. 1, 1919, in Dayton, Ohio. Her mother, Margaretta Parker (Blair) Cox, used the baby as a way to avoid talking about politics when appearing in New York the next year, during her husband's presidential campaign. (But please excuse me from talking politics, she would say. Anne is very well, thank you. Baby Anne was born last winter.)
Mr. Yang biked to the Times from his Manhattan home. More New York City cyclists died biking in 2019 than in any other year since 2000; Gothamist counts 29 deaths.
Mr. Yang has said most Americans don't want to work for the federal government and argued that his Freedom Dividend would therefore be more effective than a program like a federal jobs guarantee.
The death was confirmed by her son Morgan Englund, who did not give a cause.
I love work, and the numbers also clearly show that people need work. Men in particular, without work, they volunteer less than employed men. So think about that for a second. They have higher rates of substance abuse, their health deteriorates, all these social ills accompany. Of course, we need to create jobs in as many communities as possible.
Her son, Brodie Ransom, said she was given a diagnosis of dementia last year. She also suffered from depression, he said.
At the airport in Bucharest, I was surrounded by customs officials. They said, 'You're dead,' he recalled with disbelief. I thought they were joking. I was the only one who didn't know. The people who escorted me off the plane knew, everyone knew except me.
Mr. Blinken has to reverse some of these, said Ms. Patterson, an ambassador during the Obama and George W. Bush administrations and the assistant secretary of state for Middle East policy from 2013 to 2017.
The greatest adverse shock to the psychosocial welfare of U.S. men has not stemmed from dysfunctional notions of masculinity (not that these are above reproach) nor from #MeToo (which was long overdue) but from deep secular labor market forces — both technological and trade-induced — that have over nearly four decades reduced the demand for skilled blue collar work.
Wow, I love this question. There are many causes of poverty, and the fact that we're not able to put food into people's houses and on their tables is a structural problem. My campaign's based upon the premise that we're going through this profound economic transformation, the fourth industrial revolution. And one of the major problems is that we still pretend we're in the economy of the '70s or '80s.
St. Brendan was a sailor who had spread the Gospel in his trips around Ireland, Scotland and Wales. If the tale of his trip to the Americas is true, he would have beaten Leif Ericson and Christopher Columbus by centuries.
For Mr. Miller, who grew up in Colorado's more conservative, red-leaning Western Slope, the election of a gay governor was all the more satisfying for being in his own state. For me, on election night, seeing Jared and Marlon up on that stage and him giving his victory speech — I so much would have loved to have known what that would have felt like back when I was in high school, he said.
He did not just get shot because he was in the Wendy's parking lot asleep and he just wanted to go home. No, that's not what happened. He chose to fight the officers. He chose to be a fleeing felon when he hit the officer in the head and gave him a concussion. And then the officers reacted at that point. So you can have the conversation all day whether you agree or not that the shot was right or wrong, and we can wait for the evidence. But what you can't dispute, or you should not be saying, is that a man was killed because all he wanted to do was go home, and he was just sitting in a Wendy's drive-through and he fell asleep. So I don't — you know, words have meaning. So when you say certain words, you have to understand that you need to say what you mean. And to say that our training should keep us from killing a man that just wanted to go home just isn't genuine.
So the clearest emblem of this is NASA and space travel where we all watched the Apollo 13 movies and we've seen the armies of research scientists helping launch these missions. Now where those research scientists? They're all at Space X and Blue Origin and they're there working for the tech guys who are putting billions into it. It's going to be very, very difficult to somehow reverse essentially decades of talent migration into the private sector. And if you're a talented kid out of Stanford, why would you work for the federal government? It's like if you're working in the private sector, you feel like you're going to go faster, you're certainly going to get paid more. You're going to be working with smarter people and you idolize Elon Musk, like who the heck, you know?
How the National University of Singapore has kept the coronavirus off campus. Students and staff at the National University of Singapore move within their designated zones on campus in November. Universities in Singapore have avoided coronavirus cases in part by using technology. Credit... Ore Huiying for The New York Times Every day, Tan Eng Chye, the president of the National University of Singapore, scans his online dashboard to see how crowded the cafeterias are. If the real-time map shows that one cafeteria is too packed, he has administrators send out an advisory to avoid it and to remind students that there are campus-run food delivery services, free of charge. Following the government's lead, universities in Singapore, a semi-authoritarian city-state of almost six million people, have taken a top-down approach to managing the coronavirus. The result: Since the start of the pandemic last year, not one person has been found to have contracted the virus at any of Singapore's three major universities. While Singapore's universities have benefited from a generally low caseload in its broader population, their experience and stringent measures stand in stark contrast to many campuses across the United States. A number of American universities experienced an explosion in cases almost as soon as students returned last fall. The National University of Singapore, or N.U.S., describes its strategy as containment, decongestion and contact tracing. The university has harnessed technology to enforce social distancing measures, assigned students to different zones on campus and imposed tough penalties for flouting the rules.
There has been a continuing controversy over Hong Kong's law banning masks to target anti-government protesters. One court ruling found it unconstitutional, but a later ruling temporarily reinstated it.
People were looking for something that was more grandfatherly, something that was more wise and trustworthy and less politically slick, said Angi Stalnaker, who was Mr. Bentley's campaign manager. They wanted someone that they could see themselves having Sunday dinner with, and, of the candidates in 2010, Robert Bentley was the one you could see inviting over for fried chicken and cornbread.
Down here, they'll play with you a little while and then they'll pull the trigger on you and let you know you are and will always be lower, said Wendy Boyd-Sealy, who is black and has lived in Norfolk, where 42 percent of residents are African-American, since 2003.
Yet, an analysis of all 91 best picture winners reveals only two (as previously noted) with major plot points about filmmaking. If this analysis is expanded to all 563 best picture nominees, only nine fit the bill: Once Upon a Time, The Artist and Argo, along with the 1937 version of A Star Is Born, Sunset Boulevard (1950), All That Jazz (1979), The Aviator (2004), Hugo (2011) and La La Land (2016). (The 2018 rendition of A Star Is Born swapped out film stars for pop stars and the other versions weren't nominated for best picture.)
You wouldn't guess that from the opening of Haircut, in which a professionally logorrheic barber entertains a new customer with tales of life in his two-bit town. There's this practical joker, you see, and this gal who won't give him the time of day and this doctor she likes and so on. But the story soon asserts itself, or rather insinuates itself, as a scathing indictment of good-old-boy-ism: the barely civilized tradition of men playing tricks on one another and arranging nasty traps (including marriage) for women.

He later admitted it was a mistake to stick with swimming after his star turn in Greece. In a 2014 interview with NBC Sports, Keller said he regretted that he had not retired after Athens. Around this time, he told a different interviewer, he had entertained the idea of enrolling at Arizona State to study criminology. But unsure of his path, Keller chose to stay with what he knew.
The question is, what is the means to creating those jobs? What I'm suggesting is that if you were to put $12,000 a year into the hands of every American adult … Let's say there's a town in Missouri of 10,000 people. Let's say after I'm president, their disposable income goes up by $10 million a month. Where is that money going to go? It's going to go into car repairs, day care expenses, Little League sign-ups, the occasional night out.
Following the repeal of marriage equality in Bermuda, where same-sex couples are now limited to domestic partnership, many in the United States and Western Europe are calling for a boycott (#BoycottBermuda). The demand for this boycott is not coming from grass-roots organizations in Bermuda, and in fact such a boycott stands to harm and not help L.G.B.T.Q. Bermudians.
I think it's too soon for us to have a black president, but even if it weren't, I don't think he should be it, she told Vanity Fair. He's sleazy. The nomination went to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, who lost to Vice President George Bush.
Loews Hotels says it won't host a fund-raiser with Senator Josh Hawley. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri challenged the legitimacy of Pennsylvania's electoral votes hours after a mob attacked the Capitol this month. Credit... Win Mcnamee/Getty Images Loews Hotels said on Saturday that it would not host a fund-raiser with Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, the latest indication that many companies are distancing themselves from Republicans who voted to overturn the election results. Fighting for Missouri, a political action committee affiliated with Mr. Hawley, had planned to host a fun-filled, family-friendly Orlando weekend event with the senator at the Loews Portofino Bay Hotel in Orlando, Fla., from Feb. 12 to Feb. 15, according to an invitation for the event. Tickets were being sold for $1,000 to $5,000, depending on the size of the group. But Loews said that the fund-raiser had been called off after the deadly riot at the Capitol, which many Democrats and Republicans have blamed in part on Mr. Hawley and other members of his party who supported President Trump's efforts to stop the certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory. We are horrified and opposed to the events at the Capitol and all who supported and incited the actions, the company said on Twitter. In light of those events and for the safety of our guests and team members, we have informed the host of the Feb. fund-raiser that it will no longer be held at Loews Hotels.

She gets across Eve's vague but not terminal dissatisfaction with her job and marriage, her nerdiness (one boss calls her a tiresome thinkbucket), and her anger and fear when Villanelle makes their game lethally personal. And she never stops being funny, whether upbraiding her superiors, espousing conspiracy theories or being water-tortured.

After watching his comedy, I felt that he wasn't a malignant racist and that his slur toward me was just very, very bad comedy run amok. Which did not strike me as a fireable offense, and I realized that if I was the individual who was actually directly slurred, and I did not feel that he should lose his job over it, then I should probably share that sentiment with other people.

The Pop artists took for their subject matter images and objects from the mass media and popular culture, including advertising, comic books and consumer products.

Bill Clinton's presidency marked the end of discrimination against Jews in the upper echelons of government. For the first time in American history, the fact that an aspirant for high appointive office was a Jew became irrelevant in his or her selection. President Clinton--our first president who grew up in an age when anti-Semitism was unacceptable--selected several Jewish cabinet members, two Jewish Supreme Court justices, numerous Jewish ambassadors and other high-level executive and judicial officials. Nor, apparently, was Jewishness a bar to election to the United States Congress, which has ten Jewish senators and more than two dozen Jewish representatives, several from states with tiny Jewish populations. Though we have still not had a Jew at the top of either party's ticket, it is fair to say that in today's America, a Jew can aspire to any office, any job, and any social status.
It would take me years to realize this dream, through a marriage and divorce, undergraduate and grad school — until, at age 38, I packed my bags and moved to Los Angeles. As my grandma's mind deteriorated, I felt myself holding on to her by becoming the woman we both wanted to be.

If these are your measurements, then of course you're going to think things are going in one direction, while your way of life disintegrates. Even the inventor of G.D.P., Simon Kuznets, said 100 years ago, this is a terrible measurement of national well-being, and we should never use it as that.

Creating categories can be comforting, even when they are utter nonsense: the four humors of the ancient Greeks, for instance, or the blood-type diet. Your husband is not upset with you because of your incompatible temperaments. No, he's distraught because you are not (and I suspect, never were) sorry for your behavior. Any apology you made would be unsatisfying. You feel no actual remorse.

And then the government would need to have enough auditors to verify everything that was submitted. In 2018, for example, an estimated 4,000 estate tax returns will be filed, with tax owed on 1,900 of them.

At the last debate, I proposed a world data organization, because to me, China's in position to leapfrog us in artificial intelligence. They're investing tens of billions in a way that our government is not. It's a national effort. And they've now separated their technology ecosystem from the West's and they're trying to sell their software and operating systems to other countries with very limited success right now, but this parallel tech universe, to me, is something that we can actually use to bring China back to the table.
We'll be right back. On June 12, less than three weeks after George Floyd's killing in Minneapolis, a police officer in Atlanta responded to a 911 call from a Wendy's employee, who reported that a man had fallen asleep in the drive-through lane. That man was 27-year-old Rashard Brooks.

In this respect, as in so many others, Marcel was the opposite of his hearty, healthy brother, Robert, born two years later, on May 24, 1873, in more prosperous and settled times. The two brothers were perfect companions as children and remained very close all their lives, although it was the robust younger brother, Robert, who often played the role of protector to the asthmatic Marcel. Like his father, Robert became a doctor--and a womanizer--yet the two brothers never quarreled, and lived their whole lives in the most complete harmony. In the 1890s both brothers were Dreyfusards. At the end of his life Marcel asked Robert to intervene and secure for him the Legion of Honor and, once this honor was obtained, to confer it on him. Robert was at Marcel's bedside when he died, and after his death it was Robert who oversaw the publication of the last two volumes of his masterpiece as well as his selected correspondence.

We need to modernize the court. Lifetime appointments might have made sense at one point a long time ago, but when the Constitution was drafted, people did not live as long.

Mr. Yang's comments, on Mr. Gillis and on judgment more broadly, contribute to a growing conversation among political and cultural figures about the merits and downsides of cancel culture.

Fallout roundup 17 Capitol Police officers are under investigation one week after rampage. National Guard troops deployed to the U.S. Capitol prepare to head out for a shift change on Thursday. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times With less than a week to go before the presidential inauguration, the police force charged with protecting the grounds of the Capitol is in crisis, as law enforcement agencies across the city brace for more potentially violent gatherings, based on intelligence reviewed in recent days. The chief of the Capitol Police and two other top security officials resigned after an angry mob of Trump loyalists stormed the Capitol last week. Three officers have been suspended, and 17 more are under investigation, according to a senior Congressional aide, including an officer who took selfies with people in the crowd and another who wore a Make America Great Again Trump hat and directed rioters into the Capitol. And lawmakers have demanded a full investigation into what some have referred to as a severe systemic failure. Currently, the Capitol complex, which is usually a bevy of activity, is cut off from its surroundings by National Guard troops and an imposing backdrop of seven-foot-tall, unscalable fencing.
A pushback? Nobody can say that with a straight face, he said last week at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences annual nominee luncheon. We got 24 nominations, the most of any studio. Our films have been honored across the board.
archived recording 1 I understand why Prince Harry and Meghan have done it. I think you can see Prince Harry obviously, his wife is just getting hounded by the press, often in racially dodgy ways. And you go, of course he doesn't want any part of it. I can completely understand that. archived recording 2 If Harry's happy and Meghan's happy, that's all that matters.
The Vaseline has melted so much, to a degree it got into my eyes and created a faucet of tears. Tears are pouring down my face. I could hear the audience going, oh.
But for them the challenge is not even what's happening internally. The challenge is whether or not they can get developing countries on board with their technology standards to be able to roll them out internationally. So if you're a third party, let's say you're a developing country in Africa or Latin America, then you have a choice essentially between the global standard and the Chinese standard. And if you're the Chinese, you do not want a standard that only you are using over time, because that's going to curb your economic upside to all of the software that you're building. One of the reasons why our tech companies are so successful is that they export it to virtually the entire rest of the world, and China does not want to be in the opposite position.
Of all the raucous parties in the apartment Sarah Dudley Plimpton shared with George Plimpton before his death in 2003, she loves the one on Sept. 10, 2001, the most.
Several Republicans, including some members of the Freedom Caucus, have begun to circle the wagons around her. The entire party would be wise to heed the words of Ronald Reagan: 'The person who agrees with you 80 percent of the time is a friend and an ally, not a 20 percent traitor,' said Representative Michael Burgess, Republican of Texas. Yesterday, Republicans jumped on the calls for unity and healing no matter how they decided to vote. Removing Liz from her leadership position would be divisive and a distraction we cannot afford. Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who also voted to impeach Mr. Trump, said that Ms. Cheney in the last week had gained immeasurable respect, and suggested that it was Republicans like Mr. Jordan who should be shoved aside in the wake of the siege and the impeachment it prompted. Since the discussion is opened, though, we may have to also have a discussion about who in our party fomented this, and their roles as ranking members, he said. The debate over Ms. Cheney's leadership post reflects the deep fractures in the Republican Party over Mr. Trump, who has demanded total loyalty from his party and, up until recently, largely received it. While prominent figures have recoiled from Mr. Trump's incendiary brand of politics in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 riot, worrying that it could spell ruin for their party, a large minority faction — many of them in the House — remains unwilling to abandon him.
Our best path forward with China is to try and have them continue to show restraint, but also see that the costs to human rights abuse is not just in Hong Kong, but with their ethnic minorities and the Muslim population of Uighurs, that the costs are higher than their perceived benefits of maintaining social order and stability. In order to have those costs feel real to the Chinese, we can't just moralize and say, Hey, do the right thing. Because at this point they're looking at us and saying like, Keep your opinions and value statements to yourselves.
I read many wonderful novels though I now find the idea of literary fiction obsolete. Few qualify as great in the sense of Tolstoy or Balzac but I just finished one that did: I was dazzled by the brilliance of The Goldfinch, by Donna Tartt, a masterpiece of characterization, plot, technical artistry combined with exquisite heartbreaking understanding of loss, love and art. Now that I have finished I regret its pleasures are gone, like a delicious feast — or a vanished love one will never know again.
Since 2012, scientists based in New York and experts at the Munch Museum in Oslo have been working on this canvas — which was stolen in 2004 and recovered two years later — to tell a story of color. But the research also provides insight into Munch and how he worked, laying out a map for conservators to prevent further change, and helping viewers and art historians understand how one of the world's most widely recognized paintings might have originally looked.
But if there's one aspect of homicide work that women do about a thousand times better than men it's riding a note. Women are good at that--at breaking the news. Men fuck it up because of the way they always handle emotion. They always have to act the n.o.d., so they come on like a preacher or a town crier, or all numb and hypnotized like someone reading off a list of commodity futures or bowling scores. Then halfway through it hits them what they're doing and you can tell they're close to losing it. I've seen beat cops burst out laughing in the face of some poor little schnook whose wife just walked under a Mack truck. At such moments, men realize that they're impostors, and then anything can happen. Whereas I would say that women feel the true weight of the thing immediately and after that it's a difficult event but not an unnatural one. Sometimes, of course, they crack up laughing--I mean the supposedly bereaved. You're just getting into your my-sad-duty routine and they're waking up the neighbors at three in the morning to pop a party.
California Texas Takeaway Only California states that Levi Strauss was a German Jewish immigrant. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Growth & Conflict, California, P. 416; McGraw-Hill, United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 417 California tells the story of Wong Kim Ark, whose 1898 Supreme Court case established birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants; Texas's edition, which is older, does not mention this case, but does cover the Chinese Exclusion Act.

No. I was happily married, and everybody in my paintings had to have a significant other. In the early work, there would be a lot of times when I would be counting how many men and how many women were in the pictures, so that everybody would have a mate.
This is about morals, said Steven Drahozal, the chair of the Dubuque County Democrats in Iowa. He said voters in Iowa, the critical early primary state, will actually appreciate a candidate who recognizes and acknowledges previous shortcomings. But he said Democratic candidates need to be acutely sensitive to those who in the past have been left behind. Not intending to offend is not an excuse,'' he said.
President Obama signed into law the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in 2009, which gave the Food and Drug Administration authority to fully regulate the sale of tobacco products.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has expressed support for such measures in the past, most recently last month, when he vowed to make an election overhaul a priority in the first 100 days of the new year. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo said the administration is hopeful that the voting package is the start of a range of reforms lawmakers pass this session.
That's why something like world data organization is so vital. When they had to join the W.T.O. [World Trade Organization], they realized this was going to be vital to their economic growth, so they're going to have to make some decisions and compromises in order to join the world order. We can create an analogous situation for data and technology and then use that to try and curb some of their worst abuses and behaviors. Now, is this going to happen in time to help Hong Kong? I certainly hope so. I mean, I certainly hope that they don't flood the streets of Hong Kong with troops any time in the next number of days or weeks.
I mean, that is what I heard. And one of the biggest things that I took out of all the videos that I watched and everything was the word de-escalation — that officers need to learn how to de-escalate. Valid points. But I guess to answer your question, I think I heard what the protesters were saying. I don't disagree with the protesters. I want everybody to be able to say and be able to tell their kid, when we're not there to protect you, that man in uniform is. Go to him. And at the end of the day, that's what we need to get to. That's why I became a cop.
KK: Have you spoken to Republican lawmakers about the Freedom Dividend?
Uber is literally advertising to schoolteachers saying, Hey, we've figured out schoolteachers make really good Uber drivers. And if you look at that situation, the headline unemployment rate says, Check, this person is employed. Heck, this person might be employed twice. The headline unemployment rate when Donald Trump was running for president, he castigated it as fake news, and then he got into office and all the sudden it became real news. He was right the first time. The number is almost intentionally designed to obscure any of the difficulties in the labor market. If I drop out of the labor market, I no longer count. I actually help the number.
A Times evaluation of Mr. Yang's tax plan by N. Gregory Mankiw, professor of economics at Harvard, found that Mr. Yang's tax plan would target the affluent who spend their money lavishly while incentivizing people to save.
Well to me, playing the relative benefit game, I mean of course in any large scale national program, it's you can't calibrate it precisely to everyone's individual situation. To me the test is more, is that person going to be better off tomorrow than they are today?
That too. I mean, it's rough. But I mean, New York's going through — I just want to bring some things to you from experience. Like yeah, the infrastructure breaking down. I mean, we're coasting on the investments made decades ago and they're starting to fall apart. But also what you all do in terms of journalism — I've been campaigning around the country and over 1,200 local papers have gone out of business because the local establishments that used to advertise are gone. All of their classified revenue went off to Craigslist and democracy works much less if you don't have local journalism.
Only in August, after it became known that Ms. Lewinsky had preserved a blue dress that provided evidence of their affair, did Clinton tell the nation and a grand jury that he had had an inappropriate relationship with her.
THE END: INSIDE THE LAST DAYS OF THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE 9 p.m. on CNN and CNN International; also streaming on CNN.com/go. CNN Films follows President Obama and members of his staff from shortly after Election Day through his farewell address, as they define their legacy after eight years and prepare for the transition of power. Among those interviewed are Mr. Obama; Valerie Jarrett, his closest adviser; Cody Keenan, his chief speechwriter; Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary; Jen Psaki, its communications director; and Angella Reid, its chief usher (the head of household staff). To watch this program is to be impressed with the magnitude of what will happen this week, Neil Genzlinger wrote in The New York Times.
Rhona Wurtele and her identical twin, Rhoda, began skiing at age 5 in the hilly Westmount neighborhood of Montreal. A few years later, they were ski-jumping, and in 1948 they were the only women named to Canada's Alpine skiing team at the Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland.
We need to let our historic allies know that our commitments are good, and that if we want to make a change, we want to do it in a way that's not pulling the rug out from under you but actually consultative. If we want other people to invest more, then we have to try and sit down with them and drive them to do so without questioning our commitment to NATO wholesale. But to me, trying to nickel-and-dime our relationships with our historic allies is not the best way forward. I think it was James Mattis that said that if you invest more in diplomacy, you have to invest less in ammunition, which should be the goal. So we need to make sure our partnerships and alliances are actually strong, stable and secure, and then we can put pressure on Russia and China with more of a global consensus, and maintain the international world order that's benefited us for decades that now is falling apart because Donald Trump is so erratic and unreliable, even with the people we've been allies with for decades.
A wedding is a one-shot celebration of tying the knot, but marriage is an open-ended practice of disentangling misunderstandings. I wish the newly engaged great happiness. I also wish that in between picking a caterer and a font for the invitations, they pause to think about how they fight, and how they want to talk.
My recollection from watching the video and the —
At the same time, though, and here I will quote Grofman at length:
Mary Catherine Bateson, a cultural anthropologist who was the author of quietly groundbreaking books on women's lives — and who as the only child of Margaret Mead had once been one of the most famous babies in America — died on Jan. 2 in Lebanon, N.H. She was 81.
President Obama signed into law the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in 2009, which gave the Food and Drug Administration authority to fully regulate the sale of tobacco products.
While they had been preceded a decade earlier by pioneers like Marlene Sanders, Ms. Chase and her contemporaries were members of a freshman class still more concerned with getting into broadcast news on the ground floor than worried about being passed over for promotion later on because of a glass ceiling.
I mean, you could make it so it's analogous to what happened in the tobacco industry, where there's a certain level of revenue that gets set aside and then you have various public service announcements.
My father was married twice before I was born, once to a woman I met much later and once to my mother. When he asked me to speak in August at the reception of his third wedding, I believed it something I was incapable of doing: What could a son say about marriage to a father who had divorced twice, seeming to treat love as though it were seasonal?
But once Siegmund (here the veteran tenor Simon O'Neill), seeking shelter in a hut, chances upon the fearful young Sieglinde (the radiant soprano Heidi Melton), Wagner's music turns mysterious and quietly suspenseful. The isolated Siegmund and beaten-down Sieglinde, who is trapped in a marriage to the bullying Hunding, look at each other longingly. In fact, they are twins, separated since their early childhood. And during these passages Mr. van Zweden's performance often went slack.
Her remarks came the day after the House — with support from 10 Republicans — impeached the president on a single charge of incitement of insurrection, and as Republicans faced the prospect of a trial that could begin as soon as next week. Republicans were racing to gauge the political dynamics of a vote to convict Mr. Trump, which would open the door to disqualifying him from holding office in the future. Most of them kept their powder dry publicly, but were privately struggling to reconcile their own disdain for the leader they supported loyally for years and their fear of a backlash from a political base more devoted to Mr. Trump than any other party figure. Though few Republicans had gone on record in such stinging terms, Ms. Murkowski was not alone in breaking from the president. Senators Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania and Susan Collins of Maine had spoken out harshly against Mr. Trump, leaving colleagues to speculate that they could vote to convict him and bar him from ever holding office again. Even Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, indicated to colleagues that he was undecided about whether to convict Mr. Trump, and privately told advisers he approved of the impeachment drive and believed it could help the party purge Mr. Trump.
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — The ancient cemetery of Makli, near the city of Thatta in Sindh Province, is one of the largest necropolises in the world, so rich in monuments that UNESCO declared it a World Heritage site.
Ms. Culp, 38, a Los Angeles-based freelance writer and producer, recalled suffering from jet lag that day as she had flown home two days earlier from Shanghai, where she spent a decade living and working as a journalist, art curator and consultant. She wrote for The South China Morning Post, and served as a consultant for cultural projects and institutions. I read his book and thought, 'Wow, this guy is an amazing writer,' said Ms. Culp, who graduated from Yale.
The decision underscores a year in which Virginia and the rest of the United States grappled with both implicit biases and overt images of white supremacy, leading to Confederate monuments and other symbols of racism being removed from public spaces.
Women are stepping up together, loudly and publicly, writes Schaefer, a journalist whose subjects have ranged from the Korean beauty industry to the occult. It seems the world is finally recognizing the power of female connection, which the poet Adrienne Rich once described as the most feared, the most problematic and the most potentially transforming force on the planet.
Always described as laid back and an eternal optimist by those who knew him, he was now quick to anger, especially when his things weren't where he expected them to be. A once successful and busy urban planner, he could no longer do professional work, nor could he keep pace with carpenters or handymen, jobs he had excelled at previously.
Listening to the tape, we have no idea what this means.
Doris has two things left in life. One is her weekly Skype visit with her American great-niece, Jenny, a married mother of three. The other is the memoir she is writing, prompted by names in the red address book given to her by the father she lost as a child: All the names that come and go. That rip our hearts to pieces and make us shed tears. That become lovers or enemies. The address book may wear a bit thin as a literary device, but each name unlocks a new adventure.

Early on the morning of Nov. 12, 1958, George Whitmore, Warren Harding and Wayne Merry accomplished something many climbers considered unthinkable: They reached the top of El Capitan.
The sisters, who called themselves the Flying Twins, did not win an Olympic medal, but they often finished first or second in Canadian and American ski championship events in the 1940s and early '50s. They also taught thousands of Canadians to ski in a half-century as instructors.
Before the six of them — damaged and desperate — shoehorn into Miranda's Chevette and head up to West Virginia in time for Jodi's first appointment with her parole officer, Jodi tells Ricky, Whatever you want for a new life, bring it here with you in the morning. But the new life they're all fleeing toward is harsh, and its margins so tight that a welfare benefits card counts as a major asset.
KIDS 'N COMEDY at the Gotham Comedy Club (Jan. 22, 1 p.m.). This is the annual New Year's Resolution Show, and you know there's at least one vow these teenage and tween comics are dedicated to keeping: to be funny. Their stand-up routines, however, will examine all those broken promises that start accumulating right about now. Although the material is intended for audience members 9 and older, the show rules prohibit profanity (but not politics).
Ranchera, traditional Mexican country music, often features wistful love ballads or boisterous paeans to places in Mexico and Texas.

What would you want to accomplish in the first 100 days?
Senna might be flighty, but she is always grounded by Ms. Stone, who understands that this is a character that ought to be sold through presence, not performance. Her portrayal here is all ease and glowing smiles — she is a femme fatale reborn as a family-friendly comedian.
Floating over the narrative of Red Clocks, too, is the figure of Eivor Minervudottir, the subject of Ro's biography. This Arctic explorer's fierce yet cool interest in the natural world provides Zumas's suggested answer to the question: What is a woman when she is by herself? If, as Virginia Woolf posited, a woman must have … a room of her own — and, one is tempted to add, a womb of her own — to be able to create, then why are we so fearful of what nonsexual, nonreproductive passions could emerge from female solitude? And, if Minervudottir's tale never quite coheres, never quite touches the rest of the book, then her very ice-floe remoteness becomes a stark reminder of our society's detachment from a world in which a woman could simply and happily be left alone.
So, and I know The New York Times, I mean you've had your issues with Facebook and the rest of it, and they made a change and then all sorts of things happen.
Freshwater builds slowly, but that only crystallizes how fractured Ada and her personalities are. As the voices in her head get louder and grow hungrier, the story gains momentum. Only when Ada looks to her roots is there hope that she will wrest back control from her tormentors. For both the reader and Ada, that comes as a revelation, if not quite a relief.
The police said they had searched for human remains at a hole found at the Windsor Rod and Gun Club in East Granby, Conn., which Mr. Mawhinney helped establish.
But here she must have been underplaying her ambition, so spectacular was the second act that followed (achieved at fourth-act age). Athill was under no illusion that she would be celebrated for her work as an editor: We must always remember that we are only midwives — if we want praise for progeny we must give birth to our own. And so she did, writing novels, essays and nonfiction with the kind of 9-to-5 work ethic she'd once shown in the office of the publisher André Deutsch. She quickly found her subject: romance in its many forms. In Stet, it was a romance with words. In Yesterday Morning, with memories of childhood. In After a Funeral, it was a love lost to depression, her partner ending his life violently in Athill's home, an act she treated with her signature lack of fanfare. She used A Florence Diary to describe every inch of the Italian city as happily as a tween with a thesaurus. She made peace with love's dark demise in Instead of a Letter, in which she admits frankly that an early broken engagement has left her with a fear of lasting intimacy. She had love affair after love affair, including a brief but soul-expanding dalliance with the Black Panther Hakim Jamal (a man who'd also had a high-profile relationship with the actress Jean Seberg before the murder of his next girlfriend by his fellow Panthers, and who later was murdered himself).
What do you make of the homicidal misogyny of Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), in which Martin Landau murders his inconvenient mistress, played by Anjelica Huston? (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers does the same to Scarlett Johansson more than 15 years later in Match Point.) Does the philosophical despair that surrounds it offer an explanation or an excuse for amorality? Whose? What about the almost-romance between Mr. Allen's character in Husbands and Wives and a 21-year-old college student, the failure of which causes the man to regret ruining his marriage to a woman played by Ms. Farrow? Is the regret a pre-emptive attempt at apology? An act of denial? Completely irrelevant?
Labor force participation — the share of Americans either employed or actively looking for work — declined precipitously from the late 1990s, dropping to 62.7 percent in 2014 (its lowest rate since the Carter administration). Critics of President Obama liked to argue that this was because of government handouts. But there's a counterargument to be found in demographic trends — the Congressional Budget Office estimates that a sizable portion of the decline in labor-force participation is a result of the aging of the work force.
After watching his comedy, I felt that he wasn't a malignant racist and that his slur toward me was just very, very bad comedy run amok. Which did not strike me as a fireable offense, and I realized that if I was the individual who was actually directly slurred, and I did not feel that he should lose his job over it, then I should probably share that sentiment with other people.

Whether I was at a rehabilitation center in Utah; a military academy in Pennsylvania where I had asked my parents to send me post-9/11 when I was too young to enlist but eager to serve; a stifling hotel room in Miami; an unfurnished condominium in Juneau; or a rundown apartment complex in Savannah, my father would drive or fly to see me, sometimes for only a few short hours.

A 2016 study from the economists Lawrence Katz at Harvard and Alan Krueger at Princeton found that 94 percent of net job growth between 2005 and 2015 was alternative work, including independent contractors, freelancers and temps.
He also called for a public health jobs program that would address his goals of bolstering the economy and the coronavirus response while also rebuilding the nation's public health infrastructure.

If these are your measurements, then of course you're going to think things are going in one direction, while your way of life disintegrates. Even the inventor of G.D.P., Simon Kuznets, said 100 years ago, this is a terrible measurement of national well-being, and we should never use it as that.

Mr. Newsom, 51, had been the state's lieutenant governor — largely a ceremonial position — for eight years under Mr. Brown. Before that, he served as mayor of San Francisco, where he positioned himself, for the most part, on the liberal side of the spectrum. He was an early promoter of same-sex marriage and the legalization of recreational marijuana.

And not intimidating--or only as intimidating as the brilliant-beautiful can't help being, no matter how accessible they seem. She had it all and she had it all, and then she had some more. Her dad's a cop. Her considerably older brothers are cops--both with Chicago PD, Area Six. Jennifer was not a cop. She was an astrophysicist, here at Mount Lee. Guys? She combed them out of her hair, and played the field at CSU. But for the last--Christ, I don't know--seven or eight years, it must be, she was shacked up with another bigbrain and dreamboat: Trader. Professor Trader Faulkner. This was definitely not a yeah-right suicide. This was a no-wrong suicide.
Listening to the tape, we have no idea what this means.
But when King was asked about Court's name on the arena, she said: I know it's not as easy as people think, but I personally don't think she should have her name anymore. I think if you were talking about indigenous people, Jews or any other people, I can't imagine the public would want somebody to have their name on something. Maybe because of our community, the L.G.B.T.I.Q. community, people might feel differently. But we're all God's children. We are all God's children, so I probably don't think it's appropriate to have her name.
Here's what else you need to know today.
I also bring to this book a unique perspective informed by my experiences growing out of the publication of Chutzpah five years ago. Since that time, I have spoken to well over 100,000 Jews in nearly every city with a significant Jewish population, not only in this country but throughout the world. The talk is usually preceded by a social hour and followed by a question period. I estimate that I have been asked more than a thousand questions by concerned Jews. I have received more than ten thousand letters and phone calls from Jewish men, women, and children. I have also been teaching young students, many of them Jewish, for a third of a century. I have served as faculty adviser to the Harvard Jewish Law Students Association, have been an active participant in Hillel, and have spoken to Jewish student groups at many colleges and universities around the world. Over these years, I have discussed virtually every Jewish issue--from God to intermarriage to Israel to anti-Semitism to Jewish feminism--with thousands of students. These questions, letters, calls, and discussions have given me an extraordinary window into the fears, hopes, and beliefs of a wide assortment of Jews. It has been quite an education. I think I understand what is on the minds and in the souls of many Jews, of all ages, and I try to address myself to these concerns in this book.
Of America's Nobel Prize winners in science and economics, nearly 40 percent have been Jews. Of America's 200 most influential intellectuals, half are full Jews, and 76 percent have at least one Jewish parent. Jews attend Ivy League colleges at ten times their presence in the general population. It is no wonder that so many non-Jews believe that we constitute so much higher a percentage of the American population than we actually do. Jews today are equal in virtually every way that matters. What could not have been said even at the end of the 1980s can be said today: American Jews are part of the American mainstream; we are truly victims no more.
On gender and sexuality, California textbooks include history that is not in Texas editions. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Growth & Conflict, California, P. 624 California states that the federal government failed to recognize nonbinary gender identities and female leaders in its early relations with Native Americans. McGraw-Hill, United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 111 Texas does not mention gender roles or gender identity in its discussion of efforts to Americanize Native Americans.

In Connecticut, we had four-acre zoning, lots of wildlife, no neighbors, Ms. Maly said. We would have to drive somewhere to go trick-or-treating. And we would come to Balboa Island for eight weeks every summer, where the kids would have so much freedom.
But now we've had 20 years of a very strong pontificate. I think we're at a new era, and these men represent it. Among liberal Catholics, including liberal priests -- many of whom regard John Paul II as authoritarian and reactionary -- there is the perception that new seminarians like those at Mount St. Mary's are rigid and narrow-minded, merely parroting the Pope's views without learning to think for themselves. Certainly there is a passionate devotion to the Pope among the men of Mount St. Mary's. They often quote him -- in particular the phrase, Be not afraid. Bashista put it this way: We're the John Paul II generation. That's a great sign of hope. But at the gallery, the seminarians scrutinized Medieval and Renaissance paintings with a feverish -- and sometimes wistful -- attention to the past, a past that still pertains directly to their lives. Raphael Hall, 42, one of five seminarians at Mount St. Mary's from the Franciscan Missionaries of the Eternal Word in Birmingham, Ala., moved about the gallery in a brown Franciscan habit, the beads of a long wooden rosary clicking softly from his cord belt as he searched for works by Fra Angelico, a 15th-century Franciscan painter who would have dressed almost identically. There were chalices and vestments on display -- the very items that Bashista and the other deacons were in the process of choosing before their ordinations.
If ever I can find some healing and some comfort — it has to be with somebody who is not part of all my world of past and pain, she wrote. I can find that now — if the world will let us.

In addition to The Fall of Lucifer, which, considering the execution time required, was probably commissioned, Rauwaert owned at least 15 paintings by Cornelis, including two other major canvases: Two Followers of Cadmus Devoured by a Dragon (1588) and Hercules and Achelous (1590). The Dragon — which occasioned a magnificent engraving based on its design by Goltzius, his first collaboration with Cornelis, dedicated to their patron — portrays the dreadful beast sinking its teeth into the face of one chap and its claws into the meaty, decapitated body of another. It doesn't look like he's being devoured, said Aaron Hyman, assistant professor of art history at Johns Hopkins University, when I remarked on the painting's sadistic relish. It's more like he's being tortured. In Rauwaert's third important Cornelis painting, Hercules and Achelous, the hero is seen grasping the horn of a river god that has taken the form of a bull.
Alex Tizon, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter whose well-received 2014 memoir documented his insecurities and alienation as a Filipino-American, was found dead on March 23 in his home in Eugene, Ore. He was 57.
TV, etcetera, has had a terrible effect on perpetrators. It has given them style. And TV has ruined American juries for ever. And American lawyers. But TV has also fucked up us police. No profession has been so massively fictionalized. I had a bunch of great lines ready. Like: I was quit when you came in here. I'm twice as quit now. But this was Colonel Tom I was talking to. So I spoke the plain truth.

We must recognize that many of the factors which have fueled current assimilation and intermarriage are positive developments for individual Jews: acceptance, wealth, opportunity. Most Jews do not want to impede these developments. Indeed, they want to encourage them. For that reason, we must accept the reality that many Jews will continue to marry non-Jews, but we should not regard it as inevitable that these marriages will necessarily lead to total assimilation. We can take positive steps to stem that tide--but it will take a change in attitude toward mixed marriages, and indeed toward the tribalism that has understandably characterized Jewish attitudes toward outsiders for so much of our history.
I was in Daytona Beach at the Daytona Playhouse. I walked in because I had some extra time. I was traveling at the time. And I was on a motorcycle, and I had to stay for the winter. So I walked in and said, do you need some help backstage — assistant stage manager or props or something? And the person said, Well, have you acted before? I said, Yeah. And he goes, OK, you're in the show. Apparently, the Kralahome in The King and I had just dropped out, and I was instantly cast as the king's right-hand man. And I had body paint on me every day, and I had this purple eye shadow that stretched the eyes, very politically incorrect. So a friend of mine said, you could put a little thin layer of Vaseline on your eyelids before the makeup, and then the makeup comes off easy. Otherwise, you're left with a pink tint, and you're walking around town all day with pink eyeshadow. And so I said, oh, OK. So I put a layer of Vaseline on, but I didn't know how much. Apparently, I put on too much. So near the end of the play, just as the king is dying — spoiler alert for anybody who didn't see King and I — just as the king is dying and the Kralahome, my character, is hunched over him and distraught about his king dying, I couldn't help it anymore.
The United States had a civil war over slavery in the 19th century and a continuous history of structural racism and white oligarchical rule until the 1960s, and in many aspects until the present. Europe lacks this legacy.
Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House of Commons, wrote a letter to Mr. Hunt last week challenging the repayment policy. Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee are deeply concerned that victims may be forced to pay for their own rescue or, worse, may be dissuaded from asking for help if they have not got the funds, it said.
Roy J. Glauber, a theoretical physicist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2005 for using quantum theory to explain the field of optics and how light interacts with matter, laying the foundation for the field of quantum optics, died on Dec. 26 in Newton, Mass. He was 93.
His stepson John Oppenheimer said the cause was kidney failure.
As a police? As a police I have to say that it looks like a suicide, Colonel Tom. But it could have been an accident. There was the rag there, and the 303. You think maybe she was cleaning it and...
This week's episode was Pizzolatto's inauspicious debut as director, though the problems here are mostly with the script, which is credited to him and David Milch, the trailblazing showrunner of Deadwood and NYPD Blue. It's impossible to say how much influence Milch wielded, but many of Pizzolatto's weaknesses are on display here: grossly overwritten dialogue, a leaden understanding of domestic relationships and a tendency to brood alongside his characters.
While many Americans may be able to relate to growing up in a conservative home, my story is a little different because my father was very outspoken, she said. He was an activist who was fighting against gay rights and marriage equality in Hawaii, and at the time I forcefully defended him and his cause.

That party, on the eve of a day that would end parties for a long time, was given for Billy Collins, the popular poet. He was one of countless writers celebrated in the storied East 72nd Street home that had also once housed the cramped offices of The Paris Review, founded in 1953 by Mr. Plimpton, Peter Matthiessen, William Styron and others. The offices of the magazine moved downtown years ago, but embedded memories from the old glory days live on.
Court packing isn't a violation of any part of the Constitution, but it is widely debated with critics pointing out that it would trigger severe political backlash.

Eleanor Torrey West, who dedicated her life to preserving Ossabaw Island, a 26,000-acre inheritance off the coast of Georgia so large, lush and varied in terrain that visitors could walk among hardwood forests, palm tree stands and salt water marshes, died on Jan. 17 at her home in Savannah. She was 108.
Oh, you might not want to push the money to the states and then have them determine how to use it in their budgets. You could empower a national program or an agency to help administer it at the federal level, if you didn't trust the states to actually use it in the right way.
While reading the best scholarly history of Alexander the Great and his father Philip II, By the Spear, by Ian Worthington, I learned the word cynic derived from the Greek for doglike because Diogenes and the Cynics lived on the streets, urinating, defecating and sleeping like dogs … When Alexander visited Diogenes he asked if he could do anything for him. Diogenes replied Yes, get out of my sunlight. A very sensible hint as to how we should treat celebrities and politicians.

I mean, what I would love to see is law enforcement go to anybody that's willing to represent the Black community and have that conversation. What do you feel we're doing? And then we tell them, here's what we're actually doing. Now, how can we bring you, the community, to us and we meet in the middle? Is it that we need more social workers to where a police officer isn't acting like a social worker? Do we need to get more financing towards where we can make a phone call — we being the police — to say, I need a psychiatrist here. And instead of them saying, well, we've got to find somebody, it's going to take two or three hours, because we don't have the money to put anybody there. Or, can it be, yeah, we've got a person on call. They'll be there in 10 minutes. So now we can stand by and wait for them, and then they can take over that mental health aspect, that child protection thing. We are asked to do a myriad of things that are socially driven. And what I would rather see, like I was talking about having the ability to have a social worker on call.

ALL AMERICAN STORIES 8 p.m. on the CW. The life of the football linebacker Spencer Paysinger was the inspiration for the CW sports drama series All American. Paysinger co-hosts this documentary special, which profiles eight athletes who have overcome extraordinary circumstances in their own lives — including the Paralympic sprinter and long jumper Scout Bassett, the Olympic champion shot-putter Michelle Carter and the Paralympic sprinter David Brown. The special is divided into two hourlong parts (the second airs Feb. 1).
THE IMPROVISED SHAKESPEARE COMPANY at the 92nd Street Y (April 7, 7:30 p.m.). This Chicago-based improv group creates an impromptu Shakespearean masterpiece from the ground up at every performance. Based on an audience-suggested title, the costumed improvisers weave a play in the complex, often rhyming language of 17th-century British theater, complete with spontaneous songs. The cast includes the show's creator and director, Blaine Swen; Joey Bland; Thomas Middleditch; Ross Bryant; and Steve Waltien.
California's curriculum materials, by contrast, sometimes read like a brief from a Bernie Sanders rally. The yawning gap between the haves and have-nots and what is to be done about it is one of the great questions of this time, says the state's 2016 social studies framework.
Ms. Meng's fate throughout what has turned into a long extradition process has soured views toward the United States. Chinese officials have portrayed her as an innocent victim of a highly politicized case to damage the company.
The cause was nonalcoholic cirrhosis, her husband, Stephen Schaefer, said.

With a sex scandal now consuming one of their own, the House's impeachment debate turned more than ever into a discourse on sin and morality in politics.
Dr. Twist, who also runs a clinical practice in family and sex therapy, said she has had several patients in their 20s and 30s who qualify as second-wave digisexuals.

To the short list of television shows focused on prostitution — Hung, Secret Diary of a Call Girl, The Girlfriend Experience — add Harlots, an eight-episode British costume extravaganza that started this week on Hulu. If the cool minimalism of Steven Soderbergh's Girlfriend Experience isn't your thing, then the strenuously theatrical Harlots (keywords bawdy and voluptuous) might be more your speed.

There was much speculation of a romantic attachment. A few months later, Mr. Ormsby Gore, a former British ambassador to Washington, proposed marriage. She turned him down.
archived recording (paul howard) It is the same criticism we have had in every police case, particularly no matter how important the case was. The more important or significant the case, the more the accusation was that it was political. This is nothing new.
Recent Bollywood movies have tried out, hesitantly and conservatively, versions of the Modern Woman: Heroines can have careers; they can live alone in the big city; they can even (if very rarely) have sex before marriage.
We need to modernize the court. Lifetime appointments might have made sense at one point a long time ago, but when the Constitution was drafted, people did not live as long. And also, people stepped down from the Supreme Court for any of a range of reasons. They did not wait until they were at death's door. This is not a way to run a 21st-century society.
In each area, Mr. Lau exceeded Ms. Chau's expectations. He proudly identified as a practicing Christian and candidly shared his spiritual journey; he received a bachelor's in economics and a bachelor's in international relations from the University of Pennsylvania. He also received an M.B.A. from the University of California Berkeley, and a master's in computer information systems from Boston University. For Mr. Lau, 35, the couple's shared roots in Hong Kong were also important: It comes with a lot of cultural language, the little ways we talk about things in Cantonese.

These papers and transcripts were put together piecemeal over a period of four weeks. I apologize also for any inconsistencies in the tenses (hard to avoid, when writing about the recently dead) and for the informalities in the dialogue presentation. And I guess I apologize for the outcome. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Well first of all, it's enthralled and riveted the country —
The story recurs, with even more tragic consequences, on the eve of the Holocaust. Another great Eastern European rabbi, Elchanan Wasserman--the dean of the Rabbinical College in Baranowitz, Poland--was invited to bring his entire student body and faculty to Yeshiva College in New York or to the Beis Medrish Letorah in Chicago, both distinguished Orthodox rabbinical colleges. He declined the invitations because they are both places of spiritual danger, for they are run in a spirit of freethinking. The great rabbi reasoned, What would one gain to escape physical danger in order to then confront spiritual danger? Rabbi Wasserman, his family, his students, and their teachers remained in Poland, where they were murdered by the Nazis.
When the prosecutors appealed, they argued, with a straight face, that what had happened to J.T. was so outrageous and illegal that the New Orleans district attorney could not be held responsible. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court.
The day he said he wanted to marry me, there was sand in the sheets from our day at the beach, but then I remembered (though I wanted to forget it) how that night my body had said no.
So the Shane Gillis opinion was not based upon the timeline, it was just based upon my reaction as a person, and the person that was directly named. I certainly think there should be consequences for one's statements and actions, and I certainly think that obviously he made the statements within the year, and that if you did have some sort of time frame when you would want to overlook something, it would be much longer than a year.

Mr. Yang has proposed what he describes as a W.T.O. for data and has argued that data ownership should be made a property right. Some argue that such an organization could enable more partnership among countries in setting standards for artificial intelligence and data.
We do our sons no favors when we tell them that they don't have to answer that voice inside them that tells them to be strong, to be brave, and to lead. We do them no favors when we let them abandon the quest to become a grown man when that quest gets hard. Yes, we do them no favors when we're not sensitive to those boys who don't conform to traditional masculinity, but when it comes to the crisis besetting our young men, traditional masculinity isn't the problem; it can be part of the cure.

Benjamin Liptzin, 75, who graduated magna cum laude from Yale, noticed the ad in the November 2017 alumni issue, but he didn't respond until six months later. He had been caring for his wife Sharon of 50 years, who had Alzheimer's.
On top of that, in the United States.
That's why something like world data organization is so vital. When they had to join the W.T.O. [World Trade Organization], they realized this was going to be vital to their economic growth, so they're going to have to make some decisions and compromises in order to join the world order. We can create an analogous situation for data and technology and then use that to try and curb some of their worst abuses and behaviors. Now, is this going to happen in time to help Hong Kong? I certainly hope so. I mean, I certainly hope that they don't flood the streets of Hong Kong with troops any time in the next number of days or weeks.
So for a high school graduate in America to get by, if you have one health problem or car breakdown, it can take a very tenuous financial situation and send it in a downward spiral. Then how do you put food on the table? In theory, there are nonprofits and food pantries that would see to this, but we all know that they're dramatically underresourced relative to the need. And so when you look at the causes of food poverty, to me the best solution is instead of trying to create organizations that will put food into people's hands, which we should do obviously, we should just put money into Americans' hands and then they would be able to procure food to provide for themselves and their families.

I haven't sat down with a lot of sitting senators and congressmen and women, but I've talked to literally thousands of people who supported Donald Trump in the last election who say they are now supporting me. I've talked to many folks who are Republicans who say they are, at least, sympathetic to my message, in large part because they understand the numbers. When I talked to 70 C.E.O.s here in New York City, not that far from here, it was a fancy bank office, most of them were Republicans. I said, How many of you are looking at replacing your back-office clerical workers with artificial intelligence and software? Guess how many hands went up out of 70. All of them. The truth is, you should fire any C.E.O. who was not looking to make that happen, because their incentives are all tied to the bottom-line profitability of their firm. And most of them were Republicans. So they understand the need for what I am proposing.
BS: The New Yorker cartoon. They had a secretary with like a floppy disk. With her glasses pulled down and her fingers crossed.
A wedding is a one-shot celebration of tying the knot, but marriage is an open-ended practice of disentangling misunderstandings. I wish the newly engaged great happiness. I also wish that in between picking a caterer and a font for the invitations, they pause to think about how they fight, and how they want to talk.
Serge Schmemann: Yeah. And staying with relationships and alliances, President Trump has reversed several key policies the United States has had toward Israel. He's moved the embassy to Jerusalem, he's recognized sovereignty over the Golan Heights, et cetera, et cetera. Would you reverse those?
KK: So I want to move on. We have some more personal questions for you.
The legislation was not published until July, after the mass registration exercise had ended — a move that Justice Nyamweya said was contrary to principles of democratic governance and rule of law.
There is no safe option. And that is starting to feel especially risky.
Bob Kuechenberg, a six-time Pro Bowl guard in the National Football League, two-time Super Bowl champion and member of the only N.F.L. team to achieve a perfect season, the 1972 Miami Dolphins, died on Saturday at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 71.
At one point, Simeen wonders why it's unacceptable for three people to openly love each other. It's an interesting thought, one that poses a fresh conceptual question about marriage and love. But the power dynamics among the characters aren't sufficiently developed to dramatize that question convincingly. As for the status of her husband, Nirveen, in the triangle, Simeen says: He'd say, 'Jump.' We'd ask, 'How high?' He was dying. We were not. It was that simple. Was it? Such simplicity, even if plausible, forecloses on some of the complexity that could help bring the novel to life.
KK: I think Mara's going to kick you off.
Here's another example: Teenagers in both states will learn about the Harlem Renaissance and debates about the movement's impact on African-American life.
There are still those would insist on the last answer, which has been a critical shibboleth for a very long time. And so it may remain. The argument about Woody Allen is far from finished. Critical neurosis may not be curable. But it is useful to remind ourselves, via Freud, of what clinging to it can cost. Neurosis, he wrote, involves the flight from an unsatisfying reality into a more pleasurable world of fantasy. The real world, he went on, is under the sway of human society and of the institutions collectively created by it. To turn away from reality is at the same time to withdraw from the community of man.
The proposal would temporarily increase the size of two tax credits in a manner that would effectively provide more cash from the government to low-income workers and families.
In a year that has been described as a women's renaissance, female friendship feels particularly worthy of contemplation. As professional opportunities broaden and cultural attitudes shift, competition between women has given way to allyship. Through the return of women's social organizations and the formalization of whisper networks, female solidarity is more pervasive than ever, a byproduct of girl power and the cumulation of years of quiet rebellion.
Six new paperbacks to check out this week.
Let me ask you, then, so I can get it with a big role. So LBJ, all the others, this recent one and Your Honor and Breaking Bad, those are all top numbers, I'm assuming. But I want you to explain how you scored these roles, if you don't mind, if you'll indulge me — Rear Admiral Lyle Haggerty in Contagion, ramrod straight — by the way, prescient.
The season starts strong, purring like a well-tuned Ducati, and a stand-alone episode portraying Ciro's temporary exile in Bulgaria (following further gunplay at the end of Season 2) is a prime example of the show's moody, violent romanticism. The energy runs out around the fifth episode, though — the protestations of brotherhood start to sound rehearsed, and the inevitable web of betrayals and bloodshed feels engineered, more outcome-based than character-based. The soundtrack by Mokadelic, with its sensation of a constantly gathering storm, is called on to supply emotion rather than reinforce it. With any luck, Season 4 (almost three years old at this point) will arrive soon and make things better. (HBO Max, Thursday.)
You can build it around the town library, because a lot of them have this bulletin board that serves as the skeleton of a local paper when the local paper has gone out of business. A lot of these papers would be able to get by if they did not have to generate stock market level returns for hedge fund owners and private equity owners. If you had a cooperative model and it's made a certain amount of money, spent a certain amount of money, ran as a nonprofit, you could restore and sustain local journalism and thousands of communities, but it will not happen without government support. It just won't.
In hindsight, this was not an accurate assessment of the next question.
President Franklin Roosevelt tried to advance a court-packing strategy to ensure favorable rulings on New Deal legislation. He wanted to appoint up to six additional justices, one for every justice older than 70 years. The plan was unpopular in Congress and among the Supreme Court's justices.
So, and I know The New York Times, I mean you've had your issues with Facebook and the rest of it, and they made a change and then all sorts of things happen.
The most powerful proponent of far-reaching changes, Gov. Gavin Newsom, is threatening a state takeover if the giant utility fails to reshape itself to his liking. With a key deadline approaching in PG&E's bankruptcy case, the question is whether he is prepared to follow through — and what consequences could follow.

Would you like to play Donald Trump?
Proust's mother was pregnant with him during the Franco-Prussian War and the difficult aftermath of France's defeat, the period when Napoleon III was chased from the throne and a socialist commune was briefly declared in Paris before the Third Republic was at last established. During the months of war and the internecine street fighting, coal and wood supplies ran out and houses went unheated. In Paris the starving populace ate dogs and cats, even the animals in the zoo. As a result, Jeanne Proust was so weakened from hunger and anxiety that when Marcel was born he was sickly and fragile and at first not expected to live.
Ms. McGuire's family confirmed her death in a statement released on Friday. No cause was given.
Our economy is breaking down on all levels. Again, if you are fortunate enough to graduate from college today, you're in the top third of the population, you're graduating with tens of thousands in school loans very, very often, and there's a 40 to 44 percent chance you're going to do a job that does not require your college degree. That's if you're one of the winners in our society today. I spent seven years working with, frankly, some of the top educational products in our country. I saw that even the winners are not winning right now. And so imagine if you're a nonwinner, what this looks like.
Instead, you made a pragmatic call about the best way to deal with his ex-wife. (You rationalize it still, and I may agree with you.) But deciding how to interact with his ex, early in your marriage, was mostly your husband's call. You robbed him of that choice, probably accidentally, but you seem not to have acknowledged your mistake.
While other teams in the N.F.L. were scrambling to make deals on Thursday, the first day of free agency, the Washington Redskins announced that they had fired their general manager.
Right now we have three flagship numbers we're beating the American people over the head with, telling them that things are going great. No. 1, the headline unemployment rate. No. 2, gross domestic product, which is obviously putting up record highs even as our life expectancy is declining. And No. 3, corporate profits and shareholder value. Stock market prices correspond to the fortunes of the top 20 percent of Americans, many of the people, obviously, who live here in Manhattan. The bottom 80 percent of Americans own 8 percent of stock market value. The bottom 50 percent own essentially zero.

Raskin, lead impeachment prosecutor, says Trump is guilty of 'the most serious presidential crime' in U.S. history. Representative Jamie Raskin, center, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi at a meeting of House impeachment managers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times Representative Jamie Raskin, the Maryland Democrat who will lead the prosecution of President Trump in a Senate trial, vigorously defended the impeachment effort on Sunday, arguing that Mr. Trump needed to be held accountable even after he leaves office for his role in inciting a mob of loyalists that culminated in a deadly riot and the first occupation of the Capitol in two centuries. This was the most serious presidential crime in the history of the United States of America — the most dangerous crime by a president ever committed against the United States, Mr. Raskin, a constitutional law professor, said on CNN's State of the Union. Everything is due to his actions. Mr. Raskin took on the high-profile role of lead impeachment manager this month soon after burying his 25-year-old son, Tommy, who died by suicide on New Year's Eve. I'm not going to lose my son at the end of 2020 and lose my country and my republic in 2021, Mr. Raskin told CNN's Jake Tapper, as he delivered a heartfelt eulogy. Another of the nine impeachment managers, Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, said on ABC's This Week that the team would not need much lead time to move forward with a Senate trial.
Hughes's book begins with the prehistoric substrata, delving with curiously gripping detail into layers of settlement archaeologists have only recently unearthed. She begins with the discovery of the world's oldest wooden coffin, under the Yenikapi metro station, containing an 8,000-year-old woman whose fellow villagers even left their footprints in the ancient mud. And so, right from the start, we are confronted with a vastly larger sense of time than that in which the city is usually conceived. Moreover, Hughes also establishes just how deep the Greek roots of the settlement called Byzantion went, and how heterogenous the Hellenic frontier town of the seventh century B.C. probably was. She has a fine feel for the complexities and shadings of that distant past.
An article on Sunday about the impact that the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran might have on the fight against ISIS referred incorrectly to the American whose death helped precipitate the Trump administration's strike on General Suleimani. The American was a civilian contractor, not a soldier.
Nominations are made by an independent council and approved by the governor general. Hundreds of Australians receive the Order of Australia every year, and it has four tiers. The Companion award is the highest tier, and it is bestowed on only a handful of people each year. In 2020, just five people received it.
Even after people leave religions where they have suffered abuse, they can still harbor the emotional conviction that they are basically sinful and wrong, says Marlene Winell, a human development expert who coined the term religious trauma syndrome in a series of articles in 2011.

Over the top? Maybe. But the new, alarming truth is that I didn't care. At all.
Just when you think Phillauri is becoming a Ghost Town- or Topper-type romp, it switches gears, as Shashi imparts her own past. Flash back to almost a century ago, when she was a poet, secretly submitting verse to a newspaper under an assumed name. When she meets another poet, Phillauri (Diljit Dosanjh), a dashing ne'er-do-well, they fall into a love forbidden by Shashi's pious brother. It's painful to witness the script's transformation of Shashi at that point from a hardheaded freethinker into a lovelorn obsessive. But things become worse for her: The abuses of British rule — specifically the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, in Amritsar, Punjab, in 1919 — lead to a dire personal loss.
MC: So, and we are currently enjoying a businessmen president who has no experience in government or the military. What is your argument to people, that we should trust you with no experience in government and the military, in the same position, and that you will do a better job dealing with the peculiarities of Washington.
Los estudios muestran que una de las mejores maneras de cambiar el comportamiento y formar un nuevo hábito es unirlo con un comportamiento existente, lo que en la ciencia de la formación de hábitos se llama acumulación. Es la razón por la que los médicos, por ejemplo, sugieren tomar un nuevo medicamento al mismo tiempo que nos cepillamos los dientes o tomamos café por la mañana: es más probable que recuerdes tomar tu píldora cuando la unes a un hábito existente. Añadir pasos a tu recorrido diario es a menudo una mejor manera de añadir ejercicio a tu día que tratar de establecer un tiempo separado para una caminata diaria.
The plot of Bruning's epic is straightforward. In 1942, Gen. George Kenney, the newly minted commander of the Fifth Air Force in New Guinea, found himself stuck with possibly the worst command position of the war. At the end of a long supply chain, plagued by weird tropical bugs and diseases, his fighter pilots were taking a beating from the airborne Japanese. A visit from the famous World War I ace Eddie Rickenbacker gave Kenney the inspiration he needed to raise morale: He challenged his young aviators to beat Rickenbacker's record of shooting down 26 enemy aircraft. Rickenbacker and Kenney each agreed to stand the winning pilot a case of Scotch, and the race was on.
When people feel pigeonholed by the way they define themselves — to the point that it's the only way they can see themselves — they often use deception to double down on that identity. Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced founder of Theranos, is an extreme example; a less serious example might be the professor who quickly changes the station to NPR before a colleague gets into the car. The challenge, Dr. Leavitt says, is to be able to pivot to another identity when you feel threatened. The star saleswoman who failed to win the contract, for example, could remember that she is also a mentor.
Mr. Yang has argued that his Freedom Dividend is one answer to the needs of the millions who will lose their jobs to automation.
She found her signature role in Ballet Theater's revivals of Eugene Loring's Billy the Kid, from 1938. A brilliantly stylized experimental work that used occasional speech, the ballet had a biographical plotline by Lincoln Kirstein (who would become a founder of New York City Ballet), and a double role for Ms. Koesun, who portrayed both the sweetheart and the mother of the outlaw Billy.
According to a 2017 profile in The New Yorker, Ms. Gabbard led a protest in 2004 against a bill to legalize civil unions for same-sex couples. That year she also spoke in the State House against a measure to combat anti-gay bullying in schools.
To your earlier concern, I think we should examine the filibuster. I think that gridlock is bad for anyone trying to get anything done and solve problems. This might be controversial in this room, but I am for the restoration of earmarks, because it helped make legislation possible. That if I was a congressperson in a district, and there was a bill being passed, it's, Hey, at least I can get some pork for my local museum. And that's a very small price to pay for a functional legislature. So, getting past the filibuster to me is one possible necessity, and the restoration of earmarks could be another.
n a bright, crisp afternoon last fall, I joined all 159 Mount Saint Mary's seminarians outside McSweeney Hall, the seminary's main building, an eccentric, gabled edifice made of slabs of thickly grouted granite, perched midway up a hill among a patchwork of farms and woods. We boarded buses and rode an hour and a half to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, where the seminarians had been invited to view an exhibit of religious artwork from the Vatican Museums. Mount Saint Mary's is the second-largest seminary in the country, after Mundelein Seminary in Illinois, and is also among the most conservative -- scrupulously adherent to the magisterium, or teaching authority, of the Pope. A man seeking to become a diocesan priest must first be accepted to a diocese, whose bishop usually underwrites his education and chooses the seminary where it will take place; bishops appointed under Pope John Paul II tend to be morally conservative, upholding the Pope's stringent views on such controversial topics as contraception and the ordination of women. But conservative at Mount St. Mary's does not mean sour or grim. A mood of buoyant optimism surges among the men -- a sense, accurate or not, that the bad times are over for the priesthood, and something new and momentous is in the making. There was a period of confusion and uncertainty after the Second Vatican Council, even going into the 80's, the Rev. Kevin Rhoades, the cheerful rector of Mount Saint Mary's, told me.

Hundreds of differences — some subtle, others extensive — emerged in a New York Times analysis of eight commonly used American history textbooks in California and Texas, two of the nation's largest markets.
To meet this demand, men provided sperm at a steady rate for years, some banks said. But the coronavirus changed things. Existing donors were scared to go in. New donor sign-ups stopped for months during lockdown and never really bounced back at some banks. Several banks said that they had a lot of old frozen sperm in storage, but that it could last only so long.

None of these forces diminishes the key role of racial animosity and racism. Instead, they intensify racial resentment.
But Mr. Brandt's successes, especially with the Ritz, caught their cultural moment and propelled it forward. At the Ritz, he not only booked an expansive range of bands; he also brought new technologies into the mix.
Take the story of Nicephoros II Phokas, the ruthless mid-10th-century emperor who turned the tide of Byzantine military fortunes with a series of brilliant victories against Arab armies, culminating in the reconquest of Cyprus and Aleppo. In the summer of 968, the Lombard bishop Luitprand of Cremona visited Constantinople to negotiate a marriage contract between the family of Nicephoros and the future Otto II, king of Italy. Tensions between East and West were running high. Nicephoros treated the bishop shabbily, and Luitprand returned the favor with some unfavorable immortalizations. He is a monstrosity of a man, Luitprand wrote, fat-headed and with tiny mole's eyes. A short, broad, thick beard disfigures him, half going gray and disgraced by a neck scarcely an inch long, which is pig-like by reason of the big close bristles on his beard. In color he is like an Ethiopian and, as the poet says, 'you would not want to meet him in the dark.'
The textbooks cover the same sweeping story, from the brutality of slavery to the struggle for civil rights. The self-evident truths of the founding documents to the waves of immigration that reshaped the nation.
That too. I mean, it's rough. But I mean, New York's going through — I just want to bring some things to you from experience. Like yeah, the infrastructure breaking down. I mean, we're coasting on the investments made decades ago and they're starting to fall apart. But also what you all do in terms of journalism — I've been campaigning around the country and over 1,200 local papers have gone out of business because the local establishments that used to advertise are gone. All of their classified revenue went off to Craigslist and democracy works much less if you don't have local journalism.
Presidential Transition Highlights: N.S.A. Will Install a Trump Loyalist as Its General Counsel Vice President-elect Kamala Harris plans to resign from her Senate seat on Monday. An impeachment prosecutor said President Trump committed the most serious presidential crime in U.S. history. This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the presidential transition.
Well, fairly quickly after the wedding. There had been this rapturous coverage of the ceremony. But really within weeks, you began to see coverage and headlines in the British tabloids that started taking a slightly harder, meaner look at Harry and especially at Meghan. And it's worth pointing out quickly that the tabloids are, across the board, conservative publications. These are papers that really play to very traditional ideas of the meaning and the value of the monarchy. So what you begin to see are a series of articles. Some are actually asking valid questions about the lifestyle of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
My opposition to World War II resulted from the growing conviction that such a war would probably devastate Europe, kill millions of men and possibly result in the end of Western civilization, he told this writer a few years ago, adding: Under the circumstances of prewar Europe, I concluded that Germany could not be defeated without the active intervention of the United States. I doubted that Germany could be defeated even with American intervention. Obviously this depended a great deal on the relationship between Germany and Russia. But if Germany were defeated, it seemed to me almost certain that Russia would be the real victor and that a Stalin-dominated Europe would be even worse than a Hitler-dominated Europe. I felt that the wisest policy for Western powers would be to arm, stay neutral and let Germany and Russia clash--and thereafter to feel their way according to changing circumstances. I still think this would have been the wisest policy. Lindbergh made his first antiwar speech--a radio talk--on Sept. 17, 1939. It was arranged by Fulton Lewis, a well-known conservative commentator.

In Norse Mythology, Gaiman brings voice to the old myths so viscerally that listening to the audiobook every night for a week, I thought my bedroom might explode into Valhalla. Here are hammer-handed Thor and one-eyed Odin, tricky Loki, and the mighty goddesses Freya and Idunn. In fact the entire Norse pantheon, including dwarves and giants and demons, plays out as vividly as a novel or film. Honestly I may have to order a breastplate of some sort. As Gaiman puts it in the introduction, the stories feel like a journey from the ice and fire that created the world to the fire and ice that end it.
I was wearing a helmet. I have a staffer with the helmet as proof.
Mr. Yang has frequently reiterated his commitment to a two-state solution but has not released any detailed plans about how he would advance an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan or address Mr. Trump's policies in the region. He told the Council on Foreign Relations, I don't want to prescribe the specifics of a two-state solution, as the Israeli and Palestinian people both need to be leading any conversation, and I look forward to engaging with all stakeholders.

Most curmudgeonly protagonists, my own included, are barely eligible for senior discounts and ought to be booking cycling trips across Asia instead of shuffling about in their bedroom slippers (yes, I mean you, Ove). So it's refreshing that Doris, the Swedish heroine of Sofia Lundberg's debut novel, The Red Address Book, is truly old at 96 and depicted with an unflinching eye toward the realities of advanced age. Housebound and alone, she isn't about to rise up and go on life-changing adventures. Death is, she says, waiting in every little wrinkle, clinging to my body.
Mr. Gabbard, who has been a state lawmaker since 2006, has been an outspoken anti-gay activist. In addition to the Alliance for Traditional Marriage, he also ran a group called Stop Promoting Homosexuality America and hosted an anti-gay radio show called Let's Talk Straight Hawaii, according to Honolulu Civil Beat, a news organization.
Let's say I'm on food stamps, and I've got a 15-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. I'm concerned about their future, very, very deeply. And then Andrew Yang becomes president, and I find out that my 15-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month starting at age 18 for the rest of his life, and my 12-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month for the rest of her life. I'm going to say, wow. That's actually the biggest value gain I've ever even heard of in history. My kid will have a financial literacy class in high school, the first semester of their senior year. It is impossible to teach financial literacy to someone who does not have money. So the kids will actually learn about what to do with the money before they start getting the money.
But charities that support survivors of forced marriages said the policy had ignored the unusually risky position those women were in. They often had to ask family members for help cobbling together the money, forcing them to turn to some of the same people who had coerced them into the marriages in the first place.
In our group of eight, two of us were cancer survivors — a woman who had breast cancer, and me. In the 17 years since my diagnosis, I'd struggled to understand the lessons that accompany a life-threatening illness in a twenty-something. Sure, I tried to remember to stop and smell the roses, but other aphorisms, like everything happens for a reason or when a door closes, a window opens left me cold at best.
It is just part of Ms. Akhmedova's ongoing efforts to claim a portion of a $615 million divorce settlement, believed to be the largest in Britain's history, awarded to her after a trial in 2016. Her ex-husband has refused to hand over a single ruble and has kept his money, and himself, far away from the United Kingdom and the reach of its courts.
Men in Black: Bashista on campus; with Dobbins in a mall; at Communion.

But not yet: Nine years ago, the American mezzo-soprano Susan Graham told me she hoped she had 10 more years of singing in her. Heard on Tuesday at Alice Tully Hall, and turning 60 in July, she sounds like she could easily go another decade.
Given the wide range of student experiences, I wasn't sure how the students would receive a course on women writers. In the United States, when I've taught similar courses, discussions often veered into the territory of I'm not a feminist, but … Students were sure that there should be equity between the sexes but feminists, in their minds, were angry man-haters who did nothing but complain.
Mr. Gillis was hired by Saturday Night Live last September, then dropped days later after clips surfaced showing him using slurs and language offensive toward Asian and L.G.B.T.Q. people, including one specifically about Mr. Yang. Mr. Yang later said the comedian should have had the chance to keep his job and explained: As a society, we have become unduly punitive and vindictive about people making statements that some find offensive or distasteful.
Since joining the race last year, Mr. Biden has presented himself as the safe choice for risk-averse times, the O.K.-that'll-do option for Democrats whose chief priority has been finding the candidate best positioned to defeat President Trump. But with Mr. Biden's setback in Iowa and a slate of flawed competitors beside him onstage on Friday — their shortcomings laid bare in several punchy exchanges throughout the night — the party has been left to consider an unsettling truth.
His death, from cancer, was announced by his firm, the Christopher Little Literary Agency.

Her son, Brodie Ransom, said she was given a diagnosis of dementia last year. She also suffered from depression, he said.
On this line, Burnham did something dramatic: He shrank the frame even more, moving in on Rock like a microscope, so close to him that it obscured part of his head. It's an aggressive move, and one that both underlines the question of what is wrong with men and broadens it, giving this personal story a new weight, especially since it came out just months after the Harvey Weinstein exposé and inevitably evokes the #MeToo movement.
For 17 years, until Rubinstein's retirement in 1976, Mr. Wilcox produced some 60 of his recordings for RCA Victor Red Seal. He counted Rubinstein's recordings of Chopin's repertoire among his favorite productions.

The difficulty that white people and people of color have in talking about race together is the knot that this Advanced Beginner Group production picks at, fumblingly — a snarl as sensitive as nerve endings, and as American as our nation's history.
Biden will keep a Trump appointee at the Pentagon until Austin is confirmed, and will name a new spokesman. John F. Kirby, a retired Navy rear admiral, will be the Biden administration's Pentagon spokesman. Credit... Win Mcnamee/Getty Images A low-profile deputy defense secretary will be the lone Trump holdover running the Pentagon until President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s defense secretary pick is confirmed, according to transition officials. Mr. Biden is also planning to install John F. Kirby — the former spokesman for John Kerry when he was secretary of state, Chuck Hagel when he was defense secretary and Mike Mullen when he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — as the next Pentagon press secretary. David L. Norquist, who is now the No. 2 civilian at the Pentagon, will be Mr. Biden's first acting defense secretary — if only for a few days — transition officials said Wednesday. The transition team has been pushing to get Mr. Biden's choice for the top post, a retired Army four-star general, Lloyd J. Austin III, confirmed as soon as possible. But unlike the other top national security nominees on the Biden team, Mr. Austin will have to jump through three Congressional hoops before he is confirmed. The Senate and House must approve a waiver for him to serve at the helm of the Pentagon since he has not been retired from military service at least seven years, and then he must be confirmed by the Senate.
The simplicity of her prose belies a complexity of thought that would have been necessary to edit V. S. Naipaul (or survive a dinner with Jean Rhys); though Athill may not have been afraid of death, she didn't think it was simple, either. She just didn't dwell on its complexities. I swallowed her words like barbiturates and they killed the fear. I think that underneath, or alongside, a reader's conscious response to a text, Athill writes, whatever is needy in him is taking in whatever the text offers to assuage that need. Guilty as charged.
In an interview on Dec. 4, it was clear that Mr. Yang has done his homework, traveling across the country and listening closely. He really seemed to have an almost emotional sense of what people have been going through and what the problems are, a board member [Related: What Is an Editorial Board?] said afterward. His portrait of the fundamental economic problems were more moving than Bernie's, and Bernie has been selling this for 30 years.
JW: I just wanted to tie together the question — a question from Lauren and a question from Michelle, and ask you about Washington, both with regard to Supreme Court confirmation process and your agenda more generally.

As understood by a certain type of Brit?
In her well-received 2013 book, The Still Point of the Turning World, written while Ronan was still alive, Black (who at the time used the name Emily Rapp) found beauty in stolen moments. She was able to derive lessons to learn and wisdom to share from the terrible freedom of parenting a child without a future and turned to writing as a way to find underlying patterns of meaning in a situation that, from the outside, looked inviolate and incontrovertibly meaningless — an endeavor that would ultimately give her a way to connect with and help others.
In an exclusive interview with Andrew, the money management giant's chief, Larry Fink, discussed his decision to make climate change a focus of BlackRock's investment strategy. The shift could reshape how Wall Street invests.
He vowed to elevate scientific research and thinking on topics like the coronavirus, cancer research, climate change, clean-energy jobs, artificial intelligence, 3-D printing and other fast-advancing technologies. The appointees included Eric S. Lander, whom Mr. Biden will nominate to be director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, a position that will for the first time hold cabinet rank. President Trump left the position of science adviser unfilled for 18 months and his administration routinely ignored the guidance of government scientists on issues ranging from the coronavirus pandemic to climate change. Without specifically mentioning Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris drew an implicit contrast with his administration's dismissive attitude toward expert opinion. The science behind climate change is not a hoax, Ms. Harris said during the introductions, held at the Queen Theater in Wilmington, Del. The science behind the virus is not a lie. Dr. Lander, who will also serve as presidential science adviser, was a leader of the Human Genome Project. As Dr. Lander's deputy in the science and technology office, Alondra Nelson, whom was also named by Mr. Biden, is a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study, who has studied the intersection of science with social inequality and race.
Let me explain. I'm a parent. I've got — how many of you all are parents? So if your kids are like my kids, they are mesmerized by any screen that is nearby. I regularly challenge my kids. I say, What's more important? People or screens? And they know the right answer's people. And then if they say screens, then I hold them upside down by their ankles until they say, People, people. And the people that are most diligent about screen time are the tech folks in Silicon Valley. You go there, and all of a sudden there's not a screen to be had because they know that we have the smartest engineers in the country turning supercomputers into dopamine delivery devices for kids, because that's how they make their millions of dollars.
When I started talking to sperm banks last spring, they were already concerned about supply.
JI: Yes. Regulating it heavily and using the revenue to treat gambling addiction. Can you talk through that? You say on your website that you think gambling addiction doesn't get nearly enough attention, and it is a really important issue. How does legalizing gambling, even if you use the revenue, not make that problem worse?
As far as the judge was concerned, that response sealed her fate. Anyone who knows the language, he told her, is obviously a professional.
BA: But that doesn't make our tax code more progressive.
FROM THE MID-NINETEENTH century to the mid-twentieth, a succession of English-speaking intellectuals converted to Catholicism. Since the Reformation almost no English-language writers of any influence had tried to advance the cause of the Catholic Church. When the church began to reassert itself in the nineteenth century, it used converts as its principal advocates. Outspoken, intellectually gifted, and impressed by their own example, Catholic converts said that they would show up the fallacies of Protestants and religious skeptics, end the long schism in Christendom, and place Catholics once more at the center of Western intellectual life.
You can build it around the town library, because a lot of them have this bulletin board that serves as the skeleton of a local paper when the local paper has gone out of business. A lot of these papers would be able to get by if they did not have to generate stock market level returns for hedge fund owners and private equity owners. If you had a cooperative model and it's made a certain amount of money, spent a certain amount of money, ran as a nonprofit, you could restore and sustain local journalism and thousands of communities, but it will not happen without government support. It just won't.
Women are stepping up together, loudly and publicly, writes Schaefer, a journalist whose subjects have ranged from the Korean beauty industry to the occult. It seems the world is finally recognizing the power of female connection, which the poet Adrienne Rich once described as the most feared, the most problematic and the most potentially transforming force on the planet.
I believe your reporters then talked to maybe half a dozen or more of Kim's contemporaries at the organization and found out that those allegations were completely groundless, which they were.
PINE, Colo. — In September, three months after the death of his wife, Dog the Bounty Hunter was angling under the Colorado sun at a trout pond in the backwoods of the Rocky Mountains.
Allow me to apologize in advance for the bad language, the diseased sarcasm, and the bigotry. All police are racist. It's part of our job. New York police hate Puerto Ricans, Miami police hate Cubans, Houston police hate Mexicans, San Diego police hate Native Americans, and Portland police hate Eskimos. Here we hate pretty well everybody who's non-Irish. Or nonpolice. Anyone can become a police--Jews, blacks, Asians, women--and once you're there you're a member of a race called police, which is obliged to hate every other race.
Thank you, good to be here.

In Texas textbooks, mentions of L.G.B.T.Q. issues tend to be restricted to coverage of events in recent decades, such as the Stonewall uprising, the AIDS crisis and debates over marriage rights.
The 21st-century framework. First, you don't use price as your primary determinant of whether or not there are antitrust problems, because the tech companies would say, What? We would never gouge anyone. It's free. We're underselling everyone. So that you have to get rid of, and that's not something she's advocating, but what she is advocating, which I find to be a bit backward looking, is thinking that competition is the answer in these spaces. And competition misses the point in one way and another way.
So the radio cars and the beat cops were there, and the science crew and the medical examiners were there, and Tony Silvera and Oltan O'Boye were there--inside. And some neighbors. But them you look right through. These uniformed figures were churning under the dome lights. And I knew they swayed to sudden priorities. It was like in the Southern when you keyed the mike and said there was an officer down. Down, in some cases, meaning fucked up forever, in a cross-alley after a chase, on a warehouse floor, or reeling alone around a vanished drug corner with both his hands over his eyes. When somebody close to the murder police starts crafting overtime for the murder police, then special rules apply. This is racial. This is an attack on every last one of us.
I loved that play. It was a great play.
No you're not wrong, Colonel Tom. But the minute you really go into someone. You and I both know that there's always enough pain.
Ms. Lynch's appearance underscored how sensitive Mr. Trump was about any signs of fracturing in his base; many evangelical allies denounced the editorial, and Ms. Graham Lynch vowed on Friday to help Mr. Trump win re-election. She then welcomed a supporter to the stage who told attendees that they could not trust what the news media wrote about the president.
New York is moving from caboose to locomotive, said Blair Horner, the executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, adding, New York has been in the obstacle-creating business, as opposed to the obstacle-smashing business when it comes to voting.

The judge overseeing the trial, Justice James M. Burke, told Mr. Weinstein's defense lawyers that they could talk about the emails during opening statements but could not show copies of them to the jury.
These young architects are heirs to a deep tradition of architecture beyond building — and right now they can discover one of the greatest paper architects of a time before AutoCAD. Jean-Jacques Lequeu, more than two centuries ago, also saw his career upended by political shifts and economic crises: in his case, the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. He, too, had to settle for a career of diminished scope, grinding out maps and renderings for a land registry office and other bureaucracies.
In addition to writing novels, Ms. Wilhelm and her husband, the author and editor Damon Knight, trained generations of writers through their Clarion Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers' Workshop (now at the University of California, San Diego), and the annual Milford Writers' Conference (originally in Pennsylvania but more recently in Wales).
Ryan A. McKelley, a professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, who participated in some of the research but not in issuing the guidelines, wrote that there was no intent to reject biological determinants. Instead, it was just beyond the scope of those particular guidelines.

After a decade of deliberation, Iran's government approved a bill on Sunday that criminalizes violence and sexual misconduct against women and specifies punishments for perpetrators.
Generally speaking, I think we have become overly aggressive and optimistic about what we can accomplish in various foreign theaters. I've signed a pledge to end the forever wars because I don't believe it's the will of the American people for us to be in a constant state of armed conflict in foreign theaters for years and even decades at a time. Our Constitution says that it's in Congress's hands to declare war, but Congress has completely ceded this authority through the A.U.M.F. [Authorization for Use of Military Force] and then just said, Hey, executive branch, you can do what you want. And now they want nothing to do with it, and that is not the will of the American people, and it's not the will of the Constitution. So we should repeal the A.U.M.F. and say, Look, Congress, if we want to authorize armed conflict, it should be on you and it should be the will of the people.
Your honor, she told the judge, I've never turned a trick in my life.
JW: And let me just, one last follow-up on that. If Democrats don't take back the Senate, how do you feel with the Supreme Court — how do you, I mean, put aside expanding the number of justices, how do you even get a justice onto the court in the first place?
The Girl Scouts of Greater New York announced this week that they were trying to get out of a 15-year lease in a Manhattan building owned by the Trump Organization. Meridith Maskara, chief executive of the Girl Scouts chapter, said it was a matter of very high priority.
But Rae made it. As she, Lisa, and Naum were leaving the tunnel, Rae latched on to a Jewish youth who was from that area, who knew the countryside. She grabbed his pants and told him he was not going without her family. We're gonna die all together or we're gonna live all together, Rae said. The boy started to cry. He had someone, a gentile woman, who would take him in. But if he brought Rae, and Naum, and Lisa, he feared, she would call the Germans and they would all die. Rae told him that if she called the Germans they would all die together.
I love work, and the numbers also clearly show that people need work. Men in particular, without work, they volunteer less than employed men. So think about that for a second. They have higher rates of substance abuse, their health deteriorates, all these social ills accompany. Of course, we need to create jobs in as many communities as possible.
— as a whole, you expect us to. And then, when we slip up, we're the enemy. And yeah, I mean, I can see your point.
Nick Fox: Can I clarify one point on taxation? Are you proposing any new or increased taxes on the wealthiest Americans or corporations, or is it strictly the VAT?
How Textbooks are Produced 1 Authors, often academics, write a national version of each text. 2 Publishers customize the books for states and large districts to meet local standards, often without input from the original authors. 3 State or district textbook reviewers go over each book and ask publishers for further changes. 4 Publishers revise their books and sell them to districts and schools.
quoted Mr. Brock's attorney, Brook Antonio II, as saying on Thursday that there was no direct evidence of him breaking into the Capitol or doing anything violent inside. The top federal prosecutor in Washington said this week that he expected the number of people charged with crimes tied to the Capitol riot to rise into the hundreds. The F.B.I. has received more than 126,000 photographic and video tips and as agents have scoured airline passenger manifests and video of air travelers to and from Washington to find potential suspects. The man who was photographed holding a Confederate battle flag inside the U.S. Capitol during the riot was arrested on Thursday in Delaware, two law enforcement officials said. The man, Kevin Seefried, was wanted by the F.B.I., which had sought help from the public to identify him and had widely circulated a dispatch plastered with images of him. In a bulletin, the agency said that it was looking for assistance to identify individuals who made unlawful entry into the Capitol, including Mr. Seefried. According to court documents, Mr. Seefried and his son, Hunter Seefried, were identified after the F.B.I. received a report from a co-worker of Hunter Seefried that said the man had bragged about being in the Capitol with his father on January 6.Mr. Seefried's son was also charged. A retired firefighter from Chester, Pa., was also arrested on Thursday after he was identified as the man seen in a video throwing a fire extinguisher at police officers during the riot.
Even Isaac Hecker, who had misgivings about infallibility during the Vatican Council, accepted it later as an assertion of the external dignity of the church, which could now be ideally complemented by a full development of its internal or intellectual life.
Yeah. And I think in some ways, there's some positive lessons to be drawn from that time, because there were some significant accomplishments during that era.

Ms. Ingraham, 30, and Mr. Koster, 33, were youth leaders at Oak Hill Ranch, a therapeutic program for high-risk children. The demands of the job didn't allow much time for adult interaction, let alone a flirtation. But Ms. Ingraham did her best to let Mr. Koster know she was interested. There was the time they were out walking children around the ranch and she stepped on a wasp's nest: I was getting attacked by wasps and he was sweeping them off my legs and I was like, 'Adam, you are amazing,' Ms. Ingraham said. But he didn't think anything of it.
Borstelmann had long thought he would retire at 65. At 62, he already considers himself — and take a deep breath, here — the country's oldest daredevil acrobatic hand balancer. There is an element of physical risk that Borstelmann takes every time he does his handstand about 25 feet above center court.

Jamie Dimon, who is a Democrat but is a numbers person, has looked at the numbers and said, we should declare a national emergency around the fact that the economy is not working for most Americans.

Gross domestic product is a measure of a country's entire economic output. Its inventor worried that it might be mistaken as a measure of citizens' well-being. Mr. Yang's campaign has proposed that America measure its economic prosperity with a different index that accounts for human and not just monetary factors, including inequality and quality of life.
In the '70s or '80s, your labor and overall productivity were more or less in lock step. And we still pretend that if someone wakes up in the morning and says, Hey, I need to put food on the table, he can go out to his main street, he can sell his time for money at some hourly rate, and then he'll be able to make a good enough living so he can feed his family, raise kids and the rest of it. That has become progressively less true over the last 40 years, unfortunately, where wages have stagnated while productivity has gone up and up, and that's going to accelerate because of the convergence of capital and technology now, in unprecedented ways.
No, first of all, it's also easy to do it in a hypothetical situation. But in my character's case, he fully intended to do the right thing, as you saw. And it was that impulsive moment, when he saw that mobster, to alter the course of his life by making that decision.
Each of these systems is navigating the pandemic on its own, meaning the experience of a child in one county can be completely different from the one right next to it. Soon after the pandemic took hold, for instance, Florida's child welfare system began conducting the bulk of the work certifying foster parents and placing children in their homes remotely. In New York, the system ground to a halt. For a long while, the courts here were just not doing anything virtually, said Shantell Lewis, a recruiter with the Wendy's Wonderful Kids program, which focuses on finding placements for older foster youth, at a Brooklyn nonprofit called MercyFirst. Though New York has more recently allowed work to be conducted virtually, the state has a considerable backlog. Many child welfare professionals are also concerned about older youth emancipating from foster care, when local governments are no longer bound to provide financial assistance. This abrupt transition into adulthood, between 18 and 21 depending on the state, in the very best of times represents a significant challenge for roughly 20,000 young people each year. But today, those aging out of foster care are aging in to a country gripped by an ongoing pandemic and crippled economy. When a young person ages out of the system, we have in many ways already failed them, said Rita Soronen, president and chief executive of the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption.
In the annihilated aftermath of her third divorce, the words return, and Ditlevsen publishes, in 1968, her great novel, The Faces. Republished in Britain this year, it captures the dissociated mental state of a children's author, Lise, who hallucinates voices and faces, the latter — disembodied, floating, often those of children — inspiring the book's singular prose. Some of them, especially girls, had had to live out their mother's childhood while their own lay hidden in a secret drawer, Lise explains. Their voices would break out of them like pus from a sore, and the sound would frighten them, just like when they discovered that someone had been reading their diary, even though it was locked up among the junk and old toys from the time they had worn the discarded face of a 4-year-old. That face would stare up at them from among the tops and crippled dolls with innocent, astonished glass eyes.

From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today: In the weeks since George Floyd was killed by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, Americans have been confronting hard questions about bias and racism within policing, and what the role of the police should be. And in the face of those questions is another question: Is the culture of policing, and the resistance to change by some police unions, so entrenched that whatever change is necessary would require fundamental rethinking from the outside, rather than incremental change from within police departments and their unions? In that context, we wanted to talk to someone who sits at the heart of these questions. Vince Champion is a police union representative in Atlanta, Georgia. Georgia is a right-to-work state, where police officers aren't required to join the union or pay dues, so the unions don't hold the same power to block reforms as they do in many states. And Champion has supported some of the reforms that unions have been criticized for resisting in the past, including banning chokeholds, the use of body cams, and transparency around police officers' records. And like many law enforcement officials, Champion has forcefully condemned officer Chauvin. But when it comes to another high-profile police killing in his own city — the killing of Rashard Brooks, just weeks after Floyd's death — Champion's views are more complicated. It's Monday, June 29.
Births in China have now fallen for three years in a row. They had risen slightly in 2016, a year after the government ended its one-child policy and allowed couples to have two children, a shift that officials hoped would drive a sustained increase in the number of newborns. But that has not materialized.
But for them the challenge is not even what's happening internally. The challenge is whether or not they can get developing countries on board with their technology standards to be able to roll them out internationally. So if you're a third party, let's say you're a developing country in Africa or Latin America, then you have a choice essentially between the global standard and the Chinese standard. And if you're the Chinese, you do not want a standard that only you are using over time, because that's going to curb your economic upside to all of the software that you're building. One of the reasons why our tech companies are so successful is that they export it to virtually the entire rest of the world, and China does not want to be in the opposite position.
Wow, these questions are really fun. Who's broken my heart?
If you don't get married, asked a student from the Philippines, won't you have to move home and take care of your parents? That comment elicited murmurs of recognition and a discussion about the difficulties of resisting something we're told is natural, such as the assumption that women are always caregivers. None of these students come from a country known for progressive gender politics, which may be precisely why they see the value in a feminist perspective: It helps them think about what needs to be changed — and how. Without ignoring the specifics of their experiences, they found the commonalities in being told to be the neck, or to find a boyfriend, or to forgo graduate school.
We should definitely do that, in a very big and dramatic way. And I have proposals to help move us toward a better model of high school education. Only 6 percent of American high school students are in technical, trade or apprenticeship tracks. In Germany, that's 59 percent. Think about that gulf. Meanwhile, there are millions of those trade and middle-scale jobs that are left unfilled. Why is this?
He shrugged. He exhaled slowly. He looked up. And I saw what you seldom see in the grief-struck. Panic. A primitive panic, a low-IQ panic, in the eyes--it makes you consider the meaning of the word hare-brained. And it made me panic. I thought: He's in a nightmare and now I am too. What do I do if he starts screaming? Start screaming? Should everybody start screaming?

The train of conversions continued during and after the war. Men and women disabused of their faith in progress as a force immanent in history found consolation in Catholicism. In the interwar years a distinguished group of British novelists converted to Catholicism, including Compton Mackenzie, Graham Greene, and Evelyn Waugh, and began to make lasting contributions to the canon of English literature. In the 1850s Newman had lamented that the great classics of English literature were Protestant to the core and that English was in effect a Protestant language. Now for the first time since the Reformation, English literature enjoyed a significant Catholic leavening. Convert writers took turns touring the United States, teaching at Georgetown, Fordham, and Notre Dame and trying to encourage a Catholic literary revival across the sea. They were joined by another group of gifted and prolific controversialists, including Shane Leslie, Arnold Lunn, and Christopher Hollis, who took up the mantle of Chesterton and tried to carry on his message that Catholicism was synonymous with urbanity, erudition, and wit. Aptly enough, the first holder of the Stillman Chair in Catholic Studies at Harvard Divinity School was the English convert Christopher Dawson.

They eked out a precarious living for a while, partially from her mother's employment as a housemaid. But when the depression struck, her mother was unable to find work. Miss Holiday tried to make money scrubbing floors, and when this failed she started along Seventh Avenue in Harlem one night looking for any kind of work. At Jerry Preston's Log Cabin, a night club, she asked for work as a dancer. She danced the only step she knew for fifteen choruses and was turned down. The pianist, taking pity on her, asked if she could sing. She brashly assured him that she could. She sang Trav'lin' All Alone and then Body and Soul and got a job--$2 a night for six nights a week working from midnight until about 3 o'clock the next afternoon. Recommended to Goodman Miss Holiday had been singing in Harlem in this fashion for a year or two when she was heard by John Hammond, a jazz enthusiast, who recommended her to Benny Goodman, at that time a relatively unknown clarinet player who was the leader on occasional recording sessions. She made her first recording, Your Mother's Son-in-Law in November, 1933, singing one nervous chorus with a band that included in addition to Mr. Goodman, Jack Teagarden, Gene Krupa and Joe Sullivan. Two years later Miss Holiday started a series of recordings with groups led by Teddy Wilson, the pianist, which established her reputation in the jazz world.
I grew up in an entirely secular household. My parents did not talk about God in the house, but I had this instinctive belief in a higher power. I had many Christian relatives. I went to church over holidays growing up quite often. And then I married my wife, Evelyn, who's Christian. And so, we're raising our kids in a Christian church. I go to church when I'm home, which is not very often unfortunately nowadays. I enjoy it. My faith is still very much a journey, but I'm unreservedly thrilled about the impact it has on my wife, my boys, my family, my community.

To me, the economic imbalances are causing many of our other problems. If you look up and down the line, health problems, poor educational attainment and results, even political polarization, they stem from the fact that we have this pervasive financial insecurity where 78 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Almost half can't afford an unexpected $400 or $500 bill. If you can't pay next month's rent, it's very hard to worry about climate change. I come and talk to you and say, Hey, we need to fight climate change. And you look up and say like, I'm worried about next month. Next year, next decade has to wait in line.

From the opening origin myths — about Yggdrasil, a life tree with three roots in three worlds, and the driftwood logs that give rise to the first humans, Ask (named from the ash tree) and Embla (named from the elm) — I was struck by the differences between the stories I'd learned as a child raised Catholic (it didn't take) and a creation story in which humans spring from trees. Hearing again that we might imagine ourselves born of the natural world, an idea shared by many pre-Christian indigenous cultures, made me feel briefly less hopeless.
The reason I am drawing, in some polls, 10 percent or more of Donald Trump voters to my campaign is that Republicans and conservatives do not hate economic buying power in citizens' hands. What they hate is a giant bureaucracy making everyone's decisions. So you ask what my main priority will be as president, it will be to get the Freedom Dividend across the finish line and get buying power into Americans' hands, which will then lead us to be able to solve many other problems much more quickly.

Investigators are eyeing any military members or police officers who were part of last week's siege. Supporters of President Trump outside the door to the House chamber after breaching Capitol security during a riot last week. Credit... Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA, via Shutterstock Federal investigators working to apprehend and charge the hundreds of people connected to last week's assault on the Capitol are focusing on any military and law enforcement personnel who may have been involved in the attack, according to a law enforcement official. Investigators also have yet to find any evidence that any member of Congress helped coordinate the siege, as one prominent leader of a pro-Trump group has claimed, but are scrutinizing those leads. The official cautioned that the investigation is sprawling and that all leads need to be carefully vetted. The F.B.I. and Justice Department have already arrested several suspects who were captured in photographs inside the Capitol, including Kevin Seefried, a man who was photographed holding a Confederate battle flag; Jake Angeli, a well-known QAnon conspiracy theorist who was seen carrying a spear and wearing a fur headdress with horns; and Robert Keith Packer, who was photographed wearing a Camp Auschwitz sweatshirt. Other insurrectionists moved through the chaos inside the building in tight military formation, using hand signals and wearing tactical gear, and investigators are seeking to determine whether they were working together or whether any had ties to law enforcement or the military.
When I speak to older Jewish audiences, I am often accused, sometimes stridently, of minimizing anti-Semitism and am told that it is worse than ever. Social scientists call this dramatic disparity between the reality of declining anti-Semitism and the widespread belief that it is increasing a perception gap between what is actually happening and Jewish sensibilities. Some of the Jews who believe this are similar in this respect to some feminists and black activists I know, who insist that the plight of women and blacks is worse than it ever was. These good and decent people, whose identities are so tied up with their victimization, are incapable of accepting the good news that their situation is improving. It is not even a matter of perceiving the glass as half full or half empty. They see the glass as broken, even though it is intact and quickly filling up. As the sociologist Marshall Sklare puts it: American Jews respond more readily to bad news than to good news.
This is what's so tough right now is that countries are trying to figure out what are the benefits of being an ally of the United States and doing what we want them to do, and then what are the costs. Unfortunately that calculation is going against us more and more. Turkey's relationship with the U.S. has been stronger than our relationship with many other countries in that region. I think we should invest in that relationship if we're going to be able to accomplish any of our goals there. And that includes, to me, being a little bit more accommodating about behaviors that we might find objectionable or troubling from them than we might from another country.

What you have to do is you have to figure out what the abuses you're concerned about are, and then actually address them directly.
The pope's doctor has died of Covid-19 complications. Pope Francis with Dr. Fabrizio Soccorsi right, his personal physician, in an undated photo. Credit... Osservatore Romano, via EPA/Shutterstock Pope Francis's personal physician, Dr. Fabrizio Soccorsi, died on Saturday as a result of the coronavirus, the Vatican said. Dr. Soccorsi, 78, had been in hospitalized at the Gemelli Hospital in Rome and was being treated for cancer, but died because of complications from Covid-19, according to Vatican News, the Vatican's online news portal. Francis selected Dr. Soccorsi to be his personal physician in 2015. Dr. Soccorsi specialized in internal medicine, and served for a time as the chairman of the hepatology department at the San Camillo Hospital in Rome. He also taught immunology at the Rome and Lazio Region Medical School. The Vatican newspaper, l'Osservatore Romano, wrote in an obituary published on Saturday that Dr. Soccorsi had been profoundly affected, by the premature death of his daughter, Cristiana, in June 2017. Social distancing measures and other pandemic safety protocols were imposed in Vatican City in March. Since then, several senior church figures, including cardinals, have tested positive for the virus. In all, twenty-seven residents of Vatican City, out of a total population of roughly 800, have tested positive, according to a New York Times database. In a television interview scheduled for broadcast in Italy Sunday evening, the pope said he would be vaccinated as soon as this week, and he called on everyone to get vaccinated when possible, calling it an ethical choice to do so.

Despite Proust's silences and lapses on the subject of his mother's religion, it would be unfair, especially in light of the rampant anti-Semitism of turn-of-the-century France, to say that he was unique or even extreme in his prejudice against Jews. And yet his anti-Semitism is more than curious, given his love for his mother and given, after her death, something very much like a religious cult that he developed around her. His mother, out of respect for her parents, had remained faithful to their religion, and Proust revered her and her relatives; after her death he regretted that he was too ill to visit her grave and the graves of her parents and uncle in the Jewish cemetery and to mark each visit with a stone. More important, although he had many friends among the aristocracy whom he had assiduously cultivated, nevertheless when he was forced to take sides during the Dreyfus Affair, which had begun in 1894 and erupted in 1898, he chose to sign a petition prominently printed in a newspaper calling for a retrial.

The crux of the issue is that with autism there is often, not metaphorically but literally, a lack of voice, which renders the person a tabula rasa on which a writer can inscribe and project almost anything: Autism is a gift, a curse, super intelligence, mental retardation, mystical, repellent, morally edifying, a parent's worst nightmare. As a writer, I say go ahead and write what you want. As a parent, I find this terrifying, given the way neurotypical people project false motives and feelings onto the actions of others every day.

Ultramontanists placed their faith in Thomism. In an effort to assure intellectual coherence between disciplines and a foundation for all studies in theology, the popes who reigned in the second half of the nineteenth century placed a renewed emphasis on the work of Thomas Aquinas and his scholastic successors. Scholasticism and natural law theory have many strengths, among them an orderly rationalism and a conceptual framework into which every discrete item of information can be fitted, showing its connection to the whole and to the divine will from which it springs. But scholastic philosophy and natural law encountered a succession of powerful challengers in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, including pragmatism, vitalism, existentialism, and logical positivism, each of which debunked scholasticism's claims to intellectual respectability. Similarly, in the physical sciences and in the study of history, the developing academic orthodoxy in Britain and America, strongly empirical and increasingly based on evolutionary, probabilist, and materialist assumptions, was at variance with the scholastic framework, which, while granting science some autonomy, linked worldly phenomena to their supernatural origins. The scholastic criticism of materialism and positivism was not so much refuted as blithely ignored by most of the scientists. Protestant conservatives were also polemicizing against the new secular sciences, but for religious and traditional reasons, Catholic and Protestant objectors to secular scholarship were unable to make common cause.
So I have a three-part test for sending troops into harm's way. Number one, it needs to advance a vital American interest or avert a humanitarian catastrophe. Number two, it has to have a clearly defined timeline where we can look troops in the eyes and say, It's going to take this long and you're going to be able to accomplish our mission and then you're going to be able to come home. And not some boardroom self-delusion, like you actually believe that you're going to get it done and then be able to bring them home in that time frame. And number three, we're not going in alone; there are allies joining us in the mission. If those three things are in place, then I would consider sending our troops into harm's way.
The result is not always terrifying. A manipulative, sexually-harassing boss, robbed of work, capers across the desktops of his office, laughing and tossing paper airplanes. A young man who has lived for a long time as an anxious shut-in loses home and finds himself free to explore the world and embrace political causes. It almost seems as if the aliens do their unwitting hosts a favor. The catch is that they plan to exterminate us and take over the planet.
I'm for a more progressive tax structure. It's clear that the people at the top of the income chain are not paying enough. I don't think a wealth tax will work. I like the spirit of a wealth tax, but if you look at other countries' experience, Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, very sophisticated developed countries, they tried a wealth tax and they wound up repealing it because it had massive compliance problems, and it did not generate anywhere near the revenue that was projected.
Starting in 1979, productivity and pay sharply diverged — productivity rose nearly 70 percent, while typical hourly pay essentially stagnated, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
We have something to live for, he said, and that keeps us going.
It was one of those rare instances for me as an actor where what I say as the character very much overlapped with what I believe as a person myself. And so I felt a lot of the emotions I imagine Seretse Khama would have felt. We shot it in Botswana in front of a Botswana crowd, a lot of whom would know who Seretse Khama was. So in some ways, it's a real test to play this leader who means so much to them and to convince them both within the film and as real people who see me as an actor not from Botswana.
I walked into this job, my son has walked into this job for what it's for: to protect and serve. As cliché as that sounds, that's why we do this. We don't get holidays and weekends off. We know that going in. We know that the pay is not the best. We know that going in. We know we could get hurt or killed. We know that going in. So you look at yourself, and you go, why are you doing the job? And that's been the conversation. Is the job getting to where it's not what you thought it was? It's not maybe for you, you know, now? Are you becoming the dinosaur officer that needs to go? And everybody says things aren't done like they used to. Well, that's true. They're not. So you've got to learn to conform and make these changes. And if you don't think you can, maybe it's time for you to move on.
Does that affect your income, this idea of Netflix started it by paying people up front and then moving on?
Active play between fathers and children has a functional element correlated with several positive child outcomes, such as competitiveness without aggression, cooperation that buffers anxiety, healthy experimentation, social competence, peer acceptance and popularity, and a sense of autonomy.
KK: And do you think President Xi is a dictator?
Who was being charged with murder and who, if convicted, would face life in prison or the death penalty.
Our best path forward with China is to try and have them continue to show restraint, but also see that the costs to human rights abuse is not just in Hong Kong, but with their ethnic minorities and the Muslim population of Uighurs, that the costs are higher than their perceived benefits of maintaining social order and stability. In order to have those costs feel real to the Chinese, we can't just moralize and say, Hey, do the right thing. Because at this point they're looking at us and saying like, Keep your opinions and value statements to yourselves.
Because there is nothing but malice and exorbitant legal fees in the story of the 27-year-old Temur Akhmedov and the divorce of his parents, the Russian billionaire Farkhad Akhmedov and Tatiana Akhmedova. It is a feel-awful yarn for a feel-awful era, offering the unhappy spectacle — livestreamed in December from the Family Division of the High Court of London — of a mother testifying against her son, and vice versa, as she sues him for nearly $100 million in cash and assets.
That too. I mean, it's rough. But I mean, New York's going through — I just want to bring some things to you from experience. Like yeah, the infrastructure breaking down. I mean, we're coasting on the investments made decades ago and they're starting to fall apart. But also what you all do in terms of journalism — I've been campaigning around the country and over 1,200 local papers have gone out of business because the local establishments that used to advertise are gone. All of their classified revenue went off to Craigslist and democracy works much less if you don't have local journalism.
It's an example of this general policy of pushing costs onto the people who have incurred the misfortune, which drives a cycle of increased vulnerability, she said.
For the first two episodes of Season 3, the show had been taking a conservative, back-to-basics approach to the procedural that seemed like a correction to the indulgences of the previous season, which got lost in the tangled psychology of four lead characters who were the same brand of edgy.
Hannah and Her Sisters, Crimes and Misdemeanors and Husbands and Wives in particular draw on the nearness of that life to create a sense of intimacy and warmth even amid the harsh, cynical elements of some of their plots. In those films, Mr. Allen and Ms. Farrow enact scenarios of romantic failure, either splitting up or missing the chance to connect. They are often playing the smartest characters on screen, but also the saddest and least sympathetic, occupying a reality that is drabber and less dramatic than that of the more reckless souls with whom their fates are entwined.
I ask myself why using autism the way these books do feels wrong. As a child who was disappointed to find the only Asian characters in any book in the library to be the Japanese-American family in Farewell to Manzanar, I am acutely aware of the importance of feeling represented in literature. And yet, when it comes to autism appearing in literary fiction, I instinctively feel a need to protect my son from these portrayals. He's not an Ojibwe curse, a savant or an alien. Nor is he an emotionless cipher with no inner life.
My team then had me take the helmet off and then tried to make my hair look good. So that's why I didn't show up with the helmet.
This time, the league is promising to put its full weight behind the Beckham team. M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber has endured years of skeptical questions about the bid's many ups and downs, but on Monday he beamed as he told the crowd that he intended to help make the league's newest team one of the great clubs of the world.
KK: Oh, sorry, I just wanted to ask you, you know, there are some people who would suggest that a better use of money, instead of giving a Freedom Dividend, would be to dramatically overhaul America's high schools and start teaching people different skills instead of trying to continue the race against A.I. Why isn't that a path? Why couldn't we instead change how we do education in this country?
We were just thinking of all the restaurants that we've outlived, Judy Collins said on a recent afternoon at the Carlyle Hotel in New York. She was there with her husband, Louis Nelson.
As the paranoid Lise grows convinced that her husband is plotting to induce her to commit suicide, the voices ratchet up, accusing her of various offenses: of being an inattentive wife, an inconstant mother, a solipsistic writer. You've never seen anything but yourself in the whole world, she envisions her beloved daughter, Hanne, admonishing her. That madness can be more incisive than the rational is the novel's resonant irony, one that still lands. So, of course, does the crime of female subjectivity, of believing oneself a worthy literary subject, capacious enough to contain multitudes.
Romance novels teach readers that all partners are equal participants in a sexual relationship, said Bea Koch, the 28-year-old co-owner (with her 25-year-old sister, Leah) of the Ripped Bodice, a bookstore in Culver City, Calif., that exclusively sells romance titles. They highlight conversations about consent, birth control and myriad other topics that people generally find difficult to talk about. In some instances, it can be a literal script for how to bring up difficult topics with a partner. They give a road map to people wanting to experiment with their sexuality, or even just get in touch with what they want and need in a sexual relationship.
Right now we have three flagship numbers we're beating the American people over the head with, telling them that things are going great. No. 1, the headline unemployment rate. No. 2, gross domestic product, which is obviously putting up record highs even as our life expectancy is declining. And No. 3, corporate profits and shareholder value. Stock market prices correspond to the fortunes of the top 20 percent of Americans, many of the people, obviously, who live here in Manhattan. The bottom 80 percent of Americans own 8 percent of stock market value. The bottom 50 percent own essentially zero.
Granted, the back story to their coupledom is unusual, maybe even by the standards of the French, whose current and past leaders have been embroiled in very public romantic dramas.
BA: But you're not proposing to fix any of that. People don't just work to make money; they do work for a sense of self-worth. They work so that they can develop skills, they work so they have the possibility of earning more money someday. You're proposing to replace a portion of the income they may have lost, but not any of those other things. Why is that a solution?
That's not me. Sorry. You got the wrong gal here. Bryan Cranston was a working actor for decades before he got his big break, starring as Walter White in Breaking Bad. It was a career-defining role but also a potential trap. Where do you go after you play Heisenberg?

One could argue that what today's men need is more encouragement to enhance one side of the masculine virtues — the dignity, responsibility, self-control, and self-reliance — while inhibiting others, such as machismo, violence, and drive for dominance.
Lesli Linka Glatter, a director and executive producer, admitted she also quizzed Mr. Patinkin about his turn as Inigo Montoya (catchphrase: You killed my father. Prepare to die.) in the 1987 comedy. I was a little like, 'Should I bring this up?' she said. But definitely I asked all the questions, I was so in awe.
If Sex and the Constitution succeeds, future efforts by Stone and his publisher will no doubt include Sex and Magna Carta, Sex and the Declaration of Independence and Sex and the Instructions That Came With Your New Dishwasher. Stone tells the story fairly straight, but it's clear that he regards history as moving in a generally progressive direction — in favor of more tolerance — and that he thinks that's a good thing.
In Text Me When You Get Home Kayleen Schaefer recalls a first date — not with a potential romantic partner but with a potential friend. Describing the emotional rush of an evening spent colluding and conjoining, she sounds as if she has a new crush: I related to every single thing she said, Schaefer tells us, reporting that they discussed things I don't typically share with someone I'm just sitting down with for the first time. She gushes to her mother via text the next day: I have a new best friend. … I love her.
With retirement from ABC looming after the season, this was the 70-year-old Jackson's last sojourn to Ann Arbor to call a Michigan game. Nearly three decades since redefining the sound of televised college football with an evocative idiom and a storyteller's brio, he insists that it is time to see whether the young bucks in his shadow are as talented as they think. You want to go when it's time, he said. You're better off if you go a little early.
Yet one little-known movie amid the star-studded titles has quietly broken ground.
KK: I want to ask you, you were the C.E.O. of Manhattan Prep. How does test prep — doesn't that contribute to income inequality in the United States?
In 1975 she founded the influential literary journal Bananas, which published new work by Mr. Ballard, Beryl Bainbridge, Angela Carter and the science-fiction writer Michael Moorcock. She served as editor for three years.
Tom Bradby then has a very emotional interview with Prince Harry, where he says a couple of things. One, he says that his grief for his mother Diana is still a wound that festers.
Months after they recovered, some of the Covid survivors are worried about lingering effects.
In terms of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' of watching people become more Trumpian, these moral icons becoming shills, he is way up there, said Charlie Sykes, the author of How the Right Lost Its Mind, and a former radio host who used to occasionally substitute on Mr. Prager's show. Now you have to put PragerU in the category of other very successful meme machines and low-rent conservative grifting.
After the Murder of Albert Lima
Immigration and nativism are major themes in American history textbooks. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Continuity and Change, California, P. 736 California includes an excerpt from a novel about a Dominican-American family. McGraw-Hill, United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 609 In the same place, Texas highlights the voice of a Border Patrol agent.
Give him his due now. Say, I'm sorry I overstepped with Susan, and even sorrier for dragging my heels in apologizing sincerely. I promise that I have your back. If that's too demonstrative for you, get yourself to a therapist. But if you make an honest go of it, you may be amazed at how nicely your different temperaments align.
In chapters 5, 6, and 7, I explore the most frequently proposed solutions to the problem of assimilation. To those who are sure that return to religion is Judaism's only salvation, I say, Get as many to return as you can. Maybe you are right. But we cannot rely exclusively on your solution, because maybe you are wrong. Maybe not enough Jews will become religious. Maybe religion--at least as currently defined and practiced--is not the wave of the future for most young intellectuals. Maybe there is a strand of Judaism that can survive and thrive without exclusive dependence on theology and ritual. After all, the Yiddish secularism that flourished between the beginning of the Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah) and the Second World War was an authentic Jewish culture, which was destroyed by external forces. Political Zionism, which grew largely out of that culture, remains an authentic Jewish civilization of enormous importance to the survival of Judaism. Today's influential American Jewish community is largely secular.
I rode the subway maybe six weeks ago or so. It's become much more of a pain in the neck now that I actually get recognized. I confess that that's been the biggest adjustment in running for president. Because I was, No, I'm not going to get recognized on the street. Of course, keep in mind, when I started my run I was completely anonymous. I mean none of you had ever heard of me. And also there is, and this is not to make too much of it, but there's also this invisible Asian man thing. That you feel like all you have to do is just not want to be seen and then you disappear, and that doesn't work anymore.
KK: Actually, I also want to ask you about your time at Manhattan Prep. Your colleague Kimberly Watkins told City Council in September that she had faced both gender harassment and pay inequity under your leadership there. Could you respond to those allegations?

Some of the policies Mr. Blinken is now reviewing are decisions that were issued in the final days of the Trump administration and were clearly designed to box in Mr. Biden, said Anne W. Patterson, a former career diplomat.
Mr. Yang previously ran a successful test prep company and created the nonprofit Venture for America, which he argues is a strength, offering him fresh perspective and critical distance from the workings of Washington.
I cut off ties with everyone, as I didn't want them tracking me down, he said about family and friends in Romania. I knew it was hard for my daughter, but I felt it would be better for her.
In hindsight, this was not an accurate assessment of the next question.
There are two kinds of people in the world: the kind who alphabetize their record collections, and the kind who don't. — Sarah Vowell, The Partly Cloudy Patriot
And what made her, in your words, so beguiling?
His worst flaw here, one from which Mr. Gomes's work also suffers, is cuteness. Dancers flirt with the audience and jokily vie for attention in ways that shatter the stage reality they've been building together. The music is Rossini's unusually scored but appealing Duet for Cello and Double Bass in D major. If Mr. Brown can pare away his immaturities, he may yet become a choreographer.
Ms. Leachman entered the spotlight as a Miss America contestant in 1946 and was still in the public eye more than 74 years later, portraying offbeat grandmothers on television and film and competing with celebrities less than half her age on Dancing With the Stars. In between, she won admiring reviews for her stage, film and television work, as well as Emmy Awards for performances in both dramas and comedies.

His story does not neatly fit into the addict's narrative. Unprecedented numbers of men and women have fallen to the opioid epidemic in this country, rotating in and out of hospitals, treatment centers and jails, brought back to life by doses of Narcan, only to overdose again. Less common is a story like Mr. Azimi's, one with virtually no warning signs, evading detection by sharp-eyed colleagues in an epicenter of addiction in the Bronx. Those closest to him missed or misread the physical cravings that he hid well.

Ms. Macron first met Mr. Macron when he was 15 and she was his teacher, married with three children, at a high school in Amiens, France. The two became close after Mr. Macron asked her to help him rewrite sections of a play. Before Mr. Macron moved to Paris to continue his schooling, he declared, at age 17, that he would one day marry his teacher. He did, in 2007.
The Times of London reported on four British women who were each charged roughly $900 for the government's efforts to free them from a religious institution in Somalia where they said they had been chained, whipped and told they would be held until they married. The women's families sent them there because they thought the women were too independent.
This work was through Mr. Yang's nonprofit, Venture for America. More on that in a bit.
What I am setting out here is an account of the worst case I have ever handled. The worst case--for me, that is. When you're a police, worst is an elastic concept. You can't really get a fix on worst. The boundaries are pushed out every other day. Worst? we'll ask. There's no such thing as worst. But for Detective Mike Hoolihan this was the worst case.
Mr. Yang has proposed what he describes as a W.T.O. for data and has argued that data ownership should be made a property right. Some argue that such an organization could enable more partnership among countries in setting standards for artificial intelligence and data.
Many ballerinas have found the whole role elusive. Who is Aurora? She scarcely expresses any personal emotion; others control her destiny; she begins happy and she ends happy, with a hundred years of zzz in between.
Mr. Barris might have earned a brief mention in the obituary pages with one of his earliest accomplishments: He wrote the pop song Palisades Park, which became a hit for Freddy Cannon in 1962 and an emblem of that period of good-time rock 'n' roll just before the genre's harder, louder side emerged.
Mr. Dillard said it was time for the left to do some soul searching. Take political parties out of it; that imagery and that behavior still exists today, he said. I do believe that there are probably still Democrats who have the same types of situations, same types of backgrounds as we discovered with Ralph Northam.
So I have a three-part test for sending troops into harm's way. Number one, it needs to advance a vital American interest or avert a humanitarian catastrophe. Number two, it has to have a clearly defined timeline where we can look troops in the eyes and say, It's going to take this long and you're going to be able to accomplish our mission and then you're going to be able to come home. And not some boardroom self-delusion, like you actually believe that you're going to get it done and then be able to bring them home in that time frame. And number three, we're not going in alone; there are allies joining us in the mission. If those three things are in place, then I would consider sending our troops into harm's way.
The Singing Senator Who Found Love at IHOP
Feb. 19 was the centenary of the birth of Carson McCullers, one of the most distinctive and ill-fated writers in American history. McCullers died when she was 50, in 1967. She suffered a series of strokes before she was 30, and spent much of her life in pain.
Mr. Yang is not the first to label this period the fourth industrial revolution — the term was made popular by Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, at its annual meeting in Davos in 2016. Mr. Schwab's book of the same name argues that the fourth industrial revolution is transforming every sector of the economy and industry through new technologies that merge the physical, digital and biological realms.
I have seen the bodies of gang-raped nonagenarians. I have seen bodies left dead so long that your only shot at a t.o.d. is to weigh the maggots. But of all the bodies I have ever seen, none has stayed with me, in my gut, like the body of Jennifer Rockwell.
Correct me if I'm wrong. Did you ever meet anybody happier than Jennifer? Did you ever hear about anybody happier than Jennifer? More stable? She was, she was sunny.
The question is, what is the means to creating those jobs? What I'm suggesting is that if you were to put $12,000 a year into the hands of every American adult … Let's say there's a town in Missouri of 10,000 people. Let's say after I'm president, their disposable income goes up by $10 million a month. Where is that money going to go? It's going to go into car repairs, day care expenses, Little League sign-ups, the occasional night out.
The eighth item on the application's Articles of Employment, which requires applicants to sign their initials next to a list of beliefs, outlines Immanuel Christian's definition of marriage and stances on sexual identity.
I'm not a millennial. I'm older than you. I think I might be older than you, or very close. I am no millennial. I'm millennial thinking is what I am.
The underlying truth of a Covenantal Regime is that you have to close off choice if you want to get to the promised land. The people one sees in long, successful marriages have walked the stations of vulnerability. They've overthrown the proud ego and learned to be utterly dependent on the other. They've faced the ways they are difficult to be with and tried to address them. They've gone through all the normal episodes of confession, apology, defensiveness, forgiveness and loving the other most when there's nothing lovely about them.
The numbers. So keep in mind, I didn't just wake up and say, Hey, technology is changing the world. I spent seven years working in Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis, Baltimore and other cities that have been blasted by the waves of automation.
week after the museum trip, I joined the seminarians for Mass, which is at 7:00 each morning in Immaculate Conception Chapel, whose putty-colored walls are trimmed with gold and turquoise, and which smelled that morning of incense and after-shave. Many seminarians had been praying in the chapel since 6:15; prayer forms the core of the seminary experience, and the men talk about their prayer lives the way most people talk about their love lives. At times their prayer is strong, full and deep (some seminarians call this feeling the warm fuzzies); at others it is dry and without feeling, reverberating an emptiness through their lives. After morning Mass and breakfast, the seminarians attend classes, which include moral theology, philosophy, scripture and church history. During their fourth year, they practice celebrating the Mass and hearing confession, often from recent graduates, who return to campus and play the penitents, inventing sins for seminarians to hear. The Rev. Mark Moretti, one such volunteer who is now an associate pastor in Alexandria, Va., explained the purpose of such role playing: Are you able to judge what you're hearing? Are you able to give a suitable penance? If you have a little old lady coming in to confess her sins and you hammer her with a novena -- a penance lasting nine days -- you're too extreme. Bashista and the other deacons' first class this day was Marriage and Family, where seminarians were learning to prepare betrothed couples for marriage.
We speak of mixed motives as if they were a special case and our motives were normally pure. Maybe it's the other way around. In this instance, you're justly angry about what your ex has done. (I leave aside the issue of whether you have reason to reproach yourself for your own conduct: continuing to pursue a relationship with someone who, you'd learned, was in another one.) Still, it's important that, if you share your experience with the fiancée, you do so out of concern for her and not out of hatred for him. Which makes it important, in turn, that you ask yourself whether telling her will really be for her own good.
BA: I want to ask you about the — Oh, sorry, go ahead.
Public sympathy for the Huawei dynasty, however, slipped badly after a company employee was jailed for 251 days; he had sued the company for a bonus and was jailed for disclosing commercial secrets, though the charges were eventually dropped. It was a story that brought to the fore the concerns of a middle class increasingly facing economic hardship for the first time after decades of explosive economic growth.
For thousands of years, Jews have been embattled. Surrounded by enemies seeking to convert us, remove us, even exterminate us, we have developed collective defense mechanisms highly adaptive to combating persecution by anti-Semites. But we have not developed effective means of defending the Jewish future against our own actions and inactions. This is our urgent new challenge--to defend the Jewish future against voluntary self-destruction--and we must face it squarely, if we are to prevent the fulfillment of Isaiah's dire prophecy Your destroyers will come from your own ranks.

The six episodes, each an hour long, cover the long history of allegations against Mr. Kelly. They feature women who described being controlled or abused by him, often when they were teenagers, as well as associates and relatives of the singer.
Yes she's gone, I said. By her own hand.
I do not want the N.S.A. to outsource national security work to them. I want them to try and fight fire with fire and actually recruit using some of the same methods, and I want the N.S.A. to try and work with them to the extent that they're realistic, and they know that Google is going to be innovating in ways that the N.S.A. will not be able to do.
Since 1982, Alaska has been giving every resident an annual check from its $66.3 billion permanent fund, which gets at least 25 percent of the state's mineral royalties every year. The results of the experiment have been mixed — crippling poverty is low, but unemployment rates are among the highest in the country, and the fund's value fluctuates with oil prices.

THE JOFFREY BALLET at the David H. Koch Theater (March 29, 7:30 p.m.; March 30, 7 p.m.; through April 2). In 1995 the Joffrey Ballet, formed in 1956 by Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino in New York, relocated to Chicago. The Joyce Theater Foundation welcomes the company, now under the artistic direction of Ashley Wheater, back to town with performances of two programs, Wednesday through April 2. Gracing one is an updated Romeo & Juliet by Krzysztof Pastor; the other, part of a gala on Thursday, is a mixed bill featuring Yuri Possokhov's Bells, Christopher Wheeldon's Fool's Paradise and Myles Thatcher's Body of Your Dreams. In Mr. Pastor's Romeo & Juliet, the feuding Capulets and Montagues come to life across three decades, from the 1930s to the '90s.
Ms. Nguyen realized that during the pandemic, she has found hesitation and caution to be appealing traits in a date.
Under the policy, detailed in articles in The Times of London last week, four British women were each charged roughly $900 for the government's efforts to free them from a religious institution in Somalia where, they said, they had been chained, whipped and told they would be held until they married. The women's families had sent them there because they thought the women were too independent.
A 489-day hunger strike, an international campaign and pressure from Washington helped me regain my freedom on May 30, 2015. I felt more solidarity from strangers than I did from some of my own blood relatives.
Rhona Wurtele and her identical twin, Rhoda, began skiing at age 5 in the hilly Westmount neighborhood of Montreal. A few years later, they were ski-jumping, and in 1948 they were the only women named to Canada's Alpine skiing team at the Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland.
Well, I would suggest that one side has been acting as if it is an arms race. And so, in that environment, it's only appropriate to respond in a way that you think would help move the country and our legal system in the right direction. Can I talk — oh.

KK: How much money did you raise?
Yes, our progress has been uneven. The work of democracy has always been hard. It has been contentious. Sometimes it has been bloody. For every two steps forward, it often feels we take one step back. But the long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all, and not just some.

Why isn't that a path? Why couldn't we instead change how we do education in this country?
And why should it matter? In this Trump age of gross unreason, meeting incivility with civility has felt small to me, and futile. More and more, it feels as if the only way to be heard and understood is to give back exactly what I'm getting, not just from bilious Mr. Trump but from his base, otherwise known as my fellow Americans. That fact alone — that we are all Americans — has become infuriating. Watching those outrageous Trump rallies especially puts me on edge, seeing those red faces taunting Mexicans, Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi, in eager unison. The anger that was drawn to the surface in 2016 and stayed there quickly boils over. I feel like a fool for believing in racial harmony, for being taught at an early age that it is fundamental to the American project. I feel — again — that Malcolm X was right, black people are wasting their time trying to win over white people when they so clearly have no interest in being won over.

From the United States we can only look on with envy as European opera companies continue their seasons. Even amid the latest lockdown, the Bavarian State Opera in Munich is assembling to stream Dmitri Tcherniakov's new staging of Weber's Der Freischütz. The quintessentially Romantic story, earthy and supernatural, is recast here in the world of organized crime, and limited to a single setting: a penthouse suite where people have gathered to celebrate the marriage of Max (Pavel Cernoch) and Agathe (Golda Schultz), an event only hinted at in the opera's finale. Sounds about right for Tcherniakov, a director who revels in role-playing and psychological drama. JOSHUA BARONE

He's been around so long that now that he is going to be the leader of this country, he knows he must conduct himself with presidential composure, said Chuck Hagel, a longtime friend of Mr. Biden's who served as defense secretary in the administration of President Barack Obama and before that as a Republican senator from Nebraska. He knows the only way we'll be able to start to climb out of this hole is for the leader of the country to be seen as fair and open and not dwelling on the negative.
Ms. Culp was a producer for the Netflix crime documentary series Exhibit A in 2019 and for The Confession Tapes in 2017. Now in its second season, The Confession Tapes, which tells of wrongful convictions, was nominated for best episodic series by the International Documentary Association. She is also a fellow for the Power of Diversity Master Workshop run by the Producers Guild of America.
Allan Holdsworth, a self-taught guitarist whose protean, virtuosic style was a source of amazement even to his more famous peers, died on Saturday at his home in Vista, Calif. He was 70.
MC: He has my vote. All right. [LAUGHTER]
INVENTGENUITY FESTIVAL AT PUBLIC SCHOOL 32/MIDDLE SCHOOL 442 (Jan. 21-22) Yes, this event celebrates the marriage of invention and ingenuity, and every year hundreds gather in Brooklyn to help create those principles' offspring. An engineering Woodstock for children 7 through 17, this free festival comes from Beam Center, an arts organization offering classes, workshops and summer camps. Inventgenuity features a theme — this year it's Organic Mechanics — and a collaborative project. On Saturday and Sunday, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., participants (registration is required) will construct The Wind Farm, an installation by Mitchell Dose. They'll design and sew inflatable fabric crops that will bloom to life via a hand-built fan. Also on the bill: low-cost workshops to make crawling creature bots, moisture sensors, glowing floral badges and other cool D.I.Y. devices.
Amanda's and Joon's crossword — and story — were so good, I wanted to share it with you.
What's the power you have when you are playing a role? How do you think about that?
KK: I thought you were going to say it's a lot harder to ride the subway now because of the breakdowns of New York infrastructure.
A donor would usually go to a bank once or twice a week over months to produce enough sperm to sell to dozens of families.
Now, after two millennia of persecution and victimization, we may well be moving into a new era of Jewish life during which we will not be persecuted or victimized. If this comes to pass, we will need to refocus our attention on defining the positive qualities of Jewish life that ought to make us want to remain Jews without help from our enemies. We must become positively Jewish instead of merely reacting to our enemies.
La Cage, you would be good.
I grew up in an entirely secular household. My parents did not talk about God in the house, but I had this instinctive belief in a higher power. I had many Christian relatives. I went to church over holidays growing up quite often. And then I married my wife, Evelyn, who's Christian. And so, we're raising our kids in a Christian church. I go to church when I'm home, which is not very often unfortunately nowadays. I enjoy it. My faith is still very much a journey, but I'm unreservedly thrilled about the impact it has on my wife, my boys, my family, my community.
We talked about the concept of systemic racism in policing, and you said that you didn't think police officers are operating with racist assumptions. Do you think police officers operate with unconscious bias? Police officers, as you know, they have enormous discretion and power. They carry guns. They can end lives. And I think what people who are protesting and demonstrating now are talking about are decisions that don't feel conscious. They may not be intentional. But they are baked into how people operate and how they police.
You're talking about the need for change. And I wonder, just to start, what your views are on what needs to change in policing.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, like Mr. Yang, has argued that the country's approach to antitrust regulation is outmoded. In early 2019, the Federal Trade Commission created a new task force focused on monitoring competition in technology markets, which the foundation celebrated as a step toward modernizing antitrust.
BA: Just before we move on, maybe I can ask one more question.
So were you good or bad? Were you good? I didn't watch Loving, I'll be honest with you.
Elizabeth M. Schneider always had a soft spot for Yalies — her father and son went there — and she could belt out Bulldog football team fight songs and the Bright College Years unofficial alma mater with the best of them.
Mary Catherine Bateson, a cultural anthropologist who was the author of quietly groundbreaking books on women's lives — and who as the only child of Margaret Mead had once been one of the most famous babies in America — died on Jan. 2 in Lebanon, N.H. She was 81.
Wow, I love this question. There are many causes of poverty, and the fact that we're not able to put food into people's houses and on their tables is a structural problem. My campaign's based upon the premise that we're going through this profound economic transformation, the fourth industrial revolution. And one of the major problems is that we still pretend we're in the economy of the '70s or '80s.
Our guide to cultural events in New York City for families with children and teenagers.
A native of New Jersey, Dr. Biden grew up in Willow Grove, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia. Plain-spoken with a Philly accent, Dr. Biden has approached her new role with the same folksy touch her husband tends to employ — Call me Jill! she said last week to allies who joined her on a Zoom call. But she is not without flashes of grit: During the presidential campaign, she put herself between her husband, 77 at the time, and a group of unruly vegan protesters.
The books have the same publisher. They credit the same authors. But they are customized for students in different states, and their contents sometimes diverge in ways that reflect the nation's deepest partisan divides.
She voted for Hillary Clinton because she objected to President Trump's proposed border wall and his characterizations of immigrants. I can't say that I would have voted for her just because of the economy, Anna said.
Another congregation that is working with those grappling with religious trauma is the Holy Trinity Community Church in Nashville, with a membership that is over 80 percent L.G.B.T.
So I hope my perspective on being a progressive who is also a pragmatist will help get things done.
Any American who wants to gamble online on a poker site can do so from any state in the country right now. If it's illegal in your state, you just end up using an offshore betting site, which is shady, has problems, but it's not going to ease your gambling addiction at all. So the question is, do we want Americans, in the vast majority of the country, on offshore betting sites, dealing with shady characters and generating no revenue and still being addicted? Or would we prefer that they do business with American firms, where we do have better regulations, we know they're not getting cheated, we know they're not getting exploited, and you generate tax revenue that you can use to treat gambling addiction.
That's right. And in that regard, it's a lot like the Brexit debate itself. The people who voted to leave imagined some greater Britain. But instead, they may wind up not only with a much diminished country, but with a much diminished monarchy.
Everyone knows my flagship proposal is this Freedom Dividend of $1,000 a month for every American adult, which is not a new idea. And it's not my idea. Thomas Paine was for it at the founding of the country. Martin Luther King fought for it and was fighting for it when he was assassinated. So after I'm the nominee and I defeat Donald Trump, everyone will know that I'm in the White House because of the Freedom Dividend.
I mean, that's not solely an American decision. NATO expansion is something that is fraught and elevates tensions with Russia in particular. I think we should explore it. I'm sympathetic, but it's not a decision we can make alone.
He articulated a vision for the future of work, education and technology for the nation. The board also delved into Mr. Yang's approach to foreign policy and military intervention, and learned of his fascination with aliens and fear of flying vacuum cleaners.
I mean, what I would love to see is law enforcement go to anybody that's willing to represent the Black community and have that conversation. What do you feel we're doing? And then we tell them, here's what we're actually doing. Now, how can we bring you, the community, to us and we meet in the middle? Is it that we need more social workers to where a police officer isn't acting like a social worker? Do we need to get more financing towards where we can make a phone call — we being the police — to say, I need a psychiatrist here. And instead of them saying, well, we've got to find somebody, it's going to take two or three hours, because we don't have the money to put anybody there. Or, can it be, yeah, we've got a person on call. They'll be there in 10 minutes. So now we can stand by and wait for them, and then they can take over that mental health aspect, that child protection thing. We are asked to do a myriad of things that are socially driven. And what I would rather see, like I was talking about having the ability to have a social worker on call.
KK: O.K. Moving onto a perhaps slightly less serious topic.
The Jews in the Novogrudok ghetto sent word to Bielski: they wanted him to mount an attack to release them from the ghetto. Bielski smuggled a message back: he reiterated his offer of shelter, but he didn't have the resources to help them escape. With no other option, the last survivors of the Novogrudok ghetto, including Rae, Lisa, Chanon and Naum Kushner, Sonya Oshman, and Jack Kagan, began to dig day and night. They smuggled implements from their work sites: pieces of wood, spoons. After long hours of labor under Nazi overseers, they stayed up all night, removing bags of dirt from the tunnel and passing them along a human chain to be stacked behind the walls to hide their activity. They worked like this for three months, at one point assigning the Jewish electrician to wire the tunnel with lights. The initial plan was to build a 150-meter tunnel to terminate in a cornfield, but the harvest came, and they had to more than double the length. Chanon Kushner, by now eighteen, was among the dozens of Jews who dug out the earth. As the tunnel neared completion, one of their number became frightened, saying the Nazis would surely catch and kill them all. The others worried he was going to inform on them to the Nazis, so they took him into the tunnel and choked him to death.
That is why many manuals offer advice for navigating communication traps. They counsel asking your partner whether it is a good time to talk (since couples routinely broach complicated topics on the fly), and striking a balance between empathy and problem-solving. If your partner is an avoider, don't give up trying to connect. If your partner is an emoter, stay compassionate and firm: I'll be able to respond better if you take it down a couple of notches. In bad moments, we all need these skills.
Absolutely. It was unbelievable. And I remember how irritated my eyes were. But yet, it was a physical manifestation of the irritation. So that was that. But it also taught me, like, wow, at the right time, if that can happen, how dramatically appealing it can be.
On a rainy night at the end of September 1943, as the Rosh Hashanah holiday was beginning, the residents of the ghetto decided conditions were right. With rain pounding down, they loosened a sheet of tin on the roof to add to the din. The electrician shorted the electric wires to dim the searchlights. The two hundred and fifty or so remaining residents lined up, the youngest and strongest in the front. The tunnel was claustrophobic, only large enough for one person to crawl through at a time. The lineup ensured that if anyone elderly fainted and blocked the tiny tunnel, there'd be fewer stuck behind. Rae and Lisa, though they were young, decided to stay back with their father. Lashed together with ropes and belts so they wouldn't lose their way, wriggling through a sixty-centimeter-wide dirt tunnel with another human's feet in their faces, all two hundred fifty Jews escaped Novogrudok.
If public attention glared on Lindbergh during the hunt for his son, it positively poured down on him with the arrest and trial of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a Bronx carpenter, in 1934. The trial, which Lindbergh attended daily, was reported with diligence and sensationalism. Lindbergh received up to 100,000 letters a week, and the Hopewell estate, which he had long since left, was overrun with curiosity seekers, one of whom dug up and lugged off the earth where the baby was found buried. A Move to England After a six-week trial, in which a web of circumstantial evidence was women about Hauptmann, he was found guilty and executed. Although there were doubts (Hauptmann, the German-born father of a son about the age of Lindbergh's son, denied he was guilty), Lindbergh was satisfied that Hauptmann did the thing. Meantime, there were new threats to kidnap Lindbergh's second son, Jon, and the family was living an abnormal existence. Lindbergh was telling friends that Americans exhibited a morbid curiosity over crimes and murder trials and lacked respect for law, or the rights of others. Against this background, Lindbergh took his family to England to seek a safe, secluded residence away from the tremendous public hysteria that surrounded him in the United States. One result of the case was passage of the so-called Lindbergh law, which made kidnapping a Federal crime. Part of the statute was ruled unconstitutional in 1967. Before departing, Lindbergh completed a scientific project on which he had been working with dedication and enthusiasm since 1930.
Sometimes, property owners try to hide flaws. Vincent Fundaro, the owner of Square One Professional Home Inspectors in Levittown, N.Y., was inspecting a ground floor condominium on West 22nd Street in Manhattan last April. The apartment, which was listed for $1.8 million, had new kitchen cabinets and new floors. As he walked through the garden level, he tripped over a white shag carpet, revealing the floorboards, which were floating in water. The owner had covered the boards with newspaper and plastic to keep the water from seeping through, but the water problem was unmistakable. It was definitely saturated, Mr. Fundaro said. You would step on it and float.
Eventually she moved in with my aunt and uncle, who live in a log house in Washington. I flew out last spring to help take care of her. One morning before dawn, she entered the guest room where I was sleeping. She had no pants on. Soft light filtered in through the open window, and she flicked on the lights to signal what she thought was waking time. Her knees shook beneath her as she stood on unsteady feet. I told her to go back to bed, but she couldn't make sense of my words without her hearing aids. Instead, she repeated the nonsense phrase she thought she heard: Go that to said? It's a game she and her sisters used to play, only now the game gets played every day.
He wife, Ann Sweeny Reynolds, said the cause was heart failure.
The question of whether to prioritize free public college has divided the Democratic candidates. Senators Warren and Sanders say that four-year public colleges should be free, and Senator Cory Booker signed on to legislation that could make it debt-free. Senator Amy Klobuchar previously criticized the idea of free college for all, but then signed on to a version of a free-college proposal. Mr. Yang, though, has said he supports forgiving more student loan debt but thinks the Freedom Dividend is a better solution to inequality than free college.
Instead of this absurd division into sexes they ought to class people as static and dynamic. — Evelyn Waugh, Decline and Fall
The movie premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last year and came out on top with three awards, including the grand jury prize for documentary in the world cinema showcase.
People came up to me afterward and said: 'No one ever preaches on that. Thank you.' Holloway gave me a tape of a lecture he delivered to teen-age boys, in which he told them: Let me be perfectly clear. Sometimes people just won't say this: masturbation is always a seriously disordered act. . . . In itself, it is always wrong. He urged the boys to confess their sins, and afterward, I was told, they did, lining up in scores outside the confessionals. And if they hadn't? If you preach on these topics, you're going to endure a wrath, Bashista said. But if you are indeed teaching the truth -- what the church is saying, that has transcended time -- Christ says, you're going to endure ridicule. Because He did.
Although they were equal partners in running the company and were aligned in what Mr. Black refers to as their core values — if you lead with kindness, he said, you're not going to kick someone in the shins afterward — they fell flat romantically. Despite couples therapy and intimate getaways, Ms. Griffin-Black said, it got to be too much and we realized we couldn't 'have it all' together. They divorced in 2007.
Her death was confirmed by her goddaughter, Ellen Coghlan.
Molina has been doing wonderful work in the series, and this week he has one of his best moments, when he is overcome by a sense of shared pride at seeing Joan Crawford surrounded by a crowd of fans after a preview of Baby Jane. It's extremely vulnerable work from him. He bursts with happiness for her. (Jessica Lange's stare back at him is an intense kaleidoscope of pride, gratitude and steely self-satisfaction.) Aldrich's career unhappiness post-Baby Jane is evident when we see him directing a bullying and uncooperative Frank Sinatra (Toby Huss) in 4 for Texas and trying to assuage the fears of Davis, who is baffled that the offers haven't been pouring in.
You moved into a color when they want black and white in that situation.
Not a few designers who yearned to be named to her annual AD100 issue, listing the top 100 designers in the world, were distraught at being left out.
The Spanish Socialist Party confirmed her death, saying emergency services had discovered her body. An autopsy was to be performed. Ms. Chacón was known to have had a congenital heart condition.
Democrats argued back that the President's actions were wrong and deserved censure but did not rise to the level of impeachment. Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the House minority whip, said Republicans were trying to hijack an election and hound the President out of office.
And in brief, what does this mean about their status within the royal family? How did that shake out? Are they still royals?
Well, the Department of the Attention Economy would likely be based in Silicon Valley, and it'd be run by a guy named Tristan Harris, who's a design ethicist. He started Time Well Spent. So I don't think it's necessarily the case that you need to try and bring everyone into the cubicles in D.C. to get the rules ——
One of the strangest and most haunting objects in 21st-century Istanbul is the twisted bronze monument called the Serpent Column, a fifth-century B.C. monument to the Greeks' victory over the Persians. Still standing inside the shattered remains of the hippodrome, broken and yet superbly elegant, it was commissioned by the Spartan general Pausanius and moved to its present location by Constantine himself in A.D. 324. One cannot help but feel, Hughes writes, that Pausanius would be secretly pleased to know that this monument — a rather etiolated creature now — is one of the few remaining classical antiquities to survive back in modern Istanbul in the public space next to the Blue Mosque, today a favorite lunch-break stop for tourists and young Istanbullus. It's like a root from a vanished forest that has accidentally survived.
You have to go back to May of 2018 and the wedding of Prince Harry and his American bride, Meghan Markle. And on one level, this wedding had all the elements that one would expect from a royal wedding.
So were you good or bad? Were you good? I didn't watch Loving, I'll be honest with you.
Spoilers ahead for the first season of Russian Doll.
A judge late last month ordered the removal of the portraits ahead of Terrance Shipp Jr.'s Jan. 4 trial, ruling that the presence of the artwork, depicting judges who served in Fairfax County, could have suggested that the legal system is biased. The judge, David Bernhard of the Fairfax Circuit Court, wrote in his Dec. 20 opinion that the court was concerned the portraits might serve as unintended but implicit symbols that suggest the courtroom may be a place historically administered by whites for whites, and that others are thus of lesser standing. The display of portraits of judges in courtrooms of the Fairfax Courthouse is based on a non-racial principle, yet yields a racial result, he said.
Yeah, they lean into it, as opposed to distance themselves.
There has been a continuing controversy over Hong Kong's law banning masks to target anti-government protesters. One court ruling found it unconstitutional, but a later ruling temporarily reinstated it.

Mr. Trump brought to the stage Cissie Graham Lynch, a granddaughter of Billy Graham, the founder of Christianity Today, to offer an implicit rebuke of the magazine's recent editorial calling for his removal from the White House.
I told myself I would never fall down the wife trap rabbit hole.
Yeah, I think that might happen. We might see a lot of La Cage aux Folles or something like that. But you would be good in that. You would be very good, if you want to sing and dance.
BA: Your proposal is oddly regressive. On the benefits side you're proposing that people will have to choose between this benefit and their existing federal benefits while someone like me just all the sudden gets a new check in their mailbox every month. On the funding side you're relying on a VAT, which is an inherently regressive funding mechanism. You've proposed some offsets, but I still don't understand why you don't just embrace a progressive approach to taxation. Either raise top rates or a wealth tax. If there are people who need help, why aren't you trying to help them as much as possible?
I think it's actually unfortunate that I get asked about those sorts of questions, in the sense that I feel like men should leave the room and let women decide what to do with your bodies. I have a feeling I know what you would decide, and then we could come back and say, Hey, what did you decide? I also think that if men got pregnant, this would be a very, very different conversation. And we'd have a completely different approach to these issues. So, I don't have a short list of Supreme Court justice appointees, but safeguarding women's reproductive rights and having an evolving sense of the law would be very important.
Let me explain. I'm a parent. I've got — how many of you all are parents? So if your kids are like my kids, they are mesmerized by any screen that is nearby. I regularly challenge my kids. I say, What's more important? People or screens? And they know the right answer's people. And then if they say screens, then I hold them upside down by their ankles until they say, People, people. And the people that are most diligent about screen time are the tech folks in Silicon Valley. You go there, and all of a sudden there's not a screen to be had because they know that we have the smartest engineers in the country turning supercomputers into dopamine delivery devices for kids, because that's how they make their millions of dollars.
Mr. Gomes uses Dvorak's American String Quartet (No. 12 in F major, Op. 96) to tell a tale of social relations in small-town America. One man wants to leave (with suitcase) despite his powerful affection for the woman we may assume is his wife. Two pairs of male-female lovers spend time together, with one couple reaching the marriage ceremony as the ballet ends (veil, bouquet, trousseau, confetti); but one of these two men is keener on the other man than on his own girlfriend, and so sulks when his devotion is rejected.
He's right, of course. Women in politics have long been subjected to much closer scrutiny than men; in 1917, the first female member of Congress, Jeannette Rankin, took office and The Washington Post ran an article headlined: Congresswoman Rankin Real Girl; Likes Nice Gowns and Tidy Hair.
Will the man chosen to be the next Pope be willing to give bishops greater autonomy -- thus opening the door for discussion of other changes, like relaxing the moral doctrine and even reconsidering celibacy and the role of women? Whatever happens, the Catholic laity may well continue do as it thinks best in the moral sphere. American Catholics have matured, says William D'Antonio, a research professor at Catholic University. Vatican II has succeeded. The real documents of Vatican II are freedom of conscience and the responsibility of individuals not to blithely follow the leader. According to the University of Maryland Survey Research Center, more than two-thirds of Catholics say that when their conscience is at odds with the Pope, they should follow their conscience.
The general thesis of the book is essentially sound, if heavily weighted on the seamy side. This book deals for the most part with wide social pathologies — the divorce rate, growing sexual inversion and prostitution rather than courtship, marriage and parenthood. Tackling these social pathologies, sometimes with a detail and frankness to which the American reader is only just accustomed, Mr. McPartland illustrates his main theme, that since World War I America has changed drastically from a sex-shy, inhibited people to a hedonistic, cynical people, openly in search of pleasure, and that our old ethics of home and family have rotted away, leaving nothing except a few sporting rules. There are vivid descriptions of the sordid divorce mills, and other institutions which exploit broken lives. But primarily this is not a source book, but a long ethical essay, with considerable gaiety, humor and a refreshing time perspective. ...

To address the racial disparities in health exposed by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately claimed the lives of people of color, he pledged to increase funding for community health centers, and also intends to fund efforts to mitigate the pandemic in prisons and jails, where African-Americans and Latinos are overrepresented.
Tom Fesen, 30, a deacon from Trenton, took a job after college at Chemical Bank in New York, where he commuted each day from his home in New Jersey. There were two buses; one came too late and one came too early, he recalls. So I came early. The bus dropped me off across the street from a church, so I decided, I'll go into this church, get a little peace of mind. Mass would be about 20 minutes. So six months into this, the reader left, and the priest came up to me and said, 'Do you want to read during Mass?' I said: 'No, I don't want to. I'm just here a little early.' Immediately after that, he said, 'Well, do you want to be a priest?' I was so irritated, Fesen continues. Where does he come off? I'm going to be a banker; get married; 2.5 kids, house in the suburbs, dog. But after that I couldn't get the thought out of my mind. Bashista regards celibacy as a crucial aspect of his priesthood, which will not be a job so much as a way of life -- a marriage to the church. 'Some days I'll think: What if I was back at the architecture firm? Would I be a partner now? Married? Have kids?' he says. 'But the match has been made.'
If you run an organization, imagine having an organization that has the wrong measurements. How is that organization going to fare over time? That is where we are in the United States of America right now. We're riding a century-old measurement off a cliff, while our way of life deteriorates underneath our feet. If you looked at levels of anxiety, stress, mental health, depression, suicides, drug overdoses, you would see that we're in a mental health recession or depression, we're in a wellness or life expectancy recession or depression, and the corporate profits are going to keep on going up, because in the 21st-century economy, companies can do very, very well while not hiring a lot of people, not treating them as full-time employees, and they don't need to care what happens in their own backyard because they sell everywhere.
In the first flush of success, Catholic intellectuals who had been pressing for reforms--an end to censorship and the exclusive reliance on sholasticism--celebrated victory over the bad old days. Enough time has now passed since the Second Vatican Council that we can evaluate the rights and wrongs of this history in a new way, temper the exuberance of the modernizers, and pay at least a guarded tribute to the convert intellectuals and their work. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the Promethean self-confidence of the new sciences had seemed likely to sweep everything before it. Darwinism and the principle of evolutionary development had been applied widely to other phenomena and appeared irresistibly compelling to several generations of scientists, historians, philosophers, and social scientists. Evolutionists had scornfully dismissed the fixed principles and the unchanging universe of scholasticism and regarded it as easy to refute, if they bothered to look at it at all. Marxism, another developmental theory, which enjoyed its greatest vogue in the English-speaking countries between about 1890 and 1950, was no less scornful of Catholic thought, treating it either as an opiate for the oppressed or as the instrument of domination which a master class wielded against its subordinates. By now, however, these rival orthodoxies have, in their turn, worn thin. Evolution is still a central theory in biology but hardly in economics, anthropology, political science, or psychology, where it once ruled imperiously. From evolution sprang eugenics, the science of population manipulation, whose horrific face Hitler displayed to the world.
PragerU has expanded Dennis Prager's reach, but it has not fundamentally changed his days.
The fact that all the houses generally look the same had almost no weight on my conscience, said Mr. Paz, who works in financial services in Jersey City, N.J. As long as the house is nice, and the neighbors are nice, and they take good care of their houses, that's what matters.
Common Defense's End the Forever War pledge advocates for an expedient conclusion to the global war on terror and American military involvement in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, and Mr. Yang became the fourth candidate to sign on, in May, following Senators Sanders and Warren (and former Senator Mike Gravel).
Our messed-up heroine is Clara (Karla Souza, clearly delighted to escape the constraints of her lugubrious character on How to Get Away With Murder), an OB-GYN by day and a drunken karaoke singer by night. Fumbling hookups with random men temporarily banish her loneliness without extinguishing her torch for Daniel (José María Yazpik), the lover who abandoned her eight years earlier. Guess who shows up, though, to a family wedding to derail Clara's fledgling bond with a cuddly Australian co-worker (Ben O'Toole)? And guess whose clothing soon evaporates in the heat of Daniel's twinkling attention?
KK: So let's get into it. We have about 90 minutes together. In your assessment, what are the policy breakdowns that lead to Americans still being hungry today?
He was passed over for the grant, but he did complete the series of drawings, as the MoMA show will attest. They're among his best works, combining freely sketched passages with images from newspapers and magazines; they translate a 14th-century epic into a language of his own devising. The Inferno drawings represent, among other things, a triumph over Rauschenberg's dyslexia, signaling his love of literature. I had a book of Botticelli's wonderful illustrations of the 'Inferno,' Mr. Johns noted recently, referring to the years when he lived a flight below Rauschenberg in a loft building on Front Street. I believe that Bob's looking at that triggered his own.
The buyer, who was supposed to put down a large deposit that afternoon, was livid. The seller's broker tried to assure her that the problem could be easily fixed. But Mr. Fundaro spoke up. I turned around and said it's not a simple glue and patch fix, he said. He never found out what effect his findings had on the sale.
If there is one thing that this latest violation of online privacy teaches us, it is that — in the words of Scott McNealy, the chief executive of Sun Microsystems, back in 1999 — You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it.
Really? So, we have to get done what we can get done. And if we have to focus on things that are traditionally bipartisan, I'd be excited to lead with that. I mean, I'd be much more excited to lead with a much bigger agenda to balance out this economy, to work for people. And I will say that's bipartisan, too. When I go around to Americans around the country, if you were to go to a room of Republicans and say, Hey, how do you feel about Amazon paying zero in taxes? They're not excited about that. They feel like this economy is rigged against them and their families, and they're generally correct, and that is bipartisan.
I am the eldest of five adult children. While packing up the family home after our father died (our mother predeceased him), I came across a copy of my parents' marriage certificate. They celebrated their anniversary on Jan. 12, so I was surprised to see the actual date was Jan. 6. But I was even more surprised to see the year: 1962 — after the first three children were born. I'm smiling just writing this. Good on them! Question: Should I tell my siblings?
Mr. Yang's argument that he is pulling 10 percent or more of Trump supporters was not rated favorably on PolitiFact — the 10 percent figure comes from a July YouGov poll, and subsequent polls found the number to be lower.
He was the adolescent version of Don Ameche's character in Sins of Man (1936), and of Ricardo Cortez's character in The Californian (1937), and of Tyrone Powers's character in In Old Chicago (1938), among others. A breakthrough was when he played the young version of James Stewart's character in Of Human Hearts (1938), an MGM movie that earned him a contract with that studio.
That Mr. Biden finds himself in this role at all is an unlikely turn of events for a man whose political career seemed to have stalled or ended so many times, including when tragedy struck just after he won his first election to the Senate in 1972. But after 36 years in the chamber and eight years as vice president, he became a familiar figure in the country's political consciousness. When Americans sought a way back to stability after four years of tumult, Mr. Biden felt like a comfort to many voters. As Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, one of Mr. Biden's most important supporters in the primary race, is fond of saying and repeated in an interview on Tuesday: We know Joe and Joe knows us.
Aisha Harris: Back in September, you actually spoke out on behalf of the comedian Shane Gillis, who had been hired on SNL and then was quickly fired after some racist comments were stirred up that he had made in the past on one of his podcasts. And you said you didn't want to be judged for something you had done 25 years ago. But Gillis's comments were maybe a year ago. So I'm curious as to, in your mind, how long of a period of time should it be before someone faces some sort of consequences for something they've done in the past?
Earmarking allows Congress to appropriate discretionary funds for specific projects. Mr. Yang supports them because he feels they allow representatives to generate revenue for their constituents to offset costs their area might experience from a given piece of legislation.

A crenelated wall of books encircles my bed, its tottering towers looming ever taller, always on the verge of collapsing onto oblivious sleepers.

Having both sets of parents here in San Francisco for the wedding, it's almost like mission accomplished, where they can see how happy their kids are in all respects, Mr. Lau said.
The Days of Abandonment is told from the perspective of Olga, a woman whose husband, Mario, has just left her and their young son and daughter for another woman. The story unfolds in often excruciating psychological detail, as Olga falls apart and then pulls herself together again. We have little access to Mario's inner life. Ties puts the same plot elements through a kaleidoscope, telling the tale from three different perspectives, first that of the wife, Vanda, then of the husband, Aldo, and eventually that of their grown children, jumping backward and forward in time over an arc of decades.

July 18, 1959 OBITUARY Billie Holiday Dies Here at 44; Jazz Singer Had Wide Influence BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Billie Holiday, famed jazz singer, died yesterday in Metropolitan Hospital. Her age was 44. The immediate cause of death was given as congestion of the lungs complicated by heart failure. Miss Holiday had lived at 26 West Eighty-seventh Street. She had been under arrest in her hospital bed since June 12 for illegal possession of narcotics. Miss Holiday set a pattern during her most fruitful years that has proved more influential than that of almost any other jazz singer, except the two who inspired her, Louis Armstrong and the late Bessie Smith. Miss Holiday became a singer more from desperation than desire. She was named Eleanora Fagan after her birth in Baltimore. She was the daughter of a 13-year-old mother, Sadie Fagan, and a 15-year-old father who were married there years after she was born. The first and major influence on her singing came when as a child she ran errands for the girls in a near-by brothel in return for the privilege of listening to recordings by Mr. Armstrong and Miss Smith. Miss Holiday took her professional name from her father, Clarence Holiday, a guitarist who played with Fletcher Henderson's band in the Nineteen Twenties and from one of the favorite movie actresses of her childhood, Billie Dove. She came to New York with her mother in 1928.

To them, I'll let the Rolling Stones answer: You can't always get what you want, but sometimes you get what you need. My students need to learn how to be lawyers and professionals. To succeed they must internalize an ethos of caution, care and respect. To instill these values and skills in my students, I have no choice but to limit laptop use in the classroom.
OK, he showed a picture. That's a picture. Now, we all know a picture is worth 1,000 words. We know what it appears from the picture. We don't know what led up to that, where exactly in time that was. But with all that being said, you are correct. There's no reason to kick a suspect. And we don't train to do that. We're not allowed to do that. That's normally not the course of business. So that part of the question, I would agree and answer that no, it shouldn't be done. However, do I take Paul Howard's word that that's what that picture meant? No, sir, I do not. But that's why we have investigations. And even though it's been numerous times the media has jumped out and swore that that officer was wrong, but after all the evidence and the videos were looked at properly and in context, almost all of those have been turned over — or they haven't been found guilty. But yet, the video started out looking bad. And if we're going to get to a society where mayors and district attorneys can look at video and go, that looks bad, I don't like it, so I'm going to terminate you and charge you with murder — that's a bad precedent to start.
I think he meets just about every conventional definition of dictator. Yes.
To help make his point, the evidence was laid out on tables: a big bag of cash, bundles of drugs, high-powered firearms, all confiscated by law enforcement agents working the borderlands in South Texas.
It would seem that the worst and most corrupt president in American history would be easy to remove. Yet tyrants around the world have come to power and stayed, because people did not take the threat seriously and consoled themselves with false assurances — He can't win, or It won't happen again — instead of doing the hard work to be sure it does not happen!

One year after Stefan's death, Katherine returns to their home in Brussels. Her mother (Mary Kay Place) has suffered a minor stroke and is in need of medical care. In between her visits to the hospital, Katherine unpacks the mess Stefan left behind. She finds matchboxes with the name of his favorite club written on them — the first bread crumb in a trail that leads Katherine to suspect her husband's death was a conspiracy.
Another career high point was Luis Buñuel's comedy The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972), another winner of the best foreign language film Oscar, in which she played one of a group of cultured guests at a dinner party that turns increasingly surreal.
This simplest of smoothies, fairly thick, deliciously tart-sweet and fragrant, makes no claims of enhancing your immune system, ridding your face of wrinkles or saving your marriage. Made with high-quality Alphonso mangoes and Ronnybrook Farm yogurt, this new mango lassi is made by Monsieur Singh — a company founded by Karan Gera, an entrepreneur — with Ronnybrook. Previously, Mr. Gera produced and sold frozen lassi in pints. The new drink is satisfying enough to tide you over when breakfast or lunch are given short shrift. You could sip it alongside a meal, or pour some like an affogato over mango sorbet for dessert. The eight-ounce serving has 160 calories.
Mr. Yang has frequently reiterated his commitment to a two-state solution but has not released any detailed plans about how he would advance an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan or address Mr. Trump's policies in the region. He told the Council on Foreign Relations, I don't want to prescribe the specifics of a two-state solution, as the Israeli and Palestinian people both need to be leading any conversation, and I look forward to engaging with all stakeholders.
With some of today's older Jews, it is exactly the opposite: they refuse to read the good news, even when it is demonstrably true. They insist on focusing on the oys rather than the joys of Judaism, as Rabbi Moshe Waldoks put it. This is understandable, in light of the long history of persecution. Like an individual victim of a violent crime who sees his assailant around every corner, the Jewish people have been traumatized by our unrelenting victimization at the hands of Jew-haters. It is impossible for anyone who did not personally experience the Holocaust, or the other repeated assaults on Jewish life throughout our history, to comprehend what it must have been like to be victimized by unrelenting persecution based on primitive Jew-hating. We continue to see anti-Semitism even where it has ceased to exist, or we exaggerate it where it continues to exist in marginalized form. Indeed, some Jewish newspapers refuse to print, and some Jewish organizations refuse to acknowledge, the good news, lest they risk alienating their readerships or losing their membership. For example, in November of 1996 I saw a fundraising letter from a Jewish organization which claimed that anti-Semitism ... appears to be growing more robust, more strident, more vicious--and more `respectable.' Well-intentioned as this organization is, it seeks support by exaggerating the threats we currently face and by comparing them to those we faced during the Holocaust.

The title character of My Name Is Lucy Barton, Rona Munro's crystalline stage adaptation of Elizabeth Strout's 2016 novel, is hardly a woman of mystery. On the contrary, as embodied with middle-American forthrightness by a perfectly cast Laura Linney, in the production that opened Wednesday at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, Lucy may be the most translucent figure now on a New York stage.
After doing a halftime show at Grand Canyon University in Phoenix on March 7, Borstelmann packed up his Chrysler minivan and made the four-day cross-country drive to Greensboro, N.C., where he was scheduled to perform during the Atlantic Coast Conference men's basketball tournament. About 15 minutes after he checked into his hotel on March 11, he got the news that conference officials were canceling the tournament. Borstelmann sat on his bed watching ESPN's SportsCenter and tried to digest what it all meant.
Mr. Hawley sharply criticized the decision by Loews, which was established in 1960 and owns or operates 26 properties in the United States and Canada. If these corporations don't want conservatives to speak, they should just be honest about it, he said in a statement. But to equate leading a debate on the floor of the Senate with inciting violence is a lie, and it's dangerous. I will not be deterred from representing my constituents, and I will not bow to left-wing corporate pressure. Mr. Hawley persisted in his challenge to the election results even after the mob was cleared out of the Capitol this month, forcing the House and Senate into two hours of debate over Pennsylvania's electoral votes even though he never made a specific charge of wrongdoing. The rejection by Loews came after Simon & Schuster said that it would cancel the publication of an upcoming book by Mr. Hawley, The Tyranny of Big Tech, which had been scheduled to be published in June. Simon & Schuster said that it had made the decision because we take seriously our larger public responsibility as citizens, and cannot support Senator Hawley after his role in what became a dangerous threat. Mr. Hawley had said the cancellation could not be more Orwellian, and added, We'll see you in court. In recent days, a flurry of companies have suspended donations to some of the Republicans who voted to block the certification of the Electoral College results.

While conservative Catholics have doubled down on abortion policy and religious freedom for the past four years, Mr. Biden's policy priorities reflect those of Pope Francis, who has sought to turn the church's attention from sexual politics to issues like environmental protection, poverty and migration.
Earlier this year, the Library of America published a volume of McCullers's short stories, plays, essays, memoirs and poems. But it's the author's fiction (also published by the Library of America, among others) that keeps her reputation strong a century on. Her debut, The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, is routinely listed among the best books of the 20th century, and Rose Feld's assessment of it in the Book Review in 1940 proves that its towering reputation was formed more or less immediately.
So it became a natural focus of Suhail Zaheer Lari, a prominent Pakistani historian and author, who dedicated himself to documenting the history of Sindh Province, in southern Pakistan. He had a passion for photography, and his images of Makli's riches became the basis of several proposals for their conservation.
East Wind is what its 72 residents call an intentional community, a modern descendant of the utopian colonies and communes of centuries past where individuals share everything from meals, chores and living space to work, income, domestic responsibilities and the burden of self-governance. The term intentional community dates to the late 1940s, when the Inter-Community Exchange — an organization formed in Yellow Springs, Ohio, in the wake of World War II to help promote peaceful, cooperative living arrangements (in the hope of eradicating war altogether) — changed its name to the Fellowship of Intentional Communities; the founders felt the new title better conveyed the deliberateness with which these groups were assembling. The members of East Wind, for example, range in age from infancy to 76: Some have lived here for more than three decades, but around half of the population is part of a new wave, people in their late 20s and early 30s who joined in the last four years. These newer residents moved to East Wind to wean themselves off fossil fuels, grow their own food, have a greater say in how their society is run and live in less precarious financial circumstances.
Like his contemporaries Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, Mr. Rosenquist developed a powerful graphic style in the early 1960s that traditionalists reviled and a broad public enthusiastically embraced.

Mr. Constantin, who was living in Istanbul at the time, was oblivious to all of this. When the authorities detained him, he was told that his case was classified and that he would never be allowed to return to Turkey. It was only upon landing in the Romanian capital after 26 days in Turkish detention that he was told he was legally dead.
Abigail Bengson, who narrates much of the quasi-autobiographical electro-folk singspiel, is painting the scene of her childhood in a hippy tolerant extended family. Her mother and father and aunt all teach at the super-crunchy Blue Mountain School in a part of Vermont that happens to be in Maine; their five children, from teenagers to young adults, make a seemingly undifferentiated puppy pile, frolicking happily.
Jersey, a small island in the English Channel a few miles from the French coast, is a dependency of the British crown but is by and large independent of Britain, with its own directly elected assemblies, fiscal system and courts.
I worked for the firm I wanted to work for, I had a lot of friends. But I was my first priority, and if being nice to people helped me, then I did it. I was engrossed in the office gossip: Oh, we shouldn't be saying this, but loving every minute of it. I'd go buy clothes. You don't want to wear the same pants or shirt in one week. ... Are you kidding? I'd get extremely frustrated over the stupidest things, getting ink on a new white $70 shirt and going ballistic.

Ms. Cunningham Agee said that until those final weeks, her marriage had been blissful, but people close to the family said the couple had been living in separate wings of their St. Helena home, comparing the arrangement to the 1989 movie War of the Roses. Ms. Cunningham Agee confirmed that they lived on different floors, but said it was because Mr. Agee, whose illness had taken its toll, walked with a cane and couldn't climb stairs.
The shift of power in Congress and news reports are combining to confront President Trump with the prospect of a protracted and intense political war for survival that may make the still-unresolved partial government shutdown pale by comparison, writes our chief White House correspondent.
Re Bermuda Revokes Same-Sex Marriage (news article, Feb. 9):
Let's say I'm on food stamps, and I've got a 15-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. I'm concerned about their future, very, very deeply. And then Andrew Yang becomes president, and I find out that my 15-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month starting at age 18 for the rest of his life, and my 12-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month for the rest of her life. I'm going to say, wow. That's actually the biggest value gain I've ever even heard of in history. My kid will have a financial literacy class in high school, the first semester of their senior year. It is impossible to teach financial literacy to someone who does not have money. So the kids will actually learn about what to do with the money before they start getting the money.
Our goal should be a self-sustaining Judaism that can thrive in the kind of open society in which most Jews want to spend their lives. I strongly believe that it is essential--both for Jews and for America--that the mainstream American Jewish community flourish. It would be a tragedy if the only forms of Judaism the made it past the twenty-first century were insular, ultra-Orthodox Judaism and Israeli Zionism. I hope that they, too, will continue to prosper, but I believe that a more diverse Jewish life has even more to contribute. If I have a bias, it is in favor of an eclectic, tolerant many-branched menorah that is inclusive of all who wish to safeguard and share the future of the Jewish people.
LONDON — Lawmakers on the island of Jersey have approved scrapping a decades-old law that prevented married women from talking to the tax authorities without the permission of their husband or filing taxes under their own names, a mechanism described by a local senator as archaic.
So the Shane Gillis opinion was not based upon the timeline, it was just based upon my reaction as a person, and the person that was directly named. I certainly think there should be consequences for one's statements and actions, and I certainly think that obviously he made the statements within the year, and that if you did have some sort of time frame when you would want to overlook something, it would be much longer than a year.
OK, I know. I know. I feel terrible. I know, to the mobster.

Every tearoom that Sugimoto creates is formally named, and the one in this apartment is called Ukitsubo, which means floating inner garden, a reference to the 11th-century novel The Tale of Genji, which is set within the wealthy, refined Heian court. One of Sugimoto's original ideas was to create an indoor garden. But that was impossible in a tower, and so instead, he chose to place the two bonsai trees in a rectangular garden in the dining room, a 10½-foot-long slab of Komatsu stone between them. If the windows offer a lightness, a moment to pause in time and drift into infinity, then the two bonsai, whose dense, visible surface roots (nebari, which are considered a balance to the tree's sinuous branches) return you to earth.

Mr. Yang has prided himself on injecting the race with new thinking through proposals like yearlong daylight saving time. Daylight saving time was instituted during World War I for energy-efficiency purposes. Mr. Yang argues that extending it year-round would decrease traffic accidents, increase economic activity and lower crime.
This, to me, is an emblem of what's gone wrong in American life. Where the market is all knowing and all powerful, and if the market decides that local journalism has zero value, then it has zero value. And that is not the way forward for us. We need to make our own independent determination of our own value as people, of the value of local journalism, of the value of arts, of the value of volunteering, of caregiving, of — like all the most important things in American life. And so you, in many ways, you're like the guardians of this incredible journalistic tradition, and it's like a unique privilege because the people who've pursued the same vocation in other parts of the country are just seeing it disappear.
A Lithuanian immigrant who, with a younger brother, Adolfas, arrived in New York City in 1949 speaking little English, he became within a handful of years an effective spokesman for avant-garde film. (Adolfas, who died in 2011, became an influential filmmaker, writer and educator in his own right.)

Patricia Arquette, winning for her supporting role in the Hulu limited series The Act, offered a stern dose of reality, reminding everyone that, among other things, America was on the brink of war and that President Trump had tweeted about destroying Iranian cultural sites earlier in the night.
When Sharon suffers a debilitating medical setback, the tables of their relationship are turned, forcing Mel into the position of caretaker and Sharon into the spotlight. At the behest of Mel, who wants to use Sharon's recovery as the basis for their next feature, they delve deep into Sharon's past by way of the List: a secret compendium of every man with whom I have ever fallen in love, in which drawings of unseemly things appear. Using the List as their guide, the women set out on the road first to visit Sharon's family in Kentucky, and then to track down a boy she knew as a child, who holds the key to the traumatic memories that are haunting her.

They pulled it off. Not without a lot of heartache, and a lot of pain, and a lot of controversy. But in the end, by acting as precipitously as they did, they managed to force the palace to deal with something that it really would have preferred to put off indefinitely. So they really forced the issue successfully.
The monarch's position, officially the yang di-pertuan agong, rotates every five years among a group of hereditary sultans who are titular leaders of nine Malay states. (The other four states have governors instead.)
Those two episodes, directed by the genre wizard Jeremy Saulnier (Green Room, Blue Ruin), evoked the poverty and fear of its small-town Arkansas backdrop, but they also did the unglamorous work of moving the story forward. Two kids were abducted. One is dead. The other is still missing. The urgency of that situation should be the engine that moves True Detective forward, even in the two later timelines, when the cold case has once more become hot.
After his prodigious hit-making streak in the early 1960s, Spector found admirers eager to work with him during the 1970s: the Beatles (collectively and individually), the Ramones, even Leonard Cohen. Then Spector withdrew from music almost completely for the next decades. But through the years, countless others — among them the Beach Boys, Bruce Springsteen, the Walker Brothers, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Abba, Meat Loaf and Bleachers — would emulate the thundering beat, chiming chords and lavish percussion of his Wall of Sound. I still smile whenever I hear the music we made together, and always will, Ronnie Spector told Billboard in an interview after Spector's death. The music will be forever.
McGraw-Hill, the publisher whose annotated Bill of Rights appears differently in the two states, said it had created the additional wording on the Second Amendment and gun control for the California textbook. A national version of the pages is similar to the Texas edition, which does not call attention to gun rights, the company said in a written statement.
The American cities with the highest number of high-net-worth individuals are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington. California has the most number of people on the Forbes list of wealthiest Americans.
We must take control of our own destiny by changing the nature of Jewish life in fundamental ways. The survival of the Jewish people is too important--to us and to the world at large--to be left in the hands of those ultra-Orthodox rabbis who would rather face Armageddon than change the religious status quo. Just as Jews of the past changed the nature of Jewish life in order to adapt to external necessities and to survive the ravages of their external enemies, so, too, must today's Jews change the nature of Jewish life to adapt to new internal necessities and to survive the demographic challenges of intermarriage, assimilation, low birthrates, and the breakdown of neighborhoods and communities.
Well to me, playing the relative benefit game, I mean of course in any large scale national program, it's you can't calibrate it precisely to everyone's individual situation. To me the test is more, is that person going to be better off tomorrow than they are today?
The violence of the reaction to my naming these groups was significant and extremely interesting, he said 25 years later. In hindsight, I would not change my action. Lindbergh's attitude toward the Jews was matched by an adamantine stubbornness on other matters. These together sometimes cast him in an unfavorable public light. One example of his unwillingness to concede that he might have acted unwisely involved the Service Cross of the German Eagle, a civilian medal that was awarded him in 1938 by Hermann Goering, the Nazi leader, at the direction of Hitler. The presentation, a surprise to Lindbergh, was made at a stag dinner in the home of the American Ambassador to Berlin and was, he was told, in recognition of his services to aviation, especially his 1927 flight. The award was reported briefly in the newspapers and stirred little criticism. However, the night of the award Mrs. Lindbergh told her husband that it was the albatross, and she urged him to return it. Lindbergh took the position then and later that to do so would affront the Ambassador and Goering, as well, who was technically his host in Germany. Although he never wore the medal (he gave it to the Lindbergh collection of the Missouri Historical Society in St. Louis, along with other awards and trophies), it became an issue when he opposed American war involvement.
What I realized early on, when you're in school and someone humiliates themselves or trips and falls or is embarrassed publicly, your age doesn't permit you to be mature enough to really embrace that person. Instead, you want to distance yourself and laugh and like, oh, I'm glad I'm not that idiot who just fell down or whatever. But once people mature — and I think that's college and above — and you see someone in a vulnerable situation or embarrassed or humiliated, the great thing about human beings is that they don't feel they want to point the finger. They don't want to separate. What they feel is they want to embrace that person. They want to protect that person. And it's a really lovely human trait. Well, if you can understand that and put that layer of vulnerability in your characters, that will happen to an audience, viscerally, when they sense that. They will emotionally wrap their arms around the character. And so I look for those opportunities to develop sympathies from the audience by way of vulnerability.
Mr. Booker has made criminal justice reform a cornerstone of his Senate tenure. He sought early on to craft bipartisan bills that would have changed penalties for nonviolent crimes and reduced prison sentences, though neither effort became law. Late last year, Congress passed a criminal justice reform act, signed by President Trump, that Mr. Booker had originally sponsored. But during his time as mayor, Newark's police department faced accusations of brutality and intimidation, and the Department of Justice launched an investigation into the department; Mr. Booker said he welcomed the inquiry.
A son of European immigrants who grew up in Brooklyn and never went to college, Mr. King began as a local radio interviewer and sportscaster in Florida in the 1950s and '60s, rose to prominence with an all-night coast-to-coast radio call-in show starting in 1978, and from 1985 to 2010 anchored CNN's highest-rated, longest-running program, reaching millions across America and around the world.
The Shivering Soldier steps up to Mr. Dawson —
The house search wasn't the only thing that took them longer than expected. Their original plan to get married in May of 2020 was delayed by the pandemic until December, and then again until November of 2021 (although they had a small marriage ceremony in October). While the Pazes await their official wedding celebration, they've had a chance to settle in to what Mr. Paz recognizes is a cookie-cutter neighborhood.
Were you a bad guy and then became a good guy or good guy who became a bad guy, or what was your character?
By that time, which was 1969, Dr. Sandler was more than annoyed. She was good and mad. And that led her to become the driving force behind the creation of Title IX, the sweeping civil rights law of 1972 that barred sex discrimination by educational institutions that received federal funding.
I haven't sat down with a lot of sitting senators and congressmen and women, but I've talked to literally thousands of people who supported Donald Trump in the last election who say they are now supporting me. I've talked to many folks who are Republicans who say they are, at least, sympathetic to my message, in large part because they understand the numbers. When I talked to 70 C.E.O.s here in New York City, not that far from here, it was a fancy bank office, most of them were Republicans. I said, How many of you are looking at replacing your back-office clerical workers with artificial intelligence and software? Guess how many hands went up out of 70. All of them. The truth is, you should fire any C.E.O. who was not looking to make that happen, because their incentives are all tied to the bottom-line profitability of their firm. And most of them were Republicans. So they understand the need for what I am proposing.
The conversations are really questioning whether we want to continue to do the job.
As my colleagues have reported, for much of the encounter, Brooks cooperated with police.
But his songs boldly told the stories of his communities, and he made no effort to avoid social issues. Perhaps his biggest hit was Todii, a cautionary song about the perils of H.I.V. from the 1997 album Tuku Music. Powered by a melancholy chorus of background singers and the gravelly lament of Mr. Mtukudzi's lead vocal, it warned listeners of the virus that by then had infected a quarter of Zimbabwe's population.
I think I've been proven right on that point. It's just a lot of anxiety out there. And I think there's a terrific opportunity to move forward in a progressive way.
But Mr. Lesh's strangest misadventure happened several years ago in Chicago, where he works as an inspector, and had nothing to do with misguided home improvement projects. He was checking the carbon monoxide levels in an apartment when he heard banging from the outside wall. He opened the front door to find a team of officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, who promptly swarmed the apartment and arrested the owner. I look down the hall and say, 'My check!' recalled Mr. Lesh, who never got paid for the job. As for the carbon monoxide, he said, It was high. Had this not happened, I would have told my client, 'You need to get your C.O. fixed.'
The final feature of a covenant is that the relationship is not just about itself; it serves some larger purpose. The obvious one in many cases is raising children. But the deeper one is transformation. People in such a covenant try to love the other in a way that brings out their loveliness. They hope that through this service they'll become a slightly less selfish version of themselves.
She warned that any who stayed home without permission would not be paid, raising the prospect of a heightened clash with the union, which has suggested it may strike if teachers are not permitted to stay home if they want to. This is probably the most contentious and unpleasant reopening, in terms of how the different sides are interacting with each other, said Emily Oster, an economics professor at Brown University who has collected data on coronavirus cases in schools and has argued that reopening schools is safe under many circumstances. Interviews with parents and officials in Chicago indicate that many families are torn between concerns that their children are losing out educationally and fears that they will bring the virus home. Katrina Adams, who lives on the South Side, said she wanted to send her oldest daughter, who is in the fourth grade, back to school, but said she didn't think the district was ready to open. Ms. Adams said her views had not been influenced by the teachers' union, but she acknowledged feeling unsettled by many teachers' concerns about in-school transmission of the coronavirus. If they don't feel safe coming back, most definitely that's an alert, to a parent or anyone, she said.
His popularity in Zimbabwe reflects the fact that in a country bitterly divided by political allegiances, he positioned himself as a unifier. While Mr. Mapfumo took a strong political stance in his music — pioneering a genre known as chimurenga (revolutionary struggle music in Shona) before the fall of white minority rule, then vigorously criticizing Robert Mugabe, who ruled the country from 1980 to 2017 — Mr. Mtukudzi generally avoided taking a political side. He sang at events for the ruling ZANU-PF party, as well as the wedding and funeral of the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai.
archived recording (andrew cuomo) So I heard that, and I understood where they were. I knew what they were saying — you're on your own. [LAUGHS] You know? And it's not a good feeling. But it's sort of liberating. So in New York —
In the '70s or '80s, your labor and overall productivity were more or less in lock step. And we still pretend that if someone wakes up in the morning and says, Hey, I need to put food on the table, he can go out to his main street, he can sell his time for money at some hourly rate, and then he'll be able to make a good enough living so he can feed his family, raise kids and the rest of it. That has become progressively less true over the last 40 years, unfortunately, where wages have stagnated while productivity has gone up and up, and that's going to accelerate because of the convergence of capital and technology now, in unprecedented ways.
Yours Unfaithfully is both a daring play and a highly conventional one. Under the polished direction of Jonathan Bank, and in the hands of a fine team of designers, its arguments remain provocative, while its structure feels familiar, its tone decorous. Maybe that only makes it more unusual. It's a bit like a sex farce with real sorrow instead of slammed doors, and something like a drawing room comedy with moral conundrums peeking out beneath the cushions. It is often very funny; it is also very nearly a tragedy.
A recent poll found that roughly 50 percent of the Ukrainian population favors joining NATO, though Hungary's foreign minister recently said his country would block Ukrainian membership unless Ukraine changed a policy restricting its citizens' use of minority languages.
Would you like to play Donald Trump?
BA: But you're not proposing to fix any of that. People don't just work to make money; they do work for a sense of self-worth. They work so that they can develop skills, they work so they have the possibility of earning more money someday. You're proposing to replace a portion of the income they may have lost, but not any of those other things. Why is that a solution?
I think that he did a lot of great things and he did a lot of what he could, but to the extent that there was a missed opportunity, it was in the wake of the financial crisis. And it's very hard to Monday morning quarterback a team when they literally felt like the economy itself was at stake, but we should have done much more to recapitalize homeowners as opposed to the banks. We could have kept many more people in their homes. We could've kept many of these communities ——

But the law enforcement official said that it was too soon to expect a raft of conspiracy charges. Such cases can be tough to prove in court, and investigators would need to seek additional evidence of coordination, such as financial ties, planning around logistics and travel or messages between any alleged group members. On Thursday, the Justice Department charged two off-duty police officers from Rocky Mount, Va., Jacob Fracker and Thomas Robertson, with unlawful entry and disorderly conduct in connection with the riots. Mr. Robertson said on social media that the media and the left were upset because we actually attacked the government who is the problem and not some random small business, according to the criminal complaint. Keep poking us, Mr. Robertson warned. In a nod to concerns that members of the military might have been involved in or supported the Capitol riots, the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff issued an unusual message to all military personnel this week, reminding them that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. would soon be their commander-in-chief and that they must continue to defend the Constitution. The Defense Department declined on Thursday to directly address whether members of the military were involved in attacking the Capitol. We in the Department of Defense are doing everything we can to eliminate extremism, said Garry Reid, the Pentagon's director for defense intelligence. He said that all members of the military, including members of the National Guard, go through extensive screening for participation in hate groups and militias.
His son Daniel said his death, at George Washington University Hospital, was caused by complications of a fall at Mr. Wofford's Washington apartment several days earlier.
Toggling between Los Angeles and Mexico, English and Spanish, this sophomore feature by Catalina Aguilar Mastretta asks Clara to choose between naughty and nice. The setup is commonplace, but the scenery is delicious, the dialogue refreshingly tart and the keen supporting cast frisky or affecting, as the occasion demands.
I used to say about Cynthia's writing, and her being, that she had the soul of Janis Joplin in the voice of Hedda Hopper, Emily Prager, the novelist and comedy writer, said in an email. She was a voice for liberation with manners, freedom without regret and the blues with a grain of salt.
With only one change in the lineup — Peter Wiley replaced Mr. Soyer, who was a decade older than the others, in 2001 — the group performed and recorded for the next 45 years, appearing all over the world and introducing countless concertgoers to the beauties of a well-played quartet.
Detroit is a city of 680,000 people. Its peak population was 1.7 million. If you look this direction, you can see a thriving neighborhood, and then you turn 90 degrees and you see abandoned buildings as far as the eye can see. If we were adapting, you would see not multidecade low rates of interstate migration, which we have right now. You would not be seeing 80 percent of the country have multidecade low levels of business formation, which we have right now. You would not be seeing historic lows of business formation among young people, which we have right now. You would not see labor force participation at 62.9 percent, a multidecade low which we have right now. You would not see record-high levels of drug overdoses and suicides to the point that America's life expectancy has declined for three years in a row, which we have right now.
In the many years since then, Mary Oliver's gentle insistence that we do not end up simply having visited this world became my touchstone. When scared, I did my best to stand up to the fear (I don't want to find myself sighing and frightened…).
Great souls resemble the elements in their immensity. They absorb everything — pain, injustice, insult, folly — and give back decency and kindness. They are not born of a piece. They come into being through unflinching confrontation with life's spears. They reach quiet. Discipline is the backbone of graciousness. Stoicism is the other face of wounds. In the most beautiful smile, painful knowledge hovers.
We need to let our historic allies know that our commitments are good, and that if we want to make a change, we want to do it in a way that's not pulling the rug out from under you but actually consultative. If we want other people to invest more, then we have to try and sit down with them and drive them to do so without questioning our commitment to NATO wholesale. But to me, trying to nickel-and-dime our relationships with our historic allies is not the best way forward. I think it was James Mattis that said that if you invest more in diplomacy, you have to invest less in ammunition, which should be the goal. So we need to make sure our partnerships and alliances are actually strong, stable and secure, and then we can put pressure on Russia and China with more of a global consensus, and maintain the international world order that's benefited us for decades that now is falling apart because Donald Trump is so erratic and unreliable, even with the people we've been allies with for decades.
MC: So, and we are currently enjoying a businessmen president who has no experience in government or the military. What is your argument to people, that we should trust you with no experience in government and the military, in the same position, and that you will do a better job dealing with the peculiarities of Washington.
But as Duncan Ryuken Williams, a professor of religion and East Asian languages and cultures at the University of Southern California, who organized the festival, explained, it's more complicated than that, a subject worthy of deep — and optimistic — exploration. The festival coincided with a conference at the University of Southern California on critical mixed-race studies, and the publication of Hapa Japan, a two-part volume of essays that Professor Williams edited.
There were, however, plenty of good reasons for not converting. Quite apart from the religious wrench of conversion, becoming a Catholic in Britain or the United States often prompted accusations of disloyalty to the nation, its Protestant heritage, even its sense of common decency. When Thomas Arnold (Matthew Arnold's brother) converted, his wife wrote a furious letter to Newman, accusing him of persuading her husband to ignore every social duty and become a pervert. She added, From the bottom of my heart I curse you for it. In 1848 the poet Christina Rossetti refused an offer of marriage from a young artist, James Collinson, because he had converted. She accepted him when he reverted to Anglicanism but canceled their wedding plans when he went over to Rome for a second time. Collinson's parents disowned him, and he was reduced to begging from his friends in the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.
After Mr. Gillis was fired, Mr. Yang tweeted that the comedian had reached out to him. Looks like we will be sitting down together soon, Mr. Yang wrote. Neither the comedian nor the candidate appears to have spoken publicly about the content of the meeting.
Nothing about the March sisters of Louisa May Alcott's perennial best seller particularly stuck with me, and as an adult, annoyance overshadowed apathy as I tried to understand how the literary heroine of so many women I admired — the spunky, independent writer Jo March — would, by the end of the novel, relinquish her art for marriage, and then proclaim that she is the happiest she'd ever been.
Debarking at Washington in a civilian's blue serge suit, Lindbergh was glorified by the President, who said that the trans- Atlantic flight was the same story of valor and victory by a son of the people that shines through every page of American history. The panoplied Washington reception, which was topped by an award--the first in the nation's history--of the Distinguished Flying Cross, was followed by an even noisier outpouring in New York, where four million people spilled into the streets. Ticker tape and confetti rained on the Broadway parade, and the day was climaxed by a banquet for 4,000 guest. We measure heroes as we do ships, by their displacement, the bewhiskered Charles Evans Hughes told the multitude. Colonel Lindbergh has displaced everything. And then there were triumphal parades and receptions, seemingly endless, in other cities. Lindbergh eventually flew the Spirit of St. Louis to every state in the Union. Everywhere he went a throng collected. Even a supposedly private visit to Orville Wright, co-inventor of the airplane, was noised about and crowds appeared. Lindbergh, at one point, was so filled up with listening to this hero guff that I was ready to shout murder. What the parades, the pandemonium, the oratory, the hero worship obscured was that Lindbergh's epic flight was a most minutely planned venture by a professional flier with 2,000 air hours amassed over five years. Why shouldn't I fly from New York to Paris? he had asked himself in September, 1926.
But I wonder if this connects to something that you said earlier. You said that you don't see race. And I wonder if you've ever heard pushback on that concept, the idea that it's possible to be colorblind. Because there's a very strong line of thinking that —
quoted Mr. Brock's attorney, Brook Antonio II, as saying on Thursday that there was no direct evidence of him breaking into the Capitol or doing anything violent inside. The top federal prosecutor in Washington said this week that he expected the number of people charged with crimes tied to the Capitol riot to rise into the hundreds. The F.B.I. has received more than 126,000 photographic and video tips and as agents have scoured airline passenger manifests and video of air travelers to and from Washington to find potential suspects. The man who was photographed holding a Confederate battle flag inside the U.S. Capitol during the riot was arrested on Thursday in Delaware, two law enforcement officials said. The man, Kevin Seefried, was wanted by the F.B.I., which had sought help from the public to identify him and had widely circulated a dispatch plastered with images of him. In a bulletin, the agency said that it was looking for assistance to identify individuals who made unlawful entry into the Capitol, including Mr. Seefried. According to court documents, Mr. Seefried and his son, Hunter Seefried, were identified after the F.B.I. received a report from a co-worker of Hunter Seefried that said the man had bragged about being in the Capitol with his father on January 6.Mr. Seefried's son was also charged. A retired firefighter from Chester, Pa., was also arrested on Thursday after he was identified as the man seen in a video throwing a fire extinguisher at police officers during the riot.
Mr. Yang previously ran a successful test prep company and created the nonprofit Venture for America, which he argues is a strength, offering him fresh perspective and critical distance from the workings of Washington.
Yeah, all right. Tell me how Broadway is going to come out of the pandemic, if you're talking about a musical. It's closed down. And how will it be different?
NEW DELHI — The most ubiquitous man in Bollywood is under tremendous pressure to utter three simple words: I am gay.
He's openly acknowledging a rift between them. And that is a very powerful thing. Because remember, for the British public, these two brothers are imprinted in memory as the young boys who walked together behind their mother's casket after her death. And so to hear Harry openly acknowledge what perhaps people whispered, that's a very, very big deal in terms of both the emotional dynamic within the royal family, but also the image the royal family has with the British public.
Ms. Vella, a historian by training, found one of her richest subjects close to hand, in her native city. Intimate Enemies, published in 1997, told the story of Micaela Leonarda Antonia Almonester y Rojas, daughter of the richest man in New Orleans. Her marriage at the age of 15 to the son of a French baron set in motion a family scandal whose intricacies enthralled the novelist Stendhal.
If you look at our proposals, we have a tax on financial transactions, which would obviously end up falling most heavily on the wealthiest Americans and the wealthiest companies. We have a carbon tax, which tends to fall most heavily on the wealthiest industries, which are emitting a lot. The value-added tax would obviously be enormously generative from people who benefit from society and consume the most. I'm for trying to restore our income tax levels to previous levels to be more progressive.
That's the way you want to ask the question?
consistent with the decline in the odds of marriage between high school dropouts and those with more education since the 1970s, a period over which the real wages of men in this education group declined.

One, it's a lot easier and cheaper for us to throw kids into a classroom with textbooks and a teacher and say, You're going to go to college, than it is to try and train them in skills that are going to give them a secure livelihood. Number two, we have fetishized college and stigmatized anything that's not college. We've beaten Americans over the head, pretended everyone's going to college and say, It's going to work for you. And the Democrats are guilty of this. That's why they're yelling, Free college, free college. Meanwhile, again, only 33 percent of Americans are going to go to college, and that is a relatively stable number.

Former fans of Mr. Prager's work say they are confused by his Trumpist turn.
Andrew Yang's message is remarkably similar to Elizabeth Warren's and Bernie Sanders's — the American economy is not working for enough Americans, and it's going to require structural change to do better. Where Mr. Yang differs — beyond his almost complete lack of government or political experience — is in his prescriptions, including his signature Freedom Dividend.
Contemporary ballet makers favored her. In 1950, Herbert Ross, a new choreographer and future film director, cast her in his Caprichos, based on Goya's etchings. She portrayed a dead woman who is tossed around by her partner in choreographed movements that suggested she was inert.
As a kid growing up in the horse business and around the racetrack, he told BloodHorse magazine in 2015, you think that someday you'd love to have a horse good enough to run in this race or that race. And for me, Foolish Pleasure was the horse that not only ran in them but won those races.

H. L. Mencken once wrote that his definition of happiness included a comfortable feeling of superiority to the masses of one's fellow men. And yet his quest to be exceptional didn't appear to make him all that happy. But does the compulsion to excel make anybody happy?
Mr. Rodgers was a regular presence on the pop, country, R&B and easy listening charts for a decade after Honeycomb, with records that included Oh-Oh, I'm Falling in Love Again (1958) and Child of Clay (1967), both of which were nominated for Grammy Awards.

Especially for people who are at the lower end of the skills ladder, which is most Americans. Only 33 percent of Americans will graduate from college, 42 percent if you include two-year degrees.
His parents were Christian fundamentalists who went to church two times every Sunday. Rauschenberg had ample opportunity to hear about the torments of hell, which piqued his imagination. In 1958, in an application for a Guggenheim grant, he proposed that he illustrate Dante's Inferno in 34 drawings, one for each canto.
Alas, thrill-seeking and passion can only take a marriage so far and, now that we were living as a family, reality had set in. Gone was the Middle Eastern backdrop, the inexpensive four-bedroom house with the verdant garden. The City of Lights is as romantic as ever, but Paris, for me, represented a return to the responsibilities of adult life with its endless loads of laundry and the drudgery of putting dinner on the table every night.

Not at all. We originated the SAT during World War II as a way to determine which kids we did not want to send to the front lines. Now we treat our kids like every year is wartime. I've talked to parents and teachers around the country, and I've said, we need to de-emphasize these standardized tests. They are a terrible measurement of human value, certainly have nothing to do with character. At this point, as you said, they are more likely to test your parents' socioeconomic status than anything else.
And it's not just the leading edge N.S.A.-type stuff. If you look around congressional offices or the I.R.S., they're all using technology from the '90s or whatever it is. I had a whiz kid who said he got yelled at for writing a script in a congressional office that automated a task. They were like, No, we just wanted you to do it manually forever. So there needs to be a massive modernization effort. Not just in terms of how we recruit tech talent at the highest levels, but how we function even in the basics.
It's very hard to actually be that radically different about an avocado. But the British press figured out how to do it. While this is at some level humorous and not extremely serious, it did over time bleed into more sinister types of coverage of Meghan Markle, really around her mixed racial background. So you began to see descriptions of her in the press as, quote, exotic, or headlines that said that Harry's new girl is quote straight outta Compton. In other words, portraying Meghan as a coming up from the mean streets of Los Angeles. And so there is an element of it that is deeper, and more problematic, and gets at out-and-out racism. And certainly portraying her not just as an entitled millennial, but as an altogether more threatening figure.
Brice Thomas, the lead pastor, says he first grasped religion's capacity for harm when his father, a Pentecostal faith healer, died of a treatable skin cancer because the church did not believe in going to doctors. After a stint in the military, Mr. Thomas, who is gay, became ordained in the United Church of Christ, one of the first denominations to affirm marriage equality, and took up his duties in Nashville last year. Together with Jennifer Strickland, a licensed therapist, he is setting up a Recovering from Religious Trauma Syndrome group at the church.
Well, I don't know if the experience will be different. I think writers would then write with the knowledge of COVID and what that's done to us in current times. Actors have to feel comfortable in that intimacy on stage. And maybe even more importantly is that audiences need to feel comfortable in sitting shoulder to shoulder again with strangers and 1,000 people in an auditorium and watch stories.
The difference between economic winners and losers, captured by income inequality, poverty, and illiteracy rates within the dominant white ethnicity, is much greater than in most other Western countries, and there is no dense welfare state safety net to buffer the fall of people into unemployment and poverty.
I mean, that's not solely an American decision. NATO expansion is something that is fraught and elevates tensions with Russia in particular. I think we should explore it. I'm sympathetic, but it's not a decision we can make alone.

In the case of the very different documentaries Time and Saudi Runaway, the desire to make movies isn't simply about having a say — getting the chance to pick up a camera and share your vision with the world freely — it is also a matter of life itself. Each documentary centers on an extraordinarily gutsy woman who put her everyday existence on camera, detailing her days and nights in intimate, pointillist detail much like a diarist. Each woman subsequently handed over what she had shot to a female director, who then shaped the material, turning self-expression into collective vision.
THE RECOVERING: Intoxication and Its Aftermath, by Leslie Jamison. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $18.99.) Jamison, adding to a large group of addiction memoirs, maps her own recovery while considering the relationship between creativity and substance abuse. The emotional firepower of the book comes in its second half, after she has embraced sobriety; our critic, Dwight Garner, called this section close to magnificent, and genuinely moving.
Near the end of the novel, Lizzie reads about a group of cloistered monks who say, We have died and we are in love with everything. Weather understands that we can still be in love with what happens on a dying planet, and that life is always many things at once — full of love, full of despair, full of slobber frogs and melting glaciers and babies who won't nap; that what happens on one scale doesn't negate the others. But democratizing these scales can also become an alibi for complacency — for allowing us to shift back into the daily, the private, the emotional, as crutch or buffer. Weather suggests the comfort and peril of that retreat by narrating the life of a woman for whom retreat is becoming impossible. What happens when the horror of climate change gets lodged so deep under our skin we can't escape it any longer? What happens when an author manages to translate this horror from an abstraction to a gripping tale of immediate particulars?
Her remarks came the day after the House — with support from 10 Republicans — impeached the president on a single charge of incitement of insurrection, and as Republicans faced the prospect of a trial that could begin as soon as next week. Republicans were racing to gauge the political dynamics of a vote to convict Mr. Trump, which would open the door to disqualifying him from holding office in the future. Most of them kept their powder dry publicly, but were privately struggling to reconcile their own disdain for the leader they supported loyally for years and their fear of a backlash from a political base more devoted to Mr. Trump than any other party figure. Though few Republicans had gone on record in such stinging terms, Ms. Murkowski was not alone in breaking from the president. Senators Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania and Susan Collins of Maine had spoken out harshly against Mr. Trump, leaving colleagues to speculate that they could vote to convict him and bar him from ever holding office again. Even Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, indicated to colleagues that he was undecided about whether to convict Mr. Trump, and privately told advisers he approved of the impeachment drive and believed it could help the party purge Mr. Trump.
Keep moving. Be kind. My mother-in-law said that to us once, and I thought, that's a great aspect of life. Keep moving and be kind. That kind of says it all.

July 18, 1959 OBITUARY Billie Holiday Dies Here at 44; Jazz Singer Had Wide Influence BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Billie Holiday, famed jazz singer, died yesterday in Metropolitan Hospital. Her age was 44. The immediate cause of death was given as congestion of the lungs complicated by heart failure. Miss Holiday had lived at 26 West Eighty-seventh Street. She had been under arrest in her hospital bed since June 12 for illegal possession of narcotics. Miss Holiday set a pattern during her most fruitful years that has proved more influential than that of almost any other jazz singer, except the two who inspired her, Louis Armstrong and the late Bessie Smith. Miss Holiday became a singer more from desperation than desire. She was named Eleanora Fagan after her birth in Baltimore. She was the daughter of a 13-year-old mother, Sadie Fagan, and a 15-year-old father who were married there years after she was born. The first and major influence on her singing came when as a child she ran errands for the girls in a near-by brothel in return for the privilege of listening to recordings by Mr. Armstrong and Miss Smith. Miss Holiday took her professional name from her father, Clarence Holiday, a guitarist who played with Fletcher Henderson's band in the Nineteen Twenties and from one of the favorite movie actresses of her childhood, Billie Dove. She came to New York with her mother in 1928.

If you were a person in that town in Missouri and you wanted to start a bakery, before the dividend, it's a dumb idea. Post-dividend, it might be a great idea. You can hire someone to help staff the bakery, you know if the bakery fails, you're going to survive because you have this income that you can rely upon. This is the most stable and secure way to create jobs that actually reflect our community's needs and values. What are the other alternatives?

We're going to designate 10 people to make our people stronger forever, regardless of whether or not they're ——

His worst flaw here, one from which Mr. Gomes's work also suffers, is cuteness. Dancers flirt with the audience and jokily vie for attention in ways that shatter the stage reality they've been building together.

To your earlier concern, I think we should examine the filibuster. I think that gridlock is bad for anyone trying to get anything done and solve problems. This might be controversial in this room, but I am for the restoration of earmarks, because it helped make legislation possible. That if I was a congressperson in a district, and there was a bill being passed, it's, Hey, at least I can get some pork for my local museum. And that's a very small price to pay for a functional legislature. So, getting past the filibuster to me is one possible necessity, and the restoration of earmarks could be another.

Clinton became only the second President in history to be impeached. At 1:22 P.M., the House of Representatives, after two days of angry and emotional debate, approved, 228 to 206, the first article of impeachment, accusing Clinton of perjury for misleading a Federal grand jury last Aug. 17 about the nature of his relationship with a White House intern, Monica S.

And at the end of that explanation, you said that you are not for curtailing social supports, but isn't your plan such that, that mother, aside from what the kids would get in the future, that mother would have to choose between the food stamps and the actual U.B.I., right? Is that correct?
Amber Schleuning, deputy director of the V.A. Center for Innovation and a fourth-generation veteran, never thought she'd work at the V.A. But she began to hear from others she served with, her dad (also a veteran) and his friends about the problems they were having interacting with the system.

One of the most illuminating discussions in the book centers around the idea of adult orphans, individuals who have lost the capacity to exist as parts of that complementary human group which we call the family and who, if they marry, merely beget and rear other adult orphans. On a different level of social analysis and seriousness is the amusing chapter headed Love of Women, which discusses the way some mysterious occult agreement among women changes the styles in men (when the men aren't looking), so that the poor male who has just got himself finally organized to be a Raftish character given to black hats, dark looks and contempt for women finds that the style has shifted and women are giving the unpurchasable look to good-natured athletes, broad-shouldered and broad-minded.

What's interesting to me about the differences is that in Breaking Bad, Walter White methodically planned his next move in life, even though he was given only two years to live. But he designed his future, as short as it may have been. In this story, Michael Desiato has no time. He needs to make a decision impulsively that will alter the course of his life for who knows how long. So he doesn't have the luxury of time to look back and think, well, wait a minute. If I make this decision now, what's it going to do? What are the repercussions down the road?
For candidates seeking to lead the party into its post-Obama era, their hope is that the base is more concerned with defeating President Trump and Republicans than holding every candidate to rigid standards of ideological purity.
Perhaps Colette had been initially irritated because the young flatterer had already divined her bisexuality. By 1917, after Proust had begun to publish Remembrance of Things Past, she could see him in another light. He was very ill, he weighed no more than one hundred pounds, and he seldom emerged from his cork-lined room. He had become a martyr to art (and she herself was one of his few living rivals as a stylist). She saw him at the Ritz during the war with a few friends, wearing a fur coat even indoors over his evening clothes: He never stopped talking, trying to be gay. Because of the cold, and making excuses, he kept his top hat on, tilted backwards, and the fan-like lock of hair covered his eyebrows. Full-dress uniform, but disarranged by a furious wind, which, pouring over the nape of his hat, rumpling the calico and the free ends of his cravat, filling in with a grey ash the furrows of his cheeks, the hollows of his eye-sockets and the breathless mouth, had hunted this tottering young man of fifty to death.

I love work, and the numbers also clearly show that people need work. Men in particular, without work, they volunteer less than employed men. So think about that for a second. They have higher rates of substance abuse, their health deteriorates, all these social ills accompany. Of course, we need to create jobs in as many communities as possible.
Here is my personal ten-card. At the age of eighteen I enrolled for a master's in Criminal Justice at Pete Brown. But what I really wanted was the streets. And I couldn't wait. I took tests for state trooper, for border patrol, and even for state corrections officer. I passed them all. I also took the police test, and I passed that, too. I quit Pete and enrolled at the Academy.

The unfortunate part is, it's totally opposite of the defunding of law enforcement. It comes down to the politicians. And I really hate to be that way, but it does. And instead of building parks that make no sense, putting flowers up and down the roads that probably are going to die and you're going to have to replace or something, why can't we take that budget money and move it over to there? I'll stand next to the community and fight for that every day.

After the rampage at the Capitol, Twitter updated its civic integrity policy to aggressively increase our enforcement action on misleading and false claims about the presidential election, the platform said. Several days after the riot, Twitter said it had suspended more than 70,000 accounts — though in many of those instances one person operated multiple accounts — that promoted QAnon-associated content and were primarily dedicated to spreading the conspiracy theory. After the Capitol riot, other platforms also moved to cut off Mr. Trump and others making false claims about the election. Facebook blocked the president from its platforms through at least the end of his term.

Everyone knows my flagship proposal is this Freedom Dividend of $1,000 a month for every American adult, which is not a new idea. And it's not my idea. Thomas Paine was for it at the founding of the country. Martin Luther King fought for it and was fighting for it when he was assassinated. So after I'm the nominee and I defeat Donald Trump, everyone will know that I'm in the White House because of the Freedom Dividend.
One of the reasons why Donald Trump is our president is that millions of Americans feel like our government is unresponsive to our needs and the needs in our communities. They've been casting about for some sort of change agent for years. And it's not just Donald Trump's victory; it was Bernie Sanders outsized success. In some ways, it was even Obama's victory in 2008. If you remember that campaign, it was oh, hope, change. It was not, get the most experienced person in the seat as possible, because we are decades behind the curve in addressing the problems and challenges that are tearing us apart. Now ——

Mr. Yang is not the first to label this period the fourth industrial revolution — the term was made popular by Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, at its annual meeting in Davos in 2016. Mr. Schwab's book of the same name argues that the fourth industrial revolution is transforming every sector of the economy and industry through new technologies that merge the physical, digital and biological realms.
As a result, California textbooks are more likely to celebrate unionism, critique the concentration of wealth and focus on how industry pollutes the environment.
In the '70s or '80s, your labor and overall productivity were more or less in lock step. And we still pretend that if someone wakes up in the morning and says, Hey, I need to put food on the table, he can go out to his main street, he can sell his time for money at some hourly rate, and then he'll be able to make a good enough living so he can feed his family, raise kids and the rest of it. That has become progressively less true over the last 40 years, unfortunately, where wages have stagnated while productivity has gone up and up, and that's going to accelerate because of the convergence of capital and technology now, in unprecedented ways.
Labor force participation — the share of Americans either employed or actively looking for work — declined precipitously from the late 1990s, dropping to 62.7 percent in 2014 (its lowest rate since the Carter administration). Critics of President Obama liked to argue that this was because of government handouts. But there's a counterargument to be found in demographic trends — the Congressional Budget Office estimates that a sizable portion of the decline in labor-force participation is a result of the aging of the work force.
Tom Railsback, an eight-term Illinois congressman who forged what he called a fragile bipartisan coalition between his fellow Republicans and the Democratic majority on the House Judiciary Committee in 1974 to draft articles of impeachment against President Richard M.

It was the beginning of what one British newspaper called the most commercially successful relationship in literary history. The book was a hit in Britain, and Mr. Little sold the U.S. rights for just over $100,000 and, soon after that, the film rights for $1.8 million.

In chapters 2, 3, and 4, I develop my thesis that the nature of anti-Semitism is changing in fundamental and important ways: Mainstream anti-Semitism--as traditionally practiced by churches, states, corporations, universities, and other elite institutions--is coming to an end; today's Jew-haters are largely marginalized and powerless. This change means that although anti-Semitism persists and must continue to be monitored, it has far less daily impact on the lives of American Jews than in the past. Thus we must define our Jewish identity in different and more positive ways than we did the past.

So effortlessly did Keller glide along life's surface that for a long time few people had any inkling of his personal struggles away from the pool. In the months before the 2004 Athens Olympics, for example, Keller endured a stretch of sleeplessness and malaise that culminated in what his coach at the time, Jon Urbanchek, described as an emotional breakdown.

Fesen's story -- of having his vocation acknowledged by someone else before he knew it himself -- is one you hear repeatedly from seminarians, many of whom fell away from the church at some point in their lives. Michael Dobbins, 32, a husky, mirthful deacon from Arlington and therefore a D.B., or diocesan brother, to Bashista, had the sort of childhood that might have resulted in a fairly direct journey to the priesthood in a prior era. I played Mass as a kid, he says. My sisters were the altar boys. My dad had this old copper chalice for his beer on football Sundays, so I used that. And Wonder Bread, something white, you'd press it down flat and use a glass to cut a circle out. I wasn't very clear on the vestments, so I used a big bedspread. In college, though, Dobbins stopped going to a Catholic church and began attending a Baptist church instead, where he became involved with a Baptist woman. At one point in college, he was briefly engaged. In my last year, he recounts, I was reading my Bible, and I got to John 6. At the end it says, 'And some of his disciples no longer followed him.' I'd read that a thousand times before, but something in that passage hit me like a big brick. And I was like, holy cow -- that's me. I cried like a baby.
At one point, the Democrats even played a clip from President Trump himself.
He brought dozens of musicians and singers into the studio to perform together, doubling parts for heft and impact and pushing mixes to the brink of distortion, to create his Wall of Sound. He gathered songwriters who could convincingly capture female longing and desire for his girl groups to deliver. And he found singers — many of them ambitious Black teenagers — who would supercharge those songs with gospel spirit.
Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House of Commons, wrote a letter to Mr. Hunt last week challenging the repayment policy. Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee are deeply concerned that victims may be forced to pay for their own rescue or, worse, may be dissuaded from asking for help if they have not got the funds, it said.
But those within the church say that the increasingly secular nature of American life has taken the biggest toll on vocations.

And while you may not have felt that way, there were other jokes he made about just Asian-Americans and Asian people in general, and there were other people who were obviously affected by this. So I mean, what kind of consequences do you think someone who makes those kinds of statements and who doesn't show any sort of remorse for it, should they face? If not firing, what should happen? What would the steps be?

Really? So, we have to get done what we can get done. And if we have to focus on things that are traditionally bipartisan, I'd be excited to lead with that. I mean, I'd be much more excited to lead with a much bigger agenda to balance out this economy, to work for people. And I will say that's bipartisan, too. When I go around to Americans around the country, if you were to go to a room of Republicans and say, Hey, how do you feel about Amazon paying zero in taxes? They're not excited about that. They feel like this economy is rigged against them and their families, and they're generally correct, and that is bipartisan.
Although some genetic experts question the accuracy of such tests to pinpoint geographical ancestry, the molecular genealogist Diahan Southard said that the results are usually on the mark, save for some exceptions. The ethnicity breakdown you receive from a testing company relies heavily on the people the company is comparing you against, she said. If you are from France, but your company hasn't tested very many French people, they aren't going to do a very good job with your breakdown.

These forces have dramatically eroded the earnings power, employment stability, social stature, and marriage market value of non-college men. The ensuing dysfunction touches not just in earnings and employment but also male idleness, dysfunctional and destructive behavior (e.g., drug and alcohol abuse), and the erosion of two-parent families, which, research suggests, facilitate children in becoming successful adults.

This is what's so tough right now is that countries are trying to figure out what are the benefits of being an ally of the United States and doing what we want them to do, and then what are the costs. Unfortunately that calculation is going against us more and more. Turkey's relationship with the U.S. has been stronger than our relationship with many other countries in that region. I think we should invest in that relationship if we're going to be able to accomplish any of our goals there. And that includes, to me, being a little bit more accommodating about behaviors that we might find objectionable or troubling from them than we might from another country.

Since impeachment, some Republicans have said Kevin McCarthy has not been loyal enough to the president. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California is entering his eighth term in the House. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times BAKERSFIELD, Calif. — Representative Kevin McCarthy of California has been pilloried nationally and throughout the state for being loyal to President Trump to the bitter end — voting to overturn the election results hours after a mob of the president's supporters stormed the Capitol and urging censure of the president instead of impeachment. Democrats and some Republicans called on him to step down. The anti-Trump Lincoln Project released an ad calling him a pathetic enabler and urging his staff to pack up your desk and leave that loser behind. A scathing Sacramento Bee editorial denounced him for having a soulless lack of principle and for abusing his authority to promote big, dangerous lies about the election. But in his home district — one of the most conservative in California — Mr. McCarthy has been under fire for not being loyal enough. The split illustrates the gulf between the national outrage over the violence at the Capitol and the local hold the president still has on conservative parts of the country. Mr. McCarthy's district, which includes the city of Bakersfield and most of Kern and Tulare Counties in the San Joaquin Valley south of Sacramento and north of Los Angeles, is a place where oil, agriculture and MAGA dominate.
A project of this kind, covering more than a century and two nations (with frequent glances at Ireland, Germany, France, Spain, Canada, and Italy), is obliged to move rapidly or become impossibly long. My approach is to single out the most influential figures from each generation and explain their work, rather than attempt to give a comprehensive account of all convert writers, though at times I have tried to rescue from obscurity characters who seem to me to deserve more fame than history has granted them, including Richard Simpson (Chapter 4), Elizabeth Kite (Chapter 7), and Bertram Windle (Chapter 8). Influence is, of course, an elusive phenomenon, not really amenable to accurate measurement. Such figures as Newman, Brownson, Hecker, Dawson, and Chesterton get comparatively thorough treatment not because they are typical of anything but because of their exceptional qualities; few of their fellow converts could rival them for insight or write so much and so well. In general I aim to demonstrate qualitative rather than quantitative changes throughout, arguing that the converts, who were never more than 2 or 3 percent of the Catholic population in either nation, were disproportionately represented in the ranks of Catholic writers, lecturers, editors, and professors, that their ideas often set the agenda for other Catholic intellectuals working within the tradition, and that non-Catholics looked to the more persuasive convert writers when they wanted to find the Catholic position on a controversial issue.

I'm for a more progressive tax structure. It's clear that the people at the top of the income chain are not paying enough. I don't think a wealth tax will work. I like the spirit of a wealth tax, but if you look at other countries' experience, Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, very sophisticated developed countries, they tried a wealth tax and they wound up repealing it because it had massive compliance problems, and it did not generate anywhere near the revenue that was projected.

He carefully threaded the needle for listeners as he made the argument for Mr. Trump as a values leader. There are two types of values, micro and macro, he argued. One seems to do with the minutiae of one's life (marital fidelity, religiosity, respect); the other, he says, is more important and relates to the general effect of one's life.
In 1990, 12 European countries had some form of a wealth tax, while today only three have kept the policy — Norway, Spain and Switzerland. Reports by the O.E.C.D. and others have found that the tax led to an exodus of the wealthy and didn't raise as much revenue as anticipated.

A third issue is logistical. A wealth tax would be like an estate tax levied every year. Figuring out the tax owed on large estates is complicated, costly and time-consuming. The Internal Revenue Service gives estates a year to file a return, but even then, executors often have to file extensions. And on the other end, auditors go through the returns, which can take years before an estate is settled.

Mr. Biden's support for abortion rights is already causing tension in the Catholic church. Even before the inaugural ceremony had finished, Archbishop José H. Gomez of Los Angeles, the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, issued an extensive statement criticizing Mr. Biden for policies that would advance moral evils, especially in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender. Cardinal Blase J. Cupich of Chicago, who is known for his alignment with Pope Francis' social and economic priorities, pushed back on Twitter, calling the statement unprecedented and ill-considered.
It's obviously much harder. I'm all about trying to maximize the possible. And so, if we don't get a majority — I expect the Democrats will win a slight majority in the Senate. I'm very optimistic that way, but we're going to get done what we can get done with the branch of the government we have control of. And I will say too, I believe that we can get some things done that are traditionally bipartisan, regardless of who has control of the Senate. To me, I cannot believe that we did not get infrastructure done during the first couple of years of the Trump administration.

It took Alison Stevenson eight months to find a pandemic friend with benefits. Along the way, she had an intense, short-lived texting relationship that ended when the man on the other end told her he was getting back together with his ex. Then came two disappointing outdoor dates, including one with a guy who made fun of her for asking him to keep his mask on. I needed a 'situationship,' said Ms. Stevenson, a 31-year-old comedian and writer in Los Angeles. A person I can rely on and trust to hang out with once a week. The effort could mean setting boundaries and conditions from the outset, like regular testing (keep in mind that tests can show false negatives, especially if the amount of the virus in the body is too small to be detected, and that whoever is taking the test could be infected while waiting for results), quarantining before meeting and sticking to a single partner. As they negotiate, people are finding that the key to dating now is what it's always been: trust. And ultimately for many single people, hooking up has been worth the increased risk of contracting the virus. Everything I enjoy doing has been taken away from me, said Emmy Nicholson, a 26-year-old publicist in Brooklyn. But there's one thing they can't take away, and that's having sex.

The crux of the issue is that with autism there is often, not metaphorically but literally, a lack of voice, which renders the person a tabula rasa on which a writer can inscribe and project almost anything: Autism is a gift, a curse, super intelligence, mental retardation, mystical, repellent, morally edifying, a parent's worst nightmare. As a writer, I say go ahead and write what you want. As a parent, I find this terrifying, given the way neurotypical people project false motives and feelings onto the actions of others every day.

Well, the labor force participation rate has declined precipitously, so I don't buy that somehow the government started giving people more money over the last number of years. And the headline unemployment rate, and I'm sure you know this, it doesn't measure underemployment, 40 to 44 percent of recent college graduates are now doing a job that does not require a college degree. It does not measure the fact that 94 percent of new jobs in the economy are temp, gig or contract jobs that do not have health care benefits and can disappear at any moment. It doesn't include the fact that you might be doing two or three jobs to make ends meet.
Mr. Yang has scored internet points with some tweets paying tribute to former 2020 Democratic rivals, for example by tweeting I miss Beto.
ABC, which broadcasts the Oscars, said last week that the ceremony, viewed by roughly 30 million people in the United States, would not have a host for the second year in a row. Hosting is a thankless job that many celebrities turn down; fully vetting a host (scrubbing their social media accounts for potentially offensive comments) is time-consuming and far from foolproof; and last year's host-free show stopped the ratings free-fall.

President Trump has threatened retaliation against Iran by striking Iranian sites including some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture. If carried out, this threat would constitute a war crime under international instruments such as the 1954 Hague Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, which the United States has joined. The American military has a proud history of avoiding intentional damage to and destruction of cultural sites, which began with President Abraham Lincoln's law of war manual, known as the Lieber Code.
I think the number of aircraft carriers is either seven or nine. I confess to not knowing precisely. In terms of our investment, we're spending $650 billion plus on our military. Certainly more than any other country, but I think more than the next four countries combined, and we have to examine, at this stage, whether that $650 billion is making us safer and more secure.
I sat back, away from this. But then he went on, saying in his tethered voice,
President Obama signed into law the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in 2009, which gave the Food and Drug Administration authority to fully regulate the sale of tobacco products.
OK. Because it's kind of offensive.
She's three years older than Prince Harry. She's divorced. She's self-supporting. She's a professional woman. But really above all, she is biracial. She has a white father and an African-American mother. And that, more than anything else made her a very different, very radical new member of a family that really hasn't changed much for centuries.
So if you cannot learn from the experiences of other countries, what can you learn from? We have to take a policy that actually works, and what those countries and every other developed country have determined works, is a value added tax. Because a value added tax is impossible to game your way out of. If you're a trillion-dollar technology company — you know, I was just in New Hampshire campaigning yesterday, and you know what I say to them? I say to everyone around the country, Amazon, a trillion-dollar technology company sucking up $20 billion in business every year, closing 30 percent of your stores and malls, paying zero in taxes, how do you feel about that? You know? And they are angry. They say, how the heck can Amazon be paying zero in taxes? And I was like, I know. And it's up to you, the people of New Hampshire, to change it. So if you look at other countries ——
Anne Beau Cox was born on Dec. 1, 1919, in Dayton, Ohio. Her mother, Margaretta Parker (Blair) Cox, used the baby as a way to avoid talking about politics when appearing in New York the next year, during her husband's presidential campaign. (But please excuse me from talking politics, she would say. Anne is very well, thank you. Baby Anne was born last winter.)
I saw her in Prom, and I'm like, she's still fantastic, and this is very light.
I grew up in a house without a stereo, and my parents' car radio was always tuned to big-band music, so my formative years were in no way informed by Elvis Presley, who would have turned 83 on Monday. But you hear a cheerful song just as you're thinking you might truly die, and you form a kind of bond with it. Driving over Monteagle Mountain with the cat latched to my head, I vowed to see his Graceland estate someday. How lucky to be moving to the very state where Graceland could be found!
I lived with both parents as a child, but somehow the earliest memory I have of my father is of calling him one night when I was 7 and he was traveling. We were three time zones apart, but my mother was able to reach him at his hotel room so I could tell him I could not sleep. I was worried about dying, the way other children might be afraid of the dark. I remember him consoling me, and his ability to be there for me — by phone, by any means necessary — grew as I grew.
Reviewing a performance by Mr. Holdsworth in 1983, The New York Times's Jon Pareles wrote: He pours out notes in a liquid rush without slurring a single one. His sense of harmony reveals itself in daring melodic extrapolations and in chords that are complex and impressionistic yet as transparent as folk music.

The U.S. vaccine rollout needs to 'hit the reset,' an ex-F.D.A. chief says. Health workers prepared doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for mass inoculations at the Arizona State Fairgrounds in Phoenix this month. Credit... Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times Warning that vaccines are the only backstop the country has against fast-spreading new variants of the coronavirus, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said Sunday that federal and state leaders need to hit the reset and adopt a new strategy to get far more shots into arms as soon as possible. Speaking on Face the Nation on CBS News, Dr. Gottlieb said the 40 million doses currently available could go a long way toward protecting the nation's 50 million residents who are 65 and older in particular. I think we need to take an all-of-the-above approach and push it out through different channels, Dr. Gottlieb said, including the big-box stores, including federal sites that the Biden administration is talking about standing up. We need to try everything right now to create multiple distribution points. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 22.1 million doses had been sent to states as of Friday but only about 6.7 million people had received the first of two necessary doses. That data lags the most recent allocations by at least a few days.
These additions are part of the reason California books are almost always longer than their Texas counterparts.
In a vacuum, you're 100 percent correct. But it's failing to account for the fact that we're taking that money, and then some, and putting it directly into the hands of the American consumer.
A year later, Kevin Hart released a special, Irresponsible, in which he also discussed cheating on his wife. He was more oblique, briefer in his contrition, and the special cut away from him after a joke to show the crowd laughing. Whereas Burnham kept the audience out of it, Irresponsible took a more ingratiating route, with a shot that indicated it was OK to laugh before keeping things moving.
The petitioners — a group of women that includes a sociologist, a journalist, an activist, a lawyer and a psychologist, as well as a member of the lower house of Parliament — argued that examining whether the hymen was intact had no scientific or legal bearing in sexual violence cases, and violated constitutional rights to privacy and dignity.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's Future of Education and Skills 2030 project is exploring the ways education systems internationally need to change to prepare students for a rapidly automating economy.
JW: And let me just, one last follow-up on that. If Democrats don't take back the Senate, how do you feel with the Supreme Court — how do you, I mean, put aside expanding the number of justices, how do you even get a justice onto the court in the first place?
Without family near or money to spare, I brought my newborn with me to law school, placing her on my lap during class. Jane's presence may have distracted other students, but it also brought them joy. (Without a dose of humanity, civil procedure can be rather dry.) Jane never cried — neither in class nor as I wrote papers late into the night, waiting for my medical resident husband to come home. Now, my daughter thinks my lawyer job is boring, but her quiet patience made it all possible. — Kate Vaughan
That's not me. Sorry. You got the wrong gal here. Bryan Cranston was a working actor for decades before he got his big break, starring as Walter White in Breaking Bad. It was a career-defining role but also a potential trap. Where do you go after you play Heisenberg?
I've been a registered Democrat since the Clinton years; I was an Obama appointee. I had a fund-raiser for John Kerry. It wasn't a great fund-raiser because I was kind of young; it wasn't one of those fancy ones where you generate tens of thousands.
So if you had, for example, a rule that said, Look, the government is allowed to match whatever salary a private sector employee is being offered, then you'd have more success. If you said, Look, you don't need to move to Washington, D.C., and sit in the thing that was built decades ago, that's like solace, and you have this giant parking lot and you just feel miserable being there for like a day, let alone a career.
Unlike four years ago, when many of the participants in the post-inaugural prayer service were conservative evangelicals or prosperity gospel preachers, this year's Thursday service included a broad array of religious progressives, including two transgender faith leaders. Rabbi Sharon Brous of IKAR, a Jewish community in Los Angeles, prayed for the coming of a new America, one built on love, rooted in justice and propelled by our moral imagination.

Ms. Wilhelm was one of the few women writing science fiction under their own names in the 1960s, and her books quickly gained a following as well as awards.
I don't know. We're asking for due process and for an investigation. And if the investigation proves what you're saying is right, then that's an issue. If it's saying what you're saying is wrong, then it was a good shoot. But I don't have an opinion there, because I don't work on opinions. I work on evidence. And I haven't seen all the evidence. And I'm not going to answer or get painted into a corner or try to ask a question. What I answered you with is as a taser instructor — what we teach, what they say, what the law says. It doesn't matter, quite honestly, if you read Georgia law, it clearly says that the taser is a deadly weapon. So I mean, what's the difference? If a gun's a deadly weapon, a taser is a deadly weapon, you point either one of them, then you're justified for using deadly force.
A year ago when Wuhan shut down, it offered the world a forewarning about the dangers of the virus. Now, it heralds a post-pandemic world where the relief at unmasked faces, joyous get-togethers and daily commutes conceals the emotional aftershocks.
Mike? he said. I'm going to have to call in a big one.
Really? So, we have to get done what we can get done. And if we have to focus on things that are traditionally bipartisan, I'd be excited to lead with that. I mean, I'd be much more excited to lead with a much bigger agenda to balance out this economy, to work for people. And I will say that's bipartisan, too. When I go around to Americans around the country, if you were to go to a room of Republicans and say, Hey, how do you feel about Amazon paying zero in taxes? They're not excited about that. They feel like this economy is rigged against them and their families, and they're generally correct, and that is bipartisan.
Her death was confirmed by Shelley Ross, a former network news colleague, who said Ms. Chase had undergone surgery for brain cancer several weeks ago.
You keep saying feel, and I believe that is a deliberate word choice. But when a Black American is hurt or is killed in one of these interactions, in many cases by a white police officer, do you understand why that doesn't feel like a perception? It's an experience, a reality.
This rang true even for young local voters, who in the week leading up to the inauguration described feeling elated. Jean Peterson, a paralegal in Denver who turns 26 this week, described watching Mr. Polis's November victory speech with her girlfriend, tears in her eyes.
Its customers were the real departure from the routine, for they were almost exclusively the new male dandies invented by the 1960s, a taboo-breaking mixture of social and rock aristocracy as never encountered before, Richard Lester wrote in Boutique London: King's Road to Carnaby Street (2010).
PARK CITY, Utah — A runaway bride, wildly rambunctious women and two quietly resolute girls — the Sundance Film Festival is one movie celebration where the so-called second sex consistently comes out on top. Now in its 36th year, the festival has long made room for female filmmakers even when there weren't all that many. In 1985, its inaugural year, it presented 85 movies, 10 from female directors, about half non-Americans like Lina Wertmüller, one of the few such filmmakers on anyone's radar back then. Of this year's 128 features, nearly half are from women. (The festival ends Sunday.)
He was also well served early on by his ability — at least by the not very rigorous standards of the late 1950s — to affect an ethnically ambiguous character. In one of his earliest roles, he had a bit part as an Indian.
Nick Fox: Can I clarify one point on taxation? Are you proposing any new or increased taxes on the wealthiest Americans or corporations, or is it strictly the VAT?
This was the cover of a tax book, one seminarian remarked to me, as he looked at a painted Annunciation by Giovanni di Paolo. Then he added, That's how much religion was a part of life. In mainstream America it is no longer so; indeed, for a young man pursuing a life of celibate devotion to Christ, the world outside the seminary is a minefield of temptations and distractions. Tom Holloway, the former alt-rocker, said once, Every morning when we get out of bed, there's a war going on, and we're right in the middle of it. The world threatens in a multitude of ways; even something as simple as grocery shopping can pose hazards. Lots of magazine covers don't reach Christian modesty, Magat said. I have to pretty much stare straight ahead -- there are half-naked women all over the place! The world threatened, too, during the White House sex scandal, when seminarians had to grapple with whether to read the sexually explicit Starr report. Many did not; some who did went to confession afterward. All whom I spoke to said they prayed for the President, though politically they deplore his support for abortion rights. (In general, their opposition to abortion drives them to the right politically, but not without misgivings -- the Republicans, in their view, do not show enough concern for the poor.) To protect themselves from visual affronts, seminarians employ what they call custody of the eyes. Bashista explained this concept: You just look down.
KK: So I want to move on. We have some more personal questions for you.
To those who believe that an emphasis on Jewish ethics will be enough to transmit the essence of Judaism to our children, I say, Maybe you are right. Certainly many Jews, especially secular Jews, agree with you and hope you are right. But beyond broad generalities, it is difficult to distill from the highly diverse Jewish sources a few programmatic essences that are easily transmittable from generation to generation, without living the kind of Jewish lives that our grandparents lived.
Mr. Brown and Mr. Gomes both create stage worlds that contain same-sex partnering as well as conventionally heterosexual duets; both allow for those same-sex relationships to be interpreted in sexual terms. Although Mr. Brown is much the least experienced dance-maker of this program's three, he's the one with the strongest sense of structural suspense. One group of four (one woman, three men) is juxtaposed with another of six (three male-female couples); and what he does with each group keeps you wondering what will happen next. A sustained duet for two men looks natural: a study of intimate cooperation.
Mr. Tree, a violist, founded the Guarneri in 1964 with two friends he had studied with at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, the violinists Arnold Steinhardt and John Dalley, along with the cellist David Soyer.

After watching his comedy, I felt that he wasn't a malignant racist and that his slur toward me was just very, very bad comedy run amok. Which did not strike me as a fireable offense, and I realized that if I was the individual who was actually directly slurred, and I did not feel that he should lose his job over it, then I should probably share that sentiment with other people.
Mr. Yang has frequently reiterated his commitment to a two-state solution but has not released any detailed plans about how he would advance an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan or address Mr. Trump's policies in the region. He told the Council on Foreign Relations, I don't want to prescribe the specifics of a two-state solution, as the Israeli and Palestinian people both need to be leading any conversation, and I look forward to engaging with all stakeholders.
Christopher Federico, a professor of political science and psychology at the University of Minnesota, described the key roles of education and employment opportunity in the right-wing mobilization of less-educated white men:
But as I dug into it more and more, I realized that for all the soap opera quality to Harry and Meghan, this story actually does have a deeper dimension and a deeper context.
But this much is clear: A king's role in Malaysia has little parallel among the world's monarchies.
Details: In 1994, a multiyear, 23-nation survey found that the sexual abuse of nuns by priests or bishops was especially rampant in some African countries. In 1998, another report confirmed those findings and discovered that even rape of sisters was common. Another found that 29 nuns in one order alone had become pregnant.
Mr. Trump likes to say that the economy has reached historic highs under his administration. However, life expectancy has been falling and other measures of well-being have declined, including rising rates of depression diagnosis.

This week brings some serious-minded nonfiction (Wall Street wrongdoing, covert wars, depression) and meaty fiction (an epic bildungsroman, border wars, a multigenerational immigrant saga) with a glamorous dose of diverting memoir from the actress and biographer Patricia Bosworth. Plus, a new book from Kevin Wilson, author of the beloved 2011 novel, The Family Fang. I'm especially heartened by the ambitious sweep of this week's best fiction. There is nothing scaled-back or slight about the stories these writers set out to tell.
KK: And, who has broken your heart?
No, I didn't touch her. I just made my notes and drew my stick-figure sketch, with professional care--like I was back in the rotation. The .22 lay upside down and almost on its side, propped against the chair leg. Before I left the room I turned off the light for a second with a gloved hand and there were her eyes still moist in the moonlight. Crime scenes you look at like cartoon puzzles in the newspapers. Spot the difference. And something was wrong. Jennifer's body was beautiful--you wouldn't dare pray for a body like that--but something was wrong with it. It was dead.

Over the weekend, infections soared across the West and South, with 42,000 new cases identified on Saturday alone. Texas and Arizona reported a record number of hospitalizations, and testing sites in Florida turned people away because lines became so long.
Many of Mr. Yang's supporters say they are drawn to his perspective as a political outsider; in The Wall Street Journal, some say they previously supported Senator Sanders but now look for a candidate who offers an even fresher non-Washington perspective.
The Height of the Storm, by the French playwright Florian Zeller, is headed for Broadway, the Manhattan Theater Club announced Wednesday.
This remarkable story is all too typical of how so many Jewish leaders throughout our history have reasoned about Jewish survival. Without tsuris--troubles--we will cease to be Jewish. We need to be persecuted, impoverished, discriminated against, hated, and victimized in order for us to retain our Jewishness. The chosen people must be denied choices if Judaism is to survive. If Jews are given freedom, opportunity, and choice, they will choose to assimilate and disappear.
Thousands--no one knows how many--trampled through fences and over guards to surround the silvery plane and to acclaim, in a wild outburst of emotion, the first man to fly the Atlantic solo nonstop from the United States to Europe--a feat that was equivalent in the public mind then to the first human step on the moon 42 years later. Icarus had at last succeeded, a daring man alone had attained the unattainable. What enhanced the fear for many was that Lindbergh was a tall, handsome bachelor with a becoming smile, an errant lock of blond hair over his forehead and a pleasing outward modesty and guilelessness. He was the flawless El Cid, the gleaming Galahad, Frank Merriwell in the flesh. The delirium that engulfed Paris swirled out over the civilized world. Banner headlines heralded the event. Medals galore were bestowed on Lindbergh. He was gushed over, adulated, worshiped, feted in France, Belgium and Britain. President Calvin Coolidge sent the cruiser Memphis, flagship of the United States European Fleet, to bring him and the Spirit of St. Louis back to the United States and later awarded him the Medal of Honor, previously reserved only for military heroes. And already a captain in the United States Officers Reserve Corps, Lindbergh was jumped to a full colonel. As the cruiser steamed up Chesapeake Bay, she was met by four destroyers, two Army blimps and 40 airplanes from the Army, Navy and Marine Corps.
Mr. Yang has said most Americans don't want to work for the federal government and argued that his Freedom Dividend would therefore be more effective than a program like a federal jobs guarantee.
Matthew Azimi, 36, had overdosed, not in an abandoned house or a dank basement, but in a faculty restroom at a special education high school in the Bronx. He taught there. His students, some of them severely disabled, had just been dismissed for the day.
This is a much more structural, long-term crisis, Mr. Fink writes in the letter. He said he had come to that conclusion after talking with business leaders and scientists and having BlackRock model the economic effects of climate change.
It is likewise hard to overstate the symbolic power of General Suleimani in the region, particularly among Arab Shiite groups in Iraq and Lebanon. He was the face of Iranian power from Lebanon to Yemen, a face that brought money, weapons and advisers. Yet he wasn't the only person in the Revolutionary Guards who built such personal relationships, as the Western news media tends to depict. Far from it.
Mr. Yang's candidacy has centered on the idea of his Freedom Dividend, essentially universal basic income — which has a long history, drawing support from Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King Jr. and Friedrich von Hayek, but also a controversial one. (Later annotations will look at why.)
Pogo once said: We have [met] the enemy and he is us! As Jews, we have not yet been given the luxury of seeing ourselves as the enemy. There are still too many external enemies who challenge the very physical survival of the Jewish people in Israel and throughout the world. But as we become stronger in the face of our external enemies, we must prepare to confront ourselves.
That was just what worried me: the possibility of past-its-prime ham. (Mr. Lithgow has never been uncomfortable with the grand style.) Stories by Heart seemed to be the kind of quick and cheap show that a theater company, in this case the Roundabout, mounts when there's a hole in its schedule or budget. (The production, directed by Daniel Sullivan, is luxurious only in Kenneth Posner's lighting.) Besides, who needs the equivalent of a bedtime fairy tale on Broadway when you can have your phone read you Moby-Dick on the subway?
A VAT (value-added tax) is a tax on consumption, so the burden disproportionately falls on low-income households, who spend a larger portion of their income.
Mr. Trump canceled a planned news conference at a NATO gathering in December after a video circulated that showed world leaders including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Emmanuel Macron of France in what appeared to be a conversation mocking Mr. Trump.
The conflict now enters uncharted seas. The Nixon resignation, for one, cut the matter short, and the Andrew Johnson trial occurred more than 100 years ago, in a different America, one without nuclear weapons or cable television or public opinion polls.
There is a strikingly different approach to the debate over masculinity in a different branch of academic inquiry. As David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., wrote in response to my query:
Bradby follows up by saying, would it be fair to say she hasn't been O.K.? And Markle thinks about it for a moment and replies —
Well, in this case, what's interesting is it's up to the employer, and it was NBC and Saturday Night Live. Even as I made the statement saying I didn't think he should be fired, I thought he probably would be fired. Because if you're NBC and SNL, you look up and say, what is my upside for keeping this guy? He's not exactly a huge moneymaker, he hasn't worked a day on the set. Like, that's not a really powerful set of incentives. And so I thought they probably would fire him. I'd suggest that the extent there are consequences for people's misstatements, they should be somewhere commensurate to the level of power and influence they have and the harm that they're doing. In Shane Gillis's case, he was a comedian. I'd never heard of the guy before.
Murder is a man thing.
I'm for a more progressive tax structure. It's clear that the people at the top of the income chain are not paying enough. I don't think a wealth tax will work. I like the spirit of a wealth tax, but if you look at other countries' experience, Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, very sophisticated developed countries, they tried a wealth tax and they wound up repealing it because it had massive compliance problems, and it did not generate anywhere near the revenue that was projected.
So we need to have better, more holistic ways of measuring how our kids are doing educationally, and we need to empower teachers and let teachers do their jobs. Because if you are a teacher and you're teaching to the test, you end up making decisions in the classroom that you know are not right for the students.

The American cities with the highest number of high-net-worth individuals are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington. California has the most number of people on the Forbes list of wealthiest Americans.
Morgan Stanley said it was suspending all PAC contributions to members of Congress who did not vote to certify the results. Marriott said it would pause donations from its PAC to those who voted against certification of the election. And the chemicals giant Dow said it was suspending all PAC contributions to any member of Congress who voted to object to the certification of the presidential election.
All right, perfect. That's a perfect way to end. Mr, Cranston, thank you so much for doing this. It was a really fascinating conversation.
The son of a retail executive, Mr. Kratz grew up on Long Island, attended Dartmouth, received a law degree from Boston University, and did a brief stint at the Wall Street law firm Gould & Wilkie before realizing this isn't for me.
In Distances Smaller Than This Are Not Confirmed, David Neumann and Marcella Murray's quiet, experimental dialogue about race, the question comes up again and again — she, a young black woman, posing it to him, a middle-aged white man who cannot answer it. Not that he doesn't try, grasping for childhood anecdotes like the time in second grade that he mispronounced Niger and spurred a classroom lecture on civil rights.
Many of their contemporaries regarded the idea of a Catholic intellectual as a contradiction in terms, believing that the repressive Roman church prohibited freedom of thought. The converts were eager to prove otherwise; their work in history, science, literature, and philosophy was designed to substantiate their belief that Catholicism was intellectually liberating rather than restrictive, despite the church's dogmatic style and hierarchical structure. They wrote partly for a Catholic audience, to be sure, but more for their Protestant and skeptical contemporaries, hoping to vindicate their own conversions by persuading others to follow them. To win more converts they knew that they would have to improve intellectual standards within Catholicism. History written in the form of pious hagiography and retrospective justification of every Catholic position, for example, would never convince Protestants and skeptics; it was annoying rather than persuasive to all but the most devout believer. Catholic history would henceforth have to be deeply researched, impartial in evaluating evidence, stylistically elegant, and vigorously argued. The same would have to be true in all other disciplines too. In urging such changes and in trying to set an example in their own work, however, convert intellectuals did not mean to abandon apologetics. Rather, they introduced a more circumspect apologetics, calculated to attract other intellectuals by appealing to them in their own idiom.
Keith Leavitt, an ethics researcher and associate professor at Oregon State University, has found that workplace lies are often related to protecting our identity, whether we define ourselves through our achievements, through the roles in which we serve others, or through belonging to a group. We tend to tell three kinds of lies at work: lies that protect my own accomplishment, lies that protect someone I'm close to, and lies that protect my company, Dr. Leavitt says.
Well, that wasn't going to happen tonight.
Yeah, and I even feel more so. We've said from day one, we the union, that looking at the videos and everything, we're not saying whether it was a good shoot or a bad shoot. We don't have enough evidence to say that. Normally how this situation goes in officer-involved shootings, the G.B.I., Georgia Bureau of Investigation, does the investigation. The officer is either put on administrative leave with or without pay, and then the results are turned to the D.A. or to the city. But the district attorney here decided to do his own investigation that he normally doesn't do. And then, after he did his press conference, we found — I guess, to be politically correct, misspoken — misspokens, if you will, or lies that he did. And we haven't even been entitled to all of the investigative material. So yeah, we still believe that it was a rushed investigation, and it was politically motivated.
How the National University of Singapore has kept the coronavirus off campus. Students and staff at the National University of Singapore move within their designated zones on campus in November. Universities in Singapore have avoided coronavirus cases in part by using technology. Credit... Ore Huiying for The New York Times Every day, Tan Eng Chye, the president of the National University of Singapore, scans his online dashboard to see how crowded the cafeterias are. If the real-time map shows that one cafeteria is too packed, he has administrators send out an advisory to avoid it and to remind students that there are campus-run food delivery services, free of charge. Following the government's lead, universities in Singapore, a semi-authoritarian city-state of almost six million people, have taken a top-down approach to managing the coronavirus. The result: Since the start of the pandemic last year, not one person has been found to have contracted the virus at any of Singapore's three major universities. While Singapore's universities have benefited from a generally low caseload in its broader population, their experience and stringent measures stand in stark contrast to many campuses across the United States. A number of American universities experienced an explosion in cases almost as soon as students returned last fall. The National University of Singapore, or N.U.S., describes its strategy as containment, decongestion and contact tracing. The university has harnessed technology to enforce social distancing measures, assigned students to different zones on campus and imposed tough penalties for flouting the rules.
Blythe Connor is reluctant to become a parent — understandably so. Her own mother abandoned her when she was 11, after years of cruelty. Her grandmother, also abusive, departed in a more gruesome way: by hanging herself from a tree in the front yard. Blythe is primed, perhaps even genetically programmed, for maternal struggle. I think the baby hates me, she says just days after giving birth to her first child, a daughter named Violet. Their relationship goes downhill from there.
Until she narrowly lost a contest to lead the Socialist Party in 2012, Ms. Chacón was talked about as one day becoming Spain's first female prime minister.
From the opening origin myths — about Yggdrasil, a life tree with three roots in three worlds, and the driftwood logs that give rise to the first humans, Ask (named from the ash tree) and Embla (named from the elm) — I was struck by the differences between the stories I'd learned as a child raised Catholic (it didn't take) and a creation story in which humans spring from trees. Hearing again that we might imagine ourselves born of the natural world, an idea shared by many pre-Christian indigenous cultures, made me feel briefly less hopeless.
In fact, I had to fight it a little bit. One scene where Patricia Kalember, who played my girlfriend, was cheating on me.
Mr. Gabbard, who has been a state lawmaker since 2006, has been an outspoken anti-gay activist. In addition to the Alliance for Traditional Marriage, he also ran a group called Stop Promoting Homosexuality America and hosted an anti-gay radio show called Let's Talk Straight Hawaii, according to Honolulu Civil Beat, a news organization.
I do not want the N.S.A. to outsource national security work to them. I want them to try and fight fire with fire and actually recruit using some of the same methods, and I want the N.S.A. to try and work with them to the extent that they're realistic, and they know that Google is going to be innovating in ways that the N.S.A. will not be able to do.
SURVIVING R. KELLY: PART II: THE RECKONING 8 p.m. on Lifetime. Surviving R. Kelly, the documentary series that explored sexual abuse allegations against the R&B singer, comes to a close with this sequel. The final episode revisits the aftermath of Kelly being taken into federal custody and spotlights the families of two of his live-in girlfriends who largely defended him when the allegations surfaced.
And The Washington Post reported that the president had taken extensive steps to conceal his conversations with Russia's President Vladimir Putin over the past two years.
So you're looking at a nation of high school graduates. And what do high school graduates do for a living? The top five occupational categories are retail and administrative, which includes call center work, retail, food service and food preparation, transportation, primarily truck driving, and attendant supportive jobs and manufacturing still. We all know that we have gutted many of these industries, and their labor bases have shrunk.
As Australia's most successful female tennis player, she has 64 majors titles across singles, doubles and mixed doubles categories. She is a 24-time Grand Slam singles winner, a record that no male or female player has been able to beat. Serena Williams is next in line, one Grand Slam title away.
The police searched the hole and the area around it in August, but they never found human remains, signs of the tarp or of lime. However they reviewed cellphone data that showed that Mr. Mawhinney's phone had been used near the gun club on March 29 and again at about 11 p.m. on May 31, a week after Ms. Dulos's disappearance.
I want to counter what you have just described in those statistics and the idea that this is a question of perception rather than conduct in patterns. I'm sure you know some of this. Local and federal investigations have found what they describe as systemic racial bias in the Chicago Police Department, in the Baltimore Police Department, in the Ferguson Police Department. Now, in Ferguson, what they found was that Black drivers were more than twice as likely to be searched after being stopped as white drivers were. In New York City, where I live, data makes clear that police stopped and frisked Black and Latino New Yorkers at significantly higher rates than they actually represent in the city. About 83 percent of the stops during about a decade-long period involved Black and Hispanics, even though they make up about 50 percent of the city's residents. So 83 percent of stops, 50 percent of the city's residents. And in Minneapolis, just a few weeks ago, data showed that use of force against Black people in that city was seven times greater than it was against white people in the city. So the idea that it's just perception, rather than a documented, data-based conclusion about conduct, does not seem accurate. Because all of that data seems to point to a pattern of racial discrimination.
Especially for people who are at the lower end of the skills ladder, which is most Americans. Only 33 percent of Americans will graduate from college, 42 percent if you include two-year degrees.
When will they ever learn? The aliens, I mean, who can't seem to resist the impulse to invade Earth and wipe out humanity. Before We Vanish, Kiyoshi Kurosawa's witty science-fiction chin-scratcher — less a horror movie than a series of musings on potentially horrifying ideas — addresses the question literally. It concerns a reconnaissance squad of space travelers sent to do fieldwork in our ways and habits, with particular emphasis on our mental concepts.
Perils mount for the Trump presidency.
Scrutinizing, looking after it, because I'm just like, What? My hair? Who cares? No one. And then people are like, No, no, and they have to put time in, smooth it out.
That's right. It sets the stage for what is an epic breakup between Harry, and Meghan, and the royal family, and really between Harry and Meghan and the British people.
'Matthew Wong: Blue' at Karma gallery. Matthew Wong was one of the most talented painters of his generation, Roberta Smith wrote in her review of this posthumous show. (The 35-year-old artist died this fall before the exhibition opened.) Wong's paintings of nocturnal landscapes and interiors explore the infinite tones, moods and luminosities of the color blue, and reveal a visionary fusion of form and feeling, Smith wrote. Free.

Many lines of conflict mutually reinforce each other rather than crosscut: Less educated whites tend to be more Evangelical and more racist, and they live in geographical spaces with less economic momentum.
The statement did not specify a cause of death, but Mr. King had recently been treated for Covid-19. In 2019, he was hospitalized for chest pains and said he had also suffered a stroke.
He has promised a harder line against Russia than President Donald J. Trump was willing to take, and will review American policy toward North Korea, which he described at the Senate hearing as a problem that has not gotten better; in fact, it's gotten worse.
So this is not a left or a right idea, this is bipartisan. And many Republicans will see that this is going to be a huge win for their constituents, for rural areas, for red states on the interior. We don't need 80 percent of Congress to pass it, we just need a majority.
A VAT (value-added tax) is a tax on consumption, so the burden disproportionately falls on low-income households, who spend a larger portion of their income.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the federal government commissioned a series of experiments to look at how guaranteed income effects labor participation. Researchers discovered that a program like U.B.I. doesn't have the drastic effect on work that some might predict; households overall reduce their workload by roughly 13 percent, according to a paper in the Canadian Public Policy journal.
CW: I'm curious, then, focusing on the U.S., a couple of months ago the general counsel for the N.S.A. wrote an Op-Ed for us and was worried about this big challenge of the government not being able to acquire the tech talent. That Silicon Valley is actually so much more attractive, so much more interesting there. And that when you're looking at 5G technology, quantum computing, technology, A.I., not having engineers in that space and sort of outsourcing that to the private sector is potentially incredibly dangerous. Like how do you actually make people want to come and bring that engineering talent to the federal government, rather than ——
So sought-after was a placement in the magazine that designers were known to send expensive gifts to win her over. In the 1990 Times Magazine profile, she admitted to accepting gifts from decorators who were her friends, but she denied that she could be so easily bought by what her critics called a rat pack of designer pals.
But even as he acknowledges the faults of populism, Lind treats the class-war aspect of polarization as a potentially positive development, because he hopes that it will create a real political coalition for the losers of neoliberal era — a socially conservative, economically left-leaning constituency that's numerous but often homeless. Making such a coalition constructive rather than just disruptive may be impossible, but it's the only way he sees to escape neoliberal oligarchy and bring our class war to an end with a negotiated peace.
Instead, the media cites China's response as proof of the superiority of the country's authoritarian system, especially compared with that of the United States and other democracies, which are still struggling to contain raging outbreaks And now, as the Jan. 23 anniversary of Wuhan's lockdown nears, the government has deployed an army of censors to scrub the internet of critical coverage of the Wuhan outbreak. A recent propaganda directive explicitly banned coverage of the anniversary of the outbreak, according to journalists at state-run news outlets who were briefed on the order. Instead, propaganda agencies have pushed feel-good videos and adulatory articles that depict Wuhan as a city reborn. The government underscored its message to the media last month when it sentenced Zhang Zhan, a 37-year-old citizen journalist who documented Wuhan's ordeal, to four years in prison. She is the first person known to have faced trial for chronicling China's outbreak. Amy Qin and
Mr. Northam won 80 percent of the vote in predominantly black communities, according to Ms. Nguyen. While his call for the removal of Confederate monuments in the wake of Charlottesville might have deepened his minority support, the racist photo on his yearbook page showed that he was not immune to the state's deeply rooted racism, several Virginians said.
AK: Whether or not the Navy is big enough to meet its commitments with the Chinese and the South China Sea? What's going on in the Persian Gulf? What do you think?
Paradise was lost. Eighty-five people died, and more than 90 percent of its population was driven out. Two years later, about 4,000 residents have returned to its scorched earth to lay new foundations and test fate once again. Mr. Singer, who has spent the past 24 months preparing to rebuild his home, is among them.
Two States. Eight Textbooks. Two American Stories. American history textbooks can differ across the country, in ways that are shaded by partisan politics.
Every subsequent culture-war battle, in Caldwell's account — the debates over feminism and gay marriage, transgender rights and immigration — follows the lines of this constitutional division. The new constitutionalists are constantly discovering new rights and empowering courts and bureaucracies to enforce them; the old constitutionalists object, win a few elections on the objection and then find themselves defeated nonetheless. And this pattern of defeat is responsible, he implies, for the Trumpian turn: After so many failures to defend the old Constitution, Trump-era conservatives are embracing the logic of the new one, choosing white-identity politics because in the new constitutional dispensation that began in 1964, group identities are the only ones that count.
It's obviously much harder. I'm all about trying to maximize the possible. And so, if we don't get a majority — I expect the Democrats will win a slight majority in the Senate. I'm very optimistic that way, but we're going to get done what we can get done with the branch of the government we have control of. And I will say too, I believe that we can get some things done that are traditionally bipartisan, regardless of who has control of the Senate. To me, I cannot believe that we did not get infrastructure done during the first couple of years of the Trump administration. I thought at least he would build some bridges and roads, and I was even willing to accept the Trump name on those bridges and roads if it got some bridges and roads built. I was, At least we're going to get this.
Do I feel — you know, a lot of people ask those questions. And it's hard to answer, because I personally don't ever see race. I never have. I've been in law enforcement for over 30 years. I don't care what's your color, creed, race. It doesn't matter. You're a human being. I will treat you as that until you — and I will act the same way you act towards me. If we're cordial, we're talking, we're going to be cordial and talking. If you're going to fight me, I'm going to defend myself. Do I think these officers decided to shoot Mr. Brooks — because that appears basically what you're asking me — because of his skin color? Absolutely not.

distributed guidance to its field offices that says agents may nominate someone to be considered a known or suspected terrorist if they have particular negative information to support their suspicions, like an allegation that the suspect has terrorism ties that is corroborated by at least one other source. But mere guesses or hunches, the bureau said at the time, are not enough. The Terrorism Screening Database is maintained by the F.B.I. 's Terrorist Screening Center. Some of the data used by the Terrorist Screening Center comes from a larger database maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center, an interagency clearinghouse for intelligence about potential terrorist threats. Being on the watch list can restrict people from entering the country, deny them government benefits or contracts, and subject them to greater scrutiny at airports and by the police. A subset of the people on the watch list are also placed on the so-called no-fly list, which bars them from being aboard planes in American airspace. The vast majority of people included in the database are foreigners abroad, but some are American citizens or lawful permanent residents. Court records suggest that in 2017, the F.B.I. 's Terrorism Screening Database had about 1.2 million people in it, including about 4,600 such American or green-card holders. The government has said a broader database of terrorism suspects called the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment had about 1.6 million names in it, of which about 16,000 were Americans. Katie Benner and
Jennifer? And it just came out. I said: You're fucking me.
Well, I'm all about trying to improve the reality on the ground, to the extent that we can actually put resources and funds to work in communities to make sure that women have access to reproductive rights in clinics. Certainly any way we can make sure that there aren't any obstacles to the funding of Planned Parenthood clinics around the country. I would take those actions immediately. A lot of the legislative actions, you need a bit more time and a bit more buy-in from Congress, but at the Supreme Court level, I would consider appointing more justices if it was necessary to safeguard women's reproductive rights.
I took a hit in Iowa, the former vice president allowed. I'll probably take a hit here.

All right, you turn the table. Turn them away. Lazy Susan me, as I like to say.
Jamie Dimon, who is a Democrat but is a numbers person, has looked at the numbers and said, we should declare a national emergency around the fact that the economy is not working for most Americans. And he's proposing a negative income tax, which is a close cousin to the Freedom Dividend that I'm championing.
Another Woman (1988), starring Gena Rowlands as a professor and Ms. Farrow as a patient seeing an analyst in the adjacent apartment, is perhaps Mr. Allen's most sustained and successful effort at imagining women who function independently from a man like him (though Ian Holm shows up playing a version of that). You can say that Mr. Allen borrowed a lot from Ingmar Bergman — in this period the Bergman influence is overt and unavoidable — but also that his empathy and curiosity were engaged as never before.
He articulated a vision for the future of work, education and technology for the nation. The board also delved into Mr. Yang's approach to foreign policy and military intervention, and learned of his fascination with aliens and fear of flying vacuum cleaners.
California Texas Takeaway California refers to the income gap and explains that changes in tax structures and safety-net programs and higher costs for education, child care, and housing played a role. Both state editions discuss economic inequality in reference to the Occupy Wall Street movement and the decline of labor unions. Pearson, United States History: The Twentieth Century, California, P. 728; Pearson, United States History: 1877 to Present, Texas, P. 687. The older Texas edition highlights additional Republican critiques of President Barack Obama's environmental policies, while the California book discusses the threat of rising sea levels. Pearson, United States History: The Twentieth Century, California, P. 749; Pearson, United States History: 1877 to Present, Texas, P. 709.
But those within the church say that the increasingly secular nature of American life has taken the biggest toll on vocations. This is the world of advanced science and physics -- what are priests doing in this world? asks the Rev. Lorenzo Albacete, a theology professor at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers. Those that come into the seminary today are taking a radical stand. They are countercultural.
Long before the name Matthew Specktor was inscribed on Samantha Culp's heart, it could be found beneath a short, sweet note inscribed on a page of Mr. Specktor's book, American Dream Machine, which she bought at a benefit at the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles in June 2013.
Brice Thomas, the lead pastor, says he first grasped religion's capacity for harm when his father, a Pentecostal faith healer, died of a treatable skin cancer because the church did not believe in going to doctors. After a stint in the military, Mr. Thomas, who is gay, became ordained in the United Church of Christ, one of the first denominations to affirm marriage equality, and took up his duties in Nashville last year. Together with Jennifer Strickland, a licensed therapist, he is setting up a Recovering from Religious Trauma Syndrome group at the church.
Mr. Yang has proposed what he describes as a W.T.O. for data and has argued that data ownership should be made a property right. Some argue that such an organization could enable more partnership among countries in setting standards for artificial intelligence and data.
Raised on Martha's Vineyard, Mr. Bryant was a seaman, a carpenter, a ditch digger, a logger, a cook and a dock builder. He was also a Dartmouth College graduate and a reporter and the managing editor of The Claremont Daily Eagle in west-central New Hampshire for more than a decade in the 1950s and '60s.
LOVE AND RUIN, by Paula McLain. (Ballantine, $17.) McLain's latest novel, about the marriage between the journalist Martha Gellhorn and Ernest Hemingway, takes up the question that vexed (and probably doomed) their relationship: Why must a woman choose between her career and what her husband wants her to be? McLain drew on primary sources to develop her fiery protagonist.
We analyzed some of the most popular social studies textbooks used in California and Texas. Here's how political divides shape what students learn about the nation's history.
Michael Rainey, who dressed the Beatles and the Rolling Stones in flamboyant, boldly colored designs from his avant-garde London men's boutique and briefly became part of the city's swinging fashion scene in the 1960s, died on Jan. 28 in Granada, Spain. He was 76.
Political strategists and crisis communication experts said the sensitivity speaks to how quickly the center of gravity has shifted for Democrats on key issues. As recently as 2006, national Democrats including former President Barack Obama expressed wariness about immigrants' ability to assimilate into American culture and did not openly embrace gay marriage — two talking points that would probably be deeply damaging for any 2020 candidate.
But eventually it all comes back in a rush of clarity. You might be pushing your toddler through the park on a glorious sunny day off when suddenly you ask yourself: Did I say Dallas was the capital of Texas last week? Yes. Yes, you did. You idiot.
Gross domestic product is a measure of a country's entire economic output. Its inventor worried that it might be mistaken as a measure of citizens' well-being. Mr. Yang's campaign has proposed that America measure its economic prosperity with a different index that accounts for human and not just monetary factors, including inequality and quality of life.
BS: The New Yorker cartoon. They had a secretary with like a floppy disk. With her glasses pulled down and her fingers crossed.
I think that he did a lot of great things and he did a lot of what he could, but to the extent that there was a missed opportunity, it was in the wake of the financial crisis. And it's very hard to Monday morning quarterback a team when they literally felt like the economy itself was at stake, but we should have done much more to recapitalize homeowners as opposed to the banks. We could have kept many more people in their homes. We could've kept many of these communities ——
And this is where Caldwell's account becomes unpersuasive in its turn. He depicts federal economic policymaking after the civil rights era as a hugely expensive attempt at integrating Americans by race and sex, a project paid for after Ronald Reagan by deficits rather than transfers. But as Wesley Yang points out in a review of The Age of Entitlement for The Washington Examiner, there's little evidence that American public policy actually transfers lots of money from whites to minorities; the spending that Reagan's deficits funded was for the military and old-age entitlements, both of which flowed far more into white pocketbooks than black ones. Nor were the economic policies that have arguably harmed working class whites the most somehow a necessary extension of civil rights legislation: China's entry into the World Trade Organization, to choose one signal example, was not somehow foreordained when L.B.J. set pen to paper.
Ms. Court, 78, was named an Officer of the Order of Australia — the second-highest tier — in 2007 for her unparalleled achievements in tennis.
Honeyland is the first film to be nominated for best documentary and best international feature (the category formerly known as best foreign-language film). It follows Hatidze Muratova, a middle-aged beekeeper whose peaceful life in the Macedonian countryside is disrupted when a chaotic family moves in next door.
Nevertheless, Kerry Green, a high school social studies teacher in Sunnyvale, Tex., a small town east of Dallas, said she discussed redlining with her 11th graders, adding it as a counterpoint to lessons about postwar prosperity — the optimistic story of consumerism, television and the Baby Boom that is emphasized by her state's standards.
That's right. But it isn't just the press, because there is another very conservative institution here, one that is perhaps even more important. And that's the House of Windsor itself. And Meghan Markle, by all accounts, has a very difficult introduction to the family. There are many reports that Kate Middleton is not particularly welcoming to her new sister-in-law. There is a sense that she is simply not being approved of, her lifestyle. There is a family event where one of the older aunts shows up wearing a brooch that is interpreted as a racial slur against Meghan. And Harry begins to feel a sense of aggrievement on behalf of his wife. And that then causes a rift between Harry and his brother William. One of the first tangible examples of this is when Harry and Meghan announced that they want to move out of Kensington Palace, which they share with Kate and William and his family, and move into their own place. And you begin to see more and more evidence of distance between Meghan and Harry on the one hand, and everybody else in the family on the other hand. So all of this culminates when the couple go on a long tour of southern Africa —
Oh, man. Well, thank you for making the trip. Then you know. First, any person who says they're going to run government like a business does not know what they're talking about, because they are two completely different things.
Still, Ms. Boyd-Sealy, 59, said she believed that Mr. Northam should be given a second chance because people were too sensitive, that Mr. Northam should not be judged by that picture alone and that he was probably just a product of his environment.
None of these forces diminishes the key role of racial animosity and racism. Instead, they intensify racial resentment.
I have seen the bodies of gang-raped nonagenarians. I have seen bodies left dead so long that your only shot at a t.o.d. is to weigh the maggots. But of all the bodies I have ever seen, none has stayed with me, in my gut, like the body of Jennifer Rockwell.
One, it's a lot easier and cheaper for us to throw kids into a classroom with textbooks and a teacher and say, You're going to go to college, than it is to try and train them in skills that are going to give them a secure livelihood. Number two, we have fetishized college and stigmatized anything that's not college. We've beaten Americans over the head, pretended everyone's going to college and say, It's going to work for you. And the Democrats are guilty of this. That's why they're yelling, Free college, free college. Meanwhile, again, only 33 percent of Americans are going to go to college, and that is a relatively stable number.
THE IMPROVISED SHAKESPEARE COMPANY at the 92nd Street Y (April 7, 7:30 p.m.). This Chicago-based improv group creates an impromptu Shakespearean masterpiece from the ground up at every performance. Based on an audience-suggested title, the costumed improvisers weave a play in the complex, often rhyming language of 17th-century British theater, complete with spontaneous songs. The cast includes the show's creator and director, Blaine Swen; Joey Bland; Thomas Middleditch; Ross Bryant; and Steve Waltien.
Yes. All of this is a prelude to say that, should some of the tech companies be asked to divest parts of their businesses? One hundred percent yes. Like Amazon should not be selling its own house brand to its advantage to other goods. These companies do have excessive power and influence. At this point you could argue they control our democracy.
For the next six hours, he was questioned about his hometown — where the schools and factories were, details about his family, including dates of birth. Finally, he was released.
As a little boy Marcel could not go to sleep without his mother's kiss; this necessity would become a major theme of Combray, the first section of Remembrance of Things Past. Quite understandably she was worried by these signs of her son's total dependence on her and would attempt to cure him by refusing to indulge him in his whims, but he would become so hysterical if denied a kiss or his mother's tenth good night visit to his bedroom that usually she gave in--or her less rigorous husband would urge her to do so. Not only did Proust not outgrow his dependence; it became the template for his adult loves, since for Proust passion was a nagging need that became only more demanding the more it was denied. Indeed, Proust would drive away all his lovers (in his fiction as in his life) through his unreasonable demands.
An ocean of innuendo has always surrounded Mr. Johar's sexuality. He has done more than anybody to introduce the idea of homosexuality into the Indian home. It would seem no closet door was better primed to spring open than his. And yet when he tries the latch, he finds it sticks. The only time I'm tight-lipped is when I'm asked about my sexuality, he writes in his recently published memoir, An Unsuitable Boy. It's the only part of me I feel I've caged.
BA: But you're not proposing to fix any of that. People don't just work to make money; they do work for a sense of self-worth. They work so that they can develop skills, they work so they have the possibility of earning more money someday. You're proposing to replace a portion of the income they may have lost, but not any of those other things. Why is that a solution?
Well, it sounds like you've been there.
FRESH OFF THE BOAT 8 p.m. on ABC. In a Chinese New Year episode, Jessica encourages her family to settle its debts, disputes and grudges so that good fortune will be assured. But will she be the first one to lose her cool? And in black-ish, at 9:30, Bow persuades Dre to try anger-management therapy. Her brother Johan, meanwhile, becomes a life coach for the clan.

Equally passionate, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, said men were imperfect, and he asked Livingston not to resign, for a moment drawing a bipartisan standing ovation.
The effects of these economic changes, Autor wrote, have been devastating:
Badrinath (Varun Dhawan), the fellow who falls for Vaidehi — at a wedding, of course — comes from a well-to-do family in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, that practically screams patriarchy. (His mother and sister-in-law are mainly silent; his father is a scowling tyrant with a sadistic streak.) Badrinath may be a notch or two above Vaidehi socially, but as she points out to him, he's not her equal: She's smart and ambitious; he's neither. He is, though, sweet and persistent. Reader, she agrees to marry him.
AH: But do you think, I mean, he never truly apologized. He just said, I'm sorry you're offended. And while you may not have felt that way, there were other jokes he made about just Asian-Americans and Asian people in general, and there were other people who were obviously affected by this. So I mean, what kind of consequences do you think someone who makes those kinds of statements and who doesn't show any sort of remorse for it, should they face? If not firing, what should happen? What would the steps be?
The fact that all the houses generally look the same had almost no weight on my conscience, said Mr. Paz, who works in financial services in Jersey City, N.J. As long as the house is nice, and the neighbors are nice, and they take good care of their houses, that's what matters.
As the voices of women, people of color, and other traditionally marginalized communities grow louder the frame of reference from which we tell the story of American is expanding. The white male story is not irrelevant but it's insufficient, and when you have a group of people that are accustomed to the spotlight see the camera lens pan away, it's a threat to their sense of self. It's not surprising that QAnon support started to soar in the weeks after B.L.M. QAnon offers a way for white evangelicals to place blame on (fictional) bad people instead of a broken system. It's an organization that validates the source of Q-Anoners insecurity — irrelevance — and in its place offers a steady source of self-righteousness and acceptance.
For me the thing began on the night of March fourth and then evolved day by day and that's how I'm going to tell this part of it.
Our young people, by and large, are having sex as a result of social pressure, Damares Alves, the minister of human rights, family and women, said recently as she encouraged abstinence. You can go to a party and have lots of fun without having sex.
There will be a hearing next week to set a date for sentencing. He could face up to life in prison.
When I'm on the subway, people will look at me and then look at me. And then eventually someone will inch over and say, Hey, you running for president? And then I'll say, Yes, I am. They'll say, Yeah, yeah, I like you. Thousand bucks a month, something like that. And then they want to take pictures. And then as soon as someone breaks the seal, then it's safe for everyone to do it. And so, then I'll be — and then there's this uncomfortable period in this subway car after you've taken the pictures with him, you're still sitting there. And so then they're, So, where are you going? Or, how's Bernie? Or whatever the questions are. And so, I have not been riding the subway lately, but I've ridden the subway an awful lot over the years. Now my preferred mode of transportation is the bike, because if someone recognizes me, it's generally too late.
In 2017, Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York's subway and pledged $1 billion for improvements. The editorial board has repeatedly called for action to make the subways workable for this paper's millions of readers.
The newly minted baroness turned her hand to property development. She built the mansion on the Rue du Faubourg St.-Honoré that is now the American Embassy. On returning to New Orleans in the 1840s, she oversaw the design and construction of the Pontalba Buildings, two red-brick rowhouse complexes flanking the Place d'Armes, which was renamed Jackson Square after Andrew Jackson at her instigation. One of the chief features of the French Quarter, the rowhouses established the fashion for iron railings throughout the old city.
For nine months, from the fall of 1943 until the summer of 1944, Rae lived in the woods with the Bielski partisans, in a highly organized camp of over a thousand Jews. At night, small armed groups would make their way silently to farms owned by gentiles for potatoes, onions, bread—and if they were lucky, an egg or a piece of meat. The partisans' tactics could be brutal: when they believed Belarusian farmers were turning Jews over to the Nazis, the partisans would kill them, sometimes slaying whole families. Then the food was collected, and the ammunition, and brought back to the camp for defense and more raids.
The dance begins after Martin, who took jazz ballet lessons in his past, has attended the funeral of a friend and received text messages from his wife that hint at reuniting; he and his friends greet graduating students at the harbor as the song What a Life, by the Danish band Scarlet Pleasure, plays. At first, his movement is a little tentative, full of stops and starts. But once he gets going, he throws himself into it, taking wide crossover steps, swaying and, with a silky vigor, spinning to the ground and springing up — all the while taking sips from a can of beer.

The house search wasn't the only thing that took them longer than expected. Their original plan to get married in May of 2020 was delayed by the pandemic until December, and then again until November of 2021 (although they had a small marriage ceremony in October). While the Pazes await their official wedding celebration, they've had a chance to settle in to what Mr. Paz recognizes is a cookie-cutter neighborhood.
RICHMOND, N ew South Wales — I thought I would come to Australia and learn to surf. Instead, I learned to walk.
Ms. Lynch's appearance underscored how sensitive Mr. Trump was about any signs of fracturing in his base; many evangelical allies denounced the editorial, and Ms. Graham Lynch vowed on Friday to help Mr. Trump win re-election. She then welcomed a supporter to the stage who told attendees that they could not trust what the news media wrote about the president.
For decades, racial, religious and ethnic minority groups like Nubians, Somalis and Kenyans of Indian origin have faced obstacles and delays when applying for government-issued papers. (Nubians were originally brought to Kenya from Sudan as soldiers by British colonial rulers more than a century ago.) Human rights advocates said many members of these communities were turned away from Huduma registration centers last spring.
It's been interesting, to say the least.
Twenty One Pilots at Barclays Center
There was anther interview in 1970, again in the Philippines, but centering on his concern for primitive peoples. And again in 1971, he took this writer with him on a long American conservation tour, which was also a journey backward in time to his boyhood home in Minnesota. Lindbergh said that he had unveiled himself because he thought the cause of conservation so urgent. I have had enough publicity for 15 lives, he said, and I seek no more of it, but where I can accomplish a purpose I will do things I otherwise abhor. There was no doubt that his leadership was effective. Even though he was talking to a generation born long after his Paris flight, his person and his name evoked a tangible response. He did not pretend to be an expert, but had a singular ability to stir response and activity, to enunciate general principles and to cheer people on. It did not appear to matter that he had published his bulky Wartime Journals in 1970 to general critical dispraise. What seemed to count was that he was Charles Augustus Lindbergh, the hero still of 1927, whose smile was engaging, whose words were straightforward, whose manner was simple and whose message was forceful. This was, perhaps, the ultimate enigma of his life; for beneath his outer coating was a man who kept more to himself (and perhaps to his wife) than he ever gave to the public.
MG: So, if you become president, what government secret are you most excited to learn about?
McCloughan's dismissal, first reported by The Washington Post, leaves the Redskins searching for their fifth general manager in almost 18 years under the ownership of Daniel Snyder.
He's openly acknowledging a rift between them. And that is a very powerful thing. Because remember, for the British public, these two brothers are imprinted in memory as the young boys who walked together behind their mother's casket after her death. And so to hear Harry openly acknowledge what perhaps people whispered, that's a very, very big deal in terms of both the emotional dynamic within the royal family, but also the image the royal family has with the British public.
CW: But doing it in a national security sense. Or do you?
No, certainly not before the statements had taken place, and in terms of consequences, I would suggest that someone like Shane had probably paid a price in many ways. Like, aside from being fired, there are many circles that, if he shows up in, he'd be labeled very, very negatively. He reached out to me personally, and I had a conversation with him. The conversation with him made me feel more confident that I'd done the right thing. Because I think in many cases we're trying to follow up on a sense of shame and humiliation that the person might already feel.
She's not going to walk in the door and go, 'What's my identity as first lady?' Shailagh Murray, a former senior adviser to Mr. Biden and Mr. Obama, said in an interview. It's just going to be the first lady version of what she's been doing all along.
About 14.6 million babies were born in China in 2019, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. That was a nearly 4 percent fall from the previous year, and the lowest official number of births in China since 1961, the last year of a widespread famine in which millions of people starved to death. That year, only 11.8 million babies were born.
Oh, man. Well, thank you for making the trip. Then you know. First, any person who says they're going to run government like a business does not know what they're talking about, because they are two completely different things.
Asked about Mr. Andrews's comments, she said, Well, I'll call him blessed.
Well, a couple of things. First of all, she's an outsider. She's an American marrying into the British royal family. But beyond that, she's a very particular type of American.
Since the most recent version of Ms. Hillauer's book was released, in 2005, a number of younger Arab women have taken up film. In Morocco, Tunisia and Lebanon, women make up about a quarter of all new directors, and most focus largely on aspects of women's lives in the Arab world, according to Roy Armes's 2015 book New Voices in Arab Cinema. Mr. Armes credits the number of female directors to outside influence. Virtually all the women born in the 1960s and 1970s who have made a fictional feature have lived, worked, and/or trained abroad, he writes. There is no single pattern of entry to filmmaking, but it is notable that none of them has had the conventional, sheltered upbringing reserved for so many women in the Arab world. (Ms. Labaki, who has spent her life in Lebanon, is, as Mr. Armes points out, an exception.) This mass of educated and articulate women has changed the way in which a whole array of aspects of Arab society are experienced and depicted.
I take sort of an opposite side because I think it's a little romantic on Hollywood executives' part because they make more money doing that, also. And it's also sort of a faint because most consumers really do like watching limited series. They like binging. They like their home things. Consumers seem to be saying a different thing. If anything this technology has taught us is they will get what they want when they want it and where they want it. Is that a problem for you, from a creative point of view?
One criticism of government subsidized journalism is that it could stifle the media's capacity to serve as a watchdog.
She married Louis G. Johnson six months after the premiere. That marriage ended in divorce, as did a second marriage, in 1955, to Robert William Chambers.
We look forward to working with them to go further and enact public campaign financing, make Election Day a state holiday and ban corporate contributions once and for all, the spokesman, Rich Azzopardi, said.
Another career high point was Luis Buñuel's comedy The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972), another winner of the best foreign language film Oscar, in which she played one of a group of cultured guests at a dinner party that turns increasingly surreal.
One of the reasons why Donald Trump is our president is that millions of Americans feel like our government is unresponsive to our needs and the needs in our communities. They've been casting about for some sort of change agent for years. And it's not just Donald Trump's victory; it was Bernie Sanders outsized success. In some ways, it was even Obama's victory in 2008. If you remember that campaign, it was oh, hope, change. It was not, get the most experienced person in the seat as possible, because we are decades behind the curve in addressing the problems and challenges that are tearing us apart. Now ——
Exhibition efforts have been plagued by problems. The debut was initially planned for Berlin in September — intended as the first stop of a three-city tour that would then travel to Paris and London. It was canceled weeks before it was supposed to open, when city administrators rejected a proposal to build a concrete wall around the interactive spectacle. The wall was intended to be 1.5 miles long and painted by the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, encircling the event until its final night, the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, when it would be torn down.
That is correct. But when I've dug into it, very, very few Americans are getting $1,000 in food stamps. And most of the people who are on government assistance live in fear of losing that assistance because there are various requirements that tend to come with it. And when, if you ask them, say, Hey, would you prefer $1,000 unconditional that you can rely upon, they actually think that's too good to be true.
That autism explodes the conventional American nuclear family narrative makes it irresistible as a metaphor for the stresses of life under late-stage capitalism. In Helen Schulman's A Day at the Beach (2007), a wealthy Manhattan couple navigate the worst day of their lives: the 9/11 disaster, which causes them to flee their swank downtown home (to the Hamptons) and strains their marriage — already at the breaking point owing to a son who shows clear signs of autism. In Gary Shteyngart's Lake Success (2018), a son's autism diagnosis similarly destroys an elite Manhattan family's dreams. The high-living protagonist leaves the scene of an altercation with his wife and nanny over his son and heads straight to the Greyhound station to start a picaresque journey to the other end of the country — a journey in search of an old girlfriend and, one surmises, an autism-less American dream.
So it became a natural focus of Suhail Zaheer Lari, a prominent Pakistani historian and author, who dedicated himself to documenting the history of Sindh Province, in southern Pakistan. He had a passion for photography, and his images of Makli's riches became the basis of several proposals for their conservation.
Generally speaking, I think we have become overly aggressive and optimistic about what we can accomplish in various foreign theaters. I've signed a pledge to end the forever wars because I don't believe it's the will of the American people for us to be in a constant state of armed conflict in foreign theaters for years and even decades at a time. Our Constitution says that it's in Congress's hands to declare war, but Congress has completely ceded this authority through the A.U.M.F. [Authorization for Use of Military Force] and then just said, Hey, executive branch, you can do what you want. And now they want nothing to do with it, and that is not the will of the American people, and it's not the will of the Constitution. So we should repeal the A.U.M.F. and say, Look, Congress, if we want to authorize armed conflict, it should be on you and it should be the will of the people.
Speaking on Meet the Press after Azar, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo blamed the Trump administration for failing to act decisively and for giving little guidance to states.
Each loss meant that Mary had to work harder. To help pay expenses after her father's death, she got after-school jobs. In one of those jobs, as a switchboard operator at the Shelton Hotel in Manhattan, she eavesdropped on inhabitants, including Tennessee Williams — who, she noted in her memoir, had the cheapest room in the hotel, at $30 a month.

On Thursday night, audiences were also introduced to some of Mr. Kelly's former employees, including Lindsey Perryman-Dunn. She said that she did not believe the waves of allegations against him, even though she had seen the videotape at the center of his 2008 child pornography trial and believed it showed him having sex with an underage girl.
Mr. Yang previously ran a successful test prep company and created the nonprofit Venture for America, which he argues is a strength, offering him fresh perspective and critical distance from the workings of Washington.
Murkowski signals she is open to convicting Trump as the timing of the Senate impeachment trial remains unclear. Senator Lisa Murkowski speaks at a news conference in the Capitol building. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said on Thursday that the House had acted appropriately in impeaching President Trump, signaling possible support for convicting him at a Senate trial in a statement that called his actions unlawful and said that they warranted consequences. Ms. Murkowski said the second impeachment of Mr. Trump stood in stark contrast to the first, which she and virtually every other Republican opposed. She said Mr. Trump had perpetuated false rhetoric that the election was stolen and rigged and launched a pressure campaign against his own vice president, urging him to take actions that he had no authority to do. And though Ms. Murkowski did not commit to finding the president guilty, saying she would listen carefully to the arguments on both sides, she strongly suggested that she was inclined to do so. On the day of the riots, President Trump's words incited violence, which led to the injury and deaths of Americans — including a Capitol Police officer — the desecration of the Capitol, and briefly interfered with the government's ability to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, Ms. Murkowski said.
THE AMERICANS 10 p.m. on FX. Talk to any television critic long enough and you'll probably hear griping about how The Americans doesn't get its due. The show never acquired the cultural capital or ratings of Breaking Bad or The Sopranos, but it has received rave reviews and taken on shocking relevance as headlines involving the phrases Russian tampering and undercover operatives blare. Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys are back for a final season as Elizabeth and Philip Jennings, K.G.B. spies and assassins at the dusk of the Cold War. But their marriage crumbles as their roles shift and their daughter, Paige (Holly Taylor), learns the skills of the family business. It's that melancholy intimacy that makes 'The Americans' more than the sum of its wigs, stabbings and spot-on period-music choices, James Poniewozik wrote in his review in The New York Times.
Caroline Howard, the executor of Mr. Wright's estate, confirmed his death, at an assisted living facility.
I rode the subway maybe six weeks ago or so. It's become much more of a pain in the neck now that I actually get recognized. I confess that that's been the biggest adjustment in running for president. Because I was, No, I'm not going to get recognized on the street. Of course, keep in mind, when I started my run I was completely anonymous. I mean none of you had ever heard of me. And also there is, and this is not to make too much of it, but there's also this invisible Asian man thing. That you feel like all you have to do is just not want to be seen and then you disappear, and that doesn't work anymore.
In her well-received 2013 book, The Still Point of the Turning World, written while Ronan was still alive, Black (who at the time used the name Emily Rapp) found beauty in stolen moments. She was able to derive lessons to learn and wisdom to share from the terrible freedom of parenting a child without a future and turned to writing as a way to find underlying patterns of meaning in a situation that, from the outside, looked inviolate and incontrovertibly meaningless — an endeavor that would ultimately give her a way to connect with and help others.
Yeah, it's a little fucked up. But it's the way we're going to do this.
I started and ran a national nonprofit called Venture for America that recruited enterprising college graduates to help grow businesses in Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, New Orleans, Birmingham, Baltimore, and nine other American cities. We helped create several thousand jobs. I'm very, very proud of that. But I realize that the jobs we were creating were only going to apply for a small slice of the population. And these jobs were pouring water into a bathtub that has a giant hole ripped in the bottom. I'm running for president to let America know that it is not our imagination, the water is rushing out of the bathtub. Immigrants have nothing to do with it. It's the fact that we're going through the greatest economic transformation.
Not at all. We originated the SAT during World War II as a way to determine which kids we did not want to send to the front lines. Now we treat our kids like every year is wartime. I've talked to parents and teachers around the country, and I've said, we need to de-emphasize these standardized tests. They are a terrible measurement of human value, certainly have nothing to do with character. At this point, as you said, they are more likely to test your parents' socioeconomic status than anything else.
Softball is that thing when you sit in a field, talking to a leaf, before a ball eventually rolls by you and then everyone is yelling for some reason.
I haven't sat down with a lot of sitting senators and congressmen and women, but I've talked to literally thousands of people who supported Donald Trump in the last election who say they are now supporting me. I've talked to many folks who are Republicans who say they are, at least, sympathetic to my message, in large part because they understand the numbers. When I talked to 70 C.E.O.s here in New York City, not that far from here, it was a fancy bank office, most of them were Republicans. I said, How many of you are looking at replacing your back-office clerical workers with artificial intelligence and software? Guess how many hands went up out of 70. All of them. The truth is, you should fire any C.E.O. who was not looking to make that happen, because their incentives are all tied to the bottom-line profitability of their firm. And most of them were Republicans. So they understand the need for what I am proposing.
SS: Concretely, would you have sent troops, say, to Syria?
JI: Sure. But to Binya's point, it's still a trade-off. So, if I'm on food stamps, I'm getting less of a benefit than, say, Jesse, who's not on food stamps.
A progressive tax is one in which the rate increases with income, while a regressive tax increases inversely with income.
It's not right, but I still probably hold some bitterness toward myself mostly, but also a little bit toward my sport, because I let myself get too deep into it, Keller said at the time.
In the same place, the Texas edition of the textbook contains only a blank white space.

So pervasive was this dismissal that I'd chalked it up to a generational divide, and I assumed that my students in Abu Dhabi would also see feminism as old-fashioned and irrelevant. But I have come to reconsider that assumption. I need to be a feminist so I can do general world-saving, said one student, slightly joking about the world-saving but dead serious about the feminism.
His wife, Melissa, said that he had died in his sleep and that the cause had not yet been determined.
Twitter temporarily suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene's personal account. Twitter has temporarily suspended the personal account of Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican and supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory, citing multiple violations of the company's civic integrity policy. The move, confirmed by a company spokesperson on Sunday, came days after the platform banned President Trump over concerns that his continued use of the platform could incite more episodes of violence like the attack on the Capitol this month. A news release issued by Ms. Greene's congressional campaign, including what appeared to be screenshots of her account, said the suspension would last 12 hours. Her account's last tweet included a video in which Ms. Greene repeated baseless claims of voter fraud, blaming elected leaders in Georgia for failing to act ahead of the Senate runoff races that resulted in Republicans losing their majority. Below the video, Twitter posted a warning that the claim of election fraud was disputed. The company also disabled replies, retweets and likes due to risk of violence, an alert that also appears on other tweets by Ms. Greene. Ms. Greene's election to Congress last year signaled a major victory for QAnon, the once-fringe pro-Trump movement that the F.B.I. has warned poses a domestic terrorism threat. In the statement, Ms. Greene criticized the borderline monopolistic stranglehold of a few big tech companies over American political discourse and urged Congress to stop what she called censorship.
BA: Just before we move on, maybe I can ask one more question.
Larry King, who shot the breeze with presidents and psychics, movie stars and malefactors — anyone with a story to tell or a pitch to make — in a half-century on radio and television, including 25 years as the host of CNN's globally popular Larry King Live, died on Saturday in Los Angeles. He was 87.
BANGKOK — An American woman who has been living in Bali during the pandemic was deported on Thursday after she praised the Indonesian island as queer friendly and offered to help foreigners enter the country despite its coronavirus travel ban.

Michael Tree, a founding member of the Guarneri String Quartet, the remarkably long-lived group that helped rekindle interest in chamber music in the 1960s and '70s and continued to perform until 2009, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 84.
BA: So a Republican would say that alternative is to let markets work. Is that what makes you a Democrat — you don't think the market will create enough jobs for Americans?
That's right. It sets the stage for what is an epic breakup between Harry, and Meghan, and the royal family, and really between Harry and Meghan and the British people.
The work now has a chance of really having traction, he said. I'm very optimistic about what can unfold.
MIAMI — In his first public appearance since the strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran, President Trump rallied his evangelical Christian base of supporters on Friday, portraying himself as the restorer of faith in the public square and claiming that God is on our side.
After a brief first marriage, Dr. Biden married Mr. Biden in 1977, more than four years after his first wife, Neilia, and young daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car accident. She put her own career ambitions on hold to raise his two sons, Beau, a Delaware attorney general who died in 2015, and Hunter, as her own. The Bidens' daughter, Ashley, was born in 1981.
Pastor Thomas says that releasing feelings of shame and unworthiness takes time and the support of a loving community. He adds, however, that being ostracized by religion can be a blessing in disguise if it pushes one to develop a more authentic personal faith.
Through Venture for America, Mr. Yang created opportunities for college graduates in under-resourced American cities — but almost half of V.F.A. alumni left the cities they were placed in through the fellowship.
But you can't do that. I mean, you can't, because you don't know. You haven't done time-distance. You don't know the time that it takes for a person to think, to squeeze the trigger. You don't know how much time it took him to draw his weapon. So I don't know how you can make any assumptions from that video. And if you're asking that, that's what you're asking for — assumptions, not facts.
The original Queer Eye was like a stealth mission to straight America's vanity cabinets, built on the idea of gay men as arbiters of cool. It had its own political context. The fall after its premiere, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriage legal. In the next year's midterm election, a host of ballot initiatives banning such marriages passed.
Well, the labor force participation rate has declined precipitously, so I don't buy that somehow the government started giving people more money over the last number of years. And the headline unemployment rate, and I'm sure you know this, it doesn't measure underemployment, 40 to 44 percent of recent college graduates are now doing a job that does not require a college degree. It does not measure the fact that 94 percent of new jobs in the economy are temp, gig or contract jobs that do not have health care benefits and can disappear at any moment. It doesn't include the fact that you might be doing two or three jobs to make ends meet.
Those who could not get help from relatives or friends had to sign emergency loan agreements before the British government would send them back home. They also had to forfeit their passports until the repayments were complete, and faced a 10 percent surcharge on anything they owed after six months.
So this is not a left or a right idea, this is bipartisan. And many Republicans will see that this is going to be a huge win for their constituents, for rural areas, for red states on the interior. We don't need 80 percent of Congress to pass it, we just need a majority.
Everyone knows my flagship proposal is this Freedom Dividend of $1,000 a month for every American adult, which is not a new idea. And it's not my idea. Thomas Paine was for it at the founding of the country. Martin Luther King fought for it and was fighting for it when he was assassinated. So after I'm the nominee and I defeat Donald Trump, everyone will know that I'm in the White House because of the Freedom Dividend.
The Dreyfus Affair is worth a short detour, since it split French society for many years and it became a major topic in proust's life--and in Remembrance of Things Past. Alfred Dreyfus (1859-1935) was a Jew and a captain in the French army. In December 1894 he was condemned by a military court for having sold military secrets to the Germans and was sent for life to Devil's Island. The accusation was based on the evidence of a memorandum stolen from the German embassy in Paris (despite the fact that the writing did not resemble Dreyfus's) and of a dossier (which was kept classified and secret) handed over to the military court by the minister of war. In 1896 another French soldier, Major Georges Picquart, proved that the memorandum had been written not by Dreyfus but by a certain Major Marie Charles Esterhazy. Yet Esterhazy was acquitted and Picquart was imprisoned. Instantly a large part of the population called for a retrial of Dreyfus. On January 13, 1898, the writer Emile Zola published an open letter, J'accuse, directed against the army's general staff; Zola was tried and found guilty of besmirching the reputation of the army. He was forced to flee to England. Then in September 1898 it was proved that the only piece of evidence against Dreyfus in the secret military dossier had been faked by Joseph Henry, who confessed his misdeed and committed suicide. At last the government ordered a retrial of Dreyfus.
I do. I give everything a numerical rating. So I actually transfer my emotions into a kind of mathematical equation, which helps me look at it from a more objective viewpoint. Because if you stay subjective to it and emotional to it, it's hard to make a decision because you might be swayed by the emotions.

To me, one of the worst things you can do in a relationship is if you have this longstanding understanding or a friendship or partnership, and then you try and change the understanding at a particular point in time and do it unilaterally.
Reflexionar sobre lo que lograste en 2020 —y lo que no viviste o perdiste— también es un camino más saludable para mejorar que el típico propósito de año nuevo. Los estudios muestran de manera consistente que esos propósitos no funcionan. Para febrero, la mayoría de la gente los ha abandonado.
In A United Kingdom, David Oyelowo plays Seretse Khama, the real-life king of Botswana (then a British protectorate known as Bechuanaland) who set off an international crisis in 1948, when he married Ruth Williams, a white British clerk. South Africa, which was instituting apartheid at the time, objected to an interracial couple's leading a neighboring country; Britain opposed the marriage because resource-rich South Africa did; and Botswanans were angry that their leader had chosen a queen not of their race or tribe.

She said she objected to students being taught that homosexuality is normal and natural and feared that the anti-bullying resolution would mean inviting homosexual-advocacy organizations into our schools to promote their agenda to our vulnerable youth, according to The New Yorker.
FINDING YOUR ROOTS 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). The ancestral roots of the broadcast journalist Norah O'Donnell, the fashion designer Zac Posen and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will be excavated in the Season 6 finale of Henry Louis Gates, Jr.'s long-running familial history show. Highlights include a sequence in which Pelosi pores over the passenger manifest of a ship that arrived in New York in 1912 carrying her grandfather, her grandmother and their children, including Pelosi's mother. I take great pride in the courage that they had to come to America, Pelosi says, and to take a chance on America.

These insults, many of them handed out by people who on alternate days adored Proust, were neutralized by an issue of La Nouvelle Revue Francaise, France's best literary magazine at the time, that was entirely dedicated to Proust. It came out in 1923, just a year after Proust's death, and contained photos of the dead master, previously unpublished snippets from his pen, and evaluations from critics, French but also from nations all over the world. Most touching were the many personal testimonies. The poet Anna de Noailles, herself a monument to egotism, praised Proust for his ... modesty. (The duc de Gramont, one of Proust's highest-born friends, once remarked that aristocrats invited Proust for country weekends not because of his art but because he and Anna de Noailles were the two funniest people in Paris.)

That's right. But it isn't just the press, because there is another very conservative institution here, one that is perhaps even more important. And that's the House of Windsor itself. And Meghan Markle, by all accounts, has a very difficult introduction to the family. There are many reports that Kate Middleton is not particularly welcoming to her new sister-in-law. There is a sense that she is simply not being approved of, her lifestyle. There is a family event where one of the older aunts shows up wearing a brooch that is interpreted as a racial slur against Meghan. And Harry begins to feel a sense of aggrievement on behalf of his wife. And that then causes a rift between Harry and his brother William. One of the first tangible examples of this is when Harry and Meghan announced that they want to move out of Kensington Palace, which they share with Kate and William and his family, and move into their own place. And you begin to see more and more evidence of distance between Meghan and Harry on the one hand, and everybody else in the family on the other hand. So all of this culminates when the couple go on a long tour of southern Africa —
Are you concerned at all about the perception, particularly in the more progressive wings of the party, of you working with large corporate clients? When you were working with Lyft, you expressed opposition to Assembly Bill 5, for instance —
For some, the conversion experience rescued them from paths that Holloway refers to, in his own case, as serious darkness and sin. A onetime actor and a singer in an alternative-rock band, Holloway had dropped out of college and was living with fellow musicians when his parents persuaded him to attend a weekend conference devoted to the Virgin Mary. At the end, the keynote speaker invited all of those who believed they might have vocations to approach the stage. Holloway remembers: I had an interior experience almost as if Our Lady was standing behind me with her hands on my shoulders, leaning down to say, 'If you will put your vocation in my hands, I will take care of all the things you consider obstacles.' My heart was pounding. And I found myself climbing over this balcony and going down there.
As Kamala Harris makes history this week, so will her big, blended family. The extended family of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, includes stepchildren, nieces and an ex-wife. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times When Kamala Harris is sworn in as vice president, she will represent many firsts: First female vice president. First Black woman. First woman of Indian descent. But there is another milestone that will be on display: that of her family. As Ms. Harris ascends to this barrier-breaking role, millions of Americans will see a more expansive version of the American family staring back at them — one that could broaden rigid ideas of politically palatable family dynamics or gender roles. It's striking, said Ralph Richard Banks, a law professor at Stanford who has written about race, gender and family patterns. In some ways they are at the frontier of different aspects of American families and how they're changing. Ms. Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, was raised with both Christian and Hindu practices, while her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is white, grew up attending Jewish summer camp. She was in her 40s when they married, older than the median age of first marriage for women in this country, though that number continues to rise. Mr. Emhoff was divorced, with two children from his previous marriage, making his children, Cole and Ella, among the one in four who do not live with both biological parents, according to the Census Bureau.

Mr. Yang argues that the automation of manufacturing jobs — especially in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri and Iowa — helped breed the discontent and economic desperation that led to Mr. Trump's election.
Both of the officers are represented by the International Brotherhood of Police and by Vince Champion, who quickly criticized the investigation. We wanted to understand why Champion, a union official who supports reform, is defending the officers in the Brooks killing. I wonder what it means to have a member of your union — a police officer — charged with murder in the line of duty.
You can build it around the town library, because a lot of them have this bulletin board that serves as the skeleton of a local paper when the local paper has gone out of business. A lot of these papers would be able to get by if they did not have to generate stock market level returns for hedge fund owners and private equity owners. If you had a cooperative model and it's made a certain amount of money, spent a certain amount of money, ran as a nonprofit, you could restore and sustain local journalism and thousands of communities, but it will not happen without government support. It just won't.
Eugene Wright, a distinguished bass player who toured the world and recorded some 30 albums, including the landmark Time Out, in his decade with the Dave Brubeck Quartet, died on Dec. 30 in the Valley Glen neighborhood of Los Angeles. He was 97.
So if that's your problem, you have to go and try and solve it directly by getting into the guts of the apps and say, What are the design choices you made? Let's calibrate them so they actually balance our kids' health and not just your financial returns. So that's one way she's missing the point.
I lost my childhood home in 2000 when my grandma sold her house in Santa Cruz, Calif., to move to a retirement community in Washington State. For the first time, there was no home to return to. No desk to sit at and imagine my writing career. No critique sessions around the dining room table.
Magat, who worked as a health-care consultant before entering the seminary, learned that some colleagues were wondering if he was gay after he divulged his intention to be a priest. At first I felt emasculated, he says. I had a nave view of what people thought about priests; in my home environment and my family, priests are upheld as pillars of the community. In fact, there is a concern among some within the church that the proportion of gay men entering the priesthood has risen sharply. Magat and Bashista claim that they are not aware of gay men at Mount Saint Mary's, but say that it shouldn't matter if some seminarians have homosexual inclinations, since anyone seeking to become a Catholic priest, straight or gay, is striving to live a celibate life. The conversation drifts to another, darker presumption about the sexuality of priests. Magat recalls an encounter he had recently in a supermarket. I was standing in line in my clerics, he says. The woman in front of me was checking out her groceries, and her young son in the shopping cart, probably 2 or 3, he was kind of looking at me, interested. I waved and said, 'Hi, how's it going?' and she pulled him out of the cart and away from me. I was just mortified.
His sense of humor has remained more or less intact, if differently delivered. For the first Halloween after his crash, he dressed up as a person with a head injury, wrapping his head in gauze upon which he'd dribbled red food coloring. Around his neck he wore a sign that read: Too soon?
This is a new line of argument for Mr. Prager, who spent much of his career focusing on those micro values. He is a longtime opponent of same-sex marriage, which he considers an effort to destroy the foundation of our Judeo-Christian civilization. An episode in his Same Sex Issues collection is titled, Love Is Not Enough.
And for them, Meghan Markle was a challenging figure.
Mr. Gerdes was OK with that arrangement until the coronavirus pandemic hit. When quarantine started, I just had this feeling that I wanted to protect Darien, to make her feel safe, he said. Legalizing their relationship seemed a move in that direction. On Memorial Day 2020, he took her to the Lincoln Park Zoo, the site of what they consider their first official date in 2007, and proposed.
Harmful effects of unemployment are felt by men and women, but men are more likely to experience negative health effects including depression and increased risk of suicide.
That age limit came into effect after The Guardian newspaper reported two years ago on a 17-year-old British teenager who sought help at the British embassy in Islamabad to escape a forced marriage in 2014. She had to sign a loan agreement and hand in her British passport before being allowed to return to the United Kingdom, and ultimately was billed more than $1,000, with her passport being held until she paid.
The cause was ovarian cancer, her husband, Edward L. Alley, said.
I was the first girl, and nobody believed me, Ms. Hawkins said. And after that it continued to happen, again and again and again.
But now we've had 20 years of a very strong pontificate. I think we're at a new era, and these men represent it. Among liberal Catholics, including liberal priests -- many of whom regard John Paul II as authoritarian and reactionary -- there is the perception that new seminarians like those at Mount St. Mary's are rigid and narrow-minded, merely parroting the Pope's views without learning to think for themselves. Certainly there is a passionate devotion to the Pope among the men of Mount St. Mary's. They often quote him -- in particular the phrase, Be not afraid. Bashista put it this way: We're the John Paul II generation. That's a great sign of hope. But at the gallery, the seminarians scrutinized Medieval and Renaissance paintings with a feverish -- and sometimes wistful -- attention to the past, a past that still pertains directly to their lives. Raphael Hall, 42, one of five seminarians at Mount St. Mary's from the Franciscan Missionaries of the Eternal Word in Birmingham, Ala., moved about the gallery in a brown Franciscan habit, the beads of a long wooden rosary clicking softly from his cord belt as he searched for works by Fra Angelico, a 15th-century Franciscan painter who would have dressed almost identically. There were chalices and vestments on display -- the very items that Bashista and the other deacons were in the process of choosing before their ordinations.

Well first off, to your first part of the question, during the press conference, Paul Howard never showed a video of Officer Rolfe kicking Mr. Brooks. He showed a still shot.
The world is divided into two classes — invalids and nurses. — James McNeill Whistler
In The Interestings, Jules Jacobson poses a broad question, asking herself what the boys (now men) and girls (now women) she has lionized since her teens, and emulated throughout her adult life, have lost through their persistent, rarely rewarded efforts to opt in. She wonders if all of them have inaccurately defined success, believing they would only matter if they were extraordinary.
Described in a 2014 Esquire profile as a human Energizer bunny, Mr. Bernstein was writing, teaching and generating screenplay ideas well into his 90s. Until recently, he had several projects in development. He created the BBC mystery mini-series Hidden in 2011, and he was an adjunct instructor of dramatic writing at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts until he retired in 2017. They'll carry me off writing, he told Variety.
—— more strong and more whole. There's a saying, I think it was actually, and maybe in this … no, it was an earlier administration, but a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. There was a crisis. There was a massive opportunity to help rebalance our economy, but we instead recapitalized the banks to the tune of $4 trillion. And what I say to Americans around the country, I say, Hey, do you remember voting for the $4 trillion bailout of Wall Street? And it gets this laugh. But then they answer, Wait, we did that? And it's, Of course we didn't vote for that.
These portraits already suggest the outlines of Proust's extraordinary personality. He was attentive to his friends to the point of seeming a flatterer, though he thought friendship was valueless and conversation represented the death of the mind, since he believed only passion and suffering could sharpen the powers of observation and the only word of any value was the written. He could stare transfixed at a rose--or at anything else or anyone who was on his peculiar wavelength--but though he read everything and was deeply cultivated, he had little interest in disembodied ideas. He wasn't an intellectual, though he was supremely intelligent. He applied his attention to flowers and people and paintings, but not to theories about botany nor to psychology nor aesthetics. He never read a word of Freud, for instance (nor did Freud ever read a word of Proust). He was hilariously funny and entertaining, but he emanated a calm spirituality except, perhaps, when he was doubled up with a crazy bout of laughter (his famous choking fit of hilarity, his fou rire, which could go on so long it struck strangers as weird, even slightly mad). He was such a presence that many people spoke of him as tall, but in fact he stood just five feet six inches.
The last decade of the twentieth century has witnessed the end of state-sponsored and church-supported anti-Semitism. The fall of the Soviet Union, a nation that, since the time of Stalin, had been a major source of international anti-Semitism, had a domino effect on ending the state sponsorship of this oldest of bigotries. Other nations within the Soviet sphere of influence stopped espousing anti-Semitism as a matter of government policy. Even most Arab and Islamic countries dropped their overtly anti-Semitic policies. As a result, the United Nations has changed its tone, condemning anti-Semitism and reducing somewhat its pro-Arab and anti-Israel bias. Equally important, the Catholic church--the single institution most responsible for the persecution of Jews over the past two millennia--approved diplomatic relations with Israel, thus annulling its entrenched view that Jewish homelessness ... was the Divine judgment against Jews for rejecting Jesus. The American Lutheran Church explicitly rejected Martin Luther's anti-Semitic teachings.
archived recording — if foreigners, if Russia, if China, if someone else offers you information on an opponent, should they accept it, or should they call the F.B.I.? archived recording (donald trump) I think maybe you do both. I think you might want to listen. I don't, there's nothing wrong with listening. If somebody called from a country, Norway, we have information on your opponent. Oh, I think I'd want to hear it. archived recording Do you want that kind of interference in our elections? archived recording (donald trump) It's not an interference. They have information. I think I'd take it.
The New York Times sportswriter Red Smith quoted Kuechenberg in 1975 on his strategy for neutralizing defenders, in this case the Chicago Bears tackle Wally Chambers. I just fight him, Kuechenberg said. As long as he's beating on my head and not the quarterback's, it's all right with me.
The Senate would conduct only the second impeachment trial of a President in the 209-year history of the Republic. Clinton will be the only elected President put on trial. Andrew Johnson, impeached and acquitted by one vote in 1868, had been elected Vice President and succeeded to the White House on Abraham Lincoln's assassination in 1865.
Ms. Cunningham Agee attributes his erratic behavior to dementia. She said doctors had diagnosed Alzheimer's in 2014. His health deteriorated, and in mid-October she put him in an assisted living facility. She said that her husband was very conflicted and paranoid and that he had used the divorce filing — which would've divided up the couple's assets and allowed Mr. Agee to alter his estate planning — as a good tool to get out of assisted living. (The divorce was never finalized, which means the proceeding would be legally nullified.)
That was just what worried me: the possibility of past-its-prime ham. (Mr. Lithgow has never been uncomfortable with the grand style.) Stories by Heart seemed to be the kind of quick and cheap show that a theater company, in this case the Roundabout, mounts when there's a hole in its schedule or budget. (The production, directed by Daniel Sullivan, is luxurious only in Kenneth Posner's lighting.) Besides, who needs the equivalent of a bedtime fairy tale on Broadway when you can have your phone read you Moby-Dick on the subway?
'Matthew Wong: Blue' at Karma gallery. Matthew Wong was one of the most talented painters of his generation, Roberta Smith wrote in her review of this posthumous show. (The 35-year-old artist died this fall before the exhibition opened.) Wong's paintings of nocturnal landscapes and interiors explore the infinite tones, moods and luminosities of the color blue, and reveal a visionary fusion of form and feeling, Smith wrote. Free. Through Jan. 5; karmakarma.org.
No. I was happily married, and everybody in my paintings had to have a significant other. In the early work, there would be a lot of times when I would be counting how many men and how many women were in the pictures, so that everybody would have a mate.
While Alice's and David's fixations on Sophie begin to expose the cracks in their marriage, Alice investigates whether the movie they're making replays violent and possibly criminal events in Sophie's life. The action of Losing Alice, including extensive and authentic depictions of the filmmaking process, flows into and out of scenes from the finished film-within-the-film and Alice's increasingly fevered imaginings. The symbolism can be ripe (rats figure prominently), and some of the plot twists feel mechanical, but Avin pulls off long, complicated scenes few TV dramas would attempt, and Zurer keeps you focused on the smart, sensual and shrewdly manipulative Alice, who is Sophie's equal in every way. (Apple TV+, Friday.)
The thesis of this book is that the long epoch of Jewish persecution is finally coming to an end and that a new age of internal dangers to the Jewish people is on the horizon. Institutional anti-Semitism is on its last legs as governments, churches, universities, and businesses embrace Jews. No Jew today needs to convert in order to become a professor, a banker, or a corporate CEO. Although anti-Semitism persists in many quarters, today's overt anti-Semites--the skinheads, militias, Holocaust deniers, and Farrakhan followers--have become marginalized. They continue to constitute a nuisance and pose a potential threat, but they do not have a significant day-to-day impact on the lives of most Jews, as anti-Semites in previous generations did. Today's marginalized anti-Semites do not decide which jobs we can hold, which universities we can attend, which neighborhoods we can live in, which clubs we can join, or even whom we can date and marry. We no longer look up to anti-Semites as the elites in our society who determine our fate. We look down on anti-Semites as the dregs of our society who make lots of noise but little difference.
Oh, I think the market will work beautifully toward what it's designed to do. The market is designed for maximal capital efficiency, and it is doing a phenomenal job. That's why you see the returns on capital outstripping the returns on labor at historic levels. The market is not designed to maximize human well-being.
I do not want the N.S.A. to outsource national security work to them. I want them to try and fight fire with fire and actually recruit using some of the same methods, and I want the N.S.A. to try and work with them to the extent that they're realistic, and they know that Google is going to be innovating in ways that the N.S.A. will not be able to do.
Gross domestic product is a measure of a country's entire economic output. Its inventor worried that it might be mistaken as a measure of citizens' well-being. Mr. Yang's campaign has proposed that America measure its economic prosperity with a different index that accounts for human and not just monetary factors, including inequality and quality of life.

As Ms. Hartman,50, a manager of international projects at COC Nederland, a Dutch L.G.B.T.I. advocacy group, entered a massive, crowded room, she felt relief when she spotted a Nigerian activist friend. She led Ms. Hartman to a table with her friends. One of them was Melinda Michels, 49, the director of the Emergency Assistance Program at Freedom House, a program in Washington that supports human rights defenders who are targeted by repressive governments.
Tom Railsback, an eight-term Illinois congressman who forged what he called a fragile bipartisan coalition between his fellow Republicans and the Democratic majority on the House Judiciary Committee in 1974 to draft articles of impeachment against President Richard M. Nixon, died on Monday in Mesa, Ariz. He was 87.
Amber Schleuning, deputy director of the V.A. Center for Innovation and a fourth-generation veteran, never thought she'd work at the V.A. But she began to hear from others she served with, her dad (also a veteran) and his friends about the problems they were having interacting with the system.
Los estudios muestran que una de las mejores maneras de cambiar el comportamiento y formar un nuevo hábito es unirlo con un comportamiento existente, lo que en la ciencia de la formación de hábitos se llama acumulación. Es la razón por la que los médicos, por ejemplo, sugieren tomar un nuevo medicamento al mismo tiempo que nos cepillamos los dientes o tomamos café por la mañana: es más probable que recuerdes tomar tu píldora cuando la unes a un hábito existente. Añadir pasos a tu recorrido diario es a menudo una mejor manera de añadir ejercicio a tu día que tratar de establecer un tiempo separado para una caminata diaria.
So it became a natural focus of Suhail Zaheer Lari, a prominent Pakistani historian and author, who dedicated himself to documenting the history of Sindh Province, in southern Pakistan. He had a passion for photography, and his images of Makli's riches became the basis of several proposals for their conservation.
On Wednesday, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced plans to scale back their senior royal duties. Then came another bombshell: they plan to split their time between Britain and North America (Alexa, play Royals by Lorde).
No. That was just that one instance. I love all the people in my paintings. I would take care of them, no matter what they look like or what they are doing. They might be misguided, they might be a little naughty, but they're nice. Because I'm nice.
Something came apart in me after that. In life, there are certain truths you hold on to: I am good. We are good. When a truth you believe in falls away, a friend told me, everything seems uncertain. I stopped eating, sleeping and caring what I wrote or what I did.
In Boerum Hill, the paper ghosts were not the only unwanted visitors to the Bergen Street townhouse. During the final walk-through of the property, Mr. Burns noticed that items that had been neatly stored in the basement had been tossed around. The frame of the door to the garden entrance looked damaged. Mr. Burns found his own shopping cart, which he had been using to ferry supplies from a nearby paint store to the house, was filled with someone else's personal items — potato chips, clothes, books and other odds and ends. Then he found luggage.
Things became a bit more modern in 2013, when a box appeared on income tax forms that husbands could tick rather than giving written permission.
At his inauguration on Tuesday, the Denver Gay Men's Chorus warmed up with True Colors (Cyndi Lauper, who first recorded it, was booked for the inaugural ball that night) before remarks from local grandees and faith leaders and the new officials were sworn in. Mr. Polis sat with Mr. Reis and their children behind a pane of bulletproof glass, a precaution one veteran Colorado reporter noted he hadn't seen in five previous inaugurations. But when Mr. Polis got up to speak — after a quick selfie with the crowd — he addressed divisiveness and diversity only briefly.
A year later, he was named editor of The Week in Review (now called Sunday Review). He supervised that Sunday section until early 1989, when he was promoted by Max Frankel, the executive editor, to a senior editing position in charge of the newsroom in the evenings as it assembled the next morning's newspaper. He oversaw the paper's coverage in those hours, its newsprint presentation and, after the first edition went to press, follow-up planning for the next day.
The couple lived in a one-bedroom rental in downtown Seattle until 1999, when Wired reported the couple moved into a $10 million mansion in suburban Lake Washington. Mr. Bezos now owns several properties, including a mansion in Washington, D.C.
But Florida has used only about 30 percent of the vaccine doses it has received, a smaller proportion than 29 other states. How do you do something this huge and roll it out? said Dr. Leslie M. Beitsch, the chairman of the behavioral sciences and social medicine department at Florida State University. It's not in any way surprising — to anyone who followed it closely, for sure — that there would be halting kind of progress and missteps getting something of this magnitude underway initially, whether we're talking about Florida or the entire country. With states and counties left by the federal government to sort out logistics largely by themselves, the rollout has gone anything but smoothly. In Florida, images of seniors camped on sidewalks overnight in Fort Myers and Daytona Beach for first-come, first-served vaccines drew national attention. Health department offices that tried to offer scheduled appointments saw their phone systems and websites crash; at least one now accepts requests only by mail. Each of our 67 counties seems to be taking a slightly different pathway — and that's remarkable, because we have a single department of health that is supposed to cover the entire state, Dr. Beitsch said. Patricia Mazzei, Eric Adelson and
What happens when an author tries so strenuously to empathize with her subject that she loses control of her own book?
Each person who registers is supposed to receive a unique identification number called Huduma Namba — or service number in Swahili. Officials said the number will be required to pay taxes, open bank accounts and get a drivers' license, in addition to accessing health and schooling services.
Mr. Yang has argued that his Freedom Dividend is one answer to the needs of the millions who will lose their jobs to automation.
KK: O.K. Moving onto a perhaps slightly less serious topic.
Well, they are still royals. Prince Harry is still a prince. He's still sixth in line to the throne. They still have the titles of His Royal Highness and Her Royal Highness. But in a very big concession to the queen, they agreed to stop using those titles. They've also agreed to repay the cost of renovating their cottage in England. And they've also importantly agreed to give up direct public funding of their activities. So it's a real break. And it truly does not only liberate the couple, but it will impose some pressure on them to earn enough money to finance a lifestyle that is, by anyone's account, very extravagant.
If I treat someone for major depressive disorder, it doesn't matter to me as a clinician what percentage of their depression might have genetic determinants. I can't change their genes.
Manhattan, Woody Allen's cinematic love letter to his hometown, was released in 1979 and nominated for two Academy Awards the following year. But you would think it belonged to the 2018 awards season, given how much it is being quoted and discussed these days.
Mr. Yang has scored internet points with some tweets paying tribute to former 2020 Democratic rivals, for example by tweeting I miss Beto.
Clinton, in a finger-wagging performance last January at the White House, told the nation he did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky. He denied sexual relations with her in a deposition in the sexual harassement case brought against him by Paula Corbin Jones.
I would see Shane every once in a while at the store, and I thought he was cute, said Ms. Monk, 43, of Shane Gerdes, an espresso machine repair technician. They met in 2007, when he was hired to work at the company warehouse across town. Espresso emergencies happen only so often. Crushes sometimes can't wait.
This bold move is in keeping with the couple's history of rule-breaking and the constant scrutiny they've endured since the beginning of their relationship. But the announcement, which was shared on Instagram, did leave many of us with questions (including the royal family which was said to be blindsided by the news). What does this all really mean? Here is what we know so far about #Megxit.
To this day, he said, his mother has no clue what her son does for a living. The idea of me putting a black man in a dress and having him prance around the world like that. … To her, that would be blasphemy.
To your earlier concern, I think we should examine the filibuster. I think that gridlock is bad for anyone trying to get anything done and solve problems. This might be controversial in this room, but I am for the restoration of earmarks, because it helped make legislation possible. That if I was a congressperson in a district, and there was a bill being passed, it's, Hey, at least I can get some pork for my local museum. And that's a very small price to pay for a functional legislature. So, getting past the filibuster to me is one possible necessity, and the restoration of earmarks could be another.
BA: Your proposal is oddly regressive. On the benefits side you're proposing that people will have to choose between this benefit and their existing federal benefits while someone like me just all the sudden gets a new check in their mailbox every month. On the funding side you're relying on a VAT, which is an inherently regressive funding mechanism. You've proposed some offsets, but I still don't understand why you don't just embrace a progressive approach to taxation. Either raise top rates or a wealth tax. If there are people who need help, why aren't you trying to help them as much as possible?
Since joining the race last year, Mr. Biden has presented himself as the safe choice for risk-averse times, the O.K.-that'll-do option for Democrats whose chief priority has been finding the candidate best positioned to defeat President Trump. But with Mr. Biden's setback in Iowa and a slate of flawed competitors beside him onstage on Friday — their shortcomings laid bare in several punchy exchanges throughout the night — the party has been left to consider an unsettling truth.
This is just all recent. This is all very recent, Mr. Trump said, pointing to the illicit exhibit in front of him. Mr. Trump was not shy about his disgust for the illegal goods: It looks pretty brutal. This is not a manufactured deal, as you say. This is the real stuff.
Immediately we could just talk to each other like we'd been friends for a long time, said Mr. Hocking, 31.
I didn't understand why, it was just an awful feeling I had being in that church, that there was something wrong with me, he said. He winced recalling his mother's reaction when she learned he was gay.
You can take the boy out of Yonkers, but you can't take Yonkers out of the boy.
No, in soap operas, they pretty much were white hat, black hat.
They postponed their 200-person wedding that was scheduled for October 2020, and the couple married on New Year's Eve at an Airbnb property in Mount Kisco, N.Y. And, in true pandemic fashion, their 14 guests, which mostly included close relatives, sent screen shots of their negative Covid-19 tests before arriving.
His death was announced by the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, the philanthropic organization he founded, which grew to become one of Israel's largest nonprofit organizations. No cause was given.
Historically, we've endorsed a two-state solution, which has always struck me as the best way forward, and I think it's really unfortunate that Donald Trump has moved us away from that to the extent that he has. I would try to move us back in that direction.
Just as the government would not charge a crime victim for investigating a crime, it should not charge women for bringing them back home, said Alison Gardner, an assistant professor of sociology who studies modern slavery at the University of Nottingham. She said a $1,000 debt could be devastating for a young woman whose family has tried to force her to marry and could disown her if she escaped.
But moments after arriving with his pregnant wife and three children at the foot of the international bridge, he and his family were stopped by Mexican officials and detained.
Other candidates have taken a different approach to creating a nest egg for low-income youth — Senator Booker, for example, favors baby bonds, which would provide every infant with a savings account that the government would contribute to annually depending on family income.
Mr. Yang is not the first to label this period the fourth industrial revolution — the term was made popular by Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, at its annual meeting in Davos in 2016. Mr. Schwab's book of the same name argues that the fourth industrial revolution is transforming every sector of the economy and industry through new technologies that merge the physical, digital and biological realms.
The series, Surviving R. Kelly, includes testimony from several women who accuse the singer of abuse, as well as commentary from Mr. Kelly's critics, including the founder of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke, and the singer John Legend.
My father served in the Morsi government; I was imprisoned for my activism; my uncle was a police officer under successive regimes; many other family members were army generals or politicians under the government of the former president, Hosni Mubarak. Is my family unique? In many ways, not at all. Most Egyptian families are similarly split across the country's political divides.
KK: Do you think — speaking of allies, do you think Turkey is still an ally to the United States, and do you think the U.S. should have nuclear weapons there?
We must take control of our own destiny by changing the nature of Jewish life in fundamental ways. The survival of the Jewish people is too important--to us and to the world at large--to be left in the hands of those ultra-Orthodox rabbis who would rather face Armageddon than change the religious status quo. Just as Jews of the past changed the nature of Jewish life in order to adapt to external necessities and to survive the ravages of their external enemies, so, too, must today's Jews change the nature of Jewish life to adapt to new internal necessities and to survive the demographic challenges of intermarriage, assimilation, low birthrates, and the breakdown of neighborhoods and communities.
His story does not neatly fit into the addict's narrative. Unprecedented numbers of men and women have fallen to the opioid epidemic in this country, rotating in and out of hospitals, treatment centers and jails, brought back to life by doses of Narcan, only to overdose again. Less common is a story like Mr. Azimi's, one with virtually no warning signs, evading detection by sharp-eyed colleagues in an epicenter of addiction in the Bronx. Those closest to him missed or misread the physical cravings that he hid well.
The Brooklyn-born son of the music arranger at New York's famous Roxy Theater, Mr. McCann was precocious, irrepressible and persistent.
That's like a cleaned-up version of West Side Story. Let's get into a rundle.
A report released by PEN America in November found that more than 1,800 local print outlets have closed since 2004, and at least 200 counties have no newspaper.
Nathaniel R. Jones, a former chief legal spokesman for the civil rights movement and later a federal appeals court judge who devoted his long career to eradicating the legacy of slavery endured by his own family, died on Jan. 26 at his home in Cincinnati. He was 93.
Through that conversation we cultivate the essential emotional attitude in marriage: I can try to understand what you think and feel, without it taking away from my own experience. Your reality doesn't cancel out mine.
There have been carnal people before and they were the ancestors of most of us.
Not to be outdone by my now husband who proposed to me via a New York Times crossword, this cruciverbalist bride wanted to make her own special puzzle for the wedding. I immediately came up with the AB POSITIVE theme based on our first initials.
The day before she was supposed to meet a date, one of her roommates got a positive coronavirus test result. When she and her four other roommates went to get tested, their results were negative. She told her date what had happened, and he said he wanted her to come over anyway. But when she arrived, he raised some doubts about having sex. Ms. Nguyen told him that whatever he wanted to do was fine, and she would leave if he wanted her to.
He reached down for his briefcase. From it he removed a folder. Jennifer Rockwell. H97143. He held it out toward me, saying,
Interracial couples. A guide dog for blind people. A person using a wheelchair.
So if that's your problem and you break Facebook into Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, does that somehow make the kids stronger or healthier? No. If anything, it actually ratchets up the incentives to try and further their engagement.
It was about honor and decency and integrity and the truth, DeLay said, his voice breaking, everything that we honor in this country. It was also a debate about relativism versus absolute truth. He charged that the President's Democratic defenders would lower the standards of society.
Ms. Gabbard, an Army National Guard veteran who was twice deployed to the Middle East, was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2012. She was the first Hindu and the first American Samoan elected to that chamber.
In police work you soon get to be familiar with what we call the yeah, right suicide. Where you go in the door, see the body, look around the room, and say, Yeah, right. This was definitely not a yeah-right suicide. I have known Jennifer Rockwell since she was eight years old. She was a favorite of mine. But she was also a favorite of everybody else's. And I watched her grow into a kind of embarrassment of perfection.
We have to be working toward China's second main priority, which is maintaining robust economic growth. So there are two goals. There are two primary goals that are sometimes in tension, of maintaining social order and maintaining robust economic growth. And the best way we can try and contain their behavior in Hong Kong is to say, Look, the economic costs are going to be very, very high. And the best way we can do that is to build global consensus around certain norms and behaviors.

After all, early in the last decade, there were back-to-back best picture victories for films centered on making movies. The Artist (2011) won using precious few words to tell the story of a pair of actors struggling to make the transition from silents to talkies. A year later, Argo (2012) took the crown for its based-on-real-life tale of C.I.A. agents working with silver-screen producers to camouflage a dangerous mission as an innocent motion picture. And for years, awards-season pundits have repeated the old saw that the academy votes for films that remind voters of themselves.
I lost my last 12 contracts, Borstelmann said. That hit me hard. My gosh. That's probably the money that I'm able to save from a whole season after expenses and everything else.
This interview was conducted by the editorial board of The New York Times, which will announce its Democratic primary endorsement on Jan. 19.
The report is blinkered by two dogmas. One is the doctrine of the blank slate that rejects biological and genetic factors, Pinker wrote, adding that
He nodded at me. This package, his nod seemed to say, was going to straighten me out.
I'm curious what conversations you and your colleagues are having in this moment. I have to assume that you go into the office each day, the union headquarters, or you meet with rank-and-file officers, and you're all absorbing these protests. And I'm curious what kinds of conversations you all are having in this moment.
So if Caldwell's book supplements and corrects Klein's, by giving a clearer sense of the ideological stakes involved in post-1960s polarization, his account needs to be corrected and supplemented in its turn. And a third new book, Michael Lind's The New Class War: Saving Democracy From the Managerial Elite, does an important part of that work, by explaining an aspect of our present polarization that can't be traced to specifically American racial fears or constitutional debates: Namely, the way that our populist-era divisions increasingly mirror Europe's, with the same exodus of downscale voters from left-of-center parties, the same polarization by education and class.
Well, fairly quickly after the wedding. There had been this rapturous coverage of the ceremony. But really within weeks, you began to see coverage and headlines in the British tabloids that started taking a slightly harder, meaner look at Harry and especially at Meghan. And it's worth pointing out quickly that the tabloids are, across the board, conservative publications. These are papers that really play to very traditional ideas of the meaning and the value of the monarchy. So what you begin to see are a series of articles. Some are actually asking valid questions about the lifestyle of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
Over the past five years, 90 percent of A.I. start-ups in Silicon Valley were acquired by major companies, according to TechCrunch.
In terms of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' of watching people become more Trumpian, these moral icons becoming shills, he is way up there, said Charlie Sykes, the author of How the Right Lost Its Mind, and a former radio host who used to occasionally substitute on Mr. Prager's show. Now you have to put PragerU in the category of other very successful meme machines and low-rent conservative grifting.
Well, in this case, what's interesting is it's up to the employer, and it was NBC and Saturday Night Live. Even as I made the statement saying I didn't think he should be fired, I thought he probably would be fired. Because if you're NBC and SNL, you look up and say, what is my upside for keeping this guy? He's not exactly a huge moneymaker, he hasn't worked a day on the set. Like, that's not a really powerful set of incentives. And so I thought they probably would fire him. I'd suggest that the extent there are consequences for people's misstatements, they should be somewhere commensurate to the level of power and influence they have and the harm that they're doing. In Shane Gillis's case, he was a comedian. I'd never heard of the guy before.
Maher diligently traces Baloch's steps from her family home to an abusive marriage to the women's shelter where she resolves to leave her husband but also, permanently, her son, behind. From there Baloch moved through a series of disillusioning way stations, the limited menu for a woman on the make: bus hostess, model. Everywhere in these subcultures Maher finds women confined and commodified, desperately trying, and rarely succeeding, to govern their own lives. No wonder the internet seemed to offer Baloch a new kind of freedom, one worth the price of the abuse she received. Social media is not someone's father's property, she tells her critics. Everyone has the right to express their opinion on it. And yet this is a dark book, in which loyalty and kindness are outdone by exploitation and cruelty. Maher, for example, finds the young reporter who breathlessly raced to Baloch's family home after receiving a police tip about her murder. Dissatisfied with his scoop, he arranged to have the sheet covering her corpse removed so that he could photograph it, so he could see for himself. This is amorality without a floor.
We were two separate societies divided by color until a king fell in love with one of us, the quick-witted Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh) tells her protégé, the Duke of Hastings. Look at everything it is doing for us, allowing us to become. She insists, Love, Your Grace, conquers all.
Hadn't he used the word peacefully one time in that address before the Capitol riot, tucked between the more dominant instructions to fight and show strength and go by very different rules as he whipped up anger against elected officials, including his own vice president, who were disinclined to subvert the will of the electorate?
My job as a union representative is to give you the ability to be treated fairly. If you did wrong, we need to go forth and go before whomever we have to go for, for your due process. The one fortunate thing that I have in a right-to-work state is I'm not bound to represent everybody. I have the right, even though you pay your dues to us, I have the right to turn you down for representation.
There are two kinds of people in the world: the kind who alphabetize their record collections, and the kind who don't. — Sarah Vowell, The Partly Cloudy Patriot
So if you look at other countries, they have a value-added tax and then they take those resources and put them to work toward various social programs in ways to balance out the inequality. Now, another thing I love about the value-added tax is you can either reduce it or exempt things like diapers, toilet paper, eggs, milk, things that Americans consume just to make ends meet, and you can dial it up on things like artificial intelligence, yachts, luxury watches. There are ways that you can make it so that it falls more heavily on people that would barely notice. And we're taking the resources plus an additional hundreds of billions of dollars and putting it directly into the hands of working Americans. This would increase the buying power of literally 90 percent of Americans.
The movie follows Katherine (Katherine Waterston), the wife of Stefan Delvoe (Michiel Huisman), a rising Belgian film star who died in an apparent suicide. Their marriage was a rocky one, shaken by revelations about Stefan's drug use and the possibility that he was unfaithful. It was Katherine who found Stefan's body with a bullet lodged in his temple.
Representative David Hobson, Republican of Ohio, said he supported impeachment of the President for lying to a grand jury but not in the Jones case. Even if it's true, I worry whether it rises to the same threshold for impeachment, he said. I didn't want to pile on.
The cause was complications of pneumonia, his company, All American Racers, said in a statement.
KK: So let's get into it. We have about 90 minutes together. In your assessment, what are the policy breakdowns that lead to Americans still being hungry today?
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — The ancient cemetery of Makli, near the city of Thatta in Sindh Province, is one of the largest necropolises in the world, so rich in monuments that UNESCO declared it a World Heritage site.
MC: So, and we are currently enjoying a businessmen president who has no experience in government or the military. What is your argument to people, that we should trust you with no experience in government and the military, in the same position, and that you will do a better job dealing with the peculiarities of Washington.
So, right now, the government is like this flopping appendage behind a lot of this stuff. I mean, honestly. The Office of Technology Assessment was eliminated in 1995. So our legislature is literally 24 years behind the curve on technology, and they don't understand. They're totally outgunned. They don't know what's going on.
Mr. Yang started Venture for America in 2011, shortly after selling his test prep company to Kaplan. He said that he saw, in the wake of the financial crisis, how certain communities were rapidly losing jobs and wanted to create new work opportunities in those underserved areas.
Did you come up for this?
Colonel Tom turned: Pleased to see me. Not even a little frown of inconvenience, like maybe I was going to take the shine off his evening. But the instant he opened the door I could feel my face collapsing. And I knew what he thought. He thought I was back on it. I mean the booze and all.
In fall 2019, Portia Carryer was mourning the loss of her beloved dog, a German shepherd named Rilke. That's when Rory Jelinski made her presence felt.
The biggest number of forced marriage cases was in Pakistan. In all, the Foreign Office helped bring home 82 survivors over 2016 and 2017. Mr. Hunt said that only a small minority had to sign loan agreements with the government; the rest, he said, were able to find others to pay the fees.
The royal palace offered no explanation for why the king, Sultan Muhammad V of Kelantan, stepped down after serving only two years of a five-year term. It has also declined to comment on a widespread rumor that his departure was tied to his marriage to a former beauty queen in Russia during a recent medical leave.
Some of these notions rubbed off on Lindbergh and were reflected in his little-known book, Of Flight and Life, in which he inveighed against scientific materialism. In this 1948 book, he said, I believe the values we are creating and the standards we are now following will lead to the end of our civilization, and that if we do not control our science by a higher moral force, it will destroy us with its materialistic values. In his plea for the recognition of metaphysical values, Lindbergh wrote: To progress, even to survive, we must learn to apply the truth of God to the actions and relationships of men, to the direction of our science. We must learn from the sermons of Christ, the wisdom of Laotzu, the teachings of Buddha. But Lindbergh, in this book, also espoused a doctrine of American superiority in the world. For Americans, the doctrine of universal equality is a doctrine of death, he wrote. If we ever become an equal people among other peoples of the world, our civilization will fall. When Lindbergh went abroad to live, first in Britain and then in France, he was 33 years old. He was immediately treated with courtesy and respect--and given the privacy he so much desired. His new friends were in the upper reaches of British society and Tory politics. Moreover, as a distinguished aviator, he was invited to visit airplane factories in France by the French Air Ministry.

This week's episode, titled The Kingmaker, compares Axe's impetuousness with the patrician calm of Jack Foley (David Strathairn), a man who exemplifies the difference between being wealthy and being rich. (Chris Rock defined the terms memorably, albeit to make a point on race.) In the machine politics of Albany, Foley has both hands on the levers, choosing candidates through favors and old-guard relationships and through back-channel political maneuvering. When Chuck's father chides Chuck for not showing proper fealty to Foley by failing to earn his granddaughter a clerkship, Chuck says: We don't have kings, dad. We live in a democracy. But we can see, as the episode unfolds, that Chuck doesn't really believe that now, if he ever did. His profile as a United States attorney may give his political prospects a boost, but there's no going anywhere in New York Democratic politics without Foley's blessing. And Chuck is fortunate enough to operate in that elite circle.
The title character of My Name Is Lucy Barton, Rona Munro's crystalline stage adaptation of Elizabeth Strout's 2016 novel, is hardly a woman of mystery. On the contrary, as embodied with middle-American forthrightness by a perfectly cast Laura Linney, in the production that opened Wednesday at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, Lucy may be the most translucent figure now on a New York stage.
is that repressing emotions is bad and expressing them is good — a folk theory with roots in romanticism, Freudian psychoanalysis, and Hollywood, but which is contradicted by a large literature showing that people with greater self-control, particularly those who repress anger rather than venting, lead healthier lives: they get better grades, have fewer eating disorders, drink less, have fewer psychosomatic aches and pains, are less depressed, anxious, phobic, and paranoid, have higher self-esteem, are more conscientious, have better relationships with their families, have more stable friendships, are less likely to have sex they regretted, are less likely to imagine themselves cheating in a monogamous relationship.
Diana Athill spent most of her life as an editor, working with titans of literary history. They were mostly male — most anointed titans are — and the challenge of this job was immense enough to warrant a thick memoir, Stet: An Editor's Life. Remarkably, Athill didn't use the pages to complain, an instinct that would have been easy to understand, but instead to sing the praises of the written word and the people who make it their mission to tell stories. What she less overtly advertised, though, was her fiercely independent life. Athill died last week at the age of 101, and her words, at several critical points in this reader's life, provided a lifeline. Perhaps her greatest legacy was her refusal to cede to societal expectations as she carved out a persistently unusual world for herself in which the demands of femininity — marriage and children, specifically — were rethought and redefined.
A report released by PEN America in November found that more than 1,800 local print outlets have closed since 2004, and at least 200 counties have no newspaper.
KK: So I assume you're referring to [your] universal basic income plan. Your campaign platform, you have tons and tons of proposals, everything from U.B.I. to universal daylight saving time. Plans don't really mean anything unless you have priorities. What would you do immediately when you enter office? What would be first on your agenda? What would you want to accomplish in the first 100 days?
My team then had me take the helmet off and then tried to make my hair look good. So that's why I didn't show up with the helmet.
In addition to the nine we already have. I believe that — so if you look at the Constitution, there is nothing there that stipulates the number of Supreme Court justices. We've had fewer than nine, we've had more than nine. I think that appointing new justices would be helpful on several levels. It would help depoliticize the process, at least marginally, because if you have 17 justices and one steps down, then it's not as much of an earthquake. Well, right now we we're hinging our laws on the health of an octogenarian. It would literally be rational for us to all just to follow Ruth Bader Ginsburg around and just scrub any door knob she touches. You know what I mean?

A crisis is a terrible thing to waste is a quote attributed to the Stanford economist Paul Romer. He made the comment at a meeting in 2004, referring to the competition America faces from the rising education levels around the globe. Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's chief of staff, later echoed the statement after President Obama's election.
CW: Going back though, my question is, there's an issue of power here. I mean, sure. You might not want to. You might not be able to address the problems of Facebook if you break it up from Instagram, and I understand that, and there's still going to be addictive products, but there's an issue of the consolidation of actual power, the ability to buy those companies, to make those acquisitions. Just simply the leverage that Mark Zuckerberg can use to have a meeting with Donald Trump that they won't tell us about, I mean, how do you — if you don't break them up, how do you get rid of that conglomeration of power?
The lure of the smugglers in Reynosa is not limited to Central Americans. Mexicans, too, employ their services, although the cost is lower — the prices charged seem to depend on just how bad the situation is in a migrant's home country.
My job, simply speaking, is to get things right. So there is no worse feeling than the realization that you have entered a correctable error into print and that a correction will appear a day or two later to proclaim, Because of an editing error …
I'm amazed that Eddie Rickenbacker and Charles Lindbergh, who appear in Race of Aces, are stalwarts of my own aviation-heavy cultural literacy — yet the flying ace Dick Bong, the all-American hero at its heart, is new to me, and I suspect he will be to other readers, too. In his new book, John R. Bruning corrects this oversight. Whether he's putting you in the middle of an intense air battle in searing heat and mosquito clouds, or taking you to watch a young aviator gamely repeat his marriage vows four times in a single day to accommodate the hungry media and an adoring public, Bruning celebrates a handful of larger-than-life World War II fighter pilots and brings them to our attention once again.
Here's the — you're walking down the road, and I understand the questioning. But here's the problem that I see, how I see it. A lot of people are going to have this argument about race and systemic racism in law enforcement. The statistics don't prove it. And you go and pull nationwide, and you pull in certain cities and states law enforcement records. And I just did this, because I had to do this in front of the city council in Chattanooga, Tennessee. In 2019, use of force, 59 percent were white, 39 percent were Black. If you start looking nationwide, you start seeing similar percentages. So the issue is, statistically, the argument isn't there. My opinion — my opinion only — the statistics are not the issue. What the issue is, is the perception from the Black community that that is what's going on. So where we in law enforcement fall short is we don't change and help change that perception.
Donald Trump does not speak for every non-politician or nonmilitary officer. But there is a deep need, and you've seen this, because you spent time in D.C., the D.C. establishment will not generate big solutions.
How are you doing? I'm Vince Champion.
Mr. Prager is 6-foot-4 and imposing, in a white button-down shirt, hunched over the microphone.
Well, they are still royals. Prince Harry is still a prince. He's still sixth in line to the throne. They still have the titles of His Royal Highness and Her Royal Highness. But in a very big concession to the queen, they agreed to stop using those titles. They've also agreed to repay the cost of renovating their cottage in England. And they've also importantly agreed to give up direct public funding of their activities. So it's a real break. And it truly does not only liberate the couple, but it will impose some pressure on them to earn enough money to finance a lifestyle that is, by anyone's account, very extravagant.
Well, and speaking directly, I was told that subscriptions for Showtime has really risen a lot because of Your Honor.
After Mr. Gillis was fired, Mr. Yang tweeted that the comedian had reached out to him. Looks like we will be sitting down together soon, Mr. Yang wrote. Neither the comedian nor the candidate appears to have spoken publicly about the content of the meeting.
If nothing else, Crashing may perform a public service by discouraging other would-be comics from pursuing this already overcrowded career, since Pete's ordeals on the club circuit are painful to watch. It doesn't help that he's a terrible comic, at least until the show needs him to be a better one — in Episode 6, he suddenly finds a groove at an opportune moment. It's an amusing episode (it's the one with Ms. Silverman) but also feels disingenuous given what has come before.
AK: But one of his priorities has been to get our European allies to spend more money on their own defense. And I wonder if you think that that's a worthwhile goal and how you might go about it, if you agree that that's something that should be a priority for the United States.
So if you cannot learn from the experiences of other countries, what can you learn from? We have to take a policy that actually works, and what those countries and every other developed country have determined works, is a value added tax. Because a value added tax is impossible to game your way out of. If you're a trillion-dollar technology company — you know, I was just in New Hampshire campaigning yesterday, and you know what I say to them? I say to everyone around the country, Amazon, a trillion-dollar technology company sucking up $20 billion in business every year, closing 30 percent of your stores and malls, paying zero in taxes, how do you feel about that? You know? And they are angry. They say, how the heck can Amazon be paying zero in taxes? And I was like, I know. And it's up to you, the people of New Hampshire, to change it. So if you look at other countries ——
Not a few designers who yearned to be named to her annual AD100 issue, listing the top 100 designers in the world, were distraught at being left out.
Her first book, Feed Me I'm Yours, began inauspiciously as an anthology of favorite recipes that she organized with several neighbors in 1974 as a stay-at-home new mother. The collection was intended to raise money for the Minneapolis chapter of the Childbirth Education Association, which advocates family-centered maternity care. Later published widely, the book sold millions of copies.
Court packing isn't a violation of any part of the Constitution, but it is widely debated with critics pointing out that it would trigger severe political backlash.
Representative Henry J. Hyde, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who himself saw a past affair come to light as he presided over the House's nine-week impeachment inquiry, said: Infidelity, adultery is not a public act, it's a private act, and the Government, the Congress, has no business intruding into private acts.
It shouldn't have worked, but Dave had an ESP about musicians and knew somehow Eugene would work, Philip Clark, the author of Dave Brubeck: A Life In Time (2020), said in a phone interview. Eugene was a light-fingered player who could swing heavily, but he had a spongy sound that gave albums like 'Time Out' and very intricate pieces like 'Three to Get Ready' a chamber music quality.
In England not long ago a survey of writers and critics revealed that the twentieth-century novelist they most admired--and who they thought would have the most enduring influence on the next century--was Marcel Proust. Certainly the madeleine moistened by herbal tea has become the most famous symbol in French literature; everyone refers to sudden gusts of memory as Proustian experiences. Snobs like to point out that if the Prousts had been better-mannered and not given to dunking, world literature would have been the poorer for it. Even those who haven't read Proust speak of him freely and often.
The comment about I wouldn't want to be judged for something 25 years ago was about something completely independent. I think I'd seen something where Joe Biden was being called out for something he'd said 25 years ago, when I said I wouldn't want to be called out for some misstatement I'd made 25 years ago. And then I joked, good thing no one cared about what I was doing 25 years ago, because I was at that point a 20-year-old man, and the internet didn't really have full documentation of how I spent those years.

In episode two, Ms. Hawkins shares her story on camera for the first time. Mr. Kelly used to call her the cable girl, because she hooked him up: She connected him to other young girls whom he had sex with, all of them, she said, between the ages of 14 and 16. He was 25 at the time. Eventually, Mr. Kelly began having sex with her, too. She later sued him and settled for $250,000. As part of the settlement, she signed a nondisclosure agreement, the first in a series of confidentiality agreements with women that kept his conduct a secret, and allowed it to continue.
On a Sunday night in early September 2017, Kara Eileen Cheever called her sister. She had just gotten home from her first date with Fuery Thomas Hocking, after matching with him on the dating app Bumble. What was supposed to be a casual afternoon walk in Central Park with Ms. Cheever's dog, Percy, had lasted into evening.
His death, in a hospital there, was announced by the Archdiocese of St. Andrews and Edinburgh, which he served as archbishop from 1985. He was chosen as a cardinal in 2003 by Pope John Paul II. He had broken his collarbone and injured his head in a fall last month, they said.
atch people's faces when we come in the door, Tom Holloway says. Holloway is a 29-year-old fourth-year Catholic seminarian at Mount Saint Mary's Seminary, and on this stunningly cold winter night, he and six other seminarians have driven to a diner not far from Emmitsburg, Md., where the seminary is situated, to have dessert. Holloway and two others in their fourth and last year, Brian Bashista and Damien Cook, are wearing clerical attire, or clerics, as they call them: black slacks, black shirts, Roman collars. They have already been ordained as deacons; they've made solemn promises of celibacy and obedience, and can perform baptisms and preside at marriages, as well as preach. They will be ordained as priests later this spring. As they enter the diner, a collective awareness seizes the room, much the way it might in the presence of someone famous. People either look up, or resolutely avoid looking up. After the seminarians settle in at a round table, Holloway, a slight, fair-haired man from Peoria, Ill., expands upon the reactions I've just seen -- a phenomenon seminarians refer to as the head-turn effect. Jennifer Egan writes frequently for the magazine. Her last article was about homosexuals in the military.

New TV shows, museum openings, film releases and concerts — it's a lot to keep track of. Let us help you. For the week of April 8, seven events in New York and elsewhere not to be missed:
Over the last 10 years, the Globes and the Oscars have agreed on best picture winners only 50 percent of the time — although they did match last year, when Green Book was the big winner at both ceremonies.
Mr. Reynolds started his prolific career on the performing side of the camera, appearing in some 80 films and television shows, beginning when he was a child. He developed an unusual sort of specialty: playing the younger versions of characters played by top film stars of the 1930s.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel paid tribute to Rabbi Eckstein after his death, saying he had worked tirelessly to benefit the citizens of Israel and to strengthen the bond between Christian communities and the State of Israel.
Rory is not a huge dog person, but when Rilke passed away, she was there for me, said Ms. Carryer (left), 32, a teen librarian for the San Leandro Public Library in California.
As hospitals overflow with Covid patients, ambulance teams face tough decisions. An ambulance near downtown Atlanta. You've got to worry — is there a breaking point? said the director for emergency services in one Georgia county. Credit... Dustin Chambers for The New York Times As the coronavirus has surged through the winter, some ambulance crews have struggled to keep pace with the number of patients requiring emergency care, and staffing and bed shortages at hospitals have led to hours of waiting to unload patients. Ambulance crews have been transporting the relentless tide of Covid-19 patients as the post-holiday surge accelerated: The United States reported 300,594 new cases on Friday and more than 4,100 deaths on Thursday, both single-day records. Hospitalizations remained at near-record levels, with 130,777 patients on Saturday, according to the Covid Tracking Project, while the nation's vaccine rollout is off to a slow start. In the Augusta, Ga., area, all three major hospitals were out of beds last week, said Steven Vincent, the vice president of Gold Cross EMS in Augusta. Waiting until a bed is available can sometimes take hours, he said, so ambulance crews have often opt to continue driving to other hospitals or trauma centers many miles away. Some hospitals have erected medical tents outside so that emergency medical service crews can split up, one member waiting with the patient and while the ambulance leaves to answer another call. Right now, our hospitals are completely full, Mr. Vincent said.
Earmarking allows Congress to appropriate discretionary funds for specific projects. Mr. Yang supports them because he feels they allow representatives to generate revenue for their constituents to offset costs their area might experience from a given piece of legislation.
Court packing isn't a violation of any part of the Constitution, but it is widely debated with critics pointing out that it would trigger severe political backlash.
Well, one of the joys of running for president is you get to know incredible people on the trail, including some of the other contenders. I'm on the record saying I would prefer to have a female running mate. I think teams run better if you have men and women leaders at the highest possible levels. I joke, but it's mostly true, that if you get too many men alone for too long, we kind of become morons. So we need to keep that from happening at the highest levels.
During a booming economic era for Los Angeles in the mid 1980s, the city was terrorized by a serial rapist and murderer dubbed the Night Stalker. In the chilling four-part docu-series Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer, some of the people involved in hunting down this criminal — eventually identified as Richard Ramirez — talk about the stress of the pursuit, and how difficult it was to catch a man whose pattern of behavior defied logic. What emerges from this story is a study of someone who seemed drawn to evil for its own sake, as the ultimate way of disturbing the peace.
The great Colette completely failed to sense his value when she first ran into Proust (they were both very young and just starting out as writers). She'd even gone so far, in one of her early Claudine novels, as to call him a yid (youpin), but her husband urbanely crossed out the insult and replaced it with boy (garcon). Even cleaned up, the passage doesn't make for very pleasant reading. It states that at a literary salon, I was pursued, politely, all evening by a young and pretty boy of letters. Because of her cropped hair, unusual for the period, he kept comparing her to the young god Hermes or to a cupid drawn by Prud'hon. My little flatterer, excited by his own evocations, wouldn't leave me alone for a second.... He gazed at me with caressing, long-lashed eyes.... At the same time, in 1895, she wrote Proust a letter in which she acknowledged that he had recognized a crucial truth: The word is not a representation but a living thing, and it is much less a mnemonic sign than a pictorial translation.
We decided we had to do something, she told me. I had this idea of talking to veterans and learning what their issues were. I began to learn about things like human-centered design and started with this smushy idea that we didn't know enough, so let's just start talking to people and build some qualitative data to better understand what's going on here.

And again, all you have to do to look at it is to say, stock market prices and G.D.P. record highs, life expectancy declining. Like, that sums it up. You know? You don't need any clearer divergence than that.
BA: Your proposal is oddly regressive. On the benefits side you're proposing that people will have to choose between this benefit and their existing federal benefits while someone like me just all the sudden gets a new check in their mailbox every month. On the funding side you're relying on a VAT, which is an inherently regressive funding mechanism. You've proposed some offsets, but I still don't understand why you don't just embrace a progressive approach to taxation. Either raise top rates or a wealth tax. If there are people who need help, why aren't you trying to help them as much as possible?
Starring a pair of fine actresses, Samantha Morton and Lesley Manville, as rival brothel owners in 1763 London, the show walks a fine line between empowerment (sex work as a choice more liberating than marriage or poverty-level employment) and victimization.
Lindbergh's youth was spent close to nature. His deep feeling for it was encouraged by his father, and these early attitudes surfaced toward the end of his life when he devoted much of his fantastic energies to the cause of conservation. Also early in life, he showed a marked aptitude for mechanical contrivances. When he was 8 or 9, he worked out an ingenious and complicated system for getting ice from the icehouse into the icebox. Charles's world was jolted when his father was elected to the House of Representatives, where he served from 1907 to 1917. He went to Washington, his first venture into a metropolis, and disliked it. About that time, his mother and father ceased living together, although for appearance's sake there was no legal separation and both parents took care to give the child a sense of security. Apart from saying that the separation was a tragic situation for his parents, Lindbergh shut his lips about the situation and shied from talking about the psychic hurts that he bore. He was equally taciturn on other personal matters. The future aviator's interest in flying was sparked in 1908 or '09, when, one day, he heard a buzzing in the sky and climbed out of a dormer window onto the roof of his home to witness a frail biplane skimming through the clouds.
My job as a union representative is to give you the ability to be treated fairly. If you did wrong, we need to go forth and go before whomever we have to go for, for your due process. The one fortunate thing that I have in a right-to-work state is I'm not bound to represent everybody. I have the right, even though you pay your dues to us, I have the right to turn you down for representation.
Ms. Hamoud and Ms. Labaki are entirely deserving of praise. They have made polished films with high production values, which are thoroughly engaging, often caustic and, at times, devastating. But they follow a path blazed by many women before them. Today they have a support system, which their predecessors lacked. The women before them worked away on their own, under much more dangerous conditions (including actual wars) and against much more pushback. But just like these contemporary Arab women directors, their work was acclaimed, welcomed and shown abroad, at leading European film festivals and on international movie screens. The output of the new wave of Arab female filmmakers — and even female writers and artists — should be viewed in the actual context of the history of Arab cinema, literature and art, and not with any misguided idea that these voices are emanating from a vacuum.
The bedroom led off the living room. And I knew where to go. Because I had been to this residence before, maybe a dozen times in half as many years--to drop something off for Colonel Tom, to give Jennifer a ride to a ballgame or a beach party or a function at the Dep Comm's. Her, and once or twice Trader, too. It was like that, a functional kind of friendship, but with good chats in the car. And as I crossed the living room and leaned on the bedroom door I flashed a memory of a couple of summers back, a party Overmars threw after his new deck was done, when I caught Jennifer's eye as she was smiling up from the glass of white wine she'd been nursing all night. (Everyone else apart from me, of course, was completely swacked.) I thought then that here was somebody who had a real talent for happiness. A lot of gratitude in her. I'd need a megaton of scotch to make me burn like that but she looked lovestruck on half a glass of white.
Biden and Harris introduced members of their White House science team. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 2:23 - 0:00 transcript Science Is About 'Hope,' Biden Says President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris introduced key members of their White House science team on Saturday. We know that science is discovery, it's not fiction. It's also about hope, and that's America. It's in the DNA of this country, hope. We're on the cusp of some of the most remarkable breakthroughs that will fundamentally change the way of life for all life on this planet. We can make more progress in the next 10 years, I predict, than we've made in the last 50 years. Today, I'm proud to announce a team of some of the country's most brilliant and accomplished scientists to lead the way. The opportunities we have and the challenges we face are greater than ever before. The president-elect knows that science and technology will be crucial in meeting this moment. And he has tasked us in this letter, and I don't mean, just his scientific advisers, I mean, the whole scientific community and the American public with answering important questions about how science and technology can best be used to advance our health, our economic welfare, and our national security. Perhaps never before in living memory have the connections between our scientific world and our social world been quite so stark as they are today. The Covid-19 crisis has inflicted extraordinary suffering.
After a brief first marriage, Dr. Biden married Mr. Biden in 1977, more than four years after his first wife, Neilia, and young daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car accident. She put her own career ambitions on hold to raise his two sons, Beau, a Delaware attorney general who died in 2015, and Hunter, as her own. The Bidens' daughter, Ashley, was born in 1981.
She writes with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming, Feld said, concluding that we were to anticipate McCullers's second novel with something like fear, given the standard set by the first.
JW: Are you concerned that you wouldn't be triggering a sort of a war of — a back and forth between Republicans and Democrats, who were continuing to add justices to the bench with each new administration to satisfy their own policy priorities?
At the last debate, I proposed a world data organization, because to me, China's in position to leapfrog us in artificial intelligence. They're investing tens of billions in a way that our government is not. It's a national effort. And they've now separated their technology ecosystem from the West's and they're trying to sell their software and operating systems to other countries with very limited success right now, but this parallel tech universe, to me, is something that we can actually use to bring China back to the table.
Regardless of the result, it will signal a new chapter for Germany and Europe, where the staid but steady leadership of Ms. Merkel has been a constant for the past 15 years. She earned respect for holding Europe together through repeated crises and, most recently, her deft handling of the coronavirus pandemic over the past year.
I called my sister to say that I didn't know what Fuery would be, but I could tell he was going to be someone in my life, said Ms. Cheever, 31. We just clicked, I guess. I had never really felt that way about a guy before.
NF: I mean, is there still a role for 20th-century antitrust?
As we survey a culture that is rapidly attempting to enforce norms hostile to traditional masculinity, are men flourishing? And if men are struggling more the farther we move from those traditional norms, is the answer to continue denying and suppressing a boy's essential nature?
There are some who can live without wild things and some who cannot.
I think the number of aircraft carriers is either seven or nine. I confess to not knowing precisely. In terms of our investment, we're spending $650 billion plus on our military. Certainly more than any other country, but I think more than the next four countries combined, and we have to examine, at this stage, whether that $650 billion is making us safer and more secure.
BA: Just before we move on, maybe I can ask one more question.
Known cases occurred predominantly in some African countries and India.
Mr. Yang has proposed what he describes as a W.T.O. for data and has argued that data ownership should be made a property right. Some argue that such an organization could enable more partnership among countries in setting standards for artificial intelligence and data.
College alumni magazines are very, very enthusiastic about personal ads, said Professor Schneider, 72.
For me, things hopefully come together. Obviously you have to know your lines and know them well enough in front of a crowd, [so] you harness their attention. There's also the accent: Seretse Khama had a Botswana accent, but he also spent a lot of time in the U.K., so his accent was a hybrid. And sometimes the emotion can take over and the technical aspects can go by the wayside, and you don't want that to happen. Then there's the truth of what he's saying, the emotional truth. None of the technical work means anything unless there is an emotional connection — for you as the actor but also to the people you're delivering the speech to and then the audience as well.
Civil rights groups, however, said the program risked disenfranchising millions of people who already face systemic challenges getting the documents required to obtain biometric ID cards. To enroll, adults had to provide a national identity card, and birth certificates for those under 18.
And the problem has persisted. In 2013, a priest in Uganda was suspended after he raised concerns about his fellow priests engaging in sexual relations with women, including nuns. In India, a bishop currently faces charges of repeatedly raping a former mother superior.
This was November 2018, and the Camp Fire, the most destructive wildfire in California history, was making swift and smoky headway through the Sierra Nevada foothills. It took fewer than four hours to rip through this town of 26,000 residents, reducing schools, businesses, and 11,000 homes into piles of smoldering ash. When Mr. Singer got the evacuation order, he believed it was another false alarm. But he peeled out of his driveway as flames licked his yard, making it out of town with minutes to spare.
The question of whether to prioritize free public college has divided the Democratic candidates. Senators Warren and Sanders say that four-year public colleges should be free, and Senator Cory Booker signed on to legislation that could make it debt-free. Senator Amy Klobuchar previously criticized the idea of free college for all, but then signed on to a version of a free-college proposal. Mr. Yang, though, has said he supports forgiving more student loan debt but thinks the Freedom Dividend is a better solution to inequality than free college.
American history is not anymore the story of great white men, said Albert S. Broussard, a history professor at Texas A&M University and an author of both the Texas and California editions of McGraw-Hill's textbooks.
One criticism of government subsidized journalism is that it could stifle the media's capacity to serve as a watchdog.
Although Mr. Ellis had no formal training in the classification of national security information, he overruled the decision by a career official to clear Mr. Bolton's book for publication. The Justice Department, under pressure from Mr. Trump, has sued Mr. Bolton to recoup his profits from book. A judge overseeing the case issued a ruling on Thursday that makes it highly likely that Mr. Bolton's lawyer, Chuck Cooper, can question White House officials, like Mr. Ellis, about whether the classification decisions were made in bad faith. Julian E. Barnes and
There was no outrunning pasts — that was what I saw now. There was no papering over flaws with research and interviews. When I had interviewed the wife about her infidelity, I had inwardly judged her for what she had done. Or maybe I had been judging myself, predicting all along that this would happen.
Her movie career began in 1955 when she played a doomed hitchhiker in Kiss Me Deadly, a hard-boiled detective film based on a novel by Mickey Spillane. She was already a seasoned stage and television actress by then, and throughout the rest of the 1950s and the '60s she appeared in big roles on the small screen — she preceded June Lockhart as the mother in the 1957-58 season of Lassie — and small roles on the big screen, including as a prostitute in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969).
I have family in Hong Kong. I spent a semester there in college, and so when I see those streets wracked with riots and violence, I actually remember being on those streets. And so it's incredibly jarring, and it's an extraordinary situation because of Hong Kong's status as this semiautonomous region that's being reintegrated back into China.
CW: I'm curious, then, focusing on the U.S., a couple of months ago the general counsel for the N.S.A. wrote an Op-Ed for us and was worried about this big challenge of the government not being able to acquire the tech talent. That Silicon Valley is actually so much more attractive, so much more interesting there. And that when you're looking at 5G technology, quantum computing, technology, A.I., not having engineers in that space and sort of outsourcing that to the private sector is potentially incredibly dangerous. Like how do you actually make people want to come and bring that engineering talent to the federal government, rather than ——
Ms. LeBell contacted the program manager again and asked, What do you have against a nice white girl? she told The Bradenton Herald in Florida in 2012. He replied that she had misunderstood, and that his meaning of minority included women.
But now it has run completely aground. Developments in the case are so slow-moving and diffuse that it's hard to keep track of them, and most of them are probably red herrings anyway. Dead ends are to be expected in the middle of an eight-hour whodunit, but that doesn't absolve the series's creator, Nic Pizzolatto, from the responsibility to keep plugging away. It's not just the detectives in The Hour and the Day who are losing their sense of direction — it's as if the show itself had unscrewed the cap on a bottle of Jack Daniels and gone for a swim. Maybe it will wake from its stupor and start working the case again, but for now it's passed out on the couch. And it's dreaming about the Viet Cong.
The Democrat-dominated Assembly has voted to close the loophole for years, but the measure went nowhere in the Republican-led Senate.
In my grief, Rory made sure that I knew she was by my side, said Ms. Carryer, who graduated from Stanford and received three master's degrees: one in library science from the University of Illinois, another in fine arts from the University of Victoria and another, in education, from the University of California, Berkeley.

I mean, that's not solely an American decision. NATO expansion is something that is fraught and elevates tensions with Russia in particular. I think we should explore it. I'm sympathetic, but it's not a decision we can make alone.
No, you're making clear that you do see it. You're saying you have seen acts of racism. So you do see race.
Touching on issues of artistic survival and the porous boundary between work and pleasure, Ms. Subrin, an accomplished visual artist and filmmaker, sifts addiction, celebrity and the plight of the aging actress into something rarefied yet real. A strong, intelligent screen presence, Ms. Siff can make the simplest line feel pregnant with possibility. And Ms. Seymour is the perfect counterpoint, giving Kate a warm vulnerability that's never overplayed or milked for sentiment.
Ms. Nguyen realized that during the pandemic, she has found hesitation and caution to be appealing traits in a date.
The later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries showed unmistakably that the Catholic Church had decided to climb out of the river of contemporary intellectual life rather than swim along in midstream, despite the hopes of Newman, Brownson, Hecker, and many other converts. The papal hammer fell frequently on efforts to modernize Catholic thinking, an enterprise in which converts were often closely involved. For example, Pope Pius IX (1846-1878) issued the Syllabus of Errors in 1864, condemning many of the principles upon which contemporary scientists, social scientists, and biblical critics outside the Catholic Church were then working. It concluded by condemning the proposition that the Roman Pontiff can and ought to reconcile himself to, and come to terms with, progress, liberalism, and modern civilization. The condemnation brought the work of several convert intellectuals under scrutiny, and it discouraged them from showing the consonance of their work with contemporary philosophy and science. Among the converts affected was the English evolutionary biologist St. George Mivart, who was ultimately excommunicated for his assertion that the Catholic doctrine of hell was untenable. The seemingly antiintellectual animus of the syllabus also disillusioned some converts, among them Thomas Arnold, who reverted to Anglicanism when he learned of it.
Another congregation that is working with those grappling with religious trauma is the Holy Trinity Community Church in Nashville, with a membership that is over 80 percent L.G.B.T.
Six years later Pius IX organized the declaration of papal infallibility at the First Vatican Council (1870), declining to countenance historical evidence (provided by Newman, among others) which showed that papal supremacy itself, let alone papal infallibility, was based on several centuries of development out of an early church that had been constituted quite differently. Papal infallibility, whatever its other consequences, represented a disastrous reversal for Catholic historians, who had dedicated themselves to close analysis of the early church. The pontificate of Leo XIII (1878-1903) promised them some relief, but his encyclical letter Aeterni Patris (1879) aimed to revive scholasticism, keeping new philosophical and historical approaches at arm's length. Its successor, Providentissimus Deus (1893), set sharp limits on Catholic participation in historical-critical study of the Bible.
When I describe some of the multiple roads we must take if we are to maximize our chances for survival, I think of a variation of the old story of the rabbinical judge who, after hearing a wife's complaints about her husband, says, My daughter, you are right, and, after hearing the husband's complaints, says, My son, you are right. When his student observes, Rabbi, they can't both be right, he replies, My son, you are right. Under my variation, the rabbi responds to his student, No, you are wrong. They can both be right. To the differing and sometimes inconsistent approaches to Jewish survival, I would say, You may all be right. Don't you dare tell each other that you are wrong. Nobody has a monopoly on the truth about the Jewish future. Everything that may work must be tried.

In a business you can say, Hey, we're going to go this way, and people generally have to do what you're saying. In government it's much more analogous to my role as the founder of a national nonprofit, where you have hundreds or even thousands of stakeholders, and you have to try and generate energy around a vision. Let people see that it's in their self-interest or the self-interest of the people that they represent to get on board with your vision. And that you're willing to compromise and work with them. That is the way I would lead as president.
In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, architecture found itself back at the drafting table. Clients got spooked (or went broke), construction rates plummeted in the United States and Europe, and young architects in particular had to find new ways to work. And so this past decade has greeted a welter of digital projects, performances, pop-up designs and paper architecture, by practitioners born too late for big budgets.
It was all seat-of-the-pants flying and Lindbergh gloried in it; but he gave it up to enlist in the Army in March, 1924, so he could attend the Army flying school at Brooks Field, San Antonio, Tex. For the first time, he found some joy in textbooks and classes. Chief Pilot on Mail Run Indeed, he was graduated as the top man in his class, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army Air Service Reserve in March, 1925. He was by this time an experienced flier. He spent some time as an air circus stunt flier at county fairs and the like before being hired by the Robertson Aircraft Company of St. Louis as the chief pilot on the mail run to Chicago. He made the first run in April, 1926. It was the only paycheck job in the normal sense of the word that he ever held. Meantime, he had made a further commitment to the military by joining the Missouri National Guard, where he taught other pilots and became a first lieutenant. On one of his flights to Chicago in September, 1926, he was musing about the possibilities of long-distance trips, and he startled himself by thinking I could fly nonstop between New York and Paris. In many ways, Lindbergh's life was a series of responses to imperatives. When he became convinced that he ought to do something--he ought to oppose entry into World War II, he ought to speak out for conservation--he reacted with vigor and dispatch.
One, it's a lot easier and cheaper for us to throw kids into a classroom with textbooks and a teacher and say, You're going to go to college, than it is to try and train them in skills that are going to give them a secure livelihood. Number two, we have fetishized college and stigmatized anything that's not college. We've beaten Americans over the head, pretended everyone's going to college and say, It's going to work for you. And the Democrats are guilty of this. That's why they're yelling, Free college, free college. Meanwhile, again, only 33 percent of Americans are going to go to college, and that is a relatively stable number.

And so this idea, that suddenly this brilliant young couple — this shining symbol of the future of the monarchy — would wind up turning their backs on it, and leave Britain, comes at a particularly vulnerable moment for the British people. And as it turns out, the people who are hardest on Meghan Markle are also generally the people who voted for Brexit. And it's one of the great paradoxes of this story. That their resistance to Meghan Markle — their complicity in making her life miserable — has led to this outcome that has convulsed the royal family, has threatened an institution that these people care so deeply about. So I think that's the importance here. It's not just a debate that breaks down along generational lines. It's a debate that breaks down very much along Brexit lines. Did you vote for staying in the European Union or for leaving? How you voted in that case weighs very much in how you feel about Harry and Meghan.

Maybe, though, it is almost impossible to write the truth about these things without seeming — how like a woman! — hysterical. As with the return of fascism and the measles outbreak, it's difficult to believe that mere foolishness and complacency could return us to the bad old days until we actually see it happen. And the novel gives the reader much to enjoy in the meantime. Zumas is a skillful writer, expertly keeping each of her characters in balanced motion, never allowing one to dominate the rest. Her cunning device of not revealing the name of each character in the sections she narrates grants us a multidimensional perspective on all four women, highlighting their roles in one another's stories. It's a beautiful metaphor for the interdependence of women's lives — for the way that, as Paley would remind us, the laws that imprison or criminalize one of us narrow the options for all of us.
Listening to the tape, we have no idea what this means.
In Texas textbooks, mentions of L.G.B.T.Q. issues tend to be restricted to coverage of events in recent decades, such as the Stonewall uprising, the AIDS crisis and debates over marriage rights.
Our messed-up heroine is Clara (Karla Souza, clearly delighted to escape the constraints of her lugubrious character on How to Get Away With Murder), an OB-GYN by day and a drunken karaoke singer by night. Fumbling hookups with random men temporarily banish her loneliness without extinguishing her torch for Daniel (José María Yazpik), the lover who abandoned her eight years earlier. Guess who shows up, though, to a family wedding to derail Clara's fledgling bond with a cuddly Australian co-worker (Ben O'Toole)? And guess whose clothing soon evaporates in the heat of Daniel's twinkling attention?
His death was announced by the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, the philanthropic organization he founded, which grew to become one of Israel's largest nonprofit organizations. No cause was given.
After many fine meals together my mother had to leave Pete for the lockup. By the time he joined her nine months later she'd forgotten their years together, and he was too infirm to actively love her company as he'd once done, although he never forgot the fact of his affection. This is how it ends, he said to me, waving weakly at my mother from his new table, across the room from hers.
Mr. Gillis was hired by Saturday Night Live last September, then dropped days later after clips surfaced showing him using slurs and language offensive toward Asian and L.G.B.T.Q. people, including one specifically about Mr. Yang.

In the 1970s, as a member of the band Wagon Wheels, he played alongside the singer Thomas Mapfumo, who would become the only other Zimbabwean musician with a reputation to rival his. Mr. Mapfumo left the country in the 1990s and became well known in the West. Mr. Mtukudzi stayed, and cemented his status as the country's most renowned musician.
The events and emotions of that marriage turn up again and again in Dick's novels, transfigured into science fiction. Anne Dick, as Ms. Rubenstein became, made custom jewelry, which was a major plot element in his best-known novel, The Man in the High Castle. Their children's Barbies are featured in The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, where colonists on Mars escape their wretched existence with reality-altering drugs and Perky Pat dolls.
This week's episode was Pizzolatto's inauspicious debut as director, though the problems here are mostly with the script, which is credited to him and David Milch, the trailblazing showrunner of Deadwood and NYPD Blue. It's impossible to say how much influence Milch wielded, but many of Pizzolatto's weaknesses are on display here: grossly overwritten dialogue, a leaden understanding of domestic relationships and a tendency to brood alongside his characters.
Justice Bader Ginsburg has had a series of health scares in recent years, including surgery for lung cancer and radiation treatment. She also had surgery for early-stage pancreatic cancer in 2009.
If there is a criticism to be made of this highly absorbing novel, it is that it feels perhaps a shade too contemporary, and never quite reveals the horrors that would surely follow if the pre-Roe v. Wade days were to repeat themselves. The one disaster that has occurred — to Mattie's friend Yasmine — is elided from the action of the novel, and rendered soft-focus and ambiguous. The reader is left to wonder what it would be like to be a pregnant teenager of color under these new laws. Mattie's journey to try to terminate her pregnancy is far less demeaning and terrifying than the hardships endured by some women living in states with few legal, safe abortion clinics. Gin stands trial, but it's clear from early on that the forces conspiring against her would have seen her accused of a crime with or without the new laws. Having read one's Paley, one feels while reading Zumas's book that yes, this imagined dystopia is terrible, but the reality would be far worse.
I used to say about Cynthia's writing, and her being, that she had the soul of Janis Joplin in the voice of Hedda Hopper, Emily Prager, the novelist and comedy writer, said in an email. She was a voice for liberation with manners, freedom without regret and the blues with a grain of salt.

The other way is that many of these competitive markets end up very quickly accelerating toward one or two winners and saying, I'm going to break you up. Does not solve that problem. I joke that it would be cruel and unusual punishment to say you have to use the fourth-best navigation app. Like what is that? Apple Maps. We all hate Apple Maps, right? If you use that thing, you're like, Oh. You curse the gods until you figure out how to get Google Maps going. So going up and saying, Look, you're the winner in the space. We're going to break you up, it doesn't revive Main Street businesses, and it doesn't actually end up solving the competition problem.
President Obama referred to education as the civil rights issue of our time, as did former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. Indeed, the gap between education outcomes for black and white students has barely budged in recent decades, according to research from the Brookings Institution.

The 21st-century framework. First, you don't use price as your primary determinant of whether or not there are antitrust problems, because the tech companies would say, What? We would never gouge anyone. It's free. We're underselling everyone. So that you have to get rid of, and that's not something she's advocating, but what she is advocating, which I find to be a bit backward looking, is thinking that competition is the answer in these spaces. And competition misses the point in one way and another way.
Mr. Holdsworth forged a relentlessly exploratory approach to harmony, which he brought to bear on both the guitar and the SynthAxe, a guitarlike synthesizer that allowed him added control over his tone and flow. He had his own vocabulary of unorthodox chords, often involving far reaches across the fretboard. As a soloist, he executed lightning-fast melodies with remarkable fluidity.
When the big board was completed, I talked about the puzzle, the theme, the title, and our names, much to everyone's delight. And then I asked if anyone found anything else worth noting.

He rightly discovered that I had coded the clues acrostic style, meaning that reading the first letter of each clue in order it would reveal a message.

So for a high school graduate in America to get by, if you have one health problem or car breakdown, it can take a very tenuous financial situation and send it in a downward spiral. Then how do you put food on the table? In theory, there are nonprofits and food pantries that would see to this, but we all know that they're dramatically underresourced relative to the need. And so when you look at the causes of food poverty, to me the best solution is instead of trying to create organizations that will put food into people's hands, which we should do obviously, we should just put money into Americans' hands and then they would be able to procure food to provide for themselves and their families.
James Dao: Can I pose a future hypothetical? If the Chinese government were to flood Hong Kong with military troops after you were president and impose a violent crackdown, similar to, say, Tiananmen Square in 1989, what would you do?
He read some promos for his sponsor Blinds.com. He took calls from listeners. He talked about the importance of children respecting parents (very important) and about how parents should not want their children to be the smartest in the class, but rather the most moral.
But after failing a sobriety test, the two officers on the scene, Garrett Rolfe and Devin Brosnan, tried to handcuff him. Brooks then punched Officer Rolfe, took control of Officer Brosnan's taser, fired it and ran from the officers. Officer Rolfe chased after him. Brooks turned around, fired a second taser shot over Rolfe's head. Rolfe drew his gun and shot Brooks twice in the back, killing him. Five days later, the Fulton County district attorney, Paul Howard, held a press conference —
The week before the Oscar nominations on Jan. 13 was meant to be the most exciting phase of awards season yet: After a glittery Golden Globes ceremony on Sunday, many of the most important industry guilds and groups weighed in with their own nominations during the next two days, helping to clarify the Oscar race and winnow down the ultimate list of contenders.
Gautreaux's stories all begin in the relatively humble territory of realistic fiction. He describes his method, simply, as follows: I try to imagine a normal, average man, with a old boring job, and give him a problem. Gautreaux has been called the cartographer of the Louisiana back roads, but he also loves machines more than anyone I've read: gas stoves, trains, typewriters, sewing machines, pipes, pianos, church bells. It's one of the chief pleasures of his work — finding out how things function and how to fix them. (Or not: A reader's heart breaks with Gautreaux's when something is declared past fixin'.)
Tom Fesen, 30, a deacon from Trenton, took a job after college at Chemical Bank in New York, where he commuted each day from his home in New Jersey. There were two buses; one came too late and one came too early, he recalls. So I came early. The bus dropped me off across the street from a church, so I decided, I'll go into this church, get a little peace of mind. Mass would be about 20 minutes. So six months into this, the reader left, and the priest came up to me and said, 'Do you want to read during Mass?' I said: 'No, I don't want to. I'm just here a little early.' Immediately after that, he said, 'Well, do you want to be a priest?' I was so irritated, Fesen continues. Where does he come off? I'm going to be a banker; get married; 2.5 kids, house in the suburbs, dog. But after that I couldn't get the thought out of my mind. Bashista regards celibacy as a crucial aspect of his priesthood, which will not be a job so much as a way of life -- a marriage to the church. 'Some days I'll think: What if I was back at the architecture firm? Would I be a partner now? Married? Have kids?' he says. 'But the match has been made.'

It seems like a nice place to work. Then you might have greater success. We also saw this happen even with the rollout of healthcare.gov. Remember this? It's like they had the consultant and then they totally botched it and then they needed to bring in the ——
I mean, that's not solely an American decision. NATO expansion is something that is fraught and elevates tensions with Russia in particular. I think we should explore it. I'm sympathetic, but it's not a decision we can make alone.
In October, less than two months before he died, a frail Mr. Agee, who suffered from scleroderma, a degenerative disease of the immune system, reconnected with his first family. Legal documents show that he gave Suzanne Agee power of attorney (along with his 32-year-old daughter with Ms. Cunningham Agee, Mary Alana Kurz), filed for divorce and rewrote his will to divide his assets among Ms. Cunningham Agee and his five children. (Previously, the will had left everything to Ms. Cunningham Agee.)
His daughter Michele Rodgers said that the cause was kidney disease and that he had also tested positive for Covid-19.
Well, I would suggest that one side has been acting as if it is an arms race. And so, in that environment, it's only appropriate to respond in a way that you think would help move the country and our legal system in the right direction. Can I talk — oh.
For one year the Lewinsky scandal has preoccupied the capital despite an immense disconnet with public opinion. Since the scandal became public last January, polls have shown the public opposed impeachment and wanted the inquiry brought to an end. Even on Friday night, after a 13-hour debate, a CBS News Poll of 548 persons showed only 38 percent wanted their representative to vote for impeachment; 58 percent wanted a no vote.
And again, all you have to do to look at it is to say, stock market prices and G.D.P. record highs, life expectancy declining. Like, that sums it up. You know? You don't need any clearer divergence than that.
The play, which ended a successful run in London last month, is moving to the Samuel J. Friedman Theater in September. It centers on a couple who, after 50 years of marriage, struggle to cope with change and uncertainty. The actors Jonathan Pryce and Eileen Atkins, who starred in the London production, will reprise their roles as husband and wife. Jonathan Kent (Long Day's Journey Into Night) will direct.
You don't have to make a big deal of it. It's playing with fire. Sometimes these images will bombard your memory. If he begins to feel aroused, Bashista said, you have to channel that energy in productive ways. Doing something for someone else. If you're looking at ladies, getting some thoughts or ideas, just refocus. And yet, many of these men were reared on popular culture and find it difficult to give up. On a lot of TV shows, you know married couples are contracepting, Magat said. And any time Jerry hooked up with some girl in 'Seinfeld,' we knew they were sleeping together. . . . Should I find these things funny? This is the stuff I'm going to be preaching against! Magat stopped watching Seinfeld, but kept track of what was happening on the show to the very end from nonseminary friends. For a long time, Michael Dobbins was a devoted fan of James Taylor. I went to several of his concerts and I had his T-shirts, his CD's -- I was taking guitar lessons so I could learn to play his songs, he said. Then I began to realize that a lot of his lyrics are like, peace, love and butterflies are free -- whatever goes. But whatever goes really isn't the truth, you know? And finally one day I'm listening to this James Taylor concert on the radio, and he says, 'This is a hymn to the goddess Gaya.'
She and Warren Clark, from her neighborhood in the Bronx, fell in love, and he proposed on their first date. They determined that she should continue with her plan to become a flight attendant for Pan Am and planned a wedding for the next year, 1949.
Those are some of the portraits of the Trump White House sprinkled throughout Team of Vipers, an inside account of working there written by Cliff Sims, a former communications staff member and Trump loyalist who worked on the campaign.
In addition to making his own movies and writing prolifically about the movies of others, Mr. Mekas was the founder or a co-founder of institutions that support and promote independent filmmakers, including, in New York, the influential journal Film Culture, published quarterly from 1955 to 1996; Film-Makers Cooperative, a distribution network; and Anthology Film Archives, the leading library and museum for experimental film. (The critic Andrew Sarris published his influential essay on the auteur theory in Film Culture.)
To many in this central Chinese city, the saying sums up a temptation to let go of the bad memories while reveling in the recovery. To families grieving in the shadows, it means the danger of hastily forgetting without a public reckoning for the lives needlessly lost.
The biggest number of forced marriage cases was in Pakistan. In all, the Foreign Office helped bring home 82 survivors over 2016 and 2017. Mr. Hunt said that only a small minority had to sign loan agreements with the government; the rest, he said, were able to find others to pay the fees.
Yeah, you said you don't need 80 percent of Congress, you need a majority. And I would push back and say neither of those is correct. You need 60 percent of the Senate currently. The question is, how do you plan to get things done, even if you had a Democratic majority in the Senate? Which I think is right now less than an even chance. How do you propose getting your agenda through Congress when the filibuster is in place?

And here lies the crux of their sense of mission, and the optimism that fuels it: the so-called freedoms of our secular and relativistic culture have not paid off, they insist; on the contrary, they have created a dangerous and uninhibited world where families are ravaged by divorce, abortion, addiction and violence. Someone who chooses something they know is destructive, that's not freedom -- that's slavery, said Bashista. Freedom is knowing your choices and then choosing the truth. There is another reason to resist being of this world -- not just for seminarians but also for all fervid Catholics. This world is not the end, Bashista reminded me. That communion we're seeking will happen in the next life. Heaven is the subject of rich fantasy among the seminarians; they imagine it as a place unfettered by limitations of time or space, where they will meet and love the many anonymous strangers they pass each day in restaurants and highways. Jim Crisman, a seminarian from Denver who taught for a time in Slovakia, recalled one day: I'd go to a 4:00 Mass every day in Slovakia, and I'd see the old women coming in. I couldn't communicate with them. And I was thinking, I don't know anything about them, but I will someday. This isn't the last time that I'll see them.

• We're listening to The Daily. Our latest episode is Part 2 of a series on the Senate runoff races in Georgia.
Perhaps Colette had been initially irritated because the young flatterer had already divined her bisexuality. By 1917, after Proust had begun to publish Remembrance of Things Past, she could see him in another light. He was very ill, he weighed no more than one hundred pounds, and he seldom emerged from his cork-lined room. He had become a martyr to art (and she herself was one of his few living rivals as a stylist). She saw him at the Ritz during the war with a few friends, wearing a fur coat even indoors over his evening clothes: He never stopped talking, trying to be gay. Because of the cold, and making excuses, he kept his top hat on, tilted backwards, and the fan-like lock of hair covered his eyebrows. Full-dress uniform, but disarranged by a furious wind, which, pouring over the nape of his hat, rumpling the calico and the free ends of his cravat, filling in with a grey ash the furrows of his cheeks, the hollows of his eye-sockets and the breathless mouth, had hunted this tottering young man of fifty to death.

Pearson, the publisher whose Texas textbook raises questions about the quality of Harlem Renaissance literature, said such language adds more depth and nuance.
By her early 20s, Ditlevsen has married her first editor, a stout, impotent man three decades her senior who prints her work in his small literary journal, a spin on the stable skilled worker her mother imagined as her destiny. (Ditlevsen publishes her first book of poetry, Girl Soul, in 1939, her truth-telling landing her a devoted readership.) But nothing in her memoirs' first two volumes quite prepares you for what's to come. Her third marriage, to a sociopathic doctor who injects her regularly with Demerol — the name sounds like birdsong — nearly kills her. It does kill, for years, her urge to write, the protective membrane of words that has accompanied her since childhood dissolving into chemical oblivion. So unsparingly abject is her rendering of addiction — I frequently found myself having to pause, finger in book, and take a breath — that an episode involving Evelyn Waugh, whom she charms at a literary party before being dragged off humiliatingly by her lunatic husband, has an almost leavening effect.
This is — I mean, this is going to make me very sad to say, but I feel like I had an arc or a relationship with President Obama, where it was inspirational when he won. I was celebrating with my wife in the streets. And then over the years I began to feel like we'd missed a great opportunity. So, I'd say there was some heartbreak attached to that. And I worked with the president afterward, and I still admire him a great deal, but I think we could have done a lot more, and I don't think opportunities like that come along very often.
Dr. Winell was raised by missionary parents in Taiwan whose religion, she says, taught her that she was never good enough as a child. She struggled for years to figure out how to enjoy life, whose pleasures she had been made to feel guilty about.
A VAT (value-added tax) is a tax on consumption, so the burden disproportionately falls on low-income households, who spend a larger portion of their income.
In an essay published by the Gotham Gazette, Kimberly Watkins alleged that Mr. Yang fired her from Manhattan Prep because he did not think she would continue working as hard after getting married. Mr. Yang appeared on The View shortly after and said there was zero truth to Ms. Watkins's account. After publication, Ms. Watkins reached out to the editorial board, noting the question contained an error — she testified before a New York City hearing on pay equity, but, as she wroteto us , I have on multiple occasions drawn contrast to 'pay equity,' with what I experienced, which concerns long term economic stability. The reality that my economic future was destroyed by Yang, right after my marriage, after an unblemished six-year commitment to this company, has been the focus of my story, not pay inequity…Yang's response [also] grossly overstates the investigative process and draws a false conclusion.
JI: Yes. Regulating it heavily and using the revenue to treat gambling addiction. Can you talk through that? You say on your website that you think gambling addiction doesn't get nearly enough attention, and it is a really important issue. How does legalizing gambling, even if you use the revenue, not make that problem worse?
The forced togetherness brought on by the pandemic has caused many relationships to become strained. However, others have found that time in lockdown has strengthened bonds.
Among young people, there was a great deal of sympathy for Harry and Meghan. Among the older generation, it's been very different.
But Rae made it. As she, Lisa, and Naum were leaving the tunnel, Rae latched on to a Jewish youth who was from that area, who knew the countryside. She grabbed his pants and told him he was not going without her family. We're gonna die all together or we're gonna live all together, Rae said. The boy started to cry. He had someone, a gentile woman, who would take him in. But if he brought Rae, and Naum, and Lisa, he feared, she would call the Germans and they would all die. Rae told him that if she called the Germans they would all die together.
It's a good question, because thinking back, there are scenarios where, yeah, we weren't needed. And maybe we shouldn't have gotten the call. But unfortunately —
To me, the economic imbalances are causing many of our other problems. If you look up and down the line, health problems, poor educational attainment and results, even political polarization, they stem from the fact that we have this pervasive financial insecurity where 78 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Almost half can't afford an unexpected $400 or $500 bill. If you can't pay next month's rent, it's very hard to worry about climate change. I come and talk to you and say, Hey, we need to fight climate change. And you look up and say like, I'm worried about next month. Next year, next decade has to wait in line.
Mr. Yang told Vox's Recode that one of the reasons he quit Venture for America, the nonprofit he created, was because he realized it couldn't achieve the change he wanted at the necessary scale. For instance, it had fallen short of the 100,000 jobs he set out for it to create.
3. We have to be more honest with children than ever before.
And what made her, in your words, so beguiling?
I'm not sure. There are certain goals that I have. I want to do a Broadway musical. I want to do a one-man show at some point. But it has to be the right character, the right story for me to get excited about doing that and putting that work in.
Ms. Nguyen said that the calculations that daters are engaging in go beyond physical exposure. You're choosing to be physically vulnerable, physically risking Covid, but you're also being emotionally and mentally vulnerable, by trusting this person and believing what they're saying, she said.
They were and they weren't. Aftershocks knits together the author's own experiences with the histories of some of the places she has lived. She has seen poverty and suffering and civil wars, but always at a remove, while ensconced in the privileged bubble of expat life. She was in high school in Kampala, Uganda, when there was a string of grenade attacks in the city, but she doesn't remember feeling worried. What was the worst we could imagine while watching 'Melrose Place?' she writes. Her view of herself is exacting and remorseless. I did not fear for my life because I knew my life would be protected over the lives of others.
As for the puzzle itself, I gave it a title on the page: Marriage is as easy as … see? and a hint:
The result is not always terrifying. A manipulative, sexually-harassing boss, robbed of work, capers across the desktops of his office, laughing and tossing paper airplanes. A young man who has lived for a long time as an anxious shut-in loses home and finds himself free to explore the world and embrace political causes. It almost seems as if the aliens do their unwitting hosts a favor. The catch is that they plan to exterminate us and take over the planet.
It's every married couple's fantasy, at least in theory: You get to have sex with anyone you want, no questions asked. I'm saying let's both do it, and let's swear to keep our mouths shut about it for the rest of our lives, says the wife in Sarah Dunn's new novel, The Arrangement, as she and her husband devise a little six-month-long adultery program.
Ms. Chase was one of a number of correspondents hired by network and local television news departments — along with Connie Chung, Cassie Mackin, Marya McLaughlin, Virginia Sherwood, Lesley Stahl and others — at a time when women were striving to be taken seriously and to defy being typecast as eye candy for male viewers.

Yes, our progress has been uneven. The work of democracy has always been hard. It has been contentious. Sometimes it has been bloody. For every two steps forward, it often feels we take one step back. But the long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all, and not just some.
I love work, and the numbers also clearly show that people need work. Men in particular, without work, they volunteer less than employed men. So think about that for a second. They have higher rates of substance abuse, their health deteriorates, all these social ills accompany. Of course, we need to create jobs in as many communities as possible.
They started dating in 2017; by April of that year, they were a couple, splitting their time between his house in Morinville and hers in St. Albert.
No, no, no. The question being, did race play a factor in this? Not, was he killed because they sought out —
This is not just a timely topic but a timeless one. (Kathy Bates's Joan Blondell points this out in one of the show's 1978 interview segments: Any film starring women that makes money will be treated as a fluke by the Boys Club.) We're seeing a situation like that right now with Hidden Figures, the best picture nominee that is still in theaters months after it opened and has box-office receipts far exceeding those of X-Men: Apocalypse and Star Trek Beyond, according to a recent report by The Wrap. Will the success of Hidden Figures be treated as a fluke? Or will it spur a paradigm shift in terms of business decisions? Money talks. The Boys Club would do well to listen.
KK: I think Mara's going to kick you off.
The events of last year, both 'honor killings' that got national attention and the #MeToo movement in Iran, have increased the pressure on the government to push this bill that was in the making for almost a decade, said Tara Sepehri Far, a researcher for Human Rights Watch based in New York, referring to the murders of women by male relatives for supposedly shaming their families, even if the women themselves were victims of sexual violence.
East Asian communities around the state are celebrating, with parades, festivals and family gatherings at home. (Here's a list of events in Southern California, and one for the Bay Area.)
Even Isaac Hecker, who had misgivings about infallibility during the Vatican Council, accepted it later as an assertion of the external dignity of the church, which could now be ideally complemented by a full development of its internal or intellectual life.
Both noticed how well they worked together as colleagues, and a friendship began between Mr. Desai, a Mumbai native who left his homeland to live abroad at 20, and a self-described California girl. As she got to know him, Ms. Umeda started to confide in Mr. Desai about the difficulties in her marriage.
The defense and prosecution agreed on a judge rather than a jury trial.
Mr. Yang founded Venture for America, a fellowship program for recent college graduates, in 2011, with the goal of creating 100,000 new jobs in the country's most underresourced cities. As of 2019, the nonprofit has created around 3,500 jobs.
This is just all recent. This is all very recent, Mr. Trump said, pointing to the illicit exhibit in front of him. Mr. Trump was not shy about his disgust for the illegal goods: It looks pretty brutal. This is not a manufactured deal, as you say. This is the real stuff.

The pope's doctor has died of Covid-19 complications. Pope Francis with Dr. Fabrizio Soccorsi right, his personal physician, in an undated photo. Credit... Osservatore Romano, via EPA/Shutterstock Pope Francis's personal physician, Dr. Fabrizio Soccorsi, died on Saturday as a result of the coronavirus, the Vatican said. Dr. Soccorsi, 78, had been in hospitalized at the Gemelli Hospital in Rome and was being treated for cancer, but died because of complications from Covid-19, according to Vatican News, the Vatican's online news portal. Francis selected Dr. Soccorsi to be his personal physician in 2015. Dr. Soccorsi specialized in internal medicine, and served for a time as the chairman of the hepatology department at the San Camillo Hospital in Rome. He also taught immunology at the Rome and Lazio Region Medical School. The Vatican newspaper, l'Osservatore Romano, wrote in an obituary published on Saturday that Dr. Soccorsi had been profoundly affected, by the premature death of his daughter, Cristiana, in June 2017. Social distancing measures and other pandemic safety protocols were imposed in Vatican City in March. Since then, several senior church figures, including cardinals, have tested positive for the virus. In all, twenty-seven residents of Vatican City, out of a total population of roughly 800, have tested positive, according to a New York Times database. In a television interview scheduled for broadcast in Italy Sunday evening, the pope said he would be vaccinated as soon as this week, and he called on everyone to get vaccinated when possible, calling it an ethical choice to do so.
If you look at our proposals, we have a tax on financial transactions, which would obviously end up falling most heavily on the wealthiest Americans and the wealthiest companies. We have a carbon tax, which tends to fall most heavily on the wealthiest industries, which are emitting a lot. The value-added tax would obviously be enormously generative from people who benefit from society and consume the most. I'm for trying to restore our income tax levels to previous levels to be more progressive.

Ms. Rense was known as a highly competitive, sometimes spiteful tastemaker who insisted on exclusivity and brooked no pushback from designers she had snubbed. Those who crossed her were often said to be banned forever from the magazine's pages.
The first story takes place in 1812, when Napoleon was battling the czar for control of the Pale of Settlement (the western part of czarist Russia), where millions of Jews were forced to live in crowded poverty and under persecution and discrimination as second-class subjects. A victory for Napoleon held the promise of prosperity, first-class citizenship, freedom of movement, and an end to discrimination and persecution. A victory for the czar would keep the Jews impoverished and miserable. The great Hasidic rabbi Shneur Zalman--the founder of the Lubavitch dynasty--stood up in his synagogue on the first day of Rosh Hashanah to offer a prayer to God asking help for the leader whose victory would be good for the Jews. Everyone expected him to pray for Napoleon. But he prayed for the czar to defeat Napoleon. In explaining his counterintuitive choice, he said: Should Bonaparte win, the wealth of the Jews will be increased and their [civic] position will be raised. At the same time their hearts will be estranged from our Heavenly Father. Should however our Czar Alexander win, the Jewish hearts will draw nearer to our Heavenly Father, though the poverty of Israel may become greater and his position lower.
He's right, of course. Women in politics have long been subjected to much closer scrutiny than men; in 1917, the first female member of Congress, Jeannette Rankin, took office and The Washington Post ran an article headlined: Congresswoman Rankin Real Girl; Likes Nice Gowns and Tidy Hair.
Offill's whittled narrative bursts are apt vessels for the daily experience of scale-shifting they document — the vertigo of moving between the claustrophobia of domestic discontent and the impossibly vast horizon of global catastrophe. This fragmented form is weirdly well-suited to both melodrama and plotlessness: In Dept. of Speculation, it allowed Offill to narrate marital infidelity, which can easily verge into soap opera, with an oblique, devastating grace — its searing shards summoning the sensation of holding a hot saucepan for just a moment, before it burns the skin off your fingers. Offill's agent once described that book as an X-ray rather than a novel, but in Weather we have something like an inverted X-ray: a narrative that illuminates not the obvious bones of the story but its unexpected details; not the bold lines of your femurs but the detritus in your pockets — the crumpled receipts, the pacifier dropped on the sidewalk, the key whose lock you can't remember. These bits and bobs highlight the feeling of daily life, but their mundane silhouettes are backlit by something more like a nuclear explosion.
And that's probably a generous response. Some of the responses would be worse than that. So if you get the boot off people's throats, then you can start making progress on our health, on our educational outcomes, on our political polarization.
I think you use a broad brush. When I first took over in Florida — the union, when I was first elected as a president — I lost members, because I refused to lie for them to try to keep their jobs.

I think he meets just about every conventional definition of dictator. Yes.
He won that election, and then another in 2014. But Dianne Bentley filed for divorce the next year. Months later, an ousted state official accused Mr. Bentley of having an affair with Rebekah Caldwell Mason, a top aide and former beauty pageant contestant whom he had taught in Sunday school in Tuscaloosa. Lurid audio recordings became public, and on Friday, a special counsel concluded that the governor had committed an array of misdeeds to try to cover up the inappropriate relationship that had led to Mr. Bentley and Ms. Mason leaving their congregation.
Mr. Weinstein's lawyers have long made it clear that they intend to discredit his accusers by focusing on emails that suggest the producer's relationship with the women was consensual and had lasted long after the alleged crimes.
In his six years in the Senate, Cory Booker has progressed from a moderate who defended private equity to a leading progressive voice on issues like criminal justice reform and marijuana legalization. As he transitions to a national presidential campaign, which he announced Friday, the candidate has been focusing on some key issues that animate the left wing of the Democratic Party.
Young couples, thankfully, did not heed that panicky call to preserve issei purity. As Professor Williams told me, Japanese-Americans marry out far more than other Asian-Americans. In the 2010 census, more than 460,000 of 1.3 million Japanese-Americans identified themselves as multiracial. The trend puts Japanese-Americans on the brink of becoming the first Asian-American group that is mostly racially mixed.
Those remarks didn't have the effect he intended. Some African-Americans accused him of equating very different kinds of discrimination, and polls show that his support from black Democrats remains abysmal. When they appraise Buttigieg, they notice a whole lot beyond his sexual orientation, including worrisome friction between him and some black residents of South Bend and a path of extraordinary privilege (Harvard, a Rhodes scholarship, a job with McKinsey) that brought him to this point.
That's a fun exercise, too. I haven't gotten into the judicial appointment shortlist yet, but safeguarding women's reproductive rights would be one clear criteria. Because women's reproductive rights are fundamental human rights in my mind.
Donor recruiting is a growing challenge, said Scott Brown, vice president of strategic alliances for California Cryobank. And I would definitely say people are still very interested in having children.
So why is your Carpetbagger in no mood to celebrate?
There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and the tired. — F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby
Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart, he said. Yet hear me clearly — disagreement must not lead to disunion.
I'm a little worried that there's going to be too much content. And by having too much content, the bar of high-end storytelling will be dropped because they need more product on these platforms. Yeah, they'll just say, that's good. Bring it in. We need it, we need it, we need it. Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on. On the other side, that kind of thirst for product gives unproven writers or new writers a chance to shine. And there will be exceptional writers that will come out of that. And like my experience on a soap opera, they will say, well, I'm doing this kid's series on Disney+. And it's not tremendously challenging, but man, it started my career. I think what you'll see is the further erosion of broadcast television and the platform scenario, that when you turn on a television, it'll all be just platform. It'll be like, you have to go to Warner Media. And then you go, oh, let's go to HBO.
I mean, that is what I heard. And one of the biggest things that I took out of all the videos that I watched and everything was the word de-escalation — that officers need to learn how to de-escalate. Valid points. But I guess to answer your question, I think I heard what the protesters were saying. I don't disagree with the protesters. I want everybody to be able to say and be able to tell their kid, when we're not there to protect you, that man in uniform is. Go to him. And at the end of the day, that's what we need to get to. That's why I became a cop.
Our founding fathers created a system of government of men, not of angels, Gephardt said, his face reddening with emotion as he spoke.No one standing in this House today can pass a puritanical test of purity that some are demanding that our elected leaders take. If we demand that mere mortals live up to this standard, we will see our seats of government lay empty and we will see the best, most able people unfairly cast out of public service.
Here is a selection of a few of our favorite Will you marry me? moments we learned about from couples who married in 2020.
The film, shot in black-and-white for $2.5 million, was a hit, earning more than $30 million. But when Tatum O'Neal was nominated for an Oscar and her father wasn't, it created tension. In the press, he played the doting father, she wrote in A Paper Life, her 2004 memoir. But in his eyes, I read the truth: deep resentment that his own brilliant performance was being dismissed. (O'Neal declined to comment for this article.)
Cuba has also weathered the collapse of the Soviet Union, its main Cold War benefactor, and a slew of traumatic internal ructions including the Mariel boatlift in 1980 and the Cuban raft exodus in 1994. Last but not least, Cuba has managed its first major political transitions, following the death in 2016 of its defining leader, Fidel Castro; the presidential retirement, last year, of his younger brother, Raúl Castro; and Raúl's succession in office by Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, a 58-year-old Communist Party loyalist.
Mark, at the start of this conversation, you promised that you would tell us why all this matters beyond the human drama, and what it reveals about Britain. So here's your chance.
Anyone with a notion to map the vastness of human error could start here and never find an end.
Mr. Yang has been critical of China's increasingly authoritarian behavior and told the Council on Foreign Relations the United States must in reply demonstrate a model for democratic capitalism.
Years later, she wrote, when a mutual friend gave Williams a copy of the manuscript for 'Where Are the Children?,' which had just sold to Simon & Schuster, his comment was, 'I have a lot of friends who can write better than that,' so I guess I didn't fascinate him either. We'll call it a draw.'
We've been around a long time, and we're seeing what's happening with all the other candidates, said Mr. Trachtenburg, who said he'd previously supported Mr. Biden. They're eliminating themselves.
How were Mr. Bezos's texts released into the wild? Was his phone hacked? If so, why was he not using encryption? If he did protect his online selfies, did someone somehow get screenshots of them and send them around until one of the recipients dropped a dime to The Enquirer? If so, is anyone safe?
This week brings some serious-minded nonfiction (Wall Street wrongdoing, covert wars, depression) and meaty fiction (an epic bildungsroman, border wars, a multigenerational immigrant saga) with a glamorous dose of diverting memoir from the actress and biographer Patricia Bosworth. Plus, a new book from Kevin Wilson, author of the beloved 2011 novel, The Family Fang. I'm especially heartened by the ambitious sweep of this week's best fiction. There is nothing scaled-back or slight about the stories these writers set out to tell.
The league, which had been carefully noncommittal about its future with Beckham and Miami since hosting a similar event with him here in 2014, did little to disguise its excitement this time around. It passed out hundreds of tickets for the lunchtime announcement in a concert hall at the Adrienne Arsht Center, an event with pounding music, enthusiastic celebrity testimonial videos, Las Vegas-style showgirls and boisterous chants from members of the Southern Legion, a local soccer supporters' group that, until Monday, had no team. There was even confetti.
Mankind is divisible into two great classes: hosts and guests. — Max Beerbohm There are two kinds of people in this world: those who know where their high school yearbook is and those who do not. — Sloane Crosley, I Was Told There'd Be Cake
KK: So let's get into it. We have about 90 minutes together. In your assessment, what are the policy breakdowns that lead to Americans still being hungry today?
Her first film with him, and her fourth overall, was Les Cousins in 1959, and many others followed, including Les Biches in 1968, Just Before Nightfall in 1971 and Violette Nozière in 1978.
Running a successful arts nonprofit is difficult, even in a boom economy.
Mr. Yang's comments, on Mr. Gillis and on judgment more broadly, contribute to a growing conversation among political and cultural figures about the merits and downsides of cancel culture. Former President Obama, for example, spoke out about the prevalence of call-out culture during an interview in October, arguing that criticizing people on social media for not being woke enough is not activism and not bringing about change.
Another elusive yet important issue for a project of this kind is the question of the relationship between truth and intellectual respectability. The convert intellectuals were aware, in many cases, that what they believed to be true was not regarded by non-Catholics as plausible or reasonable or, indeed, respectable. On some points both groups could agree, of course, and the convert writers' intention was to make a closer fit between Catholic truth and intellectual respectability. At any given moment in the era from about 1825 to 1962, Catholic intellectuals knew that a range of ideas was considered respectable in the two nations. They also knew that some Catholic ideas sat comfortably inside this area and others remained well beyond its boundaries. Their job, as they saw it, was to drag the recalcitrant Catholics into the realm of the respectable, while trying to shift the zone of respectable ideas in the society at large, in order that Catholic truth and respectable ideas might coincide more fully. They wanted to convince Protestant and atheist contemporaries that much of their work was in error or based on fallacious premises, encouraging them to become more Catholic and more intellectually respectable.
Let's say I'm on food stamps, and I've got a 15-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. I'm concerned about their future, very, very deeply. And then Andrew Yang becomes president, and I find out that my 15-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month starting at age 18 for the rest of his life, and my 12-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month for the rest of her life. I'm going to say, wow. That's actually the biggest value gain I've ever even heard of in history. My kid will have a financial literacy class in high school, the first semester of their senior year. It is impossible to teach financial literacy to someone who does not have money. So the kids will actually learn about what to do with the money before they start getting the money.
BS: Remember The New Yorker cartoon?
Obviously, there is one company that is spending more than the others, but that's not going to affect how I will vote — nor do I think it will affect other members, said Hawk Koch, a producer and former president of the academy, who recently wrote a memoir about his long career in Hollywood. There is an awful lot of wasteful money being spent that could be used for making movies rather than trying to win an award.
The world community, including the United States, has rightly condemned the intentional destruction of cultural heritage for decades. Hitler's Germany, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Islamic State and the Assad regime in Syria intentionally destroyed cultural heritage in the absence of any military necessity. If Mr. Trump carries out this threat, the United States will join the ranks of these destroyers of the world's cultural legacy.
I won't spoil that bit here but now you know where to find it. It was my stealthy way of making sure my dad was at my wedding after all.
Hadn't he said the right thing that one time? That was what he meant.

In November 2012, Linda Zang was on her way to her first date with Patricia Marie Reville at Kitchen Zinc, a pizza restaurant in New Haven, Conn. They had matched on the dating website OkCupid, and Ms. Zang, who was a law student at Yale at the time, picked out the restaurant for their first date. There was only one problem — Ms. Reville, who goes by Tricia, had just let her know that she was at the wrong restaurant.
All the things that made her exciting to young people made her to older Brits more of a threat to the fabric of the royal family, a family they revere as embodying the best of Britain and the greatest times in British history.
He's right, of course. Women in politics have long been subjected to much closer scrutiny than men; in 1917, the first female member of Congress, Jeannette Rankin, took office and The Washington Post ran an article headlined: Congresswoman Rankin Real Girl; Likes Nice Gowns and Tidy Hair.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's Future of Education and Skills 2030 project is exploring the ways education systems internationally need to change to prepare students for a rapidly automating economy.
What will matter most in marriage is what's possible on the other side of love's first blush: conversations that are rewarding, intimate and real. It's not that we come together in electric recognition and pure understanding, then fall away from that through conflict. Rather, we come together in a rush of passion, then we achieve love through continuing conversation.
Mr. Yang has said most Americans don't want to work for the federal government and argued that his Freedom Dividend would therefore be more effective than a program like a federal jobs guarantee.
Elizabeth Knox's THE ABSOLUTE BOOK (Viking, $28) contains multitudes, spanning the geographies of Canada, Britain and New Zealand; the cosmologies of fairies, demons and angels; and the genres of thriller, domestic realism and epic fantasy.
One Monday in 2014, Christopher Justin Hanson sat down for a job interview at the headquarters of Covington & Burling, a law firm in Washington. As the interviewer, who was stationed in front of windows overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue, thumbed through Mr. Hanson's résumé, he noticed that Mr. Hanson didn't have any experience in Washington. Mr. Hanson lived in Wisconsin at the time. Why, the interviewer asked, did Mr. Hanson want to start practicing in Washington?
In her 25 years of marriage to Jeff Bezos, MacKenzie Bezos has been a loyal ambassador for Amazon, the company that made her and her husband the richest couple in the world.
That's why something like world data organization is so vital. When they had to join the W.T.O. [World Trade Organization], they realized this was going to be vital to their economic growth, so they're going to have to make some decisions and compromises in order to join the world order. We can create an analogous situation for data and technology and then use that to try and curb some of their worst abuses and behaviors. Now, is this going to happen in time to help Hong Kong? I certainly hope so. I mean, I certainly hope that they don't flood the streets of Hong Kong with troops any time in the next number of days or weeks.
The decision to move ahead with the bill — which, if approved, will be the first law of its kind in Iran's penal code — comes in the aftermath of a groundbreaking #MeToo movement and shocking reports of so-called honor killings that have gripped the public over the past six months.
Its customers were the real departure from the routine, for they were almost exclusively the new male dandies invented by the 1960s, a taboo-breaking mixture of social and rock aristocracy as never encountered before, Richard Lester wrote in Boutique London: King's Road to Carnaby Street (2010).
A few hours after the vote, Clinton, surrounded by Democrats, walked into the South Lawn of the White House, his wife, Hillary, on his arm, to pre-empt calls for his resignation. The man who in better days had debated where he would stand in the pantheon of American Presidents said he would stay in office and vowed to go on from here to rise above the rancor, to overcome the pain and division, to be a repairer of the breach. Later, Clinton called off the bombing in Iraq, declaring the mission accomplished.
The country boy led the Kushners to the farmhouse, where the owner recognized them from the fur store. She gave them bread, water, and onions, but ushered them on their way, afraid the Germans would kill her if she was discovered hiding Jews. Another group, coming after Rae and Lisa and Naum and the farmer boy, prevailed on the woman to let them stay. All eight of them, including the Polish woman and her husband, were killed when the Nazis discovered them.
This work was through Mr. Yang's nonprofit, Venture for America. More on that in a bit.
BA: So a Republican would say that alternative is to let markets work. Is that what makes you a Democrat — you don't think the market will create enough jobs for Americans?
KK: I want to move on to some other questions, but I actually have one last for you, which is why run as a Democratic versus a Republican if you have such bipartisan issues?
He has a backbone of steel. He has a tremendous amount of empathy and he seeks the better angels in humankind, said Valerie Biden Owens, Mr. Biden's sister and closest political adviser. His word is his bond.
Lena Dunham reviews Meg Wolitzer's The Female Persuasion for this week's cover. Five years ago, Liesl Schillinger reviewed The Interestings and considered Wolitzer's place in American fiction. Below is an excerpt.
In the warrants, the police suggested that Mr. Mawhinney helped provide what they say was a false alibi to Mr. Dulos, who has been charged with murder and kidnapping. They also linked Mr. Mawhinney to that potential grave site.
KK: Do you believe in government subsidies for journalism?
JI: Sure. But to Binya's point, it's still a trade-off. So, if I'm on food stamps, I'm getting less of a benefit than, say, Jesse, who's not on food stamps.
It's a question that kept coming to mind as I read My War Criminal: Personal Encounters With an Architect of Genocide, Jessica Stern's mystifying account of her conversations with Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader who was convicted in 2016 of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, and is serving a life sentence in prison at The Hague. Stern, a scholar of terrorism and trauma who served on President Bill Clinton's National Security Council, conducted 12 interviews with Karadzic over the course of two years — making hers the first such study, she says, of a leader tried for war crimes at an international tribunal since the Nazis were evaluated at Nuremberg.
Proust's father, Adrien, thirty-five years old when Marcel was born, came from a far more humble background, though he rose to great heights in the medical profession. His father had been a grocer in Illiers (the name is derived from that of Saint Hilaire), a village near the cathedral town of Chartres, south of Paris; Marcel gave the village the name of Combray, and today it is known officially as Illiers-Combray and has become a major goal for Proust pilgrims from all over the world. (The local bakeries are all grinding out madeleines in Proust's honor, and the house where he and his family summered has become a museum. Perhaps in another century the name Illiers will be dropped altogether as life completely surrenders to the tyranny of art.)
No, certainly not before the statements had taken place, and in terms of consequences, I would suggest that someone like Shane had probably paid a price in many ways. Like, aside from being fired, there are many circles that, if he shows up in, he'd be labeled very, very negatively. He reached out to me personally, and I had a conversation with him. The conversation with him made me feel more confident that I'd done the right thing. Because I think in many cases we're trying to follow up on a sense of shame and humiliation that the person might already feel.
In Search of Jewish Identity for the Next Century
In a December 2018 paper, When Work Disappears: Manufacturing Decline and the Falling Marriage Market Value of Men, Autor, David Dorn, an economist at the University of Zurich, and Gordon Hanson, an economist at the University of California-San Diego, argue that adverse trade shocks, like a surge of imports from China, differentially reduce employment and earnings of young adult males, reduce marriage and fertility, heighten male idleness and premature mortality, and raise the share of mothers who are unwed and the share of children living in below-poverty, single-headed households.
Recent Bollywood movies have tried out, hesitantly and conservatively, versions of the Modern Woman: Heroines can have careers; they can live alone in the big city; they can even (if very rarely) have sex before marriage.
But the general trend bore the range of intellectually respectable ideas steadily away from religion in general and Catholicism in particular. This trend, often labeled secularization, appeared for decades to be unstoppable, so that many convert intellectuals, far from reversing its momentum, found their own views gradually moving outside the realm of what other intellectuals considered plausible. The consequence was marginalization, and convert intellectuals in general lost influence with the passing decades, so that none in the twentieth century could have an effect on his or her non-Catholic contemporaries to match that of Newman and Brownson in the mid-nineteenth. Certain writers, such as Chesterton or Christopher Dawson, could still find admirers, but neither created a major school of thought, and non-Catholic admirers saw their religion as a colorful aberration rather than a central element in their work. In that sense this book is the history of a momentous and protracted failure.
That'd be my first question if I got in there, I'd be, All right, let me see them. Let's see what we've been hiding all of these years.
We're preparing as though we're going to go in the next hour, he said. Both Mr. Raskin and Mr. Castro declined to offer details about when the impeachment article against Mr. Trump would be brought to the Senate or whether Democrats would push to call witnesses in the trial. No witnesses were called in Mr. Trump's first impeachment trial, which unfolded last year while the chamber was controlled by Republicans. Democrats will control the Senate for this second trial. The remarks by Democrats defending the impeachment effort came as Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, wrote a letter to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, calling for a vote to dismiss the article of impeachment. Mr. Graham argued that a trial after Mr. Trump's departure was unconstitutional and would further divide the country. In an interview on Fox News's Sunday Morning Futures, Mr. Graham also called the strategy insane on every level and urged President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. to call on members of his party to change course. If you don't stand up against the impeachment of Donald Trump after he leaves office, you're an incredibly weak figure in American history, Mr. Graham said, directly addressing Mr. Biden. He also claimed, without further explanation, that Mr. Trump was trying to heal the nation.
Nominating American Factory was the equivalent of sending an Oscar invitation to Barack and Michelle Obama. The former president and first lady have a multiyear production deal with Netflix, and American Factory, produced with Participant Media, was their first release.
I mean, to answer your question, no. I don't think so. And I don't know how you could — I mean, other than we are in the climate that we're in today — how you draw that.
In her illustrated story collection Boundless, Jillian Tamaki flips the script: To read the first and last of her kooky and elegant tales, you often must rotate the book 90 degrees. The stories' subjects — an eerie mirror Facebook; a promotional pitch for a skin care product — unfold with a deliciously wry feminist slant.
The phone rang. It was Johnny Mac, a.k.a. Detective Sergeant John Macatitch. My colleague in Homicide, who has since made squad supervisor. A great guy and a hell of a detective.
Rory didn't try to fix the situation or talk it away, Ms. Carryer said. She was just there for me, and when that happened I thought, 'This is the person I want to go through the hard times with.'
The cause was heart failure, Jeff Ballard, a family spokesman, said.
Hundreds of differences — some subtle, others extensive — emerged in a New York Times analysis of eight commonly used American history textbooks in California and Texas, two of the nation's largest markets.

Aldo Parisot, a renowned cellist who toured the world as a soloist and settled into a career as an eminent teacher that included a 60-year tenure at the Yale School of Music, died on Saturday at his home in Guilford, Conn. He was 100.
Her conviction (she was jailed briefly) infuriated her and prompted her to take the college equivalency exam and enroll in law school. She didn't get her law degree, but acting as her own lawyer she successfully appealed her conviction.
Ms. Saah said that having to ask questions about another person's comfort level has forced many of us to consider what consent means. If you have to ask whether a hug is OK, or whether you can take off your mask, you learn to honor your own boundaries and other people's, she said. We're getting so much practice that we weren't getting.
The process requires not just lawyers and accountants but valuation experts who assess the worth of assets like closely held family businesses.
She said she objected to students being taught that homosexuality is normal and natural and feared that the anti-bullying resolution would mean inviting homosexual-advocacy organizations into our schools to promote their agenda to our vulnerable youth, according to The New Yorker.
Campaign staff members for Mr. Bloomberg before the rally at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on Tuesday.
The converts' position was doubly difficult because the Catholic Church received them with mixed feelings, an uneasy blend of gratitude and disdain. Catholic bishops were understandably glad that brilliant and influential men and women had decided that Rome represented the one true church, and delighted to learn that they were willing to put their skills at the service of Catholicism. But the bishops soon discovered that converts, intellectually adventurous and unused to clerical censorship, were likely to take speculative excursions that challenged orthodoxy rather than fortifying it. One part of the history of these converts is, accordingly, the story of conflicts with their bishops over what was or was not intellectually permissible. Newman, whose superiors often viewed him with suspicion for his ideas on the development of doctrine, the role of the laity, and the nature of religious certainty, once told Lord Acton that in the hierarchy's view all converts are dangerous. His fellow Oxford convert Richard Simpson, coeditor of the Rambler, the leading liberal Catholic journal of the mid-nineteenth century, had a long succession of conflicts with the hierarchy, which threatened to close the journal down as a hazard to the religion of the faithful. Isaac Hecker, the American Transcendentalist and Brook Farm communard who converted in 1844, also ran into official disapproval when his book Aspirations of Nature (1857) appeared to maintain that by nature human beings were good, minimizing the power of original sin, and hence the need for grace, well beyond what his superiors found admissible.
This paradoxical antiquity and novelty of Catholicism was complemented by another paradox: the converts' sense that Catholicism was both different from their former faiths and yet also very similar. They accepted their new faith as adults, having spent their youth and years of education outside the Catholic fold. In many cases a long intellectual preparation for conversion took place within other churches. The best-known British convert, John Henry Newman, for example, converted from Anglicanism at the age of forty-four after more than two decades of study and writing in Patristics. For many years he believed that the church Fathers were the precursors of Anglicanism, but at last in 1845, he admitted to himself that if they pointed in any direction, it was to Rome. Conversion changed his explicit allegiance and had immense consequences for the course of his life, but it did not overturn his pattern of thinking. The continuities in his thought before and after conversion are in many ways more striking than the discontinuities. The same was true a generation later of G. K. Chesterton, who converted at the age of forty-six. His book Orthodoxy (1908), written while he was still an Anglican, became a favorite among his Catholic admirers, who in this way acknowledged the continuity. Intellectually, then, conversion was often incremental, but institutionally (as well as perceptually, to outside observers), the jump was immense, from the establishment into the wilderness.
But it has also held up a mirror to our society, reflecting in its deadly wake, resource gaps and medical disparities, the inequality we've allowed to calcify. Science at its core is a social phenomenon. It is a reflection of people, of our relationships and of our institutions. When we provide inputs to the algorithm, when we program the device, when we design, test and research, we are making human choices, choices that bring our social world to bear in a new and powerful way. It matters who makes these choices. The science behind climate change is not a hoax. The science behind the virus is not partisan. The same laws apply. The same evidence holds true regardless of whether or not you accept them. And President-elect Biden and I will not only listen to science, we will invest in it. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris introduced key members of their White House science team on Saturday. Credit Credit... Amr Alfiky/The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Saturday that he was always going to lead with science and truth as he announced top science and technology officials on his White House staff, reaffirming trust in the kind of expert research that the Trump administration often ignored or disdained. Extolling what he called some of the most brilliant minds in the world, Mr. Biden said his new team's mission would be to ask: How can we make the impossible possible?
Given the constraints (not to mention the time sensitivity), I enlisted my friend and genius constructor Joon Pahk, who agreed to help me actualize my lofty idea. He would make the grid and I would do the cluing.
If you're among the hundreds of thousands of Californians ushering in the Year of the Pig this week, happy New Year!
So, right now, the government is like this flopping appendage behind a lot of this stuff. I mean, honestly. The Office of Technology Assessment was eliminated in 1995. So our legislature is literally 24 years behind the curve on technology, and they don't understand. They're totally outgunned. They don't know what's going on.
In an essay published by the Gotham Gazette, Kimberly Watkins alleged that Mr. Yang fired her from Manhattan Prep because he did not think she would continue working as hard after getting married. Mr. Yang appeared on The View shortly after and said there was zero truth to Ms. Watkins's account. After publication, Ms. Watkins reached out to the editorial board, noting the question contained an error — she testified before a New York City hearing on pay equity, but, as she wroteto us , I have on multiple occasions drawn contrast to 'pay equity,' with what I experienced, which concerns long term economic stability. The reality that my economic future was destroyed by Yang, right after my marriage, after an unblemished six-year commitment to this company, has been the focus of my story, not pay inequity…Yang's response [also] grossly overstates the investigative process and draws a false conclusion.
So the same forces that pushed for Britain to leave the E.U., and are now craving its greatest symbols of nationalism in the form of the monarchy, they are the same forces who have inflicted all of this on Meghan and on Harry. And perhaps driven them to leave the monarchy, to weaken the monarchy. It's a, perhaps, classic case of getting what you wanted until you realize that it's not really what you wanted.
Among young people, there was a great deal of sympathy for Harry and Meghan. Among the older generation, it's been very different.
Appearing in the fourth episode of Bridgerton, the first series produced by Shonda Rhimes as part of her powerhouse Netflix deal, this conversation between the show's main Black characters is the first explicit mention of race in a story that revolves around the duke, a Black man named Simon Basset (Regé-Jean Page), and his passionate courtship of Daphne (Phoebe Dynevor), the eldest daughter in the wealthy, white and titled Bridgerton family.
Donald Trump may not have terrific micro values, but I think he has terrific macro values, Mr. Prager said.
If Created Equal is trying to promote the conservative cause, it does so gently, and blandly. The only moment of mild discomfort occurs when the filmmakers ask Thomas about the end of his first marriage. The otherwise voluble Thomas signals that he'll be having none of it, turning momentarily awkward and taciturn: Yeah, it was, you know, you live with it.
After earning a third freestyle relay medal — his second gold — at the 2008 Beijing Games, Keller walked away for good. Having finally earned his bachelor's degree, he married and started a family. Once again, at least outwardly, he appeared to be moving forward with ease.
This rang true even for young local voters, who in the week leading up to the inauguration described feeling elated. Jean Peterson, a paralegal in Denver who turns 26 this week, described watching Mr. Polis's November victory speech with her girlfriend, tears in her eyes.
I sure enough ate my share, said Mr. Hereford, 31, who grew up Charlottesville, Va., before moving to New Orleans in 2008 and working his way from line cook to chef de cuisine at Coquette, a respected contemporary Southern bistro. But it wasn't until I came to this city of po' boys that I began to consider the creative potential of a sandwich.
For the first time since 1959, in other words, Cuba is ruled by someone other than a Castro, and it has handled the transition without the drama or bloodshed that many other revolutionary states have experienced after the death of their patriarchs.
In Breaking Bad, you play a law-abiding chemistry teacher who decides to cook meth to provide for his family. In Your Honor, you play an incredibly upstanding judge, and you subvert the law to save your son. The shift to subversion was rather quick for this judge.

Johnny Mac and myself pulled up in the unmarked. Whitman Avenue. Detached and semidetached residences on a wide tree-lined street: An academic dormitory on the edge of the Twenty-Seven. I climbed out in my stretch pants and my low pumps.
Let me explain. I'm a parent. I've got — how many of you all are parents? So if your kids are like my kids, they are mesmerized by any screen that is nearby. I regularly challenge my kids. I say, What's more important? People or screens? And they know the right answer's people. And then if they say screens, then I hold them upside down by their ankles until they say, People, people. And the people that are most diligent about screen time are the tech folks in Silicon Valley. You go there, and all of a sudden there's not a screen to be had because they know that we have the smartest engineers in the country turning supercomputers into dopamine delivery devices for kids, because that's how they make their millions of dollars.
The idea that moral hypocrisy hurts you among evangelical voters is not true, if you're sound on all of the fundamentals, said Wayne Flynt, an ordained Baptist minister and one of Alabama's pre-eminent historians. Being sound on the fundamentals depends on what the evangelical community has decided the fundamentals have become. At this time, what is fundamental is hating liberals, hating Obama, hating abortion and hating same-sex marriage.
Wow, I love this question. There are many causes of poverty, and the fact that we're not able to put food into people's houses and on their tables is a structural problem. My campaign's based upon the premise that we're going through this profound economic transformation, the fourth industrial revolution. And one of the major problems is that we still pretend we're in the economy of the '70s or '80s.
The Trachtenburgs had not seen the partial results from Iowa, having left home for the rally before the early numbers were released. I really feel there's going to be an upset, Ms. Trachtenburg said. I think Bloomberg has more than a fighting chance, and judging by tonight, she added, motioning to the crowd behind her, we're not the only ones who feel that way.
Still, accessibility and affordability are helping DNA-based travel take off, according to Sarah Enelow-Snyder, an assistant editor at the travel research company Skift. You can buy one for less than $100, and it's a price that has helped propel the popularity of these trips, she said.
We sought out couples' therapy, twice, but were no more able to communicate past our language and cultural barriers than we had been before. We still didn't have the tools to address the imbalance of power that resulted from his being dependent on me for financial and visa support. He resented being reliant on me and, truthfully, I resented it too. I wanted an equal partner, someone I could depend on, someone who would share the load.
When the prosecutors appealed, they argued, with a straight face, that what had happened to J.T. was so outrageous and illegal that the New Orleans district attorney could not be held responsible. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court.
According to a 2017 profile in The New Yorker, Ms. Gabbard led a protest in 2004 against a bill to legalize civil unions for same-sex couples. That year she also spoke in the State House against a measure to combat anti-gay bullying in schools.

Now, the building's storied history also includes La Sirena, chef Mario Batali's first New York restaurant in a decade. Since it's in a hotel, and because we have this magnificent location, it will function as the piazza at the center of a small town, says Batali, who hopes the restaurant and bar becomes a bustling hive of activity. You can have breakfast here, lunch here, late-night snack here. It's kind of a cross between Lupa and Babbo — and yet available in a much wider and more recognizable way, he says, citing two of his high-end Manhattan establishments. Food-style wise, it's kind of like a trattoria.
MC: So, and we are currently enjoying a businessmen president who has no experience in government or the military.

Before his accident, he was often the life of the party, cajoling friends into dance competitions. He designed an obstacle course for my birthday, made a glow-in-the-dark hula hoop to use at our annual big group camping trips and organized 10 grown men to dance to Beyoncé's Single Ladies for my bachelorette party. Now he tired easily in social situations and would nap in a quiet room or sit with his eyes closed in the corner.

KK: But access to college is still a civil rights issue in this country.
AY: Yeah. And I will say on a personal level, I spent seven years recruiting some of our top educational products to Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis. So I have seen that essentially the tide has turned in the direction it's gone and we should not be relying upon the government as the primary employer of a lot of this tech talent. We have to face facts and say, at this point, most of the intellectual capital is being attracted to these private firms and we need to instead try and support and work with the private firms.
So, that to me was the biggest missed opportunity in the Obama administration, and it happened very, very early on. I wish that they owned and reflected a little bit on the fact that maybe they could have done some things differently at that stage, because we're still angry. This country is still angry. I was so shocked by what happened in the financial crisis, I quit my job and started a national nonprofit and ran it for seven years. I had — my wife was pregnant. I mean, what happened to this country then is still tearing us apart.

Almost certainly, yes. And you saw it a little bit with Barack Obama where he tapped Joe Biden in part because Joe had very deep relationships on Capitol Hill. If you had another outsider like me, we'd still be trying to figure out who to call. So, you need to have folks who have deep relationships on Capitol Hill from day one.

'THE HISTORY MYSTERY' at Tada! Youth Theater (Jan. 20 through Feb. 20). The three young characters at the heart of this musical voice a typical complaint about the subject of history: that it's all about boring old white men. But when they travel back in time in this revival from Tada!, whose actors are ages 8 through 18, they discover interesting figures who aren't necessarily white or male — and are certainly not boring. The show, by Janine Nina Trevens, Eric Rockwell and Margaret Rose, includes encounters with suffragists and the young Eleanor Roosevelt and Martin Luther King Jr. An added benefit this weekend: a chance to learn a number onstage with the cast after the 4 p.m. show on Sunday.
There's the After Dark subset, where the influencer, in cozy but stylish leisure wear and a messy bun, tidies up the living room and kitchen, presumably after the children are in bed. She may even mention a link on her page where you can buy said leisure wear or the matching headband, in a not-so-subtle reminder that these videos are also about selling products for sponsors. She may have a glass of wine in hand, because what's more relaxing than a late-night tidying session?
Nor is the answer easy to detect in her personality. It was not a caring instinct that drove her — I have no turn for benevolencies, she wrote to her brother Henry in 1855 — or a curious one, to advance medical science beyond leeches, mercury and prayer. And while she was roused by the Transcendentalist Margaret Fuller's exhortation to let them be sea-captains, if you will, she was no feminist foremother: She did not believe in suffrage and rejected the fellowship of the burgeoning women's movement. She denounced women as petty, trifling, priest-ridden, gossiping, stupid, inane, and desperately in need of leadership from a superior being like herself. More than anything, Elizabeth Blackwell became a doctor to show the world that she alone could do it.
Mr. Yang founded Venture for America, a fellowship program for recent college graduates, in 2011, with the goal of creating 100,000 new jobs in the country's most underresourced cities. As of 2019, the nonprofit has created around 3,500 jobs.
Meanwhile, the development of a Catholic ghetto, especially in the United States, with its own set of self-segregating schools, colleges, and journals, made ignoring the Catholics easier than if they had been forcing their attention upon their antagonists from adjoining offices. Non-Catholics rarely investigated the work of intellectuals in the Catholic Church unless they were searching for polemical ammunition.

You don't have to make a big deal of it. It's playing with fire. Sometimes these images will bombard your memory. If he begins to feel aroused, Bashista said, you have to channel that energy in productive ways. Doing something for someone else. If you're looking at ladies, getting some thoughts or ideas, just refocus. And yet, many of these men were reared on popular culture and find it difficult to give up. On a lot of TV shows, you know married couples are contracepting, Magat said. And any time Jerry hooked up with some girl in 'Seinfeld,' we knew they were sleeping together. . . . Should I find these things funny? This is the stuff I'm going to be preaching against! Magat stopped watching Seinfeld, but kept track of what was happening on the show to the very end from nonseminary friends. For a long time, Michael Dobbins was a devoted fan of James Taylor. I went to several of his concerts and I had his T-shirts, his CD's -- I was taking guitar lessons so I could learn to play his songs, he said. Then I began to realize that a lot of his lyrics are like, peace, love and butterflies are free -- whatever goes. But whatever goes really isn't the truth, you know? And finally one day I'm listening to this James Taylor concert on the radio, and he says, 'This is a hymn to the goddess Gaya.'
AN AMERICAN MARRIAGE, by Tayari Jones. (Algonquin, $16.95.) The lives of a young black couple in Atlanta are thrown into chaos after the husband, Roy, is imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit. As the couple grapple with their grief, they must also confront the failed hopes of a marriage and romantic love. The grave miscarriage of justice forms the core of Jones's deeply compassionate and heartbreaking novel.
Set and shot amid the Lebanese civil war, Ms. Saab's feature debut, A Suspended Life (1984), follows Samar, an independent-minded young girl reveling in the freedom afforded by warfare chaos. She thinks herself — and proclaims herself — free and able to do whatever I want, but the cost of her spirited wandering is a hymen-restoring operation imposed by her family.
The margin was enough to forestall charges that the President's fate might have been different if the vote were delayed to the 106th Congress, which will have five more Democrats.
The book ends by suggesting three alternatives for the future: an America which becomes increasingly degenerate, an America which becomes increasingly over-controlled with science assisting the state in keeping sex in its place, and a more endearing picture of an America which will profit by our new careless freedom, use our new understandings of the working of body and mind and will achieve a sexual code that will be free without being careless.
A Year Later, the First Post-Pandemic City
Well, let me finish. If you're asking me if a white person, man or woman, would have done exactly what Mr. Brooks did, would they have been shot and possibly died from it? Yes. If they did exactly what it is, I believe that would have happened the same way. But the way you framed it is that if it was a white person, would they have been killed? You keep saying, would they have been killed? Mr. Brooks was killed because of actions that led up to it. The officer did not go out, again — and I don't know why we have to keep stressing this — he didn't go out to plan to kill Mr. Brooks or anybody that day. But the way you made it sound, if that was a white person — let's just go there — if that was a white person that did the exact same thing that Mr. Brooks did? Absolutely. They would have been shot. I don't know how to say that any clearer. But let's caveat that by saying with the exact same actions. But they've got to be the exact same actions. We have to be talking about the same situation and just switching the color.
We have a lot of jobs, but they don't really pay enough for people to feel comfortable that they can set aside enough for their kids' education and for their retirement, or for any health emergency.

Far from stirring up controversy, his paintings were coveted by the establishment. The second version of The Massacre of the Innocents was made for a grand official residence, the Prinsenhof. Another Prinsenhof commission resulted in The Marriage of Peleus and Thetis (1592-3), a mythological scene that covered an entire wall. These were the most prestigious assignments in the city, garnered by an artist not yet 30.

This book is a call to action for all who refuse to accept our demographic demise as inevitable. It is a demand for a new Jewish state of mind capable of challenging the conventional wisdom that Judaism is more adaptive to persecution and discrimination than it is to an open, free, and welcoming society--that Jews paradoxically need enemies in order to survive, that anti-Semitism is what has kept Judaism alive. This age-old perspective on Jewish survival is illustrated by two tragic stories involving respected rabbinical leaders.
In a sense, an era is ending, said Herfried Münkler, a political scientist at Humboldt University in Berlin. But in certain basic positions, such as the geopolitical situation and the economic conditions within the E.U., that all remains unchanged, regardless of who's the chancellor.
In a business you can say, Hey, we're going to go this way, and people generally have to do what you're saying. In government it's much more analogous to my role as the founder of a national nonprofit, where you have hundreds or even thousands of stakeholders, and you have to try and generate energy around a vision. Let people see that it's in their self-interest or the self-interest of the people that they represent to get on board with your vision. And that you're willing to compromise and work with them. That is the way I would lead as president.

Depending on who you ask, Chelsea's Maritime Hotel could be seen as proof of the architect Albert C. Ledner's inspired vision — or a monolithic monument to 1960s kitsch.

What are the true threats of the 21st century? Climate change is number one, and then cybersecurity and A.I., loose nuclear material, military drones in the hands of nonstate actors. It's very hard to secure a location from something the size of a flying vacuum cleaner. That's very, very difficult. So we're entering an era where it's going to be much easier to be offensive than defensive, and you don't need massive levels of resources to cause significant levels of damage. To me, a new aircraft carrier does not make our elections any more secure from Russian hacking, which is the most direct threat to our democracy upcoming in this cycle. We're spending money on the threats of the 20th century, and we need to try and modernize our approach as quickly as possible.

In contrast, Fidler begins his story more conventionally, with the Romans and, to be more precise, with his son, Joe, in Rome's Capitoline Museum, admiring the colossal head of Constantine, the man who made Constantinople both the capital of the Roman Empire and a Christian metropolis. While Hughes's tone is both scholarly and rich in visual detail, Fidler entertains us with novelistic vignettes and cut-and-paste erudition, though he wobbles a little here and there. In a timeline that precedes the main narrative we are informed, for example, that the city was renamed Istanbul in 1453. In fact, the Ottomans kept the name Kostantiniyye in official usage until the dissolution of their empire in 1923, and the two names were used in parallel fashion by court officials. Istanbul, in any case, comes from the common Greek expression eis tin polin, into the city, and was a word used by both Turks and Greeks long before Mehmet's conquest. As always with this great hybrid city, the continuities have as much force as the momentous changes. That said, Fidler displays great charm in the telling of his tale, spicing it with delicious gossip.
The experiment has its problems. But ultimately Martin, played by Mads Mikkelsen, finds release, which comes through in a dance at the end of the movie. The dance, a little drunken, shows Mikkelsen's nimble ability to balance daring and control. It's fitting: He was once a professional dancer.
Unless we begin to make use of our competitive advantage--as teachers, communicators, scholars, advocates, and strategists--we will lose our children and grandchildren to the seductive drift toward assimilation and away from Jewishness. The fundamental changes we must make will require a reordering of our priorities away from an almost exclusive focus on defending Jews against external enemies and toward new ways of defending ourselves and our children against self-destruction through assimilation. We will have to educate our children differently, allocate our charitable giving differently, select our leaders differently--even define our very Jewishness differently. Jewish life will have to become less tribal, more open, more accepting of outsiders, and less defensive.

Some may have terrible handwriting, or find it uncomfortable or even painful to write.

THE AFTERMATH (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. Keira Knightley and Alexander Skarsgard play grief-stricken lovers in this wartime romantic drama by the director James Kent (Testament of Youth). Rachael (Knightley) arrives in postwar Hamburg in 1946 to reunite with her husband Lewis (Jason Clarke), a British colonel in charge of rebuilding the city. The couple lost their son during the Blitz, and their marriage has been on thin ice ever since. They settle into a mansion requisitioned from Stephen (Skarsgard), a German widower. Rachael is seething when Lewis offers to share the space with Stephen and his daughter. But soon enough her animosity gives way to desire, and a love triangle unfolds under one roof. The film has been praised for its dazzling visuals, yet critics have said it lacks nuance and emotional depth.

Right from the beginning, as their broker gives Alice and her husband, Nate, a tour of the 1940s house in fictional Greenville, Alice feels uneasy. Everything it stands for makes her feel nauseous. All she wants is to be back in her cramped apartment eating takeout. Nate has a different reaction altogether. The house is the logical next step in the narrative he's already written for them: wedding, apartment, suburbs, family. He wins, yes, because, like the other men who populate this book, he walks through the world expecting life would give him whatever he wanted simply because he asked for it. But also because he's the one bankrolling their life now, which sets up a new, prickly dynamic for Alice, making her feel like less of a partner.

Some 80,000 veterans have appeals older than five years; 5,000 have appeals older than 10. The number of pending appeals climbed by 35 percent to more than 450,000 between 2012 and 2015 and is projected to soar to more than 2.2 million by the end of 2027 if there's no significant reform.

URSULA EAGLY at Chocolate Factory (March 29 through April 1, 8 p.m.). In her new Piece with gaps for each other, Ms. Eagly works in collaboration with the Mexican artist Martín Lanz Landázuri and the Japanese composer Kohji Setoh. Anchored by themes of tragedy and protest, Ms. Eagly's latest work is inspired by the disappearance of 43 students from an all-male teachers college in Mexico — they were on their way to a protest before they were stopped by the police and turned over to a criminal organization — and the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. Ultimately, Piece with gaps is not so much a political work as it is one that explores the paired ideas of difference and coexistence. For it, the collaborators will be joined by Madeline Best, Jamie Boyle, Mina Nishimura and Kathy Westwater.

But the general trend bore the range of intellectually respectable ideas steadily away from religion in general and Catholicism in particular. This trend, often labeled secularization, appeared for decades to be unstoppable, so that many convert intellectuals, far from reversing its momentum, found their own views gradually moving outside the realm of what other intellectuals considered plausible. The consequence was marginalization, and convert intellectuals in general lost influence with the passing decades, so that none in the twentieth century could have an effect on his or her non-Catholic contemporaries to match that of Newman and Brownson in the mid-nineteenth. Certain writers, such as Chesterton or Christopher Dawson, could still find admirers, but neither created a major school of thought, and non-Catholic admirers saw their religion as a colorful aberration rather than a central element in their work. In that sense this book is the history of a momentous and protracted failure.

The German critic Theodor Adorno dismissed Weill's American music as the work of a tunesmith and sellout, and much German thought followed in that vein.

In the United States, though, his early symphonic and stage works remained largely unknown.

And the people that are most diligent about screen time are the tech folks in Silicon Valley. You go there, and all of a sudden there's not a screen to be had because they know that we have the smartest engineers in the country turning supercomputers into dopamine delivery devices for kids, because that's how they make their millions of dollars.
Well, I think it really begins with a fairy tale.
A hundred years ago, Theodor Herzl identified the Jewish question of the twentieth century as the literal survival of Jews in the face of external enemies committed to our physical annihilation--Jew-haters in every nation where Jews lived as a minority. His solution--the creation of a secular Jewish state--was to change the nature of Jewish life in dramatic and unanticipated ways. A hundred years later, the Jewish question of the twenty-first century is survival in the face of our internal challenges. Herzl also anticipated that this new Jewish question might arise if and when our Christian hosts were to leave us in peace. This is now coming to pass. The solution to this Jewish question also requires the creation of yet another Jewish state: a new Jewish state of mind!
California's Board of Education adopted an expansive 842-page social studies framework in 2016. Two years later, Texas' school board streamlined its social studies standards, which are now laid out in 78 tightly compressed pages.
Buttigieg has campaigned frequently with his husband, embracing him onstage, and has mentioned his marriage in debates. And he doesn't shy away from questions about his sexual orientation, which he didn't publicly acknowledge until the age of 33, shortly before his election to a second term as mayor of South Bend, Ind.
KK: I thought you were going to say it's a lot harder to ride the subway now because of the breakdowns of New York infrastructure.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, like Mr. Yang, has argued that the country's approach to antitrust regulation is outmoded. In early 2019, the Federal Trade Commission created a new task force focused on monitoring competition in technology markets, which the foundation celebrated as a step toward modernizing antitrust.
The editorial board recently called for the Trump administration to break the impasse on funding for the proposed rail tunnel under the Hudson River in an editorial titled: Build the Donald J. Trump Tunnel. The vital infrastructure project has stalled because of political infighting.
She writes deliciously, in this memoir, about her sexual awakening, her pursuit of ravishment. After I got a taste of sex, that's all I thought about, she writes. She slept with good guys and she slept with lunks. (I lay there and took a lot of pounding, she says about one unhappy evening.) One lover took her to an orgy, where she may or may not have seen George Plimpton in priest's robes.
DESSAU, Germany — Tourists in this sleepy town would be hard-pressed to find any trace of Kurt Weill, the composer of The Threepenny Opera and other acclaimed concert and stage works, who grew up here. The synagogue where his father worked as a cantor was destroyed during Kristallnacht in 1938; the theater that employed Weill as a conductor burned down and was replaced with a Nazi-designed one christened by Hitler; and much of the urban landscape as Weill knew it was leveled by air raids in World War II.
This Weekend I Have … an Hour, and Let's Talk About Sex
The Department of Defense Law of War Manual specifically prohibits acts of hostility … directed against cultural property in the absence of military necessity. Now, the president is threatening to target cultural sites in Iran whose rich cultural heritage spans from the earliest evidence of human domestication of plants and animals to ancient majestic Achaemenid cities and richly tiled Islamic shrines and mosques. Iran is home to 24 World Heritage Sites and thousands of other places that are part of our global shared heritage.
She pointed to a bipartisan push behind censuring the president, which she said was blocked by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Emily Cochrane and
Graham Greene once wrote: Proust was the greatest novelist of the twentieth century, just as Tolstoy was in the nineteenth.... For those who began to write at the end of the twenties or the beginning of the thirties, there were two great inescapable influences: Proust and Freud, who are mutually complementary. Certainly Proust's fame and prestige have eclipsed those of Joyce, Beckett, Virginia Woolf and Faulkner, of Hemingway and Fitzgerald, of Gide and Valery and Genet, of Thomas Mann and Bertolt Brecht, for if some of these writers are more celebrated than Proust in their own country, Proust is the only one to have a uniformly international reputation. The young Andrew Holleran, who would go on to publish the most important American gay novel of the seventies, Dancer from the Dance, wrote a friend eight years earlier: Robert, much has happened: That is, I finally finished Remembrance of Things Past and I don't know what to say--the idea that Joyce ended the novel is so absurd; it's Proust who ended the novel, simply by doing something so complete, monumental, perfect, that what the fuck can you do afterwards?
The order was in response to a motion filed by Bryan Kennedy, a lawyer for Mr. Shipp. The idea, Mr. Kennedy said, came from both his client and a murder case in Louisa, Va., where a judge in September ordered a life-size portrait of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee removed from a circuit courtroom at the defendant's request.

In confronting ourselves, we must face the reality that the generation of Jews I wrote about in Chutzpah--those of us who remember the Holocaust, the creation of Israel and the mortal threats to its survival, the movements to save Soviet, Syrian, and Ethiopian Jewry, the struggle against institutional anti-Semitism--is aging. Our children, who have no actual memory of embattled Judaism fighting for the life, liberty, and equality of endangered Jews, are now the crossroads generation that will determine what Jewish life in America and around the world will be in the coming century. It is to that younger generation of Jews, as well as to their parents, that I address this volume.
Many of Mr. Yang's supporters say they are drawn to his perspective as a political outsider; in The Wall Street Journal, some say they previously supported Senator Sanders but now look for a candidate who offers an even fresher non-Washington perspective.
The type of climbing had not been done before, Whitmore said in an interview for Merry's obituary in 2019. We had to improvise as we went.
Any American who wants to gamble online on a poker site can do so from any state in the country right now. If it's illegal in your state, you just end up using an offshore betting site, which is shady, has problems, but it's not going to ease your gambling addiction at all. So the question is, do we want Americans, in the vast majority of the country, on offshore betting sites, dealing with shady characters and generating no revenue and still being addicted? Or would we prefer that they do business with American firms, where we do have better regulations, we know they're not getting cheated, we know they're not getting exploited, and you generate tax revenue that you can use to treat gambling addiction.
Here's another example: Teenagers in both states will learn about the Harlem Renaissance and debates about the movement's impact on African-American life.
The 21st-century framework. First, you don't use price as your primary determinant of whether or not there are antitrust problems, because the tech companies would say, What? We would never gouge anyone. It's free. We're underselling everyone. So that you have to get rid of, and that's not something she's advocating, but what she is advocating, which I find to be a bit backward looking, is thinking that competition is the answer in these spaces. And competition misses the point in one way and another way.
Jennifer Mass, the president of the Scientific Analysis of Fine Art lab in Harlem, whose team is on The Scream research, explained the science recently in her lab. She pointed to a photograph of what looked like a set of stalagmites: It was the surface of The Scream seen under a microscope.
The general thesis of the book is essentially sound, if heavily weighted on the seamy side. This book deals for the most part with wide social pathologies — the divorce rate, growing sexual inversion and prostitution rather than courtship, marriage and parenthood. Tackling these social pathologies, sometimes with a detail and frankness to which the American reader is only just accustomed, Mr. McPartland illustrates his main theme, that since World War I America has changed drastically from a sex-shy, inhibited people to a hedonistic, cynical people, openly in search of pleasure, and that our old ethics of home and family have rotted away, leaving nothing except a few sporting rules. There are vivid descriptions of the sordid divorce mills, and other institutions which exploit broken lives. But primarily this is not a source book, but a long ethical essay, with considerable gaiety, humor and a refreshing time perspective. ...
Dr. Bateson's parents, Dr. Mead and Gregory Bateson, an Englishman, were celebrated anthropologists who fell in love in New Guinea while both were studying the cultures there. (Dr. Mead was married to someone else at the time.) They treated their daughter's arrival almost as more field work, documenting her birth on film — not a typical practice in 1939 — and continuing to record her early childhood with the intention of using the footage not just as home movies but also as educational material. (Dr. Bateson's first memory of her father was with a Leica camera hanging from his neck.)
Objectification doesn't exist just in porn, of course. So many men cannot get their heads around the idea that women are not first and foremost sexual objects, the novelist Jenny Crusie told me. You don't get that from porn; you get that from a persistent worldview modeled by the men around you that you've been taught to admire.
If these are your measurements, then of course you're going to think things are going in one direction, while your way of life disintegrates. Even the inventor of G.D.P., Simon Kuznets, said 100 years ago, this is a terrible measurement of national well-being, and we should never use it as that.
DUVERNAY The majority of that voting body has not changed. It's still 84 percent white and 68 percent male. From a voting perspective, even doubling the number of women and people of color doesn't really tip the scales.
Mr. Yang started Venture for America in 2011, shortly after selling his test prep company to Kaplan. He said that he saw, in the wake of the financial crisis, how certain communities were rapidly losing jobs and wanted to create new work opportunities in those underserved areas.
In an essay called On Pandering, which appeared in Tin House magazine in 2015, the novelist Claire Vaye Watkins wrote about the struggle to establish herself as a woman artist in the face of the patriarchy. It was, in part, a discussion of the way men, both well-intentioned and not, had consciously and subconsciously asserted their authority, but it was also an acknowledgment of her own complicity, her desire to pander to the male gaze. The essay was challenging, provocative and ultimately chilling in a the call is coming from inside the house sort of way. It put internalized misogyny on full display. It also became part of a larger conversation about divestment — from maleness, from whiteness, from straightness and thinness and cisgenderness — and how we might reconsider our assumptions about whose perspectives are worthy of literary treatment.
Elite hospitals have vaccinated workers who were supposed to wait. Frontline workers waited in line to receive the Covid-19 vaccine at a hospital in Arlington, Va., last month. Credit... Michael A. McCoy for The New York Times At leading research hospitals in the United States, administrators and young graduate students have been inoculated with some of the earliest supplies of coronavirus vaccines, in a contradiction of federal and state guidelines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued recommendations intended to ensure that the nation's vaccines first reach those at highest risk: health care workers who interact with Covid-19 patients, and residents and staff members at nursing homes, followed by people 75 and older and certain essential workers. Each state has established its own version of the guidelines, but with the rollout proceeding at a glacial pace, pressure has been growing for a more flexible approach. Officials at the C.D.C. and the Food and Drug Administration have recently suggested that it might be wiser to simply loosen the criteria and distribute the vaccine as widely as possible. But a handful of the nation's most prestigious academic hospitals have already taken the notion much further. A 20-something who works on computers. A young researcher who studies cancer. Technicians in basic research labs.
A new generation of converts in the United States joined the Catholic Church in the interwar years. The best known, Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton, each gradually won a wide and sympathetic audience in the non-Catholic world, eventually becoming spiritual celebrities. Less celebrated but equally important, a succession of converts from the ranks of academia--among them the historians Carlton Hayes, Ross Hoffman, and Elizabeth Kite, and the sociologist Eva Ross--brought a measure of intellectual respectability to Catholic education. This generation of converts was made up of white Anglo-Saxon Protestants. They had enjoyed an education in the leading American graduate schools--Hayes at Columbia and Hoffman at the University of Pennsylvania, for example--and they felt none of the immigrant insecurities and defensive belligerence still common among their ethnically assimilating Catholic contemporaries. They were as much a part of the American establishment as the convert sons of English Anglican bishops were part of the British establishment. They brought to Catholic academic life a new sense of ease and possession. Demonstrating a high level of technical skill in their disciplines, they began to win more sympathetic attention from non-Catholic academics. They also ran graduate programs, training young cradle Catholics to high standards, with the eventual effect of reducing the prominence of converts. Many non-Catholics found their critique of science and their philosophical antitotalitarianism germane to the total war of the 1940s and the Cold War of the 1950s.
On Monday, he used his speech to laud Mr. Brown's tenure; the mention of his predecessor's name drew a standing ovation. But Mr. Newsom left little doubt that he had a broader view of government than the moderate Mr. Brown. The departing governor inherited a $28 billion deficit and left Mr. Newsom a $14 billion surplus; he also created an $18 billion so-called rainy day fund to help the state get through what is widely viewed as an inevitable coming recession.

In general, Oates is dealing here with the academic world — professors and their kids, editors, writers, adjuncts — people who live in the provinces, on the outskirts of real success. Characters are often referred to by titles rather than names: mother, daddy, wife, husband, professor. Except You Bless Me, one of the standouts in a very strong collection, recounts an early incident in a woman's teaching career. She has become convinced that a black student in her class — one she's been trying to help — has been sending her racist hate messages. Is the professor unusually patient and conscientious or completely delusional and possibly racist herself?
Murkowski Is Latest G.O.P. Senator to Signal Possible Support for Convicting Trump The timing of the Senate's impeachment trial remains unclear. President-elect Joe Biden unveiled a sweeping economic plan on Thursday that included additional $1,400 stimulus checks. The Secret Service will establish a security green zone in the capital ahead of Inauguration Day.
A Zionist and social activist, Rabbi Eckstein was often described as a bridge builder, an epithet that became the title of an authorized biography published in 2015. He also caused concern among Jews who were wary of the motives of evangelicals, the main source of the contributions.

They met in summer 1979 at Fashion Moda, a fabled gallery near 149th Street and Third Avenue in the Bronx that attracted downtown artists like Tom Otterness, Jane Dickson and Mr. Ahearn, as well as local graffiti artists and break dancers. Mr. Ahearn had been making casts of people by the gallery's big storefront windows when a cousin of Mr. Torres's stopped by to check out the scene. Mr. Torres soon went to see for himself.

In early January, the one serving Jacksonville was closed for a few hours, causing delays and flight cancellations. Last month, the center that serves the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport closed for several hours after an employee tested positive. The F.A.A. declared a ground stop, halting all departing flights. The closure caused ripples of delays and diverted flights across the country.
'ABOUT ALICE' at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center (in previews; opens on Jan. 20). Based on what The New York Times Book Review called a slim but walloping book, this Theater for a New Audience play by Calvin Trillin relates his long, fine romance with his wife, Alice, who died in 2001. Under Leonard Foglia's direction, Jeffrey Bean and Carrie Paff portray Calvin and Alice.

While Axe made plenty of mistakes in the first season — he tore his own office down to the foundations in the end — one of the strengths of the second season is that it's willing to expose his weak spots and fallibility. He can plot or buy his way out of many sticky situations, and he always seems a step ahead of other hedge-funders and Wall Street sharks. But he's also impulsive and ego-driven, and his hot temperament sometimes gets the better of him. In this episode, even Wags — Wags! — advises him to cool off a little and stop obsessing over Foley's intervention in the Sandicot deal. When the guy who lustily indulges in vaportinis and an empowering cabaret that celebrates the feminine ideal (i.e. lap dances) tells you to slow your roll, maybe it's best to listen.
JI: So, what steps would you take to take that money and create a gambling addiction treatment program or system? So, what exactly would you do to get from A to B?
KK: Oh, sorry, I just wanted to ask you, you know, there are some people who would suggest that a better use of money, instead of giving a Freedom Dividend, would be to dramatically overhaul America's high schools and start teaching people different skills instead of trying to continue the race against A.I. Why isn't that a path? Why couldn't we instead change how we do education in this country?
ASHINGTON -- William Jefferson Clinton was impeached on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice Saturday by a divided House of Representatives, which recommended virtually along party lines that the Senate remove the nation's 42d President from office.
The world is, as everyone knows, going to hell, but there's still the nervous thrill of waiting to see precisely which dark force will take us down. Will the economy collapse first, the ice sheets melt first, or chaos and war envelop us first?

Introduction The Jewish Question for the Twenty-first
There was anther interview in 1970, again in the Philippines, but centering on his concern for primitive peoples. And again in 1971, he took this writer with him on a long American conservation tour, which was also a journey backward in time to his boyhood home in Minnesota. Lindbergh said that he had unveiled himself because he thought the cause of conservation so urgent. I have had enough publicity for 15 lives, he said, and I seek no more of it, but where I can accomplish a purpose I will do things I otherwise abhor. There was no doubt that his leadership was effective. Even though he was talking to a generation born long after his Paris flight, his person and his name evoked a tangible response. He did not pretend to be an expert, but had a singular ability to stir response and activity, to enunciate general principles and to cheer people on. It did not appear to matter that he had published his bulky Wartime Journals in 1970 to general critical dispraise. What seemed to count was that he was Charles Augustus Lindbergh, the hero still of 1927, whose smile was engaging, whose words were straightforward, whose manner was simple and whose message was forceful. This was, perhaps, the ultimate enigma of his life; for beneath his outer coating was a man who kept more to himself (and perhaps to his wife) than he ever gave to the public.
No, first of all, it's also easy to do it in a hypothetical situation. But in my character's case, he fully intended to do the right thing, as you saw. And it was that impulsive moment, when he saw that mobster, to alter the course of his life by making that decision.
His stepson John Oppenheimer said the cause was kidney failure.

For nine months, from the fall of 1943 until the summer of 1944, Rae lived in the woods with the Bielski partisans, in a highly organized camp of over a thousand Jews. At night, small armed groups would make their way silently to farms owned by gentiles for potatoes, onions, bread—and if they were lucky, an egg or a piece of meat. The partisans' tactics could be brutal: when they believed Belarusian farmers were turning Jews over to the Nazis, the partisans would kill them, sometimes slaying whole families. Then the food was collected, and the ammunition, and brought back to the camp for defense and more raids.
Though golden enough for any nostalgist, Stories by Heart is neither soporific nor cute. For starters, the two stories that Mr. Lithgow recites — Haircut in the first act and P. G. Wodehouse's Uncle Fred Flits By in the second — are superb, outlandish and, in very different ways, hair-raising.
They should be, I mean clearly. Because if you spend time on these campuses, you know where they're going. So one thing you can do that's very, very fast and immediate is you can become much more flexible in terms of compensation and a type of work environment.

Who was guilty among the moms of Monterey, Calif.? She was, and she was, and she was, and she was, and she was. For being too poor, or too rich. For being overambitious, or underaccomplished. For being too hot, or not hot enough. For being too mean, or too nice. For being.
I rode the subway maybe six weeks ago or so. It's become much more of a pain in the neck now that I actually get recognized. I confess that that's been the biggest adjustment in running for president. Because I was, No, I'm not going to get recognized on the street. Of course, keep in mind, when I started my run I was completely anonymous. I mean none of you had ever heard of me. And also there is, and this is not to make too much of it, but there's also this invisible Asian man thing. That you feel like all you have to do is just not want to be seen and then you disappear, and that doesn't work anymore.
Obviously, there is one company that is spending more than the others, but that's not going to affect how I will vote — nor do I think it will affect other members, said Hawk Koch, a producer and former president of the academy, who recently wrote a memoir about his long career in Hollywood. There is an awful lot of wasteful money being spent that could be used for making movies rather than trying to win an award.
Mr. Biden also named two co-chairs of the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology: Frances H. Arnold, the first American woman to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and Maria Zuber, a geophysics and planetary science expert and the first woman to lead a NASA spacecraft mission. Mr. Biden also said that Dr. Francis S. Collins would remain as the director of the National Institutes of Health. Earlier on Saturday, the Biden-Harris transition team announced several nominations to the State Department, including that of Brian P. McKeon, who has worked with Mr. Biden for more than 25 years, to be deputy secretary of state for management and resources. Bonnie Jenkins, a veteran arms control expert, was nominated for under secretary for arms control and international security affairs; Ms. Jenkins is also the founder of a group for women of color in national security. Uzra Zeya, who has held multiple roles at the State Department, was nominated for under secretary for civilian security, democracy, and human rights. Mr. Biden also formally announced the nominations of Wendy Sherman to be deputy secretary of state and Victoria Nuland as under secretary for political affairs; his plans to nominate both Ms. Sherman and Ms. Nuland were previously reported.
Whole paragraphs on redlining and restrictive deeds appear only in the California editions of textbooks, partly as a result of different state standards. Texas' social studies guidelines do not mention housing discrimination at all.

A homicide come dressed to the ball as a suicide: This you expect from a braindead jackboy in the Seventy-Seven. But from Trader Faulkner, Associate Professor of Philosophy of Science at CSU? Please. The smart murder just never happens. That's all bullshit. That's all so...pathetic. The Professor did it. Oh, sure. Murder is dumb and then even dumber. Only two things will make you any good at it: Luck and practice. If you're dealing with the reasonably young and healthy, and if the means is violent, then the homicide/suicide gray area is TV, is bullshit, is ketchup. Make no mistake, we would see it if it was there--because we want suicides to be homicides. We would infinitely prefer it. A made homicide means overtime, a clearance stat, and high fives in the squadroom. And a suicide is no damn use to anyone.
When I'm on the subway, people will look at me and then look at me. And then eventually someone will inch over and say, Hey, you running for president? And then I'll say, Yes, I am. They'll say, Yeah, yeah, I like you. Thousand bucks a month, something like that. And then they want to take pictures. And then as soon as someone breaks the seal, then it's safe for everyone to do it. And so, then I'll be — and then there's this uncomfortable period in this subway car after you've taken the pictures with him, you're still sitting there. And so then they're, So, where are you going? Or, how's Bernie? Or whatever the questions are. And so, I have not been riding the subway lately, but I've ridden the subway an awful lot over the years. Now my preferred mode of transportation is the bike, because if someone recognizes me, it's generally too late.
In response to announcements about Mr. Trump's planned cuts to State Department funding, retired generals wrote a letter to lawmakers citing Secretary of Defense James Mattis's 2013 comment, If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately.
I agree neither with those theologians who believe that Jewish survival is assured because God promised it nor with those demographers who believe that Jewish disappearance is inevitable because of forces beyond our control.

According to Sky Blue, the 39-year-old executive director of the Foundation for Intentional Community and a former member of the Virginia-based commune Twin Oaks, which was founded in 1967, the number of intentional communities listed in the FIC's directory nearly doubled between 2010 and 2016 (the last year the directory was published), to roughly 1,200. Although the number of people living in these communities is hard to pin down — the demographic is often deliberately off the grid — Blue estimates that there are currently around 100,000 individuals residing in them. There's an obvious growth trend that you can chart, he said; millennials get this intentional community thing more than people in the past.
Other candidates have taken a different approach to creating a nest egg for low-income youth — Senator Booker, for example, favors baby bonds, which would provide every infant with a savings account that the government would contribute to annually depending on family income.

In Norse Mythology, Gaiman brings voice to the old myths so viscerally that listening to the audiobook every night for a week, I thought my bedroom might explode into Valhalla. Here are hammer-handed Thor and one-eyed Odin, tricky Loki, and the mighty goddesses Freya and Idunn. In fact the entire Norse pantheon, including dwarves and giants and demons, plays out as vividly as a novel or film. Honestly I may have to order a breastplate of some sort. As Gaiman puts it in the introduction, the stories feel like a journey from the ice and fire that created the world to the fire and ice that end it.

Stephanie Kugler, an eighth-grade history teacher in West Sacramento, Calif., said she had expanded an idea mentioned briefly in her classroom's textbook, about women who dressed as men to fight in the Civil War and continued to live as men, into an entire lesson on troops who today would be considered transgender. The students read accounts of those soldiers' lives alongside more traditional sources, such as letters written by a black Union soldier and a Confederate soldier.
Tell us about the last great book you read.
To me, the economic imbalances are causing many of our other problems. If you look up and down the line, health problems, poor educational attainment and results, even political polarization, they stem from the fact that we have this pervasive financial insecurity where 78 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Almost half can't afford an unexpected $400 or $500 bill. If you can't pay next month's rent, it's very hard to worry about climate change. I come and talk to you and say, Hey, we need to fight climate change. And you look up and say like, I'm worried about next month. Next year, next decade has to wait in line.

Well, this demanded some time to settle. Okay: Now: It is sometimes true that an apparent suicide will, on inspection, come back a homicide. But that inspection takes about two seconds. It is ten o'clock on a Saturday night, in Destry or Oxville. Some jig has just blown his chick to bits with a shotgun. But a couple of spikes later he hatches a brilliant scheme: He'll make it look like she did it. So he gives the weapon a wipe and props her up on the bed or wherever. He might even muster the initiative to scrawl out a note, in his own fair hand. We used to have one of these notes tacked to the squadroom noticeboard. It read: Good By Crule Whirld. Well this is some sad shit, Marvis, you say when you get there, responding to Marvis's call. What happened? And Marvis says, She was depress. Discreetly, Marvis leaves the room. He's done his bit. What more can a man do? Now it's our turn. You glance at the corpse: There's no burn or shell wadding in the wound and the blood spatter is on the wrong pillow. And the wrong wall. You follow Marvis into the kitchen and he's standing there with a glassine bag in one hand and a hot spoon in the other. Homicide. Heroin. Nice, Marvis. Come on. Downtown. Because you're a murdering piece of shit. And a degenerate motherfucker. That's why.

She may even mention a link on her page where you can buy said leisure wear or the matching headband, in a not-so-subtle reminder that these videos are also about selling products for sponsors. She may have a glass of wine in hand, because what's more relaxing than a late-night tidying session?
My sister divorced her husband years ago. Until recently, we remained on friendly terms with my former brother-in-law, socializing at family events he hosted and exchanging holiday gifts. Lately he has become so radical in his political and world views that I am no longer comfortable maintaining a relationship. He has a blog and is an occasional radio host, so his are very public opinions that are filled with hate and even calls to violent action. I find this horrifying, and I am firmly in the category of people he is calling for violence against, along with most of my family. This is more than simply differing ideologies. (I do not believe he is a physical danger. I believe he needs help, the way Alex Jones needs help.)

you can have dignity, but it must be earned through market or entrepreneurial success (as the Reagan/Thatcher center-right would have it) or the meritocratic attainment of professional status (as the center-left would have it). But obviously, these are not avenues available to all, simply because society has only so many positions for captains of industry and educated professionals.
Gross domestic product is a measure of a country's entire economic output. Its inventor worried that it might be mistaken as a measure of citizens' well-being. Mr. Yang's campaign has proposed that America measure its economic prosperity with a different index that accounts for human and not just monetary factors, including inequality and quality of life.
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — The ancient cemetery of Makli, near the city of Thatta in Sindh Province, is one of the largest necropolises in the world, so rich in monuments that UNESCO declared it a World Heritage site.
Black resists the pull of the river 565 feet below. And that choice — equal parts survival instinct and desire to live — marks a turning point in her trajectory. Ronan's life can go only in one tragic direction — he died on Feb. 15, 2013, just before his third birthday — but Black's refusal to die means that she can open up a little bit of space in which she can find a way to live in the world, as she puts it. And that space, in which life and death, love and loss, rage and happiness, pleasure and pain can tolerably intermingle, is the mourner's sanctuary.

That'd be my first question if I got in there, I'd be, All right, let me see them. Let's see what we've been hiding all of these years.
The experiment has its problems. But ultimately Martin, played by Mads Mikkelsen, finds release, which comes through in a dance at the end of the movie. The dance, a little drunken, shows Mikkelsen's nimble ability to balance daring and control. It's fitting: He was once a professional dancer.
I leaned back and said experimentally, I keep trying to think it through. You're sitting there kind of idling around with it--with the weapon. Cleaning it. Toying with it. Then a perverse thought. An infantile thought. I mean, that's how an intelligent infant finds out about something: It puts it in its mouth. You put it in your mouth. You--
And I think this timing is crucial to understanding how this debate is playing out in Britain. Because as you see the country charting a new identity, casting off from Europe, there's a great deal of uncertainty, of uneasiness about the future of this country. What kind of a role will it play in the world? Will it be diminished? Will it be isolated? What will the post-Brexit Britain look like? So at this time of national uncertainty, there is a yearning for symbols. There's a, a sort of an urge to reach out to things that symbolize British history and the immutability of the British idea. And there's no greater symbol of that than the monarchy.
It's obviously much harder. I'm all about trying to maximize the possible. And so, if we don't get a majority — I expect the Democrats will win a slight majority in the Senate. I'm very optimistic that way, but we're going to get done what we can get done with the branch of the government we have control of. And I will say too, I believe that we can get some things done that are traditionally bipartisan, regardless of who has control of the Senate. To me, I cannot believe that we did not get infrastructure done during the first couple of years of the Trump administration. I thought at least he would build some bridges and roads, and I was even willing to accept the Trump name on those bridges and roads if it got some bridges and roads built. I was, At least we're going to get this.
Mr. Yang's comments, on Mr. Gillis and on judgment more broadly, contribute to a growing conversation among political and cultural figures about the merits and downsides of cancel culture. Former President Obama, for example, spoke out about the prevalence of call-out culture during an interview in October, arguing that criticizing people on social media for not being woke enough is not activism and not bringing about change.
Justice Bader Ginsburg has had a series of health scares in recent years, including surgery for lung cancer and radiation treatment. She also had surgery for early-stage pancreatic cancer in 2009.

At the end of the day, it's a political process, said Jesús F. de la Teja, an emeritus professor of history at Texas State University who has worked for the state of Texas and for publishers in reviewing standards and textbooks.

I'm for a more progressive tax structure. It's clear that the people at the top of the income chain are not paying enough. I don't think a wealth tax will work. I like the spirit of a wealth tax, but if you look at other countries' experience, Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, very sophisticated developed countries, they tried a wealth tax and they wound up repealing it because it had massive compliance problems, and it did not generate anywhere near the revenue that was projected.
People of color in political office, women controlling their fertility, L.G.B.T.Q. people getting married, using their bathrooms, and having children go against the state of nature defined by white heteropatriarchy. This is a domain in which men and white men in particular stand at the apex of power, holding their rightful position over women, nonwhites, perhaps non-Christians (in the U.S.), and of course, in their view, sexual deviants such as gay people.
How can the Senate hold a trial if Trump is out of office? There is no precedent for the Senate holding an impeachment trial after a president has left office, but it has done so for other government officials. Democrats who control the House can choose when to send their article of impeachment to the Senate, at which point that chamber would have to immediately move to begin the trial. But even if the House transmitted the charge to the other side of the Capitol right away, an agreement between Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate would be needed to take it up before Jan. 19, a day before Mr. Biden is inaugurated. Since Mr. McConnell said on Wednesday that he would not agree, the trial cannot start until after Mr. Biden is president. That could clog the Senate floor in the early days of Mr. Biden's administration, at a time when he will be eager to have the chamber confirm members of his cabinet. Would impeaching Trump disqualify him from holding office again? Conviction in an impeachment trial would not automatically disqualify Mr. Trump from future public office. But if the Senate were to convict him, the Constitution allows a subsequent vote to bar an official from holding any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States. That vote would require only a simple majority of senators. There is no precedent, however, for disqualifying a president from future office, and the issue could end up before the Supreme Court.
This is a game changer for Americans in any circumstance. And I am not for reducing or curtailing any of these social programs. For me, we're trying to lay a foundation that works for all Americans, and then we need to keep building on top of it. So if there are people that post-Freedom Dividend need additional programs and assistance, I'm all for it.
Wow, so telling the world, in what sounds a little bit like a cry for help, I am not doing O.K.
Although they were equal partners in running the company and were aligned in what Mr. Black refers to as their core values — if you lead with kindness, he said, you're not going to kick someone in the shins afterward — they fell flat romantically. Despite couples therapy and intimate getaways, Ms. Griffin-Black said, it got to be too much and we realized we couldn't 'have it all' together. They divorced in 2007.
Throughout the narrative, which jumps back and forth in time between the late 1980s and 2007, the events leading to Jodi's conviction spin in her memory, becoming clearer bit by bit. Her teenage affair with Paula once took Jodi into a dark, frightening and exciting underworld of gambling, guns and passion. At one point, remembering a flight in a small plane over the ocean with Paula, Jodi searches in vain for the right words to describe the color of the water, as elusive as her swirling emotions — words sufficient to catch the heart-wild magic of it.

American history is not anymore the story of great white men, said Albert S. Broussard, a history professor at Texas A&M University and an author of both the Texas and California editions of McGraw-Hill's textbooks.
Donald Trump does not speak for every non-politician or nonmilitary officer. But there is a deep need, and you've seen this, because you spent time in D.C., the D.C. establishment will not generate big solutions.
Tom Rockwell was Squad Supervisor during much of my time in Homicide. That was before he climbed into his personal express elevator and pushed the button marked Penthouse. In the space of ten years he made lieutenant as Shift Commander, then captain in charge of Crimes Against Persons, then full colonel as head of CID. He's brass now: He isn't a police, he's a politician, juggling stats and budgets and PR. He could make Dep Comm for Operations. Christ, he could make Mayor. It's all head-doctoring and kissing ass, he once said to me. You know what I am? I'm not a cop. I'm a communicator. But now Colonel Tom, the communicator, just sat there, very quietly.
He has never considered words to be as significant as actions, or even in the same category of prospective offense. Words were whatever got him through the next interaction, people who worked with him say. Words were not deemed important enough to invite serious trouble.

As Brad and Susan led me on a walking tour of their offices, which they moved into in 2012 and, later on, their manufacturing facility, their rapport seemed warm and relaxed, both with their employees and each other. Their work space is an open floor plan, painted white, with skylights, windows and plants scattered about. No one has an office except for Mr. Black, Ms. Griffin-Black, and the head of human resources. The couple's own offices, across the hall from each other, are unprepossessing to the point of minimalism — equipped with a standing desk (for Ms. Griffin-Black) and a stool (for Mr. Black), couches and various personal items, such as travel photos and Buddhist memorabilia.
Andrew Yang's message is remarkably similar to Elizabeth Warren's and Bernie Sanders's — the American economy is not working for enough Americans, and it's going to require structural change to do better. Where Mr. Yang differs — beyond his almost complete lack of government or political experience — is in his prescriptions, including his signature Freedom Dividend.
This work was through Mr. Yang's nonprofit, Venture for America. More on that in a bit.

Ms. Lee trains at least three days a week. Wednesdays are reserved for interval training with her coach, Liz de Vries. I never know what horrors she has in store for me, Ms. Lee said. But I'm turning back the clock as far as speed's concerned.
In 1976, Mr. Jones helped persuade Alabama officials, including Gov. George C. Wallace, to pardon Clarence Norris, the last surviving member of the Scottsboro Boys, the nine black teenagers falsely accused of raping two white women aboard a train near Scottsboro, Ala., in 1931.
Nice, nice. You're good with the whistles. All right, last question, then. You articulate a lot of characters who are middle aged, unhappy. Like you talked about, you represent people who have been frustrated, which is happening in this country, which is an interesting juxtaposition. Do you have any advice to them?
In an interview on Dec. 4, it was clear that Mr. Yang has done his homework, traveling across the country and listening closely. He really seemed to have an almost emotional sense of what people have been going through and what the problems are, a board member [Related: What Is an Editorial Board?] said afterward. His portrait of the fundamental economic problems were more moving than Bernie's, and Bernie has been selling this for 30 years.
My father's dubious acting career did influence, to the point where I wasn't going to be an actor. I was going to be a police officer, going into college. But it was an acting class in college that changed my mind back to acting because I felt I had an ability. But I think because of my father's struggles as a professional actor, I didn't set my sights on being a star. My dad needed to be a star, and anything less than that was failure. And so he experienced failure.
This is, as I have been telling anyone who will listen, a hate-wear. I am now hate-wearing clothing.
Ms. Bosworth became a regular presence on Broadway. She was in Phoebe Ephron's comedy Howie (1959), playing a gamin character based on the young Nora Ephron, Phoebe's daughter. She toured alongside Helen Hayes in a production of The Glass Menagerie. Her best-known movie role was in the box-office success The Nun's Story (1959), alongside Audrey Hepburn.
The bedroom led off the living room. And I knew where to go. Because I had been to this residence before, maybe a dozen times in half as many years--to drop something off for Colonel Tom, to give Jennifer a ride to a ballgame or a beach party or a function at the Dep Comm's. Her, and once or twice Trader, too. It was like that, a functional kind of friendship, but with good chats in the car. And as I crossed the living room and leaned on the bedroom door I flashed a memory of a couple of summers back, a party Overmars threw after his new deck was done, when I caught Jennifer's eye as she was smiling up from the glass of white wine she'd been nursing all night. (Everyone else apart from me, of course, was completely swacked.) I thought then that here was somebody who had a real talent for happiness. A lot of gratitude in her. I'd need a megaton of scotch to make me burn like that but she looked lovestruck on half a glass of white.
I worked for the firm I wanted to work for, I had a lot of friends. But I was my first priority, and if being nice to people helped me, then I did it. I was engrossed in the office gossip: Oh, we shouldn't be saying this, but loving every minute of it. I'd go buy clothes. You don't want to wear the same pants or shirt in one week. ... Are you kidding? I'd get extremely frustrated over the stupidest things, getting ink on a new white $70 shirt and going ballistic.

So I have a three-part test for sending troops into harm's way. Number one, it needs to advance a vital American interest or avert a humanitarian catastrophe. Number two, it has to have a clearly defined timeline where we can look troops in the eyes and say, It's going to take this long and you're going to be able to accomplish our mission and then you're going to be able to come home. And not some boardroom self-delusion, like you actually believe that you're going to get it done and then be able to bring them home in that time frame. And number three, we're not going in alone; there are allies joining us in the mission. If those three things are in place, then I would consider sending our troops into harm's way.
Anne attended Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., spent a year in Paris and graduated from Finch College in Manhattan, which closed in 1976. She liked to say that she first went to Atlanta to attend the premiere of Gone With the Wind, on Dec. 15, 1939, and never left.
We were in my college apartment after several weeks of hooking up when he said, You feel good. Is this good? Yeah, I said. This is good. I feel good. And he said, I'm happy. And I said, I'm happy. And he said, I like this. And I said, I like you. That was it — not in a that was it, they fell in love kind of way, but in a that was it, he saw the possibility of connection beyond the confines of my bed and got scared and ran away type of way. — Sarah Marlin

I believe your reporters then talked to maybe half a dozen or more of Kim's contemporaries at the organization and found out that those allegations were completely groundless, which they were.
If I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history — if I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, take out the mastermind of 9-11 — if I had told you that we would win marriage equality and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens — if I had told you all that, you might have said our sights were set a little too high.
On the surface, it seems like one of the most joyfully innocent moments in Oscar history: Tatum O'Neal became the youngest competitive winner in history, taking home the 1974 Academy Award for best supporting actress at the age of 10 for the Depression-era comedy Paper Moon. But the story behind her victory is darker, involving a fractured family and bitter controversy surrounding a competitor.
KIDS' WORKSHOP: 'MODEL BUILDERS' at the Bard Graduate Center (Jan. 21, noon to 3 p.m.). When the architect and decorator Charles Percier (1764-1838) designed for Napoleon, he used materials like marble, bronze and gilded wood. The participants in this workshop for ages 6 through 12 will deal with cardboard, foam and corrugated paper, but they'll still emulate the classical forms that he did: domes, arches, columns and pediments. Linked to the center's exhibition Charles Percier: Architecture and Design in an Age of Revolutions, the program will begin with a tour of the show and end with the creation of model buildings.
INVENTGENUITY FESTIVAL AT PUBLIC SCHOOL 32/MIDDLE SCHOOL 442 (Jan. 21-22) Yes, this event celebrates the marriage of invention and ingenuity, and every year hundreds gather in Brooklyn to help create those principles' offspring. An engineering Woodstock for children 7 through 17, this free festival comes from Beam Center, an arts organization offering classes, workshops and summer camps. Inventgenuity features a theme — this year it's Organic Mechanics — and a collaborative project. On Saturday and Sunday, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., participants (registration is required) will construct The Wind Farm, an installation by Mitchell Dose. They'll design and sew inflatable fabric crops that will bloom to life via a hand-built fan. Also on the bill: low-cost workshops to make crawling creature bots, moisture sensors, glowing floral badges and other cool D.I.Y. devices.
It became gradually clear to me, after meeting British science-fiction writers — J. G. Ballard amongst them — that a way to the center for me lay in the fantastic; and despite the very deep loathing of the British literary establishment for any writing that could be so described, I set out to read as many Latin American and Central European writers as possible, finding confirmation in such works as Bulgakov's 'The Master and Margarita' and the writing of Bruno Schulz that there was nothing inherently 'silly,' as the English would have it, in showing the world through lenses both fantastic and real: that the English were indeed limited by a creative feebleness and love of irony which left them out of the most interesting writing, all going on in other parts of the world.
These numbers are impressive; the movies even more so. At some events, female filmmakers sometimes seem to have been invited simply to check a box, a practice that, however well-intentioned, inevitably suggests that women are second-class talent. This year's Sundance, by contrast, underscores that when women receive real opportunities — serious money and institutional support — the pool of work expands, bringing new stories, styles and worldviews. For the 2020 edition, you didn't need to dig to find female talent, make excuses for substandard work or politely yawn through another worthy endeavor. It was right on the screen, blissful and unbound.
Take the story of Nicephoros II Phokas, the ruthless mid-10th-century emperor who turned the tide of Byzantine military fortunes with a series of brilliant victories against Arab armies, culminating in the reconquest of Cyprus and Aleppo. In the summer of 968, the Lombard bishop Luitprand of Cremona visited Constantinople to negotiate a marriage contract between the family of Nicephoros and the future Otto II, king of Italy. Tensions between East and West were running high. Nicephoros treated the bishop shabbily, and Luitprand returned the favor with some unfavorable immortalizations. He is a monstrosity of a man, Luitprand wrote, fat-headed and with tiny mole's eyes. A short, broad, thick beard disfigures him, half going gray and disgraced by a neck scarcely an inch long, which is pig-like by reason of the big close bristles on his beard. In color he is like an Ethiopian and, as the poet says, 'you would not want to meet him in the dark.'
Obviously, the trend of allowing the outside to see the inside is not a new one — gossip and its tabloid incarnations, as well as tell-alls and all the shabby circuses like it, were skulking around well before the digital age ever dawned. But the trend has accelerated in the last few years, as means of communication have mutated and proliferated. It's too easy now to forget that at least some of our utterances are not meant for public consumption.
KK: But access to college is still a civil rights issue in this country.
They should be, I mean clearly. Because if you spend time on these campuses, you know where they're going. So one thing you can do that's very, very fast and immediate is you can become much more flexible in terms of compensation and a type of work environment.
Peppered throughout California books are passages on topics like same-sex families under slavery and early sex reassignment surgery in the 1950s — text that does not appear in Texas versions.

Moments before the impeachment votes, Democrats tried to bring to the floor their own proposal to censure Clinton. But after some debate, their motion was held to be not germane to impeachment and ruled out of order by Representative Ray LaHood, an Illinois Republican whom Speaker Gingrich named to preside over the impeachment proceedings.
I am excited to be back in the classroom and doing what I love to do, which is to teach art, Ms. Pence said in a statement about her new job, conjuring up a world of finger-painting and construction paper that seemed more civilized than the Lord of the Flies playground inhabited by her husband and his colleagues.

There is a long and rich tradition of debate in philosophy and cognitive science about the nature of those entities, which the three main aliens resolve with impressive practical acumen. For them, to acquire a concept is to steal it from the person who explained it, a theft that is consummated by a brisk tap on the forehead. The victim crumples to the ground (there are some variations on this procedure) and then resumes life missing a key piece of mental furniture.
I only watched it because I deal with billionaires all the time covering tech, and I know that billionaire, those wacky billionaires.
The academy's old guard has resisted a dogged push by Netflix to join the best picture club, arguing that, since the streaming service does not release its films in a traditional theatrical manner, its offerings should be better considered by Emmy voters. (Helen Mirren, onstage at the most recent National Association of Theater Owners convention, used an expletive to refer to the company.) Some longtime academy members say that Netflix's campaigning has turned them off, in part because it reminds them of the days when Harvey Weinstein solicited Oscar votes with no-stone-unturned vigor.
There's a sense that Prince Harry and Meghan exploited the goodwill of the queen. They blindsided Buckingham Palace by putting out their announcement the way they did, and also that they kind of want to have it both ways.
Beverly McDonald, who owns the Norfolk branch of the soul food restaurant Croaker's Spot, said she was torn. If Mr. Northam was currently advocating for black communities, the past might not be such a big deal, said Ms. McDonald, who is black.
All the things that made her exciting to young people made her to older Brits more of a threat to the fabric of the royal family, a family they revere as embodying the best of Britain and the greatest times in British history.
And again, all you have to do to look at it is to say, stock market prices and G.D.P. record highs, life expectancy declining. Like, that sums it up. You know? You don't need any clearer divergence than that.
That's quite a soap opera to pile onto poor Dvorak's wonderful and large-spirited quartet. Mr. Gomes is not short of ideas; but almost none of them feel organic. There are forcefully folksy handclaps where the music doesn't call for them; later, when the music develops a folk atmosphere, Mr. Gomes ignores it. Though I believe that there are many such small-town stories to tell, I don't believe the way Mr. Gomes tells this one. He keeps nudging us to notice the same points about the same relationships. The long pas de deux between the husband and wife creates its own clichés.
In an essay published by the Gotham Gazette, Kimberly Watkins alleged that Mr. Yang fired her from Manhattan Prep because he did not think she would continue working as hard after getting married. Mr. Yang appeared on The View shortly after and said there was zero truth to Ms. Watkins's account. After publication, Ms. Watkins reached out to the editorial board, noting the question contained an error — she testified before a New York City hearing on pay equity, but, as she wroteto us , I have on multiple occasions drawn contrast to 'pay equity,' with what I experienced, which concerns long term economic stability. The reality that my economic future was destroyed by Yang, right after my marriage, after an unblemished six-year commitment to this company, has been the focus of my story, not pay inequity…Yang's response [also] grossly overstates the investigative process and draws a false conclusion.
For me the thing began on the night of March fourth and then evolved day by day and that's how I'm going to tell this part of it.

The Baron de Pontalba, enraged when he learned that his daughter-in-law's dowry was to be paid in installments and foiled in his 20-year attempt to seize her property, burst into her bedroom at the family's country estate in France in 1834, took out a pistol and shot her three times in the chest. Wounded but still alive, Micael, as she was known, led him in a chase around the house that ended when the baron, admitting defeat, turned his gun on himself.
MC: So, and we are currently enjoying a businessmen president who has no experience in government or the military.

For centuries, women have been expected to endure bad marriages in many conservative pockets of West Africa. Divorce happened, but most often the husbands were the ones casting off their partners. Tradition has bound women so tightly that spouses are sometimes chosen for babies in the womb.
A White House spokeswoman declined to comment on the book.
I call the approach taken by these rabbis the Tsuris Theory of Jewish Survival. Under this theory, the Jews need external troubles to stay Jewish. Nor has this fearful, negative perspective on Jewish survival been limited to ultra-Orthodox rabbis. Many Jewish leaders, both religious and secular, have argued that Jews need enemies--that without anti-Semitism, Judaism cannot survive. Theodor Herzl, the founder of political Zionism and a secular Jew, believed that our enemies have made us one ... It is only pressure that forces us back to the parent stem. In a prediction that reflects an approach to the survival of Judaism strikingly similar to that of the founder of the Lubavitch Hasidim, Herzl warned that if our Christian hosts were to leave us in peace ... for two generations, the Jewish people would merge entirely into surrounding races. Albert Einstein agreed: It may be thanks to anti-Semitism that we are able to preserve our existence as a race; that at any rate is my belief. Jean-Paul Sartre, a non-Jew, went even further, arguing that the sole tie that binds [the Jewish people together] is the hostility and disdain of the societies which surround them. He believed that it is the anti-Semite who makes the Jew.
The final feature of a covenant is that the relationship is not just about itself; it serves some larger purpose. The obvious one in many cases is raising children. But the deeper one is transformation. People in such a covenant try to love the other in a way that brings out their loveliness. They hope that through this service they'll become a slightly less selfish version of themselves.
One reflection of our country's toxic partisanship is that families may now find dinner-table conversations about politics impossible. Yet if people can't talk about the things that divide us with their families — where there's a background assumption that you should try to stick together even when you disagree — you've got to wonder where they can. So I'd be inclined to have a go at talking to this fellow about his noxious opinions, letting him know what you think. If most of his political discussions are in the echo chamber of social media and on a right-wing radio station, you and your family may be the only fellow citizens of his who have a chance to make him consider other points of view. Supposing that he doesn't respond reasonably — the likeliest outcome, no doubt — you can tell him that you're breaking off with him, and he'll know your reasons. But at least you'll have treated him respectfully, both as someone you had a family connection with and as a fellow American citizen.
So this is not a left or a right idea, this is bipartisan. And many Republicans will see that this is going to be a huge win for their constituents, for rural areas, for red states on the interior. We don't need 80 percent of Congress to pass it, we just need a majority.
Just to be sure I understand, in your mind, would a white man or a white woman who engaged in the same behavior as Rashard Brooks, do you think that they would have also ended up dead?
In the bathroom I applied makeup. Like someone doing a chore. Wiping down a counter. With my mouth meanly clenched. I used to be something, I guess, but now I'm just another big blonde old broad.
Seeing him as needing help, though, suggests that you think he's mentally ill. Of course, it's possible that he is. But his views may have just been heightened by the extreme rhetoric that circulates in social media nowadays. If that's the case, it's not him individually but our civic culture that's in need of help. Casting a social phenomenon as an individual pathology is a perilous temptation. (You can see it in the movement now afoot to medicalize racism as a mental disorder.) In crazy times, you can have crazy views without being insane.
But as I dug into it more and more, I realized that for all the soap opera quality to Harry and Meghan, this story actually does have a deeper dimension and a deeper context.

AK: Speaking of allies, should Ukraine be invited to join NATO? I know that Ukraine's received sort of undue influence on this election, but going forward?
In addition to the nine we already have. I believe that — so if you look at the Constitution, there is nothing there that stipulates the number of Supreme Court justices. We've had fewer than nine, we've had more than nine. I think that appointing new justices would be helpful on several levels. It would help depoliticize the process, at least marginally, because if you have 17 justices and one steps down, then it's not as much of an earthquake. Well, right now we we're hinging our laws on the health of an octogenarian. It would literally be rational for us to all just to follow Ruth Bader Ginsburg around and just scrub any door knob she touches. You know what I mean?
I haven't sat down with a lot of sitting senators and congressmen and women, but I've talked to literally thousands of people who supported Donald Trump in the last election who say they are now supporting me. I've talked to many folks who are Republicans who say they are, at least, sympathetic to my message, in large part because they understand the numbers. When I talked to 70 C.E.O.s here in New York City, not that far from here, it was a fancy bank office, most of them were Republicans. I said, How many of you are looking at replacing your back-office clerical workers with artificial intelligence and software? Guess how many hands went up out of 70. All of them. The truth is, you should fire any C.E.O. who was not looking to make that happen, because their incentives are all tied to the bottom-line profitability of their firm. And most of them were Republicans. So they understand the need for what I am proposing.
Anshai Lal's Phillauri is a Bollywood movie toggling between a contemporary screwball rom-com and a sweeping historical love story. Balancing both proves to be challenging.
Plenty of people regularly ate sandwiches as kids. But few, if any, have spun that experience into culinary gold like Mason Hereford, whose restaurant Turkey and the Wolf in New Orleans was lauded by Bon Appétit as America's best new restaurant in 2017.
No, you're making clear that you do see it. You're saying you have seen acts of racism. So you do see race.
JI: In that system, a lot of that money didn't actually go to treating tobacco-related health problems. A lot of it went to shoring up state budgets, and some of them even went to the tobacco industry actually, so I don't know if that's the best model.
This is a game changer for Americans in any circumstance. And I am not for reducing or curtailing any of these social programs. For me, we're trying to lay a foundation that works for all Americans, and then we need to keep building on top of it. So if there are people that post-Freedom Dividend need additional programs and assistance, I'm all for it.

KIDS 'N COMEDY at the Gotham Comedy Club (Jan. 22, 1 p.m.). This is the annual New Year's Resolution Show, and you know there's at least one vow these teenage and tween comics are dedicated to keeping: to be funny. Their stand-up routines, however, will examine all those broken promises that start accumulating right about now. Although the material is intended for audience members 9 and older, the show rules prohibit profanity (but not politics).

THE ORIGINAL BLACK ELITE: Daniel Murray and the Story of a Forgotten Era, by Elizabeth Dowling Taylor. (Amistad/HarperCollins, $27.99.) Taylor's fascinating and well-researched account of a wealthy black civic leader and businessman (1851-1925) reveals how black Americans benefited from opportunities afforded by Reconstruction policies.
Well, this demanded some time to settle. Okay: Now: It is sometimes true that an apparent suicide will, on inspection, come back a homicide. But that inspection takes about two seconds. It is ten o'clock on a Saturday night, in Destry or Oxville. Some jig has just blown his chick to bits with a shotgun. But a couple of spikes later he hatches a brilliant scheme: He'll make it look like she did it. So he gives the weapon a wipe and props her up on the bed or wherever. He might even muster the initiative to scrawl out a note, in his own fair hand. We used to have one of these notes tacked to the squadroom noticeboard. It read: Good By Crule Whirld. Well this is some sad shit, Marvis, you say when you get there, responding to Marvis's call. What happened? And Marvis says, She was depress. Discreetly, Marvis leaves the room. He's done his bit. What more can a man do? Now it's our turn. You glance at the corpse: There's no burn or shell wadding in the wound and the blood spatter is on the wrong pillow. And the wrong wall. You follow Marvis into the kitchen and he's standing there with a glassine bag in one hand and a hot spoon in the other. Homicide. Heroin. Nice, Marvis. Come on. Downtown. Because you're a murdering piece of shit. And a degenerate motherfucker. That's why.
Diocesan priests, as liaisons between the church hierarchy and the laity, are caught in a morality gap between the two -- asked to promote unpopular views that in many cases they themselves do not share. According to a 1994 Los Angeles Times survey, nearly half of American priests believe that birth control is seldom or never wrong; even more say the same of masturbation. As a result, few Catholics hear preaching on touchy sexual issues on any given Sunday. This is about to change, say the seminarians at Mount Saint Mary's -- they have every intention of preaching on these topics, and some deacons already have done so in the parishes they were assigned to last summer. If people had the great opportunity we have to learn and to pray and to study, Bashista said, maybe they would come to a consensus with what the church is teaching and think of the beauty of it rather than the Thou Shalt Not. And that is our obligation: to preach and to teach the truth in charity and in love, and to be patient. After asking permission from his pastor, Cook preached against contraception in the parish he was assigned in Omaha, Neb., last summer. I was nervous, he recalled. If I hadn't really prayed on it and done it in a way that I think was not overbearing. ... I said: 'What is the nature of marriage? To give of oneself.' I didn't use the word 'contraception' until the end.

Though the powerful pulls of land and home and sense of place persist, one of the primary questions Sugar Run asks is what these concepts even mean now in this country. Maren is masterly at describing America's modern wastelands, the blasted towns not yet and maybe never-to-be the beneficiaries of rehabilitation and reoccupation. The book's landscape is dotted with roadside casino trailers, abandoned mining operations, country brothels set up like prisons with chain-link fences and armed guards to control both the customers and the immigrant prostitutes. Jodi's own brother uses her in an opioid transaction and then threatens her by suggesting that locals might consider Miranda's children better off with a more Christian family. How do you possibly find or make a home under such conditions?
Cleans and Dirties — The two kinds of writers, according to Saul Bellow
And yet, I know this is indulgent. Aggression for aggression's sake goes against the practice of generations of black struggle that have made justice bigger than everybody's anger, black and white. Going off on a white person because she deserves it or because you can is not something Malcolm X, or Martin Luther King Jr., would have approved of — not because it's unwarranted but because it's undisciplined. It's a waste of resources. And then there's the fact that public displays of anger are still risky for black folk. They might land you in jail, or at the very least on the wrong side of authority, potentially heaping injustice on top of waste.
Unlike universal basic income, a system that would provide some cash to every person regardless of income level, a negative income tax system would give cash to people below a certain income threshold. Milton Friedman made the case for the tax as a poverty alleviation tool in his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom.

On a rainy night at the end of September 1943, as the Rosh Hashanah holiday was beginning, the residents of the ghetto decided conditions were right. With rain pounding down, they loosened a sheet of tin on the roof to add to the din. The electrician shorted the electric wires to dim the searchlights. The two hundred and fifty or so remaining residents lined up, the youngest and strongest in the front. The tunnel was claustrophobic, only large enough for one person to crawl through at a time. The lineup ensured that if anyone elderly fainted and blocked the tiny tunnel, there'd be fewer stuck behind. Rae and Lisa, though they were young, decided to stay back with their father. Lashed together with ropes and belts so they wouldn't lose their way, wriggling through a sixty-centimeter-wide dirt tunnel with another human's feet in their faces, all two hundred fifty Jews escaped Novogrudok.
I've been a registered Democrat since the Clinton years; I was an Obama appointee. I had a fund-raiser for John Kerry. It wasn't a great fund-raiser because I was kind of young; it wasn't one of those fancy ones where you generate tens of thousands.
One of the reasons why Donald Trump is our president is that millions of Americans feel like our government is unresponsive to our needs and the needs in our communities. They've been casting about for some sort of change agent for years. And it's not just Donald Trump's victory; it was Bernie Sanders outsized success. In some ways, it was even Obama's victory in 2008. If you remember that campaign, it was oh, hope, change. It was not, get the most experienced person in the seat as possible, because we are decades behind the curve in addressing the problems and challenges that are tearing us apart. Now ——
That's it for this briefing. See you next time. — Andrea
This is — I mean, this is going to make me very sad to say, but I feel like I had an arc or a relationship with President Obama, where it was inspirational when he won. I was celebrating with my wife in the streets. And then over the years I began to feel like we'd missed a great opportunity. So, I'd say there was some heartbreak attached to that. And I worked with the president afterward, and I still admire him a great deal, but I think we could have done a lot more, and I don't think opportunities like that come along very often.

To call Grand Horizons one of the brightest shows to hit Broadway in years is not to tout its intelligence, which flickers. Rather, I mean that it is blindingly lit, no doubt in deference to the theatrical wisdom that defines comedy as what dies in the dark.
Well, I don't know if the experience will be different. I think writers would then write with the knowledge of COVID and what that's done to us in current times. Actors have to feel comfortable in that intimacy on stage. And maybe even more importantly is that audiences need to feel comfortable in sitting shoulder to shoulder again with strangers and 1,000 people in an auditorium and watch stories.

Yet, as The Unicorn begins, their inability to pull the marriage trigger is presented as a mystery, especially to Malory's sexually outré parents, who remain so mutually besotted they renew their vows every year. And when, at their 25th anniversary party, their secret is revealed as a fondness for threesomes, Malory and Caleb decide that, hey, maybe an extra pair of hands — a so-called unicorn — would be just the thing to invigorate their own close encounters.

Underneath, he said, there was a real spiritual poverty. I felt a sense of loneliness and emptiness. Bashista's disquiet culminated one night five years after he'd graduated from college: I was in my apartment, and I was so confused and unhappy. I just felt broken. I was in tears. That night, he said, he turned to God: I said: Lord, I have no other roads to exhaust. I'm going to make a sincere effort to live as You've called me to live. After that night, thoughts of the priesthood began once again to visit Bashista, and finally he made a furtive visit to a chancery office in Charlotte, N.C., where he lived at the time. I thought, I'll just get a book on priesthood, find out what it's all about, he recalled. So the receptionist said, 'Well, let's go up to the library.' Then a priest walked by, and the receptionist goes, 'Wait a minute, that's the vocation director!' I just got a chill. I said, 'Father, I have this friend, ...' and I bombarded him with an hour and a half of questions. At the end he goes, 'You have an awfully inquisitive friend.' Still, Bashista resisted: My response was not yes; it was, I'll consider it. I call it my one-sided argument with Our Lord; it was about four months long. I said, 'I don't have to be a priest to be holy.' Finally the response came: 'You're right, but this is what I call you to.'
Though Derek McLane's set boasts a view out over the roofs of Manhattan, hinting at something symbolic and substantial, the play never quite escapes the room, narrowing to a quarrel about personal choices made in the past. Miller maintained he wrote The Price as a response to the war in Vietnam and that it was not based on his own relationship with his brother, who dropped out of college to shore up the imperiled family business. Neither assertion seems especially credible.
Do you ever find yourself, as a union leader, representing a police officer who has been disciplined and who faces, perhaps, expulsion, termination, and yet, because of a contract, or because of your own union instincts and ethos, you're supposed to defend them? I'm thinking about, for example, officers that we have learned about over the past few years, with 10, 12, 15, 17 complaints of misconduct against them, who end up in one of these shootings. And everyone looks back and says, wow, look at that record. And then I always imagine, and maybe I'm mis-imagining, that there is a union official — maybe he looks like you — and he is defending that officer from being terminated.
The Department of Defense Law of War Manual specifically prohibits acts of hostility … directed against cultural property in the absence of military necessity. Now, the president is threatening to target cultural sites in Iran whose rich cultural heritage spans from the earliest evidence of human domestication of plants and animals to ancient majestic Achaemenid cities and richly tiled Islamic shrines and mosques. Iran is home to 24 World Heritage Sites and thousands of other places that are part of our global shared heritage.
You keep saying feel, and I believe that is a deliberate word choice. But when a Black American is hurt or is killed in one of these interactions, in many cases by a white police officer, do you understand why that doesn't feel like a perception? It's an experience, a reality.

And here lies the crux of their sense of mission, and the optimism that fuels it: the so-called freedoms of our secular and relativistic culture have not paid off, they insist; on the contrary, they have created a dangerous and uninhibited world where families are ravaged by divorce, abortion, addiction and violence. Someone who chooses something they know is destructive, that's not freedom -- that's slavery, said Bashista. Freedom is knowing your choices and then choosing the truth. There is another reason to resist being of this world -- not just for seminarians but also for all fervid Catholics. This world is not the end, Bashista reminded me. That communion we're seeking will happen in the next life. Heaven is the subject of rich fantasy among the seminarians; they imagine it as a place unfettered by limitations of time or space, where they will meet and love the many anonymous strangers they pass each day in restaurants and highways. Jim Crisman, a seminarian from Denver who taught for a time in Slovakia, recalled one day: I'd go to a 4:00 Mass every day in Slovakia, and I'd see the old women coming in. I couldn't communicate with them. And I was thinking, I don't know anything about them, but I will someday. This isn't the last time that I'll see them.

All the different truths are set before us, each given its due, each character fully realized, with the empathy and insight of a gifted novelist.

Of America's Nobel Prize winners in science and economics, nearly 40 percent have been Jews. Of America's 200 most influential intellectuals, half are full Jews, and 76 percent have at least one Jewish parent. Jews attend Ivy League colleges at ten times their presence in the general population. It is no wonder that so many non-Jews believe that we constitute so much higher a percentage of the American population than we actually do. Jews today are equal in virtually every way that matters. What could not have been said even at the end of the 1980s can be said today: American Jews are part of the American mainstream; we are truly victims no more.
Mr. Yang argues that the automation of manufacturing jobs — especially in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri and Iowa — helped breed the discontent and economic desperation that led to Mr. Trump's election.

I grew up in an entirely secular household. My parents did not talk about God in the house, but I had this instinctive belief in a higher power. I had many Christian relatives. I went to church over holidays growing up quite often. And then I married my wife, Evelyn, who's Christian. And so, we're raising our kids in a Christian church. I go to church when I'm home, which is not very often unfortunately nowadays. I enjoy it. My faith is still very much a journey, but I'm unreservedly thrilled about the impact it has on my wife, my boys, my family, my community.

Yes she's gone, I said. By her own hand.
Yeah. As far as, OK, the first one that you talked about — that Officer Rolfe's life was never in danger — well, let's not forget, there was a fight ensued. One officer did go to the hospital with a concussion. And I guess it depends on whether you subscribe to that a taser is not a deadly weapon.
If we are to counteract this trend, we must understand the dynamics of contemporary assimilation and not confuse them with past episodes of assimilation, which were based largely on the perceived need to escape from the burdens of Jewish identification. Today, there are no burdens from which to escape. Being Jewish is easy, at least in relation to external burdens. Jews today assimilate not because Christianity or Islam is better or easier, but because Jewish life does not have a strong enough positive appeal to offset the inertial drift toward the common denominator. Jews do not convert to Christianity; they convert to mainstream Americanism, which is the American religion closest to Judaism. They see no reason not to follow their heart in marriage, their convenience in neighborhoods, their economic opportunities in jobs, their educational advantages in schools, their conscience in philosophy, and their preferences in lifestyle. Most Jews who assimilate do not feel that they are giving up anything by abandoning a Jewishness they know little about. They associate the Judaism they are abandoning with inconvenient rituals and rules that have no meaning to them. As one young woman remembers her Jewishness: An old man saying no.
When Mr. Rainey opened Hung on You in 1965, he had little fashion or tailoring experience, but the store flourished as part of a vanguard of hip London shops like Granny Takes a Trip. His frilly shirts, jackets with velvet cuffs, kipper ties, lemon-hued sharkskin suits, Great Leap Forward Mao jackets and reworked military uniforms turned customers into peacocks.
Mark, what has been the reaction inside Britain to this seismic disruption to the royal family?
Coming days will determine how far this goes, but for the moment the nation faces, for all intents and purposes, the makings of a civil insurgency. What makes this insurgency unusual in American history is that it is based on Trump's false claim that he, not Joe Biden, won the presidency, that the election was stolen by malefactors in both parties, and that majorities in both branches of Congress no longer represent the true will of the people.

If you look at our proposals, we have a tax on financial transactions, which would obviously end up falling most heavily on the wealthiest Americans and the wealthiest companies. We have a carbon tax, which tends to fall most heavily on the wealthiest industries, which are emitting a lot. The value-added tax would obviously be enormously generative from people who benefit from society and consume the most. I'm for trying to restore our income tax levels to previous levels to be more progressive.

And yet Proust was not always so appreciated, and even his chief defenders were capable of making snide remarks about him. Robert de Montesquiou (whose arch manners and swooping intonations Proust loved to imitate and whose life provided Proust with the main model for his most memorable character, the baron de Charlus) said that Proust's work was a mixture of litanies and sperm (a formula that he considered to be a compliment). Gide accused him of having committed an offense against the truth (Gide was irritated that Proust never acknowledged his own homosexuality in print nor ever presented homosexual inclinations in an attractive light). Lucien Daudet, a young writer with whom Proust had an affair (Proust liked artistic young men with mustaches and dark eyes: that is, those who resembled himself), at one point told Cocteau that Proust was an atrocious insect. Lucien's father, Alphonse Daudet, one of the most celebrated writers of the generation before Proust's, though now largely forgotten, announced, Marcel Proust is the devil! He might well have taken such a position, since it was Proust's seven-volume novel, Remembrance of Things Past (in recent editions, translated more literally as In Search of Lost Time), that surpassed--indeed, wiped out--the fiction written in the two decades before him. Who today reads Anatole France, Paul Bourget, Maurice Barres, or even Alphonse Daudet? Paul Claudel, the arch-Catholic poet and playwright, described Marcel as a painted old Jewess.

She eventually relented: Mr. Biden was chosen as President Barack Obama's vice president in 2008 after an unsuccessful presidential run. As second lady, she relished the relative anonymity teaching provided, noting in interviews that her students often did not recognize her.

Once, a senior associate for whom I was working berated me for such a mistake and said, Getting these things right is the easy part, and if you can't get that right, what does it say about your ability to analyze the law properly? I learned my lesson. To restore the focus-training function of the classroom, I stopped allowing laptops in class early in my teaching career. Since then research has confirmed the wisdom of my choice.
I'd like to amend the caption for the illustration of medieval tooth extraction that accompanied Josephine Livingstone's review of Jack Hartnell's Medieval Bodies: Life and Death in the Middle Ages and Sylvia Townsend Warner's The Corner That Held Them (Jan. 5). The image, taken from the 14th-century London encyclopedia Omne Bonum, shows a dental instrument on a belt or snakeskin with sewn-in teeth. Such devices were used by itinerant dentists rather like a modern pair of pliers, often at country fairs. Ouch.
Many of their contemporaries regarded the idea of a Catholic intellectual as a contradiction in terms, believing that the repressive Roman church prohibited freedom of thought. The converts were eager to prove otherwise; their work in history, science, literature, and philosophy was designed to substantiate their belief that Catholicism was intellectually liberating rather than restrictive, despite the church's dogmatic style and hierarchical structure. They wrote partly for a Catholic audience, to be sure, but more for their Protestant and skeptical contemporaries, hoping to vindicate their own conversions by persuading others to follow them. To win more converts they knew that they would have to improve intellectual standards within Catholicism. History written in the form of pious hagiography and retrospective justification of every Catholic position, for example, would never convince Protestants and skeptics; it was annoying rather than persuasive to all but the most devout believer. Catholic history would henceforth have to be deeply researched, impartial in evaluating evidence, stylistically elegant, and vigorously argued. The same would have to be true in all other disciplines too. In urging such changes and in trying to set an example in their own work, however, convert intellectuals did not mean to abandon apologetics. Rather, they introduced a more circumspect apologetics, calculated to attract other intellectuals by appealing to them in their own idiom.

So it was very natural for me to run as a Democrat. I've ruled out completely any third-party bid because that would in my mind increase the chances of Donald Trump winning, and the mission is to defeat Donald Trump and help move the country forward.
Mr. Yang has frequently reiterated his commitment to a two-state solution but has not released any detailed plans about how he would advance an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan or address Mr. Trump's policies in the region. He told the Council on Foreign Relations, I don't want to prescribe the specifics of a two-state solution, as the Israeli and Palestinian people both need to be leading any conversation, and I look forward to engaging with all stakeholders.

A girls' trip with monastic overtones, Jessica Dickey's new play goes on retreat with a group of women trying to live like medieval nuns (though likely practicing better personal hygiene). Daniel Talbott directs the all-female cast, which includes Lisa Ramirez and Samantha Soule, as they recede from modernity.
SS: O.K. Again, about your responsibilities as president. One of the heaviest ones would be waging war. When you look back on the conflicts into which recent presidents have put us, would you support this? Is this something you would have done in Syria, in Libya, in Kosovo? Would you have sent troops there?
This dirty, darling eight-episode series is a teen sex comedy, a perceptive family dramedy and a thoughtful examination of the roles sex and sexuality play in how we construct our social identities. Otis (Asa Butterfield) is a high school student whose mother, Jean (Gillian Anderson), is a sex and relationship therapist. Some of her therapeutic techniques have rubbed off on her anxious son, and he slowly becomes a therapist to his classmates.
Ms. Bezos, 48, has written two books. In 2005, she published The Testing of Luther Albright: A Novel, a psychological thriller set in Sacramento, Calif. The New York Times called it a quietly absorbing first novel. Her second book, Traps, is a tale of four women who meet on a road trip to Las Vegas.
That is correct. But when I've dug into it, very, very few Americans are getting $1,000 in food stamps. And most of the people who are on government assistance live in fear of losing that assistance because there are various requirements that tend to come with it. And when, if you ask them, say, Hey, would you prefer $1,000 unconditional that you can rely upon, they actually think that's too good to be true.
Still, recent textbooks have come a long way from what was published in past decades. Both Texas and California volumes deal more bluntly with the cruelty of the slave trade, eschewing several myths that were common in textbooks for generations: that some slave owners treated enslaved people kindly and that African-Americans were better off enslaved than free. The books also devote more space to the women's movement and balance the narrative of European immigration with stories of Latino and Asian immigrants.
Unlike universal basic income, a system that would provide some cash to every person regardless of income level, a negative income tax system would give cash to people below a certain income threshold. Milton Friedman made the case for the tax as a poverty alleviation tool in his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom.
You say we must draw this to a close, Watts continued, I say we must draw a line between right and wrong, not with a tiny fine line of an executive fountain pen, but with the big fat lead of a No. 2 pencil. And we must do it so every kid in America can see it. The point is not whether the President can prevail, but whether truth can prevail.
His death was announced by his son, Dean Parisot, a film director and producer in Los Angeles. The cellist had retired from Yale only last June.
Senna might be flighty, but she is always grounded by Ms. Stone, who understands that this is a character that ought to be sold through presence, not performance. Her portrayal here is all ease and glowing smiles — she is a femme fatale reborn as a family-friendly comedian.
So if that's your problem, you have to go and try and solve it directly by getting into the guts of the apps and say, What are the design choices you made? Let's calibrate them so they actually balance our kids' health and not just your financial returns. So that's one way she's missing the point.
Ms. Green said she preferred to assign primary sources that encourage students to explore history on their own. But she said she would welcome textbooks that contain more historical documents and a greater diversity of voices and themes from the past.
JW: You remember what happened the last time a president tried to do this, right?
But jobs in finance and sales didn't pan out. His marriage fell apart, and a contentious divorce kept him from seeing his young daughter and two sons for long periods. Unemployed and homeless, he spent months living out of his Ford Fusion, he said in an interview with U.S.A. Swimming's website in 2018. He kept up his gym membership, he said, only so he would have a place to shower.
I think the narrative we continue to see is that of a scandalous affair, but ultimately it was a great love story, McKinley Agee said.
We will forever be saddened that his life was cut short by this devastating disease, his family said in a statement. He achieved a lot in his 24 years, but we will never get the chance to see how much more Harry could have done.
But Texas students will read that some critics dismissed the quality of literature produced.
Bernard Grofman, a political scientist at the University of California, Irvine, put it this way in an email:
But it was Foolish Pleasure who brought Mr. Jolley his first measure of track immortality.
So I have a three-part test for sending troops into harm's way. Number one, it needs to advance a vital American interest or avert a humanitarian catastrophe. Number two, it has to have a clearly defined timeline where we can look troops in the eyes and say, It's going to take this long and you're going to be able to accomplish our mission and then you're going to be able to come home. And not some boardroom self-delusion, like you actually believe that you're going to get it done and then be able to bring them home in that time frame. And number three, we're not going in alone; there are allies joining us in the mission. If those three things are in place, then I would consider sending our troops into harm's way.
So if you had, for example, a rule that said, Look, the government is allowed to match whatever salary a private sector employee is being offered, then you'd have more success. If you said, Look, you don't need to move to Washington, D.C., and sit in the thing that was built decades ago, that's like solace, and you have this giant parking lot and you just feel miserable being there for like a day, let alone a career.
Okay. But you're going to have to take me by the scene.
Right. How do you look at the controversy right now? I just interviewed Jason Kilar. It caused quite a stir. What are messages you're getting from your agents?
The play, which ended a successful run in London last month, is moving to the Samuel J. Friedman Theater in September. It centers on a couple who, after 50 years of marriage, struggle to cope with change and uncertainty. The actors Jonathan Pryce and Eileen Atkins, who starred in the London production, will reprise their roles as husband and wife. Jonathan Kent (Long Day's Journey Into Night) will direct.
The simplicity of her prose belies a complexity of thought that would have been necessary to edit V. S. Naipaul (or survive a dinner with Jean Rhys); though Athill may not have been afraid of death, she didn't think it was simple, either. She just didn't dwell on its complexities. I swallowed her words like barbiturates and they killed the fear. I think that underneath, or alongside, a reader's conscious response to a text, Athill writes, whatever is needy in him is taking in whatever the text offers to assuage that need. Guilty as charged.
How did you think about this scene?
Mr. Bezos, who spent summers working at his grandfather's cattle ranch in Texas, also went to Princeton, where he studied computer science. He described his younger self in the Wired profile as a professional dater who had set up a systemic approach to dating modeled after the criteria investment bankers used to analyze deals. (He added then it did not work.)
I explained all that as we sat knee to knee, relishing our newfound voices, and then read Ms. Oliver's lines out loud, especially focusing on the last one: I don't want to end up simply having visited this world.
The textbook companies are not gearing their textbooks toward teachers; they're gearing their textbooks toward states, she said.
BA: But you're not proposing to fix any of that. People don't just work to make money; they do work for a sense of self-worth. They work so that they can develop skills, they work so they have the possibility of earning more money someday. You're proposing to replace a portion of the income they may have lost, but not any of those other things. Why is that a solution?
The events and emotions of that marriage turn up again and again in Dick's novels, transfigured into science fiction. Anne Dick, as Ms. Rubenstein became, made custom jewelry, which was a major plot element in his best-known novel, The Man in the High Castle. Their children's Barbies are featured in The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, where colonists on Mars escape their wretched existence with reality-altering drugs and Perky Pat dolls.
President Obama referred to education as the civil rights issue of our time, as did former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. Indeed, the gap between education outcomes for black and white students has barely budged in recent decades, according to research from the Brookings Institution.
It went on to win accolades at smaller festivals across the globe and is still riding high. It has a 99 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and, in December, The New York Times critic A.O. Scott named it the best movie of 2019.
Eventually she moved in with my aunt and uncle, who live in a log house in Washington. I flew out last spring to help take care of her. One morning before dawn, she entered the guest room where I was sleeping. She had no pants on. Soft light filtered in through the open window, and she flicked on the lights to signal what she thought was waking time. Her knees shook beneath her as she stood on unsteady feet. I told her to go back to bed, but she couldn't make sense of my words without her hearing aids. Instead, she repeated the nonsense phrase she thought she heard: Go that to said? It's a game she and her sisters used to play, only now the game gets played every day.
On the island of Tasmania, more than 50 wildfires were burning, and farmers were bracing for more. And in Elizabeth North, a town north of Adelaide, the Red Lion Hotel promised free beer if the temperature reached 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) — and then had to deliver.
Harris Wofford, a former United States senator from Pennsylvania whose passion for getting people involved helped create John F. Kennedy's Peace Corps, Bill Clinton's AmeriCorps and other service organizations and made him America's volunteer in chief, died on Monday night in Washington. He was 92.
KK: For millions of Americans, church and religion are the centers of their communities. Do you believe in God? Do you go to church regularly? Who are your spiritual advisers?
No matter what Axe does, he will always be on the outside looking in. Even if he were interested in making people forget his working-class roots, the manner in which he earned — and continues to maintain — his billionaire status cannot be forgotten. To a certain extent, Axe knows this already, which is why he delights in wearing a heavy-metal T-shirt to formal occasions, thumbing his nose at New York City royalty. Yet no amount of money is enough for him to buy out Foley's scrap metal supplier, who will lose in penalties, fines, and endless governmental harassment whatever he gains upfront. And while Axe's gambit of arranging an animal conservation honor to present to Foley earns him a meeting, Foley uses the opportunity to make it clear that certain pathways to power aren't available to him. Nice try, but don't bother, Foley effectively tells him. There's nothing for you here.
She was an integral part of its origin story, driving to Seattle in 1994 while Mr. Bezos sat in the passenger seat, working on the nascent company's business plan. She was Amazon's first accountant and was involved in its transformation from a small online bookseller to the e-commerce behemoth it is today, the second company in American history to be valued at over a trillion dollars.
Caldwell's book is noteworthy for being a conservative account that effectively reinforces a liberal ideological narrative. It is usually liberals who argue that on every new culture-war battlefield their side is just extending Martin Luther King Jr.'s vision, while conservatives respond that the civil rights acts were supposed to correct a specific historical injustice and their application to debates over gender or marriage or abortion or the rights of illegal immigrants warps that purpose. Caldwell shrugs off this idea as a pleasant illusion; in his account the original critics of civil rights legislation were probably correct to warn against its revolutionary implications, which include the steady subsequent advance of cultural progressivism, an enormous expansion of deficit spending and the economic abandonment and cultural vilification of the white male working class.
Dr. Glauber's seminal work addressed an area of research that had been largely ignored in quantum physics. For much of the first half of the 20th century, physicists had concentrated on trying to understand the nature of matter, neglecting the field of optics. That began to change with the development of the laser in 1960. Physicists wanted to understand how it worked vis-à-vis quantum mechanics, the mysterious rules that govern subatomic particles.
And although there was great interest in him before take-off time (his hope and that of his rivals to fly the Atlantic had excited wide newspaper coverage), Lindbergh had not calculated the response to his achievement, the degree to which he would be lionized or the extent to which he would be regarded as public property, especially by reporters and photographers, whom he came quickly to detest. 'Extraordinary Situation' The situation I encountered was extraordinary in the extreme, and often fantastic, he recalled, and cited, as an example, a woman who wanted to rent the hotel room I was leaving so she could take a bath in the same tub. Overwhelmed, without precedents to guide him, pressed by dizzying demands on his time, Lindbergh was happy to accept an invitation from Harry Guggenheim, a very rich and very conservative financier who was connected with the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics, to escape for a while to his Long Island estate. The invitation was at the suggestion of Dwight Morrow, the Morgan banker, who told Mr. Guggenheim, Harry, almost everyone in the country is after this young fellow, trying to exploit him. Isn't there something you and the fund can do, to save him from the wolves? At Falaise, the Guggenheim castle, which was perhaps the most opulent private home he had stayed in, the aviator was able to catch his breath for three weeks and rewrite the ghostwritten manuscript that became the book We.
So if that's your problem, you have to go and try and solve it directly by getting into the guts of the apps and say, What are the design choices you made? Let's calibrate them so they actually balance our kids' health and not just your financial returns. So that's one way she's missing the point.
Many of Mr. Yang's supporters say they are drawn to his perspective as a political outsider; in The Wall Street Journal, some say they previously supported Senator Sanders but now look for a candidate who offers an even fresher non-Washington perspective.
Serge Schmemann: Yeah. And staying with relationships and alliances, President Trump has reversed several key policies the United States has had toward Israel. He's moved the embassy to Jerusalem, he's recognized sovereignty over the Golan Heights, et cetera, et cetera. Would you reverse those?
Jaap van Zweden, the music director designate of the New York Philharmonic, built up good will with the orchestra's extended audience on Tuesday evening when he announced the details of his first season, which begins in September. He enthusiastically discussed his plans and programming, including five premieres he will conduct, the introduction of two new-music series tied to themes the season will explore, and much more. It was an auspicious occasion for the Philharmonic.
I think it's actually unfortunate that I get asked about those sorts of questions, in the sense that I feel like men should leave the room and let women decide what to do with your bodies. I have a feeling I know what you would decide, and then we could come back and say, Hey, what did you decide? I also think that if men got pregnant, this would be a very, very different conversation. And we'd have a completely different approach to these issues. So, I don't have a short list of Supreme Court justice appointees, but safeguarding women's reproductive rights and having an evolving sense of the law would be very important.
It wasn't supposed to be that way. Owusu was raised to feel as if she could live anywhere. I know how my parents believed their love and the birth of their daughters to be a part of something important, she writes, a movement fueled by borderless love. Her father's family lamented his decision to marry a white woman. Any river loses its identity when entering the sea, they said. The marriage failed; Owusu had to struggle to piece together who she was, where she belonged, whom she loved. Was her father's family right?
I believe your reporters then talked to maybe half a dozen or more of Kim's contemporaries at the organization and found out that those allegations were completely groundless, which they were.
After a painfully dark — some would say unflinchingly realistic — first season, viewers could be forgiven for squirming away from HBO's Divorce, starring Sarah Jessica Parker and Thomas Haden Church as Frances and Robert DuFresne, New York suburbanites putting their marriage out of its misery. But those who've braved Round 2 have been rewarded with sunbeams through parting clouds. The papers are signed, leaving the couple free to move on to other partners (Steven Pasquale for her, Becki Newton for him) and, perhaps more important, to become the better people they somehow couldn't muster in each other's company.
— how are you doing? Are you O.K.? And she looks visibly moved, visibly emotional.
John F. Kelly, as White House chief of staff, presented himself as the man leading a charge of country first, president second. The attorney general suggested administering lie-detector tests to the small group of people with access to transcripts of the president's calls with foreign leaders. And President Trump sought a list of enemies working in the White House communications shop.

Mr. Yang was asked on CNN's The Van Jones Show about cancel culture and whether Americans have gone too far in the direction of a lack of grace or a lack of forgiveness. He responded: I'm new to politics, but I certainly would hate to be judged by something I did 25 years ago.
In Architectural Digest: Autobiography of a Magazine 1920-2010, her 2018 book about her tenure, Ms. Rense made clear her vision. I was not interested in trends, and certainly not in fads, she wrote. I preferred to speak of style, which is really a way of seeing and living creatively in the world.
archived recording (andrew cuomo) Look, if you listen to what the secretary said, if you listen to what the president says, they're saying what they said three months ago. They're basically in denial about the problem. They don't want to tell the American people the truth. And they don't want to have any federal response, except supporting the states, supporting the states.

Ms. Vidaurri, who was nicknamed La Calandria, or the Lark, belted out songs with a powerful voice, often making risqué wisecracks during her performances. Based in San Antonio, she sang in Mexico, Cuba and other parts of Latin America, performing with artists like Nat King Cole, Eydie Gorme & Los Panchos and Celia Cruz. By the 1950s she was mentioned alongside such famous Tejana entertainers as Eva Garza and Lydia Mendoza.

WASHINGTON — In a week of White House tantrums and fast-food dinners, of canceled speeches and aborted congressional trips, it seemed fitting that Karen Pence, the wife of Vice President Mike Pence, announced that she was going back to her job as an elementary schoolteacher.
To those who look to Israel as Judaism's sole salvation, I say, Keep trying to get Jews from throughout the Diaspora to make aliyah. Maybe you are right. But we cannot count on Zionism and aliyah alone, because maybe you are wrong. Maybe most Jews will want to remain where they and their families have established a comfortable home. Maybe they will not come to Israel. Maybe Israel will not endure forever as a Jewish state. Maybe it will normalize--as Theodor Herzl put it--and become like most other states, which began as religious but became secular and multicultural over time.
J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, was an unpublished, unemployed single mother in Edinburgh in 1995 when she sent Mr. Little the first three chapters of her first book after finding his name in a directory of literary agents. Knowing nothing about the business, she picked him because his name made him sound like a character from a children's book.

Mr. Conrad's fearlessness and good looks served him well in Wild Wild West and many other shows, though he found the most satisfaction in some later, meatier roles, like the fur trader he played in the mini-series Centennial in the late 1970s.
He looked like he was still trying to smile his way past it. The smile now starting to plead. They had David one year, Yehoshua the next. And then, a decade and a half later: Jennifer.
Kate Wilhelm, a prolific, prizewinning author of science fiction and mystery novels, died on March 8 in Eugene, Ore. She was 89.
If ever I can find some healing and some comfort — it has to be with somebody who is not part of all my world of past and pain, she wrote. I can find that now — if the world will let us.
Well, the one thing I know for sure is that human beings love being told a story. And whether you're two or 102, you want to be told a story. You want to be taken away.
Immanuel Kant begins his Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals by declaring that the only thing that can be called good without qualification is a good will. By a good will, he meant, roughly, the desire to do what the moral law requires just because the moral law requires it. But beyond the Kantian worry — that your desire to do the right thing is enmeshed with a desire for revenge — is a psychological one: Your pain and outrage could hamper your assessment of what you ought to do.
With only one change in the lineup — Peter Wiley replaced Mr. Soyer, who was a decade older than the others, in 2001 — the group performed and recorded for the next 45 years, appearing all over the world and introducing countless concertgoers to the beauties of a well-played quartet.
Jeneen Interlandi: Oh no, go ahead.
In chapters 5, 6, and 7, I explore the most frequently proposed solutions to the problem of assimilation. To those who are sure that return to religion is Judaism's only salvation, I say, Get as many to return as you can. Maybe you are right. But we cannot rely exclusively on your solution, because maybe you are wrong. Maybe not enough Jews will become religious. Maybe religion--at least as currently defined and practiced--is not the wave of the future for most young intellectuals. Maybe there is a strand of Judaism that can survive and thrive without exclusive dependence on theology and ritual. After all, the Yiddish secularism that flourished between the beginning of the Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah) and the Second World War was an authentic Jewish culture, which was destroyed by external forces. Political Zionism, which grew largely out of that culture, remains an authentic Jewish civilization of enormous importance to the survival of Judaism. Today's influential American Jewish community is largely secular.
Young people thought of her as perhaps a vehicle for changing an institution that at some level they revered but probably thought of as somewhat outmoded. But —
In a 2011 interview with Atlanta magazine, which noted that she had a cardboard cutout of President Barack Obama in her living room, she credited her father for her lifelong affiliation with the Democratic Party. I remember someone asked Daddy if he would ever think of voting for a Republican, she said, and he said, 'Sure I would, if I ever found one worth voting for.'
Ms. Rense was known as a highly competitive, sometimes spiteful tastemaker who insisted on exclusivity and brooked no pushback from designers she had snubbed. Those who crossed her were often said to be banned forever from the magazine's pages.
Among the guild's original-screenplay nominees are three movies that won Golden Globes on Sunday. They are the war film 1917, which took the Globe for best drama; the South Korean sensation Parasite, the Globes' foreign-language film winner; and the divorce dramedy Marriage Story, which netted Laura Dern a supporting-actress Globe. The WGA Award category was filled out by the mystery Knives Out and the acclaimed teen comedy Booksmart.
espouse positive manhood to include living in cooperation, respect, appreciation, courage, and fearlessness about being fully human. We do not see negativity, shame, unwarranted violence and aggression, gender domination, or hate and prejudice as ways to promote a better quality of life for any one of us.
This year's nominations include just one actor of color (Cynthia Erivo), and eight of the nine best picture nominees feature overwhelmingly white casts. (Bong Joon Ho's Parasite is the exception.) Still, the academy is on track to reach its diversity targets by this summer, according to a spokeswoman. In total, it has grown by more than 3,000 new members since 2016, a nearly 50 percent increase.

I'm not sure why there's all this conversation about Tulsi's position right now, he wrote in an email. Her position changed a long time ago. So, I'm not sure why it's coming out now.
BA: Just before we move on, maybe I can ask one more question.
Generally speaking, I think we have become overly aggressive and optimistic about what we can accomplish in various foreign theaters. I've signed a pledge to end the forever wars because I don't believe it's the will of the American people for us to be in a constant state of armed conflict in foreign theaters for years and even decades at a time. Our Constitution says that it's in Congress's hands to declare war, but Congress has completely ceded this authority through the A.U.M.F. [Authorization for Use of Military Force] and then just said, Hey, executive branch, you can do what you want. And now they want nothing to do with it, and that is not the will of the American people, and it's not the will of the Constitution. So we should repeal the A.U.M.F. and say, Look, Congress, if we want to authorize armed conflict, it should be on you and it should be the will of the people.

Australia — again — is in the midst of one of its hottest summers on record. In the southeast, where most people live, aging coal-powered plants struggled to cope with demand on Friday, with more than 160,000 households temporarily losing power.
In fact, he argued, the guidelines specifically encourage a kind of competitiveness, citing a section that reads,
Unsurprisingly, their experiences diverge. The husband, Owen, essentially jumps into bed with the first hot single woman he meets, only to find that she is kind of unhinged as well as much more annoying than his wife. The wife, Lucy, embarks on an orderly affair with a man who's up for some no-strings-attached sex once a week, and the two inconveniently fall in love.
Oh, that but that's another person. That's another person. A twin, the evil twin — it has to be another person.
Growing up on the prairies, I formed a vision of the American South based almost exclusively on James Dickey's Deliverance — first the 1970 novel and later the 1972 movie, Burt Reynolds heading deep into rural Georgia with three buddies to battle a landscape so bloody and beautiful it seemed an honor just to be there even as they tried desperately to escape. But it was another Dickey book, the sweet love letter to literature Metaphor as Pure Adventure, that taught me the pleasures of writing. One begins with the sensible world, which in its entirety is a gift, and a gift also in each of its parts, he proclaims. But there is a second gift that you give yourself, based on the world's great gift. . . . those pictures of the world inside one's head; pictures made of the real world but pictures that one owns, that one infuses with one's own personality. They are fragments of the world that live not with the world's life but with ours.
How goes it with you, Colonel Tom? My dear.
Mr. Trump likes to say that the economy has reached historic highs under his administration. However, life expectancy has been falling and other measures of well-being have declined, including rising rates of depression diagnosis.
Federal authorities are said to be looking into Bitcoin donations made to people who breached the Capitol last week. Supporters of President Trump were forced off the Capitol grounds after a mob breached the building on Jan. 6. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times Federal authorities are investigating several Bitcoin donations made to right-wing figures ahead of the assault on the Capitol last week, according to a person briefed on the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly about it. A single donor from France appears to have sent around $500,000 in Bitcoin in early December to several figures involved in far right activist circles, according to an investigation published Thursday by the cryptocurrency data firm Chainalysis. Authorities are looking into whether the donations were linked to the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. The existence of the investigation was first reported by Yahoo News. The single largest donation that Chainalysis found, which was worth around $250,000 at the time, went to a Bitcoin wallet owned by Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist who was at the Capital building on Jan. 6 and who called for violence before the event. Mr. Fuentes has previously mocked journalists on Twitter who asked him about his involvement in the event. Other donations went to the right-wing social media network Gab and the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, Chainalysis said. By Jan. 6, the value of the donations had grown because of the soaring price of Bitcoin.
It took Alison Stevenson eight months to find a pandemic friend with benefits. Along the way, she had an intense, short-lived texting relationship that ended when the man on the other end told her he was getting back together with his ex. Then came two disappointing outdoor dates, including one with a guy who made fun of her for asking him to keep his mask on. I needed a 'situationship,' said Ms. Stevenson, a 31-year-old comedian and writer in Los Angeles. A person I can rely on and trust to hang out with once a week. The effort could mean setting boundaries and conditions from the outset, like regular testing (keep in mind that tests can show false negatives, especially if the amount of the virus in the body is too small to be detected, and that whoever is taking the test could be infected while waiting for results), quarantining before meeting and sticking to a single partner. As they negotiate, people are finding that the key to dating now is what it's always been: trust. And ultimately for many single people, hooking up has been worth the increased risk of contracting the virus. Everything I enjoy doing has been taken away from me, said Emmy Nicholson, a 26-year-old publicist in Brooklyn. But there's one thing they can't take away, and that's having sex.
BA: You've expressed profound distrust of market forces. You just compared the major tech companies to drug dealers, and you want the N.S.A. to outsource national security work to them?

But it isn't just scale. The numbers tell a story. Only eight works from the 1980s and '90s are being revived, in effect conceding that that era was, as it is now generally remembered, a gloomy mourning period of anxiety, short on pathbreaking inspiration. Five of those eight are by Peter Martins, who has led City Ballet since Balanchine's death, and who, despite considerable skill, didn't turn out to be his equal as a genius choreographer.
Any American who wants to gamble online on a poker site can do so from any state in the country right now. If it's illegal in your state, you just end up using an offshore betting site, which is shady, has problems, but it's not going to ease your gambling addiction at all. So the question is, do we want Americans, in the vast majority of the country, on offshore betting sites, dealing with shady characters and generating no revenue and still being addicted? Or would we prefer that they do business with American firms, where we do have better regulations, we know they're not getting cheated, we know they're not getting exploited, and you generate tax revenue that you can use to treat gambling addiction.
Donald Trump tapped into that. He did tap into that. Some people felt it was the right thing to do, to say, and they followed him by the millions, as we find out. However, when you look at it and assess it — and I think history will be accurate in this — they will realize that there was emptiness to Donald Trump's words. There was impulse to it but not strategy. There was hyperbole without wisdom. And I think that's what will be his legacy. Whereas Howard Beale spewed emotional frustration and intellectual thought and then let the chips fall where they may, and I think that's the difference.
The Regime of Covenants acknowledges the fact that we don't really choose our most important attachments the way you choose a toaster. In the flux of life you meet some breathtakingly amazing people, usually in the swirl of complex circumstances. There is a sense of being blown around by currents more astounding than you can predict and control. Mostly you're bumblingly trying to figure out the right response to the moments you're in.
The judge said the case had hinged on Mr. Zhao's mental state at the time of the shooting and whether he had the intent necessary for the crime to qualify as murder.
Yet, an analysis of all 91 best picture winners reveals only two (as previously noted) with major plot points about filmmaking. If this analysis is expanded to all 563 best picture nominees, only nine fit the bill: Once Upon a Time, The Artist and Argo, along with the 1937 version of A Star Is Born, Sunset Boulevard (1950), All That Jazz (1979), The Aviator (2004), Hugo (2011) and La La Land (2016). (The 2018 rendition of A Star Is Born swapped out film stars for pop stars and the other versions weren't nominated for best picture.)
When read in order, the answers to the starred clues will reveal the ultimate 60 Across. (Those starred clues are 16-across, 36-across, 65-across, and 68-across.) During the party, I cryptically told Will (Yes, Will Shortz was at my wedding!) that I was counting on him for something but he'd have to figure out what it was. He nodded, grinned, and accepted my challenge. (None of my five test solvers had grokked this last layer, so I deemed it best to offer the prompt, even to the puzzle master himself).
MC: He has my vote. All right. [LAUGHTER]
LEE After last year's ceremony, I said, It ain't gonna be like this next year! It's always feast or famine with us.
About 14.6 million babies were born in China in 2019, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. That was a nearly 4 percent fall from the previous year, and the lowest official number of births in China since 1961, the last year of a widespread famine in which millions of people starved to death. That year, only 11.8 million babies were born.
We'll be right back. So Mark, what does happen next in this story?
NF: I mean, is there still a role for 20th-century antitrust?
For me, things hopefully come together. Obviously you have to know your lines and know them well enough in front of a crowd, [so] you harness their attention. There's also the accent: Seretse Khama had a Botswana accent, but he also spent a lot of time in the U.K., so his accent was a hybrid. And sometimes the emotion can take over and the technical aspects can go by the wayside, and you don't want that to happen. Then there's the truth of what he's saying, the emotional truth. None of the technical work means anything unless there is an emotional connection — for you as the actor but also to the people you're delivering the speech to and then the audience as well.
One, it's a lot easier and cheaper for us to throw kids into a classroom with textbooks and a teacher and say, You're going to go to college, than it is to try and train them in skills that are going to give them a secure livelihood. Number two, we have fetishized college and stigmatized anything that's not college. We've beaten Americans over the head, pretended everyone's going to college and say, It's going to work for you. And the Democrats are guilty of this. That's why they're yelling, Free college, free college. Meanwhile, again, only 33 percent of Americans are going to go to college, and that is a relatively stable number.
So when I heard that Shane Gillis had called me Jew chink — I think was the slur — my reaction was the same reaction anyone would have, which was like, who the heck is this guy, and he sounds like a total jackass. Well, my wife actually had heard about it independently and was also like, Who the heck is this guy? And so then I sat down and started to figure out who Shane Gillis was, what he did for a living, and then I sat down and watched some of his comedy to try and get some context.
Detroit is a city of 680,000 people. Its peak population was 1.7 million. If you look this direction, you can see a thriving neighborhood, and then you turn 90 degrees and you see abandoned buildings as far as the eye can see. If we were adapting, you would see not multidecade low rates of interstate migration, which we have right now. You would not be seeing 80 percent of the country have multidecade low levels of business formation, which we have right now. You would not be seeing historic lows of business formation among young people, which we have right now. You would not see labor force participation at 62.9 percent, a multidecade low which we have right now. You would not see record-high levels of drug overdoses and suicides to the point that America's life expectancy has declined for three years in a row, which we have right now.
Nathaniel R. Jones, a former chief legal spokesman for the civil rights movement and later a federal appeals court judge who devoted his long career to eradicating the legacy of slavery endured by his own family, died on Jan. 26 at his home in Cincinnati. He was 93.
I lost my childhood home in 2000 when my grandma sold her house in Santa Cruz, Calif., to move to a retirement community in Washington State. For the first time, there was no home to return to. No desk to sit at and imagine my writing career. No critique sessions around the dining room table.
The verdict brings to an end what is surely one of Canada's most gruesome killings, made all the more interesting by the fact that it happened in the wealthy and virtually crime-free enclave of West Vancouver, Mr. Johnson said.
After a painfully dark — some would say unflinchingly realistic — first season, viewers could be forgiven for squirming away from HBO's Divorce, starring Sarah Jessica Parker and Thomas Haden Church as Frances and Robert DuFresne, New York suburbanites putting their marriage out of its misery. But those who've braved Round 2 have been rewarded with sunbeams through parting clouds. The papers are signed, leaving the couple free to move on to other partners (Steven Pasquale for her, Becki Newton for him) and, perhaps more important, to become the better people they somehow couldn't muster in each other's company.
MC: He has my vote. All right. [LAUGHTER]
This year's nominations include just one actor of color (Cynthia Erivo), and eight of the nine best picture nominees feature overwhelmingly white casts. (Bong Joon Ho's Parasite is the exception.) Still, the academy is on track to reach its diversity targets by this summer, according to a spokeswoman. In total, it has grown by more than 3,000 new members since 2016, a nearly 50 percent increase.
But once Siegmund (here the veteran tenor Simon O'Neill), seeking shelter in a hut, chances upon the fearful young Sieglinde (the radiant soprano Heidi Melton), Wagner's music turns mysterious and quietly suspenseful. The isolated Siegmund and beaten-down Sieglinde, who is trapped in a marriage to the bullying Hunding, look at each other longingly. In fact, they are twins, separated since their early childhood. And during these passages Mr. van Zweden's performance often went slack.
Nor is this misperception limited to California. According to journalist J.J. Goldberg, [T]he percentage of Jews who tell pollsters that anti-Semitism is a `serious problem' in America nearly doubled during the course of the 1980s, from 45 percent in 1983 to almost 85 percent in 1990. Yet by every objective assessment, the problem was less serious in 1990 than it was in 1983, and the trend has clearly been in the direction of improvement.
If nothing else, Crashing may perform a public service by discouraging other would-be comics from pursuing this already overcrowded career, since Pete's ordeals on the club circuit are painful to watch. It doesn't help that he's a terrible comic, at least until the show needs him to be a better one — in Episode 6, he suddenly finds a groove at an opportune moment. It's an amusing episode (it's the one with Ms. Silverman) but also feels disingenuous given what has come before.
I've been asked, 'Have you been to a bunch of parties? Do you feel like you have a fever? When was the last time you made out with someone? How many people have you been hanging out with?' she said. You want to date someone who has asked these questions and has gone ahead and gotten a test for you. It's so related to what you want in a person.
Perhaps there are two kinds of people, those for whom nothingness is no problem, and those for whom it is an insuperable problem. — John Updike, Self-Consciousness
HOW DEMOCRACIES DIE, by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt. (Broadway, $15.) Think beyond the coups d'état: The backslide from democracy into autocracy can be brought about by elected officials who upend the processes that empowered them. The authors, political scientists at Harvard, describe four criteria to identify authoritarian leaders. Donald Trump has met all of them.
A third abrupt check for adventurous Catholic intellectuals came in 1907 when Pope Pius X's decree Lamentabili (1907) and the encyclical Pascendi (1907) sweepingly condemned modernism in theology; in response, one English convert, George Tyrrell, S.J., courted excommunication. In the following years seminaries and Catholic colleges in Britain and America were purged of all traces of modernism. Outsiders regarded these episodes as further evidence that Catholic intellectuals were hamstrung by intrusive, censorious, and often ignorant authorities. This was the age in which Andrew Dickson White, first president of Cornell University, wrote his influential History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom (1896), casting the scientists as truth-loving heroes through the ages and the Catholic Church as an antiintellectual villain trying to squeeze the life out of them. White made enormous capital out of the famous Galileo case and treated it as typical of Catholicism at all times. Converts who remained committed to contemporary intellectual principles found themselves walking a tightrope between the guardians of orthodoxy on their right and their former friends and colleagues to their left.
Despite Lott's recent assurances that he will move ahead, some wonder whether the Senate may yet flinch from a trial because of the popular will. But Republicans have steadfastly ignored the polls all year.
Well, I'm all about trying to improve the reality on the ground, to the extent that we can actually put resources and funds to work in communities to make sure that women have access to reproductive rights in clinics. Certainly any way we can make sure that there aren't any obstacles to the funding of Planned Parenthood clinics around the country. I would take those actions immediately. A lot of the legislative actions, you need a bit more time and a bit more buy-in from Congress, but at the Supreme Court level, I would consider appointing more justices if it was necessary to safeguard women's reproductive rights.
That age limit came into effect after The Guardian newspaper reported two years ago on a 17-year-old British teenager who sought help at the British embassy in Islamabad to escape a forced marriage in 2014. She had to sign a loan agreement and hand in her British passport before being allowed to return to the United Kingdom, and ultimately was billed more than $1,000, with her passport being held until she paid.
But by then the trio was on the verge of being supplanted as the face of folk by a new generation of harder-edged singers like Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs and Joan Baez, and by hipper ones like Peter, Paul and Mary. Then the coming of the British invasion and the rise of rock utterly marginalized the group.
KK: Especially given your proposal for Department of the Attention Economy.
atch people's faces when we come in the door, Tom Holloway says. Holloway is a 29-year-old fourth-year Catholic seminarian at Mount Saint Mary's Seminary, and on this stunningly cold winter night, he and six other seminarians have driven to a diner not far from Emmitsburg, Md., where the seminary is situated, to have dessert. Holloway and two others in their fourth and last year, Brian Bashista and Damien Cook, are wearing clerical attire, or clerics, as they call them: black slacks, black shirts, Roman collars. They have already been ordained as deacons; they've made solemn promises of celibacy and obedience, and can perform baptisms and preside at marriages, as well as preach. They will be ordained as priests later this spring. As they enter the diner, a collective awareness seizes the room, much the way it might in the presence of someone famous. People either look up, or resolutely avoid looking up. After the seminarians settle in at a round table, Holloway, a slight, fair-haired man from Peoria, Ill., expands upon the reactions I've just seen -- a phenomenon seminarians refer to as the head-turn effect. Jennifer Egan writes frequently for the magazine. Her last article was about homosexuals in the military.
Well first off, to your first part of the question, during the press conference, Paul Howard never showed a video of Officer Rolfe kicking Mr. Brooks. He showed a still shot.
Edward M. Adams, past president of Division 51 on Men and Masculinities of the American Psychological Association, emailed that the guidelines
In this time of hyperpartisanship, leave it to writers to put us all into pens.
At the last debate, I proposed a world data organization, because to me, China's in position to leapfrog us in artificial intelligence. They're investing tens of billions in a way that our government is not. It's a national effort. And they've now separated their technology ecosystem from the West's and they're trying to sell their software and operating systems to other countries with very limited success right now, but this parallel tech universe, to me, is something that we can actually use to bring China back to the table.
KK: I want to ask you, you were the C.E.O. of Manhattan Prep. How does test prep — doesn't that contribute to income inequality in the United States?
There is a difference between reading a book and listening to stories, a difference amplified to epic proportions in the case of Norse Mythology. I knew it immediately when all of the hairs on my arm shot up during the retelling of how Odin lost his eye when he traded it for a sip from the well of wisdom. My theory was confirmed when my 16-year-old son passed by my bedroom door one night and could not stop himself from coming in to listen — for an entire hour. Hearing a story aloud, you are seduced by the wonder of an ancient oral tradition.
Crashing is yet another comedy that is less interested in jokes than in wringing laughs out of awkward or humiliating situations, but it feels primitive compared with shows like, say, the FX series Baskets. As for fashioning a TV series out of the stand-up life, it's not nearly as sophisticated as Louie or Seinfeld or most of the others. It's pleasant enough, with enjoyable guest stars, but it comes too late in the evolution of this genre to make much of an impression.
Court documents in previous cases also suggested further links between Mr. Dulos and Mr. Mawhinney, with Mr. Mawhinney's estranged wife telling the police that she thought Mr. Dulos was working to get rid of her on her husband's behalf.
The movie premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last year and came out on top with three awards, including the grand jury prize for documentary in the world cinema showcase.
However, I believe that the priorities favored by the more progressive candidates make them more electable: accessible and affordable health care, a Manhattan Project to combat climate change, regulations targeting corporate and government corruption, affordable college education and a more progressive tax system designed to decrease income inequality.
Another Woman (1988), starring Gena Rowlands as a professor and Ms. Farrow as a patient seeing an analyst in the adjacent apartment, is perhaps Mr. Allen's most sustained and successful effort at imagining women who function independently from a man like him (though Ian Holm shows up playing a version of that). You can say that Mr. Allen borrowed a lot from Ingmar Bergman — in this period the Bergman influence is overt and unavoidable — but also that his empathy and curiosity were engaged as never before.
The league, which had been carefully noncommittal about its future with Beckham and Miami since hosting a similar event with him here in 2014, did little to disguise its excitement this time around. It passed out hundreds of tickets for the lunchtime announcement in a concert hall at the Adrienne Arsht Center, an event with pounding music, enthusiastic celebrity testimonial videos, Las Vegas-style showgirls and boisterous chants from members of the Southern Legion, a local soccer supporters' group that, until Monday, had no team. There was even confetti.
The list — which includes 59 new emojis, as well as variants for a total of 230 options — emphasizes inclusivity. People will soon be able to create a holding hands emoji to reflect their own relationship, selecting for the skin color and gender identity of each individual. Other options include emojis showing a hearing aid, prosthetic limbs, sign language, a cane or a wheelchair.
The proposal would temporarily increase the size of two tax credits in a manner that would effectively provide more cash from the government to low-income workers and families.
Stephanie Jones, his daughter, said the cause was congestive heart failure.
John F. Kelly, as White House chief of staff, presented himself as the man leading a charge of country first, president second. The attorney general suggested administering lie-detector tests to the small group of people with access to transcripts of the president's calls with foreign leaders. And President Trump sought a list of enemies working in the White House communications shop.
Howard said that politics has played no role.
Yes, I was listening, the last minutes of NPR this morning.
Yeah, sure. Sure, I can understand that. And I understand what you were saying. But we can do this all day long, but that's not helping anything. What we need to do is fix why it is the way that it is, and why people feel that way. Because if we try to prove and try to change that and make it better to where it's not that way, isn't it the same, whether it's a perception or reality?

As the anniversary of the world's first coronavirus lockdown nears, China scrubs the history of any mistakes. Visitors attend the museum at Wuhan Parlor Convention Center Dec. 31, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Credit... Tingshu Wang/Reuters At a museum in Wuhan, China, a sprawling exhibition paints a stirring tale of how the city's sacrifices in a brutal 76-day lockdown led to triumph over the coronavirus and, ultimately, rebirth. But the exhibition may be most striking for what is not included about the experiences of the city where the virus first came to the world's attention. For example, visitors are invited to lay a virtual chrysanthemum at a wall of martyrs that includes Li Wenliang, the ophthalmologist at a Wuhan hospital whose death from the virus led to nationwide mourning. But missing from his brief biography is a crucial fact: that Dr. Li was reprimanded by the government for warning colleagues about the virus. China has spent much of the past year trying to spin a narrative of the coronavirus pandemic as an undisputed victory led by the ruling Communist Party. As life in the city, and most of the country, has returned to normal, the state-run news media has largely ignored the government's missteps.
KK: So let's get into it. We have about 90 minutes together. In your assessment, what are the policy breakdowns that lead to Americans still being hungry today?
It was really moving, she said, to see him point to his partner and all the support that his partner gave him, to have someone acknowledge their partner … We were both kind of crying.
He sometimes sounded pompous in print, but he was not in person. Indeed, he was a man of genuinely simple tastes who was happier in a sleeping bag than in a luxury hotel, who preferred eating wild boar with his fingers in the jungle to dining in expensive restaurants, who found more inner satisfaction with primitive than with sophisticated people and who was more at ease in knockabout attire than in street dress. Lindbergh's life, like his personality, was full of shadows and enigmas. Born Feb. 4, 1902, in Detroit, he was the son of C. A. Lindbergh, a prosperous Little Falls, Minn., lawyer and land speculator, and his second wife, Evangeline Lodge Land. The elder Lindbergh's first wife had died, leaving him two daughters. Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr. was born in Detroit because his mother's uncle was a physician there. He was returned to Little Falls six weeks later and lived in that small town, the center of a farming and timbering community, with few interruptions until he was 18. His paternal antecedents were Swedes, who changed their name from Mansons to Lindbergh when they emigrated from Sweden in 1860. They had a history of independence and vigor. The Lands, of Irish and English background, arrived in the United States shortly after 1812. Lindbergh's maternal grandfather was C. H. Land, a dentist and inventor. Both Dr. Land and C. A. Lindbergh were strong advocates of free inquiry and individual initiative, and both impressed on young Charles the merits of personal independence.
archived recording 1 I understand why Prince Harry and Meghan have done it. I think you can see Prince Harry obviously, his wife is just getting hounded by the press, often in racially dodgy ways. And you go, of course he doesn't want any part of it. I can completely understand that. archived recording 2 If Harry's happy and Meghan's happy, that's all that matters.
Mr. Yang has frequently reiterated his commitment to a two-state solution but has not released any detailed plans about how he would advance an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan or address Mr. Trump's policies in the region. He told the Council on Foreign Relations, I don't want to prescribe the specifics of a two-state solution, as the Israeli and Palestinian people both need to be leading any conversation, and I look forward to engaging with all stakeholders.
the implication that the goal is to eliminate male characteristics. The real implication is that rigid adherence to extreme expression of a few select masculine norms is related to poorer health outcomes.
As the gay rights movement spread from San Francisco and New York in the 1970s, Mr. Baker was often asked by friends aware of his creative talents to make banners for protests and marches. His creations, like others during that time, often included the pink triangle, which protesters had claimed as an icon after its initial use by the Nazis to identify gay men in concentration camps during World War II.
SONYA TAYEH (choreographer) That's all we have now, is dreaming.

News reports: A Times report detailed how, after Mr. Trump fired James Comey as F.B.I. director, the bureau became so concerned by the president's behavior that they took the aggressive step of opening a counterintelligence inquiry into whether he had been working on behalf of Russia.
In 2002, 40 agents from the Bureau of Land Management descended on the Danns' ranch, backed up by helicopters. They confiscated and then sold 232 cattle. It was one of a series of punitive measures by the U.S. government stretching over decades.
Charlie Warzel: You were talking about data and that's a good segue into some of the — I mean, you're probably the candidate who sort of runs on understanding the internet better than anyone right now. And I'm curious first about this worldwide data organization. For someone like China, wouldn't it actually be better for them to sort of hoard that data and hoard that information and keep that closed system?
I think I've been proven right on that point. It's just a lot of anxiety out there. And I think there's a terrific opportunity to move forward in a progressive way.
It became gradually clear to me, after meeting British science-fiction writers — J. G. Ballard amongst them — that a way to the center for me lay in the fantastic; and despite the very deep loathing of the British literary establishment for any writing that could be so described, I set out to read as many Latin American and Central European writers as possible, finding confirmation in such works as Bulgakov's 'The Master and Margarita' and the writing of Bruno Schulz that there was nothing inherently 'silly,' as the English would have it, in showing the world through lenses both fantastic and real: that the English were indeed limited by a creative feebleness and love of irony which left them out of the most interesting writing, all going on in other parts of the world.
Lott said, There are steps that precede the beginning of an impeachment trial. Once the Senate is organized as an impeachment proceeding, there will be pleadings and motions that come before the taking of evidence. That makes it difficult to determine at this time when an actual trial will begin.
3. We have to be more honest with children than ever before.
Cloris Leachman, who won an Academy Award for her portrayal of a neglected housewife in the stark drama The Last Picture Show but who was probably best known for getting laughs, notably in three Mel Brooks movies and on television comedies like The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Malcolm in the Middle, died on Wednesday at her home in Encinitas, Calif. She was 94.
This week's episode, titled The Kingmaker, compares Axe's impetuousness with the patrician calm of Jack Foley (David Strathairn), a man who exemplifies the difference between being wealthy and being rich. (Chris Rock defined the terms memorably, albeit to make a point on race.) In the machine politics of Albany, Foley has both hands on the levers, choosing candidates through favors and old-guard relationships and through back-channel political maneuvering. When Chuck's father chides Chuck for not showing proper fealty to Foley by failing to earn his granddaughter a clerkship, Chuck says: We don't have kings, dad. We live in a democracy. But we can see, as the episode unfolds, that Chuck doesn't really believe that now, if he ever did. His profile as a United States attorney may give his political prospects a boost, but there's no going anywhere in New York Democratic politics without Foley's blessing. And Chuck is fortunate enough to operate in that elite circle.
The zero tolerance on issues of race also played out in the almost immediate demands by nearly all the Democratic presidential candidates that Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia resign over a racist yearbook photo. (Mr. Northam began with an apology but pivoted to a new defense when he triggered a crush of calls for him to resign.)
AK: Whether or not the Navy is big enough to meet its commitments with the Chinese and the South China Sea? What's going on in the Persian Gulf? What do you think?
The Senate would conduct only the second impeachment trial of a President in the 209-year history of the Republic. Clinton will be the only elected President put on trial. Andrew Johnson, impeached and acquitted by one vote in 1868, had been elected Vice President and succeeded to the White House on Abraham Lincoln's assassination in 1865.
So it became a natural focus of Suhail Zaheer Lari, a prominent Pakistani historian and author, who dedicated himself to documenting the history of Sindh Province, in southern Pakistan. He had a passion for photography, and his images of Makli's riches became the basis of several proposals for their conservation.
It wasn't an accident, Mike, he said, standing. That's precluded by the evidence. Expect a package this time tomorrow.
Her critics, and there were many, saw the magazine's contents as pretentious and its sensibility as nouveau riche, but faithful readers treasured it, and such criticism only fueled Ms. Rense's determination.
n a sunny Saturday, I rode with Bashista from Mount Saint Mary's to Blessed Sacrament, the parish in Arlington where he served last summer and now spends two weekends each month. We drove in the low-slung gold Honda Civic that he purchased during his architecture days, and I asked Bashista what has become of that old egotistical, materialistic version of himself. It's there, but it's been transformed, he said. St. Paul said, I'm a new creation. The old self is dead. And in a sense that's true. Now, Bashista said, the energy he once spent serving his own interests is directed toward other people who need his help, both in prayer and in deed; like most seminarians, he keeps lists of people who have asked him to pray for them, or else he prays for them in the moment of promising to do so. According to the Pope's theology of the body, the passionate intensity of sexual love is also the model for celibate love -- the total self-donation of a priest to his people. The needs of the sick and the poor are a particular focus; there is perhaps no setting in America -- neither the halls of government nor the campuses of elite colleges anymore -- where you hear the poor evoked more often, and more sympathetically, than in a Catholic seminary. At Blessed Sacrament, Bashista checked in with the pastor and made some last-minute adjustments to his homily, which he would deliver at Mass that evening.
When she was older, teaching part-time at the University of Maryland, she was told that she wasn't being hired for a full-time job because you come on too strong for a woman. Another interviewer complained that women stayed home when their children were sick. Another rejected her by saying that she was just a housewife who went back to school.
As the general counsel of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the 1970s, Mr. Jones revealed unwelcome truths by challenging school segregation in the North and racial bias in the military justice system, in which, among other things, black defendants had complained of being unable to trust white lawyers. He was also a strong defender of affirmative action programs and other measures to address historic discrimination.
For centuries, women have been expected to endure bad marriages in many conservative pockets of West Africa. Divorce happened, but most often the husbands were the ones casting off their partners. Tradition has bound women so tightly that spouses are sometimes chosen for babies in the womb.
Well, in this case, what's interesting is it's up to the employer, and it was NBC and Saturday Night Live. Even as I made the statement saying I didn't think he should be fired, I thought he probably would be fired. Because if you're NBC and SNL, you look up and say, what is my upside for keeping this guy? He's not exactly a huge moneymaker, he hasn't worked a day on the set. Like, that's not a really powerful set of incentives. And so I thought they probably would fire him. I'd suggest that the extent there are consequences for people's misstatements, they should be somewhere commensurate to the level of power and influence they have and the harm that they're doing. In Shane Gillis's case, he was a comedian. I'd never heard of the guy before.
Well, thank you for saying so. Yeah, in 2019 dollars it must be at least $6,000. I've been a Democrat for years and years, and if you look at my alignment on the vast majority of issues, they're lock step with the Democratic Party. So it was very natural for me to run as a Democrat. I've ruled out completely any third-party bid because that would in my mind increase the chances of Donald Trump winning, and the mission is to defeat Donald Trump and help move the country forward.
Adams noted that the guidelines are
Well, and speaking directly, I was told that subscriptions for Showtime has really risen a lot because of Your Honor.
Yeah, so that was by design. As far as working on stage compared to film, the work itself is very different. In a play, you go through a beginning, middle, and end every single performance. Whereas in film and television, you do bits and pieces. You might have a day where it's emotional, and then the next seven days, it's not. So it's much more tiring for me to do a play on a long run than it is to do film. You have moments when you can shut down and relax and rest.

The church has been to some degree disengaged, said the Rev. Dr. W. Franklyn Richardson of Grace Baptist Church in Mt. Vernon, N.Y. Churches that have social consciousness are pushed by this anniversary into a place of reflecting on how far we have come or not come, and have we abandoned what he gave his life for?
Would it offend you to know I watched the LBJ — though I had seen it on stage — on my iPhone in bed, the whole thing.
In a business you can say, Hey, we're going to go this way, and people generally have to do what you're saying. In government it's much more analogous to my role as the founder of a national nonprofit, where you have hundreds or even thousands of stakeholders, and you have to try and generate energy around a vision. Let people see that it's in their self-interest or the self-interest of the people that they represent to get on board with your vision. And that you're willing to compromise and work with them. That is the way I would lead as president.
There's a perfect foreboding moment near the beginning of The Lucky Ones that gets at what I take to be the heart of the matter.
Think of major threats to South Korea, and its nuclear-armed neighbor North Korea may come to mind. But a subtler risk to South Korea's future well-being lies within its borders: a shrinking and rapidly aging population.
California is one of many states to ask teachers and textbooks in recent years to cover the contributions of specific immigrant groups, including Asian-Americans, Pacific Islanders, European-Americans and Mexican-Americans.
People came up to me afterward and said: 'No one ever preaches on that. Thank you.' Holloway gave me a tape of a lecture he delivered to teen-age boys, in which he told them: Let me be perfectly clear. Sometimes people just won't say this: masturbation is always a seriously disordered act. . . . In itself, it is always wrong. He urged the boys to confess their sins, and afterward, I was told, they did, lining up in scores outside the confessionals. And if they hadn't? If you preach on these topics, you're going to endure a wrath, Bashista said. But if you are indeed teaching the truth -- what the church is saying, that has transcended time -- Christ says, you're going to endure ridicule. Because He did.
Allegra Lynch, a member of the Travel Leaders Network who lives in Santa Rosa, Calif., said that she sold $1.5 million worth of such trips in 2018, primarily to Europe, compared with $800,000 in 2017. The rise is 100 percent because of people wanting to go on trips after taking at-home DNA tests, she said.
Like some American colleges, it is testing people extensively and even sifting through sewage for traces of the virus. The goal, Professor Tan said, is to make sure there are no infections among the students, faculty and staff members at N.U.S.
On July 27, 1974, the judiciary committee voted 27 to 11, with 6 of the panel's 17 Republicans joining all 21 Democrats, to send to the full House an article of impeachment. The article accused the president of unlawful tactics that constituted a course of conduct or plan to obstruct the investigation of the break-in at the offices of the Democratic opposition in the Watergate complex in Washington by a White House team of burglars.
The world is divided into two types: the idle and the anti-idle. The anti-idle I hereby christen 'botherers.'
Ora Media, which Mr. King co-founded in 2012, confirmed the death in a statement posted on Mr. King's own Twitter account and said he had died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
MC: So, and we are currently enjoying a businessmen president who has no experience in government or the military. What is your argument to people, that we should trust you with no experience in government and the military, in the same position, and that you will do a better job dealing with the peculiarities of Washington.
As Kamala Harris makes history this week, so will her big, blended family. The extended family of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, includes stepchildren, nieces and an ex-wife. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times When Kamala Harris is sworn in as vice president, she will represent many firsts: First female vice president. First Black woman. First woman of Indian descent. But there is another milestone that will be on display: that of her family. As Ms. Harris ascends to this barrier-breaking role, millions of Americans will see a more expansive version of the American family staring back at them — one that could broaden rigid ideas of politically palatable family dynamics or gender roles. It's striking, said Ralph Richard Banks, a law professor at Stanford who has written about race, gender and family patterns. In some ways they are at the frontier of different aspects of American families and how they're changing. Ms. Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, was raised with both Christian and Hindu practices, while her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is white, grew up attending Jewish summer camp. She was in her 40s when they married, older than the median age of first marriage for women in this country, though that number continues to rise. Mr. Emhoff was divorced, with two children from his previous marriage, making his children, Cole and Ella, among the one in four who do not live with both biological parents, according to the Census Bureau.
At 18, he bolted, finding temporary refuge in the Manhattan apartment of a boyfriend, and in a series of jobs that included a public relations stint at Club Monaco and, later, posts as a personal dresser at Saks and Bergdorf Goodman.
Mr. Yang has been the most vocal of all candidates about privacy issues. Tristan Harris, whom he has alluded to in discussing the Department of the Attention Economy, spent three years as a Google design ethicist. He left to found the Center for Humane Technology, a nonprofit that seeks to address the digital attention crisis.

I think we've watched everything on Netflix, said Arestov, who estimated they had lost about 95 percent of their income for the year. We're trying to stay positive. We can see a light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccines, but we've been juggling our finances because there hasn't been a lot of help from the government for our industry.
You know, just being in touch with it and having my own television production company for seven years now and realizing that it's shifting and adjusting. And the business will always shift and adjust. I hope that we don't see the end of movie theaters. They're on life support right now, understandably, and I don't want that to go away. I don't want it to only be the big superhero movies are in the theaters and everything else is on your home screens. That experience of witnessing a story being told in a cinematic way and you're in a room with a bunch of strangers is really rewarding, and I hope that comes back in the movie theaters and on Broadway.
Her involvement in politics continued after her term as ambassador ended in 1981 with the arrival of the Reagan administration. During the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta she opened up her home for fund-raising. Her outspokenness caused a stir when she said that despite a strong race for the presidential nomination, the Rev. Jesse Jackson was not qualified to be on a national ticket.
THE RECOVERING: Intoxication and Its Aftermath, by Leslie Jamison. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $18.99.) Jamison, adding to a large group of addiction memoirs, maps her own recovery while considering the relationship between creativity and substance abuse. The emotional firepower of the book comes in its second half, after she has embraced sobriety; our critic, Dwight Garner, called this section close to magnificent, and genuinely moving.
I want to make sure I understand what you are referring to. When you say that there are cases where the district attorney may have misspoken, what do you mean?
Mike. Jesus, Mike, are you okay?
When you are drawn together and make a pledge with a person, the swirl doesn't end; it's just that you'll ride it together. In the Regime of Covenants, making the right one-time selection is less important than the ongoing action to serve the relationship.
There was Seth Meyers, who hosted the Golden Globes in January, inserting a Manhattan joke into his opening monologue.
Yeah. What's been the most difficult character for you to do that, of the most recent ones?
Unlike universal basic income, a system that would provide some cash to every person regardless of income level, a negative income tax system would give cash to people below a certain income threshold. Milton Friedman made the case for the tax as a poverty alleviation tool in his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom.
KK: With inflation, though, it would be higher, right?
If these are your measurements, then of course you're going to think things are going in one direction, while your way of life disintegrates. Even the inventor of G.D.P., Simon Kuznets, said 100 years ago, this is a terrible measurement of national well-being, and we should never use it as that.
In that world, President Trump sent Speaker Nancy Pelosi a letter telling her that he was postponing her trip with a congressional delegation to visit American troops in Afghanistan. The president's salvo came 24 hours after Ms. Pelosi informed Mr. Trump that because of the shutdown, she was rescinding her invitation to him to deliver a State of the Union address in the House chamber.
CW: I'm curious, then, focusing on the U.S., a couple of months ago the general counsel for the N.S.A. wrote an Op-Ed for us and was worried about this big challenge of the government not being able to acquire the tech talent. That Silicon Valley is actually so much more attractive, so much more interesting there. And that when you're looking at 5G technology, quantum computing, technology, A.I., not having engineers in that space and sort of outsourcing that to the private sector is potentially incredibly dangerous. Like how do you actually make people want to come and bring that engineering talent to the federal government, rather than ——
It would be a highly cumbersome tax return to prepare on an annual basis, said Jeff Moes, executive vice president and chief fiduciary officer at FineMark National Bank & Trust, which serves high-net-worth clients. Every federal estate tax goes through an audit, and presumably this would go through an audit as well. They'd have to figure out if the valuation methodology is correct.
Democrats and progressives will be so thrilled to have defeated Donald Trump, they will love the fact that we're going to put buying power into families' hands, make children stronger and healthier. But here's the great thing: The Republicans will look up and say, Wait a minute, do I hate the Freedom Dividend? And they look up, and they notice only one state's had a dividend for almost 40 years, and it's Alaska, a deep red conservative state, that was passed by a Republican governor.
There's also this: Telling kids the difficult or awkward truth is a great chance to impart values. I learned this from the sex educator Amy Lang, author of Birds + Bees + Your Kids. So when my very curious middle-schooler asked me if a certain slang term meant oral sex, instead of changing the topic or squirming out of answering, I was able to say, Yes, and … oral sex is a way that people like to be sexual without worrying about getting pregnant. It's part of a healthy sex life. But it's definitely not for kids. It's for later.
Max Wilcox, a classical record producer and engineer who won five Grammy Awards, and whom the pianist Arthur Rubinstein called his musical collaborator, died on Jan. 20 in Seattle. He was 88.
The shift of power in Congress and news reports are combining to confront President Trump with the prospect of a protracted and intense political war for survival that may make the still-unresolved partial government shutdown pale by comparison, writes our chief White House correspondent.

Great person, great soul, great teammate, said Tom Malchow, a teammate of Keller's at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics. But he just had a hard time finding his place in society outside the pool.
The ghost of a dead person must divide into many ghosts--to begin with. It is labor-intensive--to begin with. Because there are many bedrooms to visit, many sleepers to stand over.
A month after Senator H. John Heinz III, a Republican, died, Gov. Robert P. Casey was still searching for a replacement, having been turned down by Lee Iacocca, the chairman of Chrysler, and others. Whoever accepted would have to run in a special election in November against the United States attorney general, Dick Thornburgh, a popular former two-term governor who had signaled his intention to seek the seat.
And again, all you have to do to look at it is to say, stock market prices and G.D.P. record highs, life expectancy declining. Like, that sums it up. You know? You don't need any clearer divergence than that.

In Opinion: Our columnist David Leonhardt builds a detailed argument that Mr. Trump is demonstrably unfit for office and must go, but that a rushed impeachment could actually help him remain in office.
The authors delineated between first wave digisexuality (online pornography, hookup apps, sexting and electronic sex toys), where the tech is simply a delivery system for sexual fulfillment, and second wave digisexuality. Those practitioners form deeper relationships through immersive technologies like virtual reality, augmented reality and A.I.-equipped sex robots, sometimes obviating the need for a human partner altogether.
Fallout roundup 17 Capitol Police officers are under investigation one week after rampage. National Guard troops deployed to the U.S. Capitol prepare to head out for a shift change on Thursday. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times With less than a week to go before the presidential inauguration, the police force charged with protecting the grounds of the Capitol is in crisis, as law enforcement agencies across the city brace for more potentially violent gatherings, based on intelligence reviewed in recent days. The chief of the Capitol Police and two other top security officials resigned after an angry mob of Trump loyalists stormed the Capitol last week. Three officers have been suspended, and 17 more are under investigation, according to a senior Congressional aide, including an officer who took selfies with people in the crowd and another who wore a Make America Great Again Trump hat and directed rioters into the Capitol. And lawmakers have demanded a full investigation into what some have referred to as a severe systemic failure. Currently, the Capitol complex, which is usually a bevy of activity, is cut off from its surroundings by National Guard troops and an imposing backdrop of seven-foot-tall, unscalable fencing.
Samuel Beckett, when asked one beautiful spring morning whether such a day did not make him glad to be alive, responded, I wouldn't go as far as that. Life is a predicament, death the elephant at the horizon that looms larger as the years pass.
In this true crime documentary, a man ventures with two bounty hunters into Honduras to avenge the killing of his father. But the film struggles to fit the crime.

A critique of President Obama's financial policies by Matt Stoller, of the Open Markets Institute, argues that the Obama administration let banking executives off the hook for their role in the financial crisis and enabled nine million foreclosures.
FRANK CONNIFF'S OPEN RIFF NIGHT at Q.E.D. (April 11, 7:30 p.m.). The host of this event hails from one of the O.G. riff-track shows, Mystery Science Theater 3000, so you know his ability to provide colorful commentary to terrible television and film alike is top-notch. Is yours? Here's an opportunity to find out: Audience members sign up as they would at an open mike to offer riffs of their own as they watch clips from bad movies. Mr. Conniff and his guest judges will chose the best riffer, who will try to hold his or her own against Mr. Conniff at the end of the night.

More than a particular place, says Olivia Smith, the gallery's director, they represent a memory of something that we all recognize. For this New Yorker, whose city has felt all but unrecognizable these past 10 months, it's a welcomed remembrance. Martha Diamond: 1980-1989 is on view from Jan. 13 through Feb. 17 at Magenta Plains, 94 Allen Street, New York City, magentaplains.com.
On many of these recordings the accompanying musicians were members of Count Basie's band, a group with which she felt a special affinity. She was particularly close to Mr. Basie's tenor saxophonist, the late Lester Young. It was Mr. Young who gave her the nickname by which she was known in jazz circles--Lady Day. She in turn created the name by which Mr. Young was identified by jazz bands, Pres. She was the vocalist with the Basie band for a brief time during 1937 and the next year she signed for several months with Artie Shaw's band. Miss Holiday came into her own as a singing star when she appeared at Cafe Society in New York in 1938 for the major part of the year. It was at Cafe Society that she introduced one of her best-known songs, Strange Fruit, a biting depiction of a lynching written by Lewis Allen. During that engagement, too, she established trade-marks that followed her for many years--the swatch of gardenias in her hair, her fingers snapping lazily with the rhythm, her head cocked back at a jaunty angle as she sang. Arrested in 1947 In 1947, a cloud that had been gathering over Miss Holiday and which was to cover the rest of her career, burst on her. She was arrested for a narcotics violation and, at her own request, was committed to a Federal rehabilitation establishment at Alderson, W. Va., for a year and a day in an attempt to rid herself of the habit.
I guess if you look at it that way, and you're framing it that way, I still don't know if there's enough funding. But if you're talking in relation to, if we took calls away — I don't want to say away, but calls that aren't necessary for law enforcement, and we were able to — I don't know how we would do it, teach, or whatever the word you use, the public to call another number, then maybe, yeah, that may be something that would cause the cost factor to go down.
On a Friday night soon after, I kissed the man who sent me the folk-blues songs. When I came home and got in bed, my whole body itched. I thought of the unfaithful wife I had interviewed who had believed it was wrong to let the other man kiss her, but she also knew she would go wild with loneliness if she didn't.
Things became a bit more modern in 2013, when a box appeared on income tax forms that husbands could tick rather than giving written permission.
Those who have known and watched Mr. Trump across the years cannot shake the irony of a president felled by the very formula that powered his rise: inflammatory speech and a self-regard that has congealed at times into functional self-delusion.
Historically, we've endorsed a two-state solution, which has always struck me as the best way forward, and I think it's really unfortunate that Donald Trump has moved us away from that to the extent that he has. I would try to move us back in that direction.
The Rev. William J. Barber II, a chairman of the Poor People's Campaign, preached and directly challenged Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to pursue a Third Reconstruction, decades after the civil rights era. He urged them to address interlocking injustices of systemic racism, poverty, ecological devastation/denial of health care, the war economy, and the false moral narrative of religious nationalism.
He read some promos for his sponsor Blinds.com. He took calls from listeners. He talked about the importance of children respecting parents (very important) and about how parents should not want their children to be the smartest in the class, but rather the most moral.
The book, which will be published at the end of January, describes a nest of back-stabbing and duplicity within the West Wing, a narrative by now familiar from other books and news media reports. But Mr. Sims, who left last year after clashing with Mr. Kelly, is one of the few people to attach his name to descriptions of goings-on at the White House that are not always flattering to Mr. Trump, and many of the scenes are not particularly flattering to anyone, including himself.
Those remarks didn't have the effect he intended. Some African-Americans accused him of equating very different kinds of discrimination, and polls show that his support from black Democrats remains abysmal. When they appraise Buttigieg, they notice a whole lot beyond his sexual orientation, including worrisome friction between him and some black residents of South Bend and a path of extraordinary privilege (Harvard, a Rhodes scholarship, a job with McKinsey) that brought him to this point.
Spoilers ahead for the first season of Russian Doll.
Indeed, some of Mr. Shane's finest moments, like the smoky cocktail-hour ballad Scotch and Soda, had nothing to do with folk. In 1961, Ervin Drake wrote It Was a Very Good Year for Mr. Shane. He sang it with the trio long before Frank Sinatra made it one of his classic recordings.
For his part, Dr. Glauber became intrigued by an experiment, performed in 1956 by the British astronomers Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss, to measure the apparent angular diameter of visible stars. (The angular size of a star is essentially how large the dot of light appears in the night sky.) The two scientists had set up two detectors, which received photons and sent them to a central device for measurements.

In 2017, Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York's subway and pledged $1 billion for improvements. The editorial board has repeatedly called for action to make the subways workable for this paper's millions of readers.
Everyone had a sharp memory to share. Jean Cocteau, the poet-playwright-impresario-filmmaker (Beauty and the Beast), recalled Proust's voice: Just as the voice of a ventriloquist comes out of his chest, so Proust's emerged from his soul. The writer Leon-Paul Fargue remembered seeing Proust towards the end of his life, completely pale, with his hair down to his eyebrows, his beard, so black it was blue, devouring his face.... Fargue noticed the long sleeves covering frozen hands, the Persian, almond-shaped eyes. He looked like a man who no longer lives outdoors or by day, a hermit who hasn't emerged from his oak tree for a long time, with something pained about the face, the expression of suffering that has just begun to be calmed. He seemed possessed by a bitter goodness. A young aristocratic woman recalled that when she was a girl she was supposed to be presented to him at a ball, but the great writer, livid and bearded, wearing the collar of his overcoat turned up, stared at her with such intensity that when they were finally introduced she was so frightened she nearly fainted.
Hours before Clinton was impeached for his efforts to cover up his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, Robert L. Livingston, who had been chosen to succeed Gingrich as Speaker, shocked the House by announcing he would leave Congress because of revelations of his own adulterous affairs.
Ms. Dunn, 47, is also the creator and executive producer of the popular sitcom American Housewife and the author of two previous novels. She would like to make it clear that the book is fiction, though, as she pointed out in a recent interview, married people often like to fantasize about these things.
Well, I would suggest that one side has been acting as if it is an arms race. And so, in that environment, it's only appropriate to respond in a way that you think would help move the country and our legal system in the right direction. Can I talk — oh.
Kenya's digital registry drew comparisons to India's giant biometric program, known as Aadhaar, whose sweeping powers were limited by the Indian Supreme Court in 2018.
The differences between state editions can be traced back to several sources: state social studies standards; state laws; and feedback from panels of appointees that huddle, in Sacramento and Austin hotel conference rooms, to review drafts.
He longed to produce some work for the glory of God but was condemned to the most anxious thoughts as to what I shall eat and what I shall drink, wherewithal I shall be clothed, I and mine, and to the drudgery of teaching dunces. Such cases strongly suggest that the motive for conversion was genuine religious conviction. There are few plausible ulterior motives to explain it, though it may be true that certain character types were more receptive to the demands of Catholic life than others.
On Wednesday, Democratic House impeachment managers began laying out their case to senators for convicting and removing President Trump from office, accusing him of a corrupt scheme to pressure Ukraine into tarnishing his political rivals.
That is correct. But when I've dug into it, very, very few Americans are getting $1,000 in food stamps. And most of the people who are on government assistance live in fear of losing that assistance because there are various requirements that tend to come with it. And when, if you ask them, say, Hey, would you prefer $1,000 unconditional that you can rely upon, they actually think that's too good to be true.
The U.S. vaccine rollout needs to 'hit the reset,' an ex-F.D.A. chief says. Health workers prepared doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for mass inoculations at the Arizona State Fairgrounds in Phoenix this month. Credit... Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times Warning that vaccines are the only backstop the country has against fast-spreading new variants of the coronavirus, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said Sunday that federal and state leaders need to hit the reset and adopt a new strategy to get far more shots into arms as soon as possible. Speaking on Face the Nation on CBS News, Dr. Gottlieb said the 40 million doses currently available could go a long way toward protecting the nation's 50 million residents who are 65 and older in particular. I think we need to take an all-of-the-above approach and push it out through different channels, Dr. Gottlieb said, including the big-box stores, including federal sites that the Biden administration is talking about standing up. We need to try everything right now to create multiple distribution points. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 22.1 million doses had been sent to states as of Friday but only about 6.7 million people had received the first of two necessary doses. That data lags the most recent allocations by at least a few days.
Among Maher's wise choices is to accept that the very publicness of Baloch's life makes her, on some level, unknowable. She was a construction, down to her name, which was invented. (Indeed the disclosure of her real name by local media may have played a role in her death, by exposing her family to local ridicule and judgment.) Maher sprinkles the book with Baloch's own words, spoken and written, but she doesn't try to resolve their contradictions. Baloch was brave and foolish, phenomenally independent and pathetically needy, protective of her virtue and, as was her right, also willing to trade on it. She was a type (see: a Kardashian, to whom she was sometimes compared) but also only herself. She was proof, if we needed it, that a life can be lived simultaneously on the rise and on the run.
This is how you do it. You kind of wheel around slowly into the scene. Periphery first. Body last. I mean, I knew where she was. My radar went to the bed but she had done it on a chair. In the corner, to my right. Otherwise: Curtains half-drawn against the moonlight, orderly dressing table, tousled sheets, and a faint smell of lust. At her feet, an old black-stained pillowcase and a squirt can of 303.
A Year Later, the First Post-Pandemic City
This isn't to say that his only interesting work belongs to this period, or that his movies from The Purple Rose of Cairo through Husbands and Wives can be watched today without queasiness or qualm. On the contrary, Ms. Farrow's presence in most of them — and the glimpses of her household, including some of her children — make it impossible not to think about Mr. Allen's personal life, and challenges the notion that it can be easily separated from his work.
Accomplishing that in a way that isn't just depressing or infuriating involves turning the profession and the time period into a raucous combination of pageant and farce. Harlots doesn't shy away from doubt, sorrow and the straightforward presentation of appalling exploitation, but it doesn't linger on them — it always moves right along to the next scene of intrigue and competition between brothels, or the next bit of comic business involving the desperate buffoonery of the male customers. All against a backdrop of jolly sex and nudity, mostly by extras.
One day last month, Senator Bob Menendez made three separate calls to three friends, each of whom was celebrating a birthday.
A Sonic Mishmash That Resonated in '16
His death, from cancer, was announced by his firm, the Christopher Little Literary Agency.
Tell me about the resonance because there's a lot of prescience in that play, too, of where we are today, where cable has gone and where news has gone. Explain what you meant by close to Donald Trump and yet not.
The performance started strongly. In the dark, pulsing orchestra music of the opening scene, Wagner simultaneously depicts the stormy weather that pummels a wounded young Siegmund as he is pursued through a dense forest, and the internal despair that never leaves him. Mr. van Zweden conducted this music with lean textures and crisp attacks.
Hadn't he said the right thing that one time? That was what he meant.
Asked whether the hotel's nautical flourishes have inspired the menu, Batali says he preferred to keep the two sensibilities separate. We wanted to honor the marine tradition, and 'La Sirena' is a little doff of the hat to that, but the food is more like what I want to do now, within the confines of classic Italian food. Still, Batali, a fan of Homer's Odyssey, felt a name with aquatic flair was only appropriate. My tie to the marine culture is something a little more macabre, he says. I love the idea that the sirens would sing the songs and the passing ships could not avoid them, like all the traffic on Ninth Avenue.
These numbers are impressive; the movies even more so. At some events, female filmmakers sometimes seem to have been invited simply to check a box, a practice that, however well-intentioned, inevitably suggests that women are second-class talent. This year's Sundance, by contrast, underscores that when women receive real opportunities — serious money and institutional support — the pool of work expands, bringing new stories, styles and worldviews. For the 2020 edition, you didn't need to dig to find female talent, make excuses for substandard work or politely yawn through another worthy endeavor. It was right on the screen, blissful and unbound.
U.S. government shutdown enters third week
It all started with Orsini's, Mr. Nelson said, referring to the famed pasta house in Midtown Manhattan where the couple had their first date. There was nothing like Orsini's.
What BlackRock will do, according to Mr. Fink's latest letter to C.E.O.s:
Large house to one-bedroom apartment to studio apartment until you're in a small room that has little else in it but a bed. Home is bed. Home is also your mind, as always, only your mind may not retain much of that long life or even what happened five minutes ago. What has surprised me in all that shrinkage isn't the fact that my mother has again found love — because at 95 she is still pretty, kind and witty — but how she's found the attachments that seem very like marriages. Love, it turns out, comes on the wings of assigned seating.
So you have a situation where the premise of the story is that a father doesn't like his daughter's boyfriend, and that's it. It's so thin.
You can build it around the town library, because a lot of them have this bulletin board that serves as the skeleton of a local paper when the local paper has gone out of business. A lot of these papers would be able to get by if they did not have to generate stock market level returns for hedge fund owners and private equity owners. If you had a cooperative model and it's made a certain amount of money, spent a certain amount of money, ran as a nonprofit, you could restore and sustain local journalism and thousands of communities, but it will not happen without government support. It just won't.
HONG KONG — Malaysia's king resigned on Sunday, becoming the first monarch to abdicate in the country's history.
The series, Surviving R. Kelly, includes testimony from several women who accuse the singer of abuse, as well as commentary from Mr. Kelly's critics, including the founder of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke, and the singer John Legend.
For dancers, this entrance is famously challenging: Aurora's opening rush of vivacity must change pace and scale as she meets the suitors and dances with them the famous, ceremonious Rose Adagio. (Since the 1940s, this has featured a series of exposed balances on point that add to the adagio's high-wire nature, but the whole number is, above all, a multifaceted courtship drama — which Aurora, having not yet met Prince Right, leaves unresolved.)
Justice Bader Ginsburg has had a series of health scares in recent years, including surgery for lung cancer and radiation treatment. She also had surgery for early-stage pancreatic cancer in 2009.
Mr. Hawley sharply criticized the decision by Loews, which was established in 1960 and owns or operates 26 properties in the United States and Canada. If these corporations don't want conservatives to speak, they should just be honest about it, he said in a statement. But to equate leading a debate on the floor of the Senate with inciting violence is a lie, and it's dangerous. I will not be deterred from representing my constituents, and I will not bow to left-wing corporate pressure. Mr. Hawley persisted in his challenge to the election results even after the mob was cleared out of the Capitol this month, forcing the House and Senate into two hours of debate over Pennsylvania's electoral votes even though he never made a specific charge of wrongdoing. The rejection by Loews came after Simon & Schuster said that it would cancel the publication of an upcoming book by Mr. Hawley, The Tyranny of Big Tech, which had been scheduled to be published in June. Simon & Schuster said that it had made the decision because we take seriously our larger public responsibility as citizens, and cannot support Senator Hawley after his role in what became a dangerous threat. Mr. Hawley had said the cancellation could not be more Orwellian, and added, We'll see you in court. In recent days, a flurry of companies have suspended donations to some of the Republicans who voted to block the certification of the Electoral College results.
Now, back in West Virginia with her collection of fugitives, Jodi holds to her prison vision of living simply on the land, an old and deeply American dream that is hard to let go. She finds that her grandmother's farm has been sold, but that doesn't deter her from moving her group into the cabin anyway for a brief cigarette-and-whiskey outlaw idyll. Instead of peace and hope and love, however, they find they're under constant threat in an Appalachian community gutted by meth and opioids, by fracking creeping so close that a neighbor can set his tap water on fire, and, as always, by limitations on upward mobility for the underprivileged that have been baked into American culture from its beginning.
So this all seems to set the stage for what happens next.
In general, Oates is dealing here with the academic world — professors and their kids, editors, writers, adjuncts — people who live in the provinces, on the outskirts of real success. Characters are often referred to by titles rather than names: mother, daddy, wife, husband, professor. Except You Bless Me, one of the standouts in a very strong collection, recounts an early incident in a woman's teaching career. She has become convinced that a black student in her class — one she's been trying to help — has been sending her racist hate messages. Is the professor unusually patient and conscientious or completely delusional and possibly racist herself?
Racism is the key construct here in understanding why this sort of violence is possible. The other explanations would be the pathways through which racism creates these conditions. An individual experiences their standing in society as relative and comparative, so sometimes the gains of other groups feel like losses to Whites. Whites in the last 60 years have seen minoritized folks gain more political power, economic and educational opportunity. Even though these gains are grossly exaggerated, Whites experience them as a loss in group status.
That's why something like world data organization is so vital. When they had to join the W.T.O. [World Trade Organization], they realized this was going to be vital to their economic growth, so they're going to have to make some decisions and compromises in order to join the world order. We can create an analogous situation for data and technology and then use that to try and curb some of their worst abuses and behaviors. Now, is this going to happen in time to help Hong Kong? I certainly hope so. I mean, I certainly hope that they don't flood the streets of Hong Kong with troops any time in the next number of days or weeks.
Ms. Comer is good in the showier part of Villanelle, but it's Ms. Oh who makes sure that the series is more than a cute gloss on the glamorous international caper. She gets across Eve's vague but not terminal dissatisfaction with her job and marriage, her nerdiness (one boss calls her a tiresome thinkbucket), and her anger and fear when Villanelle makes their game lethally personal. And she never stops being funny, whether upbraiding her superiors, espousing conspiracy theories or being water-tortured.

So you're looking at a nation of high school graduates. And what do high school graduates do for a living? The top five occupational categories are retail and administrative, which includes call center work, retail, food service and food preparation, transportation, primarily truck driving, and attendant supportive jobs and manufacturing still. We all know that we have gutted many of these industries, and their labor bases have shrunk.

Mr. Yang has a fervent online following that calls itself the Yang Gang.
The word testosterone appears nowhere in the report, and the possibility that men and women's personalities differ for biological reasons is unsayable and unthinkable.
If two fingers can be easily inserted into the vagina, supporters of the practice say, it shows that a woman is not a virgin, and thus lacks moral authority to make an assault or rape accusation.

If you were a person in that town in Missouri and you wanted to start a bakery, before the dividend, it's a dumb idea. Post-dividend, it might be a great idea. You can hire someone to help staff the bakery, you know if the bakery fails, you're going to survive because you have this income that you can rely upon. This is the most stable and secure way to create jobs that actually reflect our community's needs and values. What are the other alternatives?

We're going to designate 10 people to make our people stronger forever, regardless of whether or not they're ——
Karadzic was found guilty of orchestrating the massacre at Srebrenica, a Bosnian Muslim town and United Nations-designated safe zone where Serbian forces murdered 8,000 men and boys in 1995, burying them in mass graves. Four years before, he had given a speech to the Bosnian Assembly threatening Muslims with annihilation if they voted to secede from the disintegrating Yugoslavia. White supremacists across the world, including mass shooters in Norway and New Zealand, have looked to Karadzic for inspiration.
Mr. Yang is not the first to label this period the fourth industrial revolution — the term was made popular by Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, at its annual meeting in Davos in 2016. Mr. Schwab's book of the same name argues that the fourth industrial revolution is transforming every sector of the economy and industry through new technologies that merge the physical, digital and biological realms.

In a sprawling home in Punjab, the families of Kanan (Suraj Sharma), a 26-year-old aspiring rapper, and his longtime girlfriend, Anu (Mehreen Pirzada), prepare for their wedding. But Kanan has his doubts — he thinks he might be too young for marriage — and to make matters worse, his family insists he first participate in a ceremony marrying him to a tree. (In this way, he is told, the hapless Kanan can avoid the usual fate of a manglik, a person born under a cursed star.)

Martin Plimmer's essay In Roald Dahl's Car (Jan. 12) reminded me of my days on a rival newspaper, The Bucks Advertiser, when I was sent on similar assignments after the last bus left and had to walk or hitchhike the same scary terrain.
I was introduced to Athill through her memoir Somewhere Towards the End. Published when she was 91, it was a meditation on the mixed bag that is aging. While Athill was quick to point out the injustices of growing older, chief among them giving up sex (Athill loved sex in her very British way, decreeing that every woman should have a few good love affairs), her tone was almost defiantly peppy — never saccharine, but refusing to give in to the weighty fear with which we tend to face the great unknown. I had my first existential crisis (that's putting it generously) at age 13, and sat with the pain for years afterward. My primary literary bedfellows in the ensuing years were death obsessives like Philip Roth and Robert Lowell, or poets who were far too successful in its pursuit (Sylvia Plath, who was less enthusiastic about her life in the London literary scene than Athill, her counterpart who was born more than a decade before her and survived her by more than 50 years). I figured if I couldn't solve the mystery around mortality then I could at least wallow with some of the greats. I was on year 15 of this strategy when I found myself in possession of Athill's slim book in consideration of the topic.
This was the cover of a tax book, one seminarian remarked to me, as he looked at a painted Annunciation by Giovanni di Paolo. Then he added, That's how much religion was a part of life. In mainstream America it is no longer so; indeed, for a young man pursuing a life of celibate devotion to Christ, the world outside the seminary is a minefield of temptations and distractions. Tom Holloway, the former alt-rocker, said once, Every morning when we get out of bed, there's a war going on, and we're right in the middle of it. The world threatens in a multitude of ways; even something as simple as grocery shopping can pose hazards. Lots of magazine covers don't reach Christian modesty, Magat said. I have to pretty much stare straight ahead -- there are half-naked women all over the place! The world threatened, too, during the White House sex scandal, when seminarians had to grapple with whether to read the sexually explicit Starr report. Many did not; some who did went to confession afterward. All whom I spoke to said they prayed for the President, though politically they deplore his support for abortion rights. (In general, their opposition to abortion drives them to the right politically, but not without misgivings -- the Republicans, in their view, do not show enough concern for the poor.) To protect themselves from visual affronts, seminarians employ what they call custody of the eyes. Bashista explained this concept: You just look down.
If the Tsuris Theory of Jewish identity, survival, and unity is true, then Jews are doomed to live precariously on a pendulum perennially swinging in a wide arc between the extremes of persecution and assimilation. As the pendulum swings away from the Scylla of persecution, it inevitably moves toward the Charybdis of assimilation. In this reactive view, Jews have little power over their ultimate destiny. Our enemies always call the shots, either by persecuting us, in which case we fight back and remain Jewish, or by leaving us alone, in which case we assimilate. The only other alternative--the one proposed by Herzl--is for all Jews to move to Israel, where they control their own destiny. But most Jews will continue to ignore that option, certainly if our hosts continue to leave us in peace in our adopted homelands. In this respect, aliyah (emigration) to Israel has also been largely determined by our external enemies, since most Jews who have moved to the Jewish homeland have done so in reaction to anti-Semitism and persecution in their native countries.
very consistent and compelling evidence to suggest the some of what we have witnessed this past week is a reflection of the angst, anger, and refusal to accept an America' in which White (Christian) Americans are losing dominance, be it political, material, and/or cultural. And, I use the term dominance here, because it is not simply a loss of status. It is a loss of power. A more racially, ethnically, religiously diverse US that is also a democracy requires White Americans to acquiesce to the interests and concerns of racial/ethnic and religious minorities.
Her death, at a care facility, was confirmed by her daughter, Linda Alvarado.
Yet despite these enormous gains, many older Jews do not seem to be able to give up their anachronistic status as victims. A recent book on the American Jewish community notes: [A]bout a third [of affiliated Jews in San Francisco said] that Jewish candidates could not be elected to Congress from San Francisco. Yet three out of four Congressional representatives ... were, in fact, well identified Jews at the time the poll was conducted. And they had been elected by a population that was about 95 percent non-Jewish.
Ms. Heyman, on and off dating sites for a decade, said she let potential matches marinate a couple of days before reaching out to Adam Seth Joseph, whose warm smile on the photo he posted caught her eye.
Pogo once said: We have [met] the enemy and he is us! As Jews, we have not yet been given the luxury of seeing ourselves as the enemy. There are still too many external enemies who challenge the very physical survival of the Jewish people in Israel and throughout the world. But as we become stronger in the face of our external enemies, we must prepare to confront ourselves.

No, certainly not before the statements had taken place, and in terms of consequences, I would suggest that someone like Shane had probably paid a price in many ways. Like, aside from being fired, there are many circles that, if he shows up in, he'd be labeled very, very negatively. He reached out to me personally, and I had a conversation with him. The conversation with him made me feel more confident that I'd done the right thing. Because I think in many cases we're trying to follow up on a sense of shame and humiliation that the person might already feel.

Actually, there isn't much about sex in Sex and the Constitution, either, until well into the book, let alone sex and the Constitution together. The first half is a mad dash through history, starting with the Greeks and ending with Senator Joseph McCarthy, the Stonewall uprising and Anita Bryant. This history proceeds in a seesaw manner, with periods of prudery in reaction to periods of license followed by more prudery, followed by license. But since Stone has made it clear that he thinks the general direction life has taken is toward more freedom, he generally approves of the way things have gone.

That autism explodes the conventional American nuclear family narrative makes it irresistible as a metaphor for the stresses of life under late-stage capitalism. In Helen Schulman's A Day at the Beach (2007), a wealthy Manhattan couple navigate the worst day of their lives: the 9/11 disaster, which causes them to flee their swank downtown home (to the Hamptons) and strains their marriage — already at the breaking point owing to a son who shows clear signs of autism. In Gary Shteyngart's Lake Success (2018), a son's autism diagnosis similarly destroys an elite Manhattan family's dreams. The high-living protagonist leaves the scene of an altercation with his wife and nanny over his son and heads straight to the Greyhound station to start a picaresque journey to the other end of the country — a journey in search of an old girlfriend and, one surmises, an autism-less American dream.

Everyone had a sharp memory to share. Jean Cocteau, the poet-playwright-impresario-filmmaker (Beauty and the Beast), recalled Proust's voice: Just as the voice of a ventriloquist comes out of his chest, so Proust's emerged from his soul. The writer Leon-Paul Fargue remembered seeing Proust towards the end of his life, completely pale, with his hair down to his eyebrows, his beard, so black it was blue, devouring his face.... Fargue noticed the long sleeves covering frozen hands, the Persian, almond-shaped eyes. He looked like a man who no longer lives outdoors or by day, a hermit who hasn't emerged from his oak tree for a long time, with something pained about the face, the expression of suffering that has just begun to be calmed. He seemed possessed by a bitter goodness. A young aristocratic woman recalled that when she was a girl she was supposed to be presented to him at a ball, but the great writer, livid and bearded, wearing the collar of his overcoat turned up, stared at her with such intensity that when they were finally introduced she was so frightened she nearly fainted.

On July 27, 1974, the judiciary committee voted 27 to 11, with 6 of the panel's 17 Republicans joining all 21 Democrats, to send to the full House an article of impeachment. The article accused the president of unlawful tactics that constituted a course of conduct or plan to obstruct the investigation of the break-in at the offices of the Democratic opposition in the Watergate complex in Washington by a White House team of burglars.
Public sympathy for the Huawei dynasty, however, slipped badly after a company employee was jailed for 251 days; he had sued the company for a bonus and was jailed for disclosing commercial secrets, though the charges were eventually dropped.

As the poet Bill Berkson once wrote, Martha Diamond, who is known for her indelible New York cityscapes rendered in thick, gestural brush strokes and bold, contrasting colors, builds edifices that bring citified chaos into focus as character, condensing the rush and stabilizing it as an emblem. Next week sees the opening of a new show, at Magenta Plains gallery on Manhattan's Lower East Side, that explores the depths of Diamond's affinity for these structures. Culled from pieces completed in the '80s, a pivotal decade for the artist that culminated in her work appearing in the 1989 Whitney Biennial, the six large-scale oil paintings to go on view share a palette of muted grays, midnight blues, glowing yellows and burnt scarlets — shades encountered on a lonely stroll at night, or thanks to a peek through the blinds after dark. (A number of preparatory studies on Masonite will also be on display.) Having lived and worked on the Bowery since 1969, Diamond indeed draws on scenes from her own walks through the city, depicting grids of buttery windows (as in Moonlight/City View #2, 1981) or stacks of green fence screens on identical balconies (Untitled 11, 1987). She also paints with her nondominant hand, which gives her canvases their intimate, figurative quality. They brood, slump and occasionally menace, and yet they're also solitary and anonymous — in other words, the works themselves are true city dwellers.

In the months that followed, he made other radio speeches and worded actively with other antiwar personalities in public and private life, including Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana; Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia; former President Herbert Hoover; Senator William Borah of Idaho; Henry Ford; Merwin K. Hart, an avowed right-winger; William Castle, a diplomat; Dean Carl Ackerman of the Columbia Journalism School; Theodore Roosevelt Jr.; and James E. Van Zandt, head of the American Legion. Lindbergh spoke and worked under his own auspices until April, 1941, when he joined the national board of the America First Committee, the country's principal antiwar group. Although its membership was heterogeneous, its effective leadership rested with Robert E. Wood, board chairman of Sears, Roebuck & Co., and Robert R. McCormick, publisher of The Chicago Tribune. Both were archconservatives and zealous haters of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. America First was strongest in the Midwest, the traditional seat of the nation's isolationist attitudes; but it was also a powerful force in New York and Boston. Popular support for its antiwar objectives was widespread, and Lindbergh epitomized that support. He rallied millions to the cause with such effectiveness that Roosevelt considered him a major threat. The President vented his anger at a news conference in April, 1941. Roosevelt was asked why he did not call Lindbergh, an Army officer, into uniform.
People do one of three things, Holloway says. Suddenly they get really nice, and they want you to think they're really good people. Somebody my age, they're calling me Sir. The second one is, people get very stony, like they're mad at you. They just glare. The third one is my favorite: you walk in and they do a double take and they look really scared, like, Why is he dressed like that? He knows my secrets! The sight of a Roman collar, the seminarians go on to explain, can have the power to flush profanity from conversations, douse lovers' fights and halt the scolding of children. Airplane rides are notorious for inspiring long queries from seatmates, Catholic and non-Catholic alike, even when the seminarian isn't wearing clerics; the sight of a breviary is often enough to set things off. (Priests regularly hear confessions on airplanes, I'm told, finding two back seats for that purpose whenever possible.) Jerome Magat, a brainy, energetic 26-year-old of Filipino descent, is a second-year seminarian, so he wears clerics off-campus only when attending a formal, ecclesiastical event or when visiting hospitals, homeless shelters, prisons and schools, which is part of the seminary program. It's that supernatural element, Magat says of the reactions his clerics provoke. There's a mystery about the priesthood. Some of that mystery inheres in the very nature of the Catholic priesthood.

Elite hospitals have vaccinated workers who were supposed to wait. Frontline workers waited in line to receive the Covid-19 vaccine at a hospital in Arlington, Va., last month. Credit... Michael A. McCoy for The New York Times At leading research hospitals in the United States, administrators and young graduate students have been inoculated with some of the earliest supplies of coronavirus vaccines, in a contradiction of federal and state guidelines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued recommendations intended to ensure that the nation's vaccines first reach those at highest risk: health care workers who interact with Covid-19 patients, and residents and staff members at nursing homes, followed by people 75 and older and certain essential workers. Each state has established its own version of the guidelines, but with the rollout proceeding at a glacial pace, pressure has been growing for a more flexible approach. Officials at the C.D.C. and the Food and Drug Administration have recently suggested that it might be wiser to simply loosen the criteria and distribute the vaccine as widely as possible. But a handful of the nation's most prestigious academic hospitals have already taken the notion much further. A 20-something who works on computers. A young researcher who studies cancer.

In the same book Athill reflects on how her relationship to sex had gone through several stages and had not always been a happy one, but that had always seemed central to my existence. Sex, she explains, obliterates the individuality of young women more often than it does that of young men, because so much more of a woman than a man is used by sex. And her individuality appears to be the quality Athill valued most as she made decisions that were unorthodox, and geared to maximize joy and minimize obligation. She wasn't the workaholic we expect passionately single women to be (in the movies, it seems everyone who's unmarried by choice wears a blazer and wields a Blackberry), proclaiming in Stet, I was not ashamed of valuing my private life more highly than my work; that, to my mind, is what everyone ought to do.
One reflection of our country's toxic partisanship is that families may now find dinner-table conversations about politics impossible. Yet if people can't talk about the things that divide us with their families — where there's a background assumption that you should try to stick together even when you disagree — you've got to wonder where they can. So I'd be inclined to have a go at talking to this fellow about his noxious opinions, letting him know what you think. If most of his political discussions are in the echo chamber of social media and on a right-wing radio station, you and your family may be the only fellow citizens of his who have a chance to make him consider other points of view. Supposing that he doesn't respond reasonably — the likeliest outcome, no doubt — you can tell him that you're breaking off with him, and he'll know your reasons. But at least you'll have treated him respectfully, both as someone you had a family connection with and as a fellow American citizen.
Not all his big bets paid off. Perhaps his best-known debacle was Jobriath, a gay performer whom Mr. Brandt backed with a lavish promotional campaign in 1973 and '74, hoping to create an American version of David Bowie's androgynous Ziggy Stardust persona. The concertgoing and record-buying public soundly rejected the attempt to manufacture a star, and Jobriath, whose real name was Bruce Campbell, faded quickly.

And in Southern California, Los Angeles is now the epicenter of the pandemic, leading the nation both in confirmed cases and in numbers of deaths.

Here are two novels that are, in some ways, opposites: one by an author who's been publishing celebrated work for 40 years, and one a debut; one that blends numerous genres with a skillful and inquiring hand, and one that glories in modeling a single genre by hitting every one of its notes. Between them they contrast the pleasures of surprise with those of satisfied expectations.

Well, that's your assumption that Brooks wouldn't stop and turn around and come back. It was evident that he was running, yes. But if he decided to stop and come back, it could have been used.

Six women will be called to testify about their allegations that Mr. Weinstein sexually assaulted them. Four of those incidents happened too long ago to be prosecuted as separate crimes, but prosecutors hope their testimony will show a pattern of predatory behavior.
They see you with a dog and all their defenses go down, said Mr. Morrill, 59, a businessman in Jersey City, N.J. They assume you must be a decent human being. How could you have a dog and be a bad person?

George Nicolau, a prominent arbitrator who determined that Major League Baseball teams colluded in the 1980s to restrict bidding for free agents, leading club owners to pay players $280 million in damages, died on Jan. 2 in Manhattan. He was 94.
Mr. Cuomo made no mention of the bail reform on Wednesday during his speech, which included quotations from George Washington, Henry David Thoreau and the singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, and an extended nautical theme, with mentions of rocky shores, rough seas, and a political and social superstorm of anger and divisive rhetoric.
BA: But that just brings us to the other side of it, where what you're proposing is not to give as much more money to the people who need it the most. You're saying, if you get food stamps, the amount by which your government benefits increase will be less than for me or you.
But he doesn't volunteer lengthy ruminations about its impact on how he sees the world or showcase it in any other way. It's there if you look and listen for it. But sometimes you have to look and listen hard.
You're right, I did promise that. And here's the greater significance. Harry and Meghan are not just leaving Britain at any old time. They're leaving Britain at the very moment that Britain is leaving the European Union, that it is finally carrying out Brexit.
After all, early in the last decade, there were back-to-back best picture victories for films centered on making movies. The Artist (2011) won using precious few words to tell the story of a pair of actors struggling to make the transition from silents to talkies. A year later, Argo (2012) took the crown for its based-on-real-life tale of C.I.A. agents working with silver-screen producers to camouflage a dangerous mission as an innocent motion picture. And for years, awards-season pundits have repeated the old saw that the academy votes for films that remind voters of themselves.

The story recurs, with even more tragic consequences, on the eve of the Holocaust. Another great Eastern European rabbi, Elchanan Wasserman--the dean of the Rabbinical College in Baranowitz, Poland--was invited to bring his entire student body and faculty to Yeshiva College in New York or to the Beis Medrish Letorah in Chicago, both distinguished Orthodox rabbinical colleges. He declined the invitations because they are both places of spiritual danger, for they are run in a spirit of freethinking. The great rabbi reasoned, What would one gain to escape physical danger in order to then confront spiritual danger? Rabbi Wasserman, his family, his students, and their teachers remained in Poland, where they were murdered by the Nazis.
But the most important contrast is in the comic's discussion of his own infidelity. Until Tamborine, Rock was known as a social commentator who mostly kept his private life at a distance. But addressing his divorce and his responsibility for the failure of his marriage, Rock made the most vulnerable, introspective comedy of his career. Burnham was clearly drawn to this aspect of the set and focused on it. This material, including jokes about marriage, divorce and sex, takes up about half of the special, as opposed to around a third of the extended version.

I'm not going to dispute the fact of what you're saying. One, I haven't pulled the stats. I'll take your word for the stats. You said three or four cities. I said one city. So the thing is, you can go to your state's and pull yours. I can go to my state's and pull mine. Now, is there departments that actually may have it? I'm not going to argue that point. You're probably — yes, that could be absolutely right. I just think that trying to go to our respective corners, if you would, and make our arguments is not going to do it. We in law enforcement have to admit that in the Black community, this is how they feel. How do we prevent them from feeling that way?
Jeneen Interlandi: Oh no, go ahead.

What would you think the greatest strength of Walter White is? Because I'd love to go through some of your recent characters like that.
BA: But you're not proposing to fix any of that. People don't just work to make money; they do work for a sense of self-worth. They work so that they can develop skills, they work so they have the possibility of earning more money someday. You're proposing to replace a portion of the income they may have lost, but not any of those other things. Why is that a solution?
Mr. Yang, a former technology executive and entrepreneur, has distinguished himself from Senator Sanders and the far left of the Democratic Party in making the case for a more humane capitalist system, what he calls human-centered capitalism.
His first grid contained theme answers I wasn't wild about (ARMY BRAT, ALL BETTER) so I had the nerve to ask him to redo it, as I had my heart set on more sparkly fill like AURORA BOREALIS and AWESOME BLOSSOM. Joon generously obliged and then showed me where he had hidden our names, which leads me to how the published puzzle is a little different than the one we had at the wedding.
The historian and author, most recently, of the novel Red Sky at Noon has little patience for thrillers that rely on tricks: When I found out the 'Girl' wasn't quite 'Gone,' I went.
Six years later Pius IX organized the declaration of papal infallibility at the First Vatican Council (1870), declining to countenance historical evidence (provided by Newman, among others) which showed that papal supremacy itself, let alone papal infallibility, was based on several centuries of development out of an early church that had been constituted quite differently. Papal infallibility, whatever its other consequences, represented a disastrous reversal for Catholic historians, who had dedicated themselves to close analysis of the early church. The pontificate of Leo XIII (1878-1903) promised them some relief, but his encyclical letter Aeterni Patris (1879) aimed to revive scholasticism, keeping new philosophical and historical approaches at arm's length. Its successor, Providentissimus Deus (1893), set sharp limits on Catholic participation in historical-critical study of the Bible.
—— more strong and more whole. There's a saying, I think it was actually, and maybe in this … no, it was an earlier administration, but a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. There was a crisis. There was a massive opportunity to help rebalance our economy, but we instead recapitalized the banks to the tune of $4 trillion. And what I say to Americans around the country, I say, Hey, do you remember voting for the $4 trillion bailout of Wall Street? And it gets this laugh. But then they answer, Wait, we did that? And it's, Of course we didn't vote for that.
Instead, the media cites China's response as proof of the superiority of the country's authoritarian system, especially compared with that of the United States and other democracies, which are still struggling to contain raging outbreaks And now, as the Jan. 23 anniversary of Wuhan's lockdown nears, the government has deployed an army of censors to scrub the internet of critical coverage of the Wuhan outbreak. A recent propaganda directive explicitly banned coverage of the anniversary of the outbreak, according to journalists at state-run news outlets who were briefed on the order. Instead, propaganda agencies have pushed feel-good videos and adulatory articles that depict Wuhan as a city reborn. The government underscored its message to the media last month when it sentenced Zhang Zhan, a 37-year-old citizen journalist who documented Wuhan's ordeal, to four years in prison. She is the first person known to have faced trial for chronicling China's outbreak. Amy Qin and
Taryn Cornick was 19 when her sister, Beatrice, was murdered, and her rage and grief over that loss have shaped her life: her distance from her famous-actor father, her marriage to a wealthy older man, and her strange, brief intimacy with a Canadian wilderness guide she calls the Muleskinner. Several years later, Taryn is the successful author of a book called The Feverish Library, about the dangers faced by collections of books over centuries. It includes anecdotes about the Firestarter: a locked scroll box that is said to have survived no fewer than five fires in famous libraries.
JW: Right, but you're talking about expanding the court, too, and if you expand the court, as you say correctly, that it's a federal law, there's nothing in the Constitution about the number of justices. You expand it to 13, the next Republican who comes in, who is furious about women having too many reproductive rights, will expand it to 17 to overturn the rulings you just got. So, how doesn't that just become — doesn't devolve into ——
Is my child's behavior normal? It's a parenting question for the ages, particularly at a time when a certain type of parent (present company included) frets over every childhood quirk, no matter how mundane. Does the preschooler with a predilection for hitting need a professional intervention, or maybe just a taekwondo class? Is the kid who drops naps but not tantrums a future rageaholic? This sort of hand-wringing, at its most extreme, is at the center of Ashley Audrain's taut, chilling debut novel, The Push.
In fall 2019, Portia Carryer was mourning the loss of her beloved dog, a German shepherd named Rilke. That's when Rory Jelinski made her presence felt.
Sometimes, property owners try to hide flaws. Vincent Fundaro, the owner of Square One Professional Home Inspectors in Levittown, N.Y., was inspecting a ground floor condominium on West 22nd Street in Manhattan last April. The apartment, which was listed for $1.8 million, had new kitchen cabinets and new floors. As he walked through the garden level, he tripped over a white shag carpet, revealing the floorboards, which were floating in water. The owner had covered the boards with newspaper and plastic to keep the water from seeping through, but the water problem was unmistakable. It was definitely saturated, Mr. Fundaro said. You would step on it and float.
In her latest starring role, Sharon Stone plays Senna, a woman who has found herself spiritually comfortable, but romantically, financially, and professionally at sea. Senna's career as a fashion buyer is at a standstill, and her dreams of becoming a designer seem out of reach. Marriage, she thinks, doesn't suit her. But thanks to the meddling of her friend Darla (Liza Lapira), she meets cute with Adam (Tony Goldwyn), a lawyer with a heart of gold. Susan Walter's All I Wish checks in with Senna over the course of several birthdays thereafter, and we watch as this free spirit changes her ways, locking down a bridegroom to go with her business.

The Dreyfus Affair is worth a short detour, since it split French society for many years and it became a major topic in proust's life--and in Remembrance of Things Past. Alfred Dreyfus (1859-1935) was a Jew and a captain in the French army. In December 1894 he was condemned by a military court for having sold military secrets to the Germans and was sent for life to Devil's Island. The accusation was based on the evidence of a memorandum stolen from the German embassy in Paris (despite the fact that the writing did not resemble Dreyfus's) and of a dossier (which was kept classified and secret) handed over to the military court by the minister of war. In 1896 another French soldier, Major Georges Picquart, proved that the memorandum had been written not by Dreyfus but by a certain Major Marie Charles Esterhazy. Yet Esterhazy was acquitted and Picquart was imprisoned. Instantly a large part of the population called for a retrial of Dreyfus. On January 13, 1898, the writer Emile Zola published an open letter, J'accuse, directed against the army's general staff; Zola was tried and found guilty of besmirching the reputation of the army. He was forced to flee to England. Then in September 1898 it was proved that the only piece of evidence against Dreyfus in the secret military dossier had been faked by Joseph Henry, who confessed his misdeed and committed suicide. At last the government ordered a retrial of Dreyfus.
They should be, I mean clearly. Because if you spend time on these campuses, you know where they're going. So one thing you can do that's very, very fast and immediate is you can become much more flexible in terms of compensation and a type of work environment.
The Oscar race is in full swing, and all eyes are on the big contenders: Joker! Marriage Story! Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood!
The fashion-conscious Christine chose the sisters' matching wardrobes, Dorothy kept track of finances, and Phyllis did most of the talking for the trio. Their million-selling records included two No. 1 hits, Sincerely in 1955 and Sugartime in 1958. Like other white performers of their generation, they recorded what critics called blander (but often better-selling) covers of rhythm-and-blues hits by black artists.
Mr. Yang was asked on CNN's The Van Jones Show about cancel culture and whether Americans have gone too far in the direction of a lack of grace or a lack of forgiveness. He responded: I'm new to politics, but I certainly would hate to be judged by something I did 25 years ago.
The couple, who have four children, wrote that they see wonderful futures ahead, as parents, friends, partners in ventures and projects, and as individuals pursuing ventures and adventures.
The couple became engaged in July on a trip to Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay and began to plan their wedding soon after. They considered holding the ceremony in Hong Kong, to make it easier and safer for their families to attend, but chose California instead after Mr. Lau's parents, Yuk-Lai and Margaret Lau, and Ms. Chau's parents, Tak Cheong and Kitty Chau, both assured them that they were happy to make the journey from Hong Kong to the United States despite the difficulties and risk involved during a pandemic.
Yet Becca Blackwell's tentative performance as Diane has no magnetism. Subdued to the point of flatness, it drains the life out of Ms. George's humor — a particular shame for the beautifully written monologues. Instead of an enigmatic god, the Diane before us is closer to a nonentity, and the sexual energy among her and the women, vital to moments of attraction and abandon, is nowhere to be found. It's not credible that this outsider would succeed at not only insinuating herself into the group but also commanding it.

So when Ms. Monk told a co-worker about her attraction to Mr. Gerdes, 42, he promptly invited them both to a local bar. Then he sat them down together and left. Sparks flew. Within a year, they were living together in a new Chicago apartment, where they let a dozen years pass without much talk of marriage. I'm a little shy, and essentially it felt like we were married anyway, Ms. Monk said.

To formulate her policy, Ms. Alves has made clear she consulted closely with the team behind a campaign called I Chose to Wait, started by evangelical pastors with a large social media following. In doing so, she has incited a heated debate about reproductive rights and sex education in Latin America's largest nation.
A few hours after the vote, Clinton, surrounded by Democrats, walked into the South Lawn of the White House, his wife, Hillary, on his arm, to pre-empt calls for his resignation. The man who in better days had debated where he would stand in the pantheon of American Presidents said he would stay in office and vowed to go on from here to rise above the rancor, to overcome the pain and division, to be a repairer of the breach. Later, Clinton called off the bombing in Iraq, declaring the mission accomplished.
I've been a registered Democrat since the Clinton years; I was an Obama appointee. I had a fund-raiser for John Kerry. It wasn't a great fund-raiser because I was kind of young; it wasn't one of those fancy ones where you generate tens of thousands.
Vince, I want to talk about the protests that have been happening all over the country. And I'm curious what you think, as a union leader, when you have seen these vast crowds in 2,000 U.S. cities and towns, protesting the death of Rashard Brooks, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, among many others. What did you see when you watched those?
Eventually we were able to resume our long bike rides, with him on a recumbent tricycle (lacking the balance for a two-wheeler). He used to ride in front, acting as my wind block, guide and protector. Now he trails behind. I look down at his helmet, at the person on the bright yellow recumbent tricycle and wonder, Who is this stranger?
In Han Kang's propulsive, lacerating novel The Vegetarian, translated from the Korean by Deborah Smith, the bloodless union between Yeong-hye, a hushed bookworm, and her largely indifferent husband ruptures when she ceases to be a carnivore. Stop eating meat, and the world will devour you whole, Yeong-hye's mother chides. And she's right: When Yeong-hye asserts her dietary will, characters around her react with violent rage.
So I have a three-part test for sending troops into harm's way. Number one, it needs to advance a vital American interest or avert a humanitarian catastrophe. Number two, it has to have a clearly defined timeline where we can look troops in the eyes and say, It's going to take this long and you're going to be able to accomplish our mission and then you're going to be able to come home. And not some boardroom self-delusion, like you actually believe that you're going to get it done and then be able to bring them home in that time frame. And number three, we're not going in alone; there are allies joining us in the mission. If those three things are in place, then I would consider sending our troops into harm's way.
The government's repayment policy is an extension of its approach to British tourists or other citizens who get in trouble abroad and need help returning to the United Kingdom. People 18 years or older have to reimburse the government.

The show is forthright, sometimes surprisingly so, about the, uh, ins and outs of bodies and partnerships, but in a mostly sweet and sincere way.
A second article of impeachment, charging Clinton with obstruction of justice, passed on a narrower vote of 221 to 212. It accused him of inducing others to lie in order conceal his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. This time 12 Republicans voted no, while 5 Democrats voted yes.
His wife, Jani, said the cause was Parkinson's disease.
BS: Would you dilate what you're talking — seven years doing what?
Only in August, after it became known that Ms. Lewinsky had preserved a blue dress that provided evidence of their affair, did Clinton tell the nation and a grand jury that he had had an inappropriate relationship with her.
The day Paradise burned, Aaron Singer was a skeptic. Then he saw the flames in his rearview mirror.
One, it's a lot easier and cheaper for us to throw kids into a classroom with textbooks and a teacher and say, You're going to go to college, than it is to try and train them in skills that are going to give them a secure livelihood. Number two, we have fetishized college and stigmatized anything that's not college. We've beaten Americans over the head, pretended everyone's going to college and say, It's going to work for you. And the Democrats are guilty of this. That's why they're yelling, Free college, free college. Meanwhile, again, only 33 percent of Americans are going to go to college, and that is a relatively stable number.
The show's casting diversity is its most immediately striking quality, not just in Black aristocratic characters like the duke and Lady Danbury, but also in the entrepreneurial Madame Genevieve Delacroix (Kathryn Drysdale) and the working-class couple Will and Alice Mondrich (Martins Imhangbe and Emma Naomi). All of them are central to the complicated social caste system that make up the show's version of early 1800s London.
Earmarking allows Congress to appropriate discretionary funds for specific projects. Mr. Yang supports them because he feels they allow representatives to generate revenue for their constituents to offset costs their area might experience from a given piece of legislation.
That's all in the Lardner, but Mr. Lithgow adds another emotional channel by showing us how the barber, himself a good old boy, is implicated in the nastiness he pretends only to describe. An astonishing collection of laughs — whinnies, giggles, squeals, snorts, heaves — gradually colors the narrative, until this seemingly harmless man becomes, in effect, not just a witness to savagery, but also an accessory.
I still could not bring myself to call my uncle, but as I watched my mother grieve, I began to rethink. I came to realize that in my self-righteous pursuit of justice, I had committed injustice against myself and my loved ones. My resentment blinded me to what was truly important: my empathy and humanity. I had dehumanized one of my most beloved, just as he had dehumanized me. I was angry at him for abandoning me while I was in prison, yet when he became a prisoner of his own body, I was ready to abandon him.
Especially for people who are at the lower end of the skills ladder, which is most Americans. Only 33 percent of Americans will graduate from college, 42 percent if you include two-year degrees.
So for a high school graduate in America to get by, if you have one health problem or car breakdown, it can take a very tenuous financial situation and send it in a downward spiral. Then how do you put food on the table? In theory, there are nonprofits and food pantries that would see to this, but we all know that they're dramatically underresourced relative to the need. And so when you look at the causes of food poverty, to me the best solution is instead of trying to create organizations that will put food into people's hands, which we should do obviously, we should just put money into Americans' hands and then they would be able to procure food to provide for themselves and their families.
A coronavirus infection at an air traffic control center near Washington causes delays. The Washington Air Traffic Control Center in Leesburg, Va., in 2001. Credit... Paul Hosefros/The New York Times Delays were reported at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport after an air traffic control center that serves the area reported a coronavirus infection and closed for cleaning on Sunday, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center, located in Leesburg, Va., was closed from 11:45 a.m. to 1:45 p.m. for cleaning. It is one of 20 such centers in the United States, which generally provide service to aircraft while they are en route, as opposed to airport control towers, which handle takeoffs and landings. While the center was closed, the controllers worked from an alternate location, the F.A.A. said, and airplanes were routed around the airspace or handled by underlying facilities. Reagan airport attributed delays of more than 45 minutes to the Washington Center's closure but no others in the region did. The delays appear to have been resolved by midafternoon. There have been at least 13 prior reported cases at the center, according to the F.A.A. It was not immediately clear if any of those had resulted in closures of the facility. Other air route traffic control centers have similarly closed for cleaning after infections were discovered over the past few months, resulting in widespread delays. In December, the one in Memphis was closed for cleaning after an employee tested positive, resulting in slight delays.
People on terrorism watch list are said to have been part of crowd in Washington on the day of Capitol riot. A mob of Trump supporters overtake the Capitol last week. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times Several people on a terrorist watch list were in Washington last week for pro-Trump events that ultimately devolved into the assault on the Capitol, according to a government official briefed on the Justice Department investigation into the riot. Most are suspected white supremacists, according to The Washington Post, which first reported on their status on the list. It was not clear how many people on the watch list were part of the mob that stormed the Capitol. But their presence in Washington last week adds to the urgent questions about security preparations for the events of Jan. 6, ahead of which thousands of supporters of President Trump had vowed to travel to Washington to disrupt, even violently, the congressional certification of the Electoral College results of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s win. The people were listed on the government's main terrorism watch list, the Terrorism Screening Database, one of several databases of people that law enforcement and intelligence officials have deemed to be known or suspected terrorists. The tool has undergone explosive growth in the era following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. As the lists were rapidly growing over a decade ago, the F.B.I.
So this is the carrot and the stick. So imagine if you had data standards that were endorsed by the U.S., the E.U., and Japan, and it had certain technology protocols associated with it. Then China said, Hey, I don't want to adhere to that. Because like you said, they like to hoard data, and one of the reasons why they're in position to leapfrog us is they have more data than we do and they have essentially nonexistent privacy rights or regulations. They have complete surveillance. That's one reason why they've banned masks in Hong Kong, so that their surveillance technology can pick up who the protesters are. So China has its own vast hoard of data.
MADNESS IS BETTER THAN DEFEAT, by Ned Beauman. (Vintage, $17.) Emboldened by fungal clairvoyance after inhaling mold in an old temple, a C.I.A. agent tells the story of a fateful meeting in the Honduran jungle in 1938. The novel's twists and turns touch on everything from colonialism to conspiracy theories. Our reviewer, Helene Stapinski, called the story a kitchen-sink sendup of spy novels, 1930s Hollywood and screwball newspaper comedies, with a pinch of Pynchon thrown in for fun.
And that is very much the way it's interpreted. And I think also, it's the way that Meghan Markle intended for it to be interpreted. She knew she was going to be asked that question. I don't think there was anything accidental about the reply, nor do I think anyone misinterpreted who she meant when she said not many people have asked if I'm O.K. By that she meant members of the royal family. But it doesn't end there.
Without thinking about it I found I had brought along my notebook, my flashlight, my rubber gloves, and my .38 snub.

A 2016 study from the economists Lawrence Katz at Harvard and Alan Krueger at Princeton found that 94 percent of net job growth between 2005 and 2015 was alternative work, including independent contractors, freelancers and temps.
I suppose this was inevitable in the age of Donald Trump. Before his election, I had a wariness about racism that was abstract and low key; it noted things, like being the only black person in an E.R., but it was chiefly interested in gathering information, reflecting, analyzing. Now, that racial awareness has become visceral and overstimulated. When something racially questionable happens, I tend to leap immediately to anger. This happens even when I know distinctly I shouldn't leap. But it doesn't matter.
You approach the character the same way, as far as developmental qualities. You have to be insatiably curious and enjoy the research. You have to have talent to be able to bring it out. You have to use your imagination to string together any elements of a character that you have not had personal experience with. And the last part, the fourth part, is that you must be willing and able to open up the cavity of your own emotions to pull out what is appropriate, and that is to make yourself look good, bad. It's rage. It's public or physical vulnerability. Like in Breaking Bad, I wanted the character to be soft and pudgy and overweight, so I wanted the love handles to spill out over my underwear. I wanted that. I needed the audience to feel sorry for this guy, that he's gone to seed, that he's lost his desire and his hope and his drive. And that's the whole point of the story is that he gets that back once he makes his decision to do his evil deeds. So he transforms his body and his look and his attitude and his ability to intimidate and his level of confidence, and all those things completely change.
Mr. Yang and his family began attending Sunday services at the Reformed Church of New Paltz after they purchased a home nearby in 2015.

I mean, that's not solely an American decision. NATO expansion is something that is fraught and elevates tensions with Russia in particular. I think we should explore it. I'm sympathetic, but it's not a decision we can make alone.

Sex might be easy, but relationships are hard. And a 400-page novel can teach you more about them than any X-rated clip. Fiction has time to draw a deeper picture, covering the getting-to-know-you stuff, the starts and stops and circling back that take boy and girl from first date to first kiss to the moment where they're both naked and hopefully into what's going to happen next.
Critics of California's approach say that making state standards and textbooks longer and more inclusive can be overwhelming to teachers trying to move quickly through hundreds of years of material.
No, certainly not before the statements had taken place, and in terms of consequences, I would suggest that someone like Shane had probably paid a price in many ways. Like, aside from being fired, there are many circles that, if he shows up in, he'd be labeled very, very negatively. He reached out to me personally, and I had a conversation with him. The conversation with him made me feel more confident that I'd done the right thing. Because I think in many cases we're trying to follow up on a sense of shame and humiliation that the person might already feel.
During an interview on CNN, Paul Howard, the Fulton County district attorney, was asked about claims that his prosecution of officers Rolfe and Brosnan is politically motivated.
Each time we have new technologies, there's a wave of alarmism that follows, he said. It happened first with porn, then with internet dating, then with Snapchat sexting. One by one these technologies come along and there's this wave of panic. But as people start to use these technologies, they become part of our lives.
An online video created for AeroMexico by the Ogilvy advertising agency last year played on the trend, offering discounts to Americans to fly to Mexico based on the portion of their heritage that a DNA test determined was from Mexico. Amid the debate around border security, the ad has recently gone viral on the Internet. John Raul Forero, the chief creative officer for Ogilvy Latam confirmed in an email that the ad had been created last year for the airline but had no further comment. The DNA promotion is no longer valid, according to Paula Santiago, a spokeswoman for the agency.

In the case of the very different documentaries Time and Saudi Runaway, the desire to make movies isn't simply about having a say — getting the chance to pick up a camera and share your vision with the world freely — it is also a matter of life itself. Each documentary centers on an extraordinarily gutsy woman who put her everyday existence on camera, detailing her days and nights in intimate, pointillist detail much like a diarist. Each woman subsequently handed over what she had shot to a female director, who then shaped the material, turning self-expression into collective vision.
To formulate her policy, Ms. Alves has made clear she consulted closely with the team behind a campaign called I Chose to Wait, started by evangelical pastors with a large social media following.

Badrinath (Varun Dhawan), the fellow who falls for Vaidehi — at a wedding, of course — comes from a well-to-do family in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, that practically screams patriarchy. (His mother and sister-in-law are mainly silent; his father is a scowling tyrant with a sadistic streak.) Badrinath may be a notch or two above Vaidehi socially, but as she points out to him, he's not her equal: She's smart and ambitious; he's neither. He is, though, sweet and persistent. Reader, she agrees to marry him.
I cut off ties with everyone, as I didn't want them tracking me down, he said about family and friends in Romania. I knew it was hard for my daughter, but I felt it would be better for her.
There's no question. If I felt, in my heart of hearts, that by doing the right thing, it would put my child in mortal danger and the threat is very real, I wouldn't put them in it.
Her mother, who had gotten married at 14 to a stranger twice her age, couldn't understand the fuss. She'd stuck with her husband for five decades until he died, and was appalled that young women these days didn't do the same.
Mr. Yang started Venture for America in 2011, shortly after selling his test prep company to Kaplan. He said that he saw, in the wake of the financial crisis, how certain communities were rapidly losing jobs and wanted to create new work opportunities in those underserved areas.
These are some of the thousands of people who have been immunized against the coronavirus at hospitals affiliated with Columbia University, New York University, Harvard and Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, even as millions of frontline workers and older Americans are waiting their turns. Some of the institutions were among the first recipients of the limited supplies in the United States. The C.D.C. never intended to include workers who don't interact with patients, like administrators and graduate students, in the first tier of priority vaccinations, said Dr. Stanley Perlman, an immunologist at the University of Iowa and a member of the committee that issued the recommendations. This all got so confusing, he said. In retrospect, I think it probably needed to be a little more exact on what we were thinking, because we were never thinking about hospital administrators.
That song is Gotta Get Up, the opening track from the late singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson's 1971 album Nilsson Schmilsson, and its bright, infectious instrumentation belies melancholy, wistful lyrics about growing older.
We're preparing as though we're going to go in the next hour, he said. Both Mr. Raskin and Mr. Castro declined to offer details about when the impeachment article against Mr. Trump would be brought to the Senate or whether Democrats would push to call witnesses in the trial. No witnesses were called in Mr. Trump's first impeachment trial, which unfolded last year while the chamber was controlled by Republicans. Democrats will control the Senate for this second trial. The remarks by Democrats defending the impeachment effort came as Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, wrote a letter to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, calling for a vote to dismiss the article of impeachment. Mr. Graham argued that a trial after Mr. Trump's departure was unconstitutional and would further divide the country. In an interview on Fox News's Sunday Morning Futures, Mr. Graham also called the strategy insane on every level and urged President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. to call on members of his party to change course. If you don't stand up against the impeachment of Donald Trump after he leaves office, you're an incredibly weak figure in American history, Mr. Graham said, directly addressing Mr. Biden. He also claimed, without further explanation, that Mr. Trump was trying to heal the nation.

Focus is crucial, and we do best when monotasking: Even disruptions of a few seconds can derail one's train of thought. Students process information better when they take notes — they don't just transcribe, as they do with laptops, but they think and record those thoughts. One study found that laptops or tablets consistently undermine exam performance by 1.7 percent (a significant difference in the context of the study). Other studies reveal that writing by hand helps memory retention. Screens block us from connecting, whether at dinner or in a classroom. Kelly McGonigal, a psychologist and lecturer at Stanford University, says that just having a phone on a table during a meal is sufficiently distracting to reduce empathy and rapport between two people.

I mean, you could make it so it's analogous to what happened in the tobacco industry, where there's a certain level of revenue that gets set aside and then you have various public service announcements.
Biden plans to roll out dozens of executive orders in his first 10 days as president. Credit... Amr Alfiky/The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., inheriting a collection of crises unlike any in generations, plans to start his administration with dozens of executive directives on top of expansive legislative proposals in a 10-day blitz meant to signal a turning point for a nation reeling from disease, economic turmoil, racial strife and now the aftermath of the assault on the Capitol. Mr. Biden's team has developed a raft of decrees that he can issue on his own authority after the inauguration on Wednesday to begin reversing some of President Trump's most hotly disputed policies. Advisers hope the flurry of action, without waiting for Congress, will establish a sense of momentum for the new president even as the Senate puts his predecessor on trial. On his first day in office alone, Mr. Biden intends a flurry of executive orders that will be partly substantive and partly symbolic. They include rescinding the travel ban on several predominantly Muslim countries; rejoining the Paris climate change accord; extending pandemic-related limits on evictions and student loan payments; issuing a mask mandate for federal property and interstate travel; and ordering agencies to figure out how to reunite children separated from their families after crossing the border, according to a memo circulated on Saturday by Ron Klain, his incoming White House chief of staff, and obtained by The New York Times.
A maid in Stockholm at 13, a fashion model in 1930s Paris, unemployed and poverty-stricken in New York, torpedoed in World War II: Doris struggles like Job. But help always pops up in the nick of time. A fellow Swede on a New York bus offers a home; a sailor on a dark pier provides a disguise and a job on a ship to Europe; unexpected funds arrive in the mail. There is a slightly breezy overlooking of travel logistics and the realities of war, but the story is a colorful page-turner.
The Fun of Flying Afterward, I remember lying in the grass and looking up at the clouds and thinking how much fun it would be to fly up there among those clouds, he recalled in later years, adding: I didn't think of the hazards--I was just interested in getting up there in the clouds. But he was torn for a time by a strong yearning to go to Alaska, a land pictured as wild frontier and the source of mythic Gold Rush tales. For him Alaska was also the scene of Robert W. Service's verse, some of which he memorized so thoroughly that he could recite it faultlessly in old age. Although Lindbergh Sr. led an active and exciting political life as a maverick Republican who battled (and helped to overthrow) the entrenched Establishment in the House, led an assault on the money trust and voted against American entry into World War I, his son was bored by politics and all the speeches. The issue that his father espoused in Congress and later as a Farmer-Laborite supporter of Robert LaFollette failed, so the son said, to make any impressions on him. His mother, too, eschewed political thinking. In World War I, Lindbergh operated the family farm, leaving it in the fall of 1920 to study engineering at the University of Wisconsin.
And that's probably a generous response. Some of the responses would be worse than that. So if you get the boot off people's throats, then you can start making progress on our health, on our educational outcomes, on our political polarization.

After the class recited the Our Father, the teacher, Sister Paula Jean Miller, got down to business: the topic of the day was the theology of sexuality. Drawing on Pope John Paul II's theology of the body, Miller explained that total self-donation, or self-gift, is the goal for human relationships -- and also a way of explaining why married people should not use contraception. Sexual intercourse is a cause of grace within the sacrament of marriage, Miller said. Just as the Father gives himself totally to the Son and the Son gives himself back totally to the father, that's the standard of love for us. Contraception is a holding back of some very critical aspect of ourselves, of who I am. It's saying to you, I want you but I don't want your fertility, at least not right now. And the goal is total self-gift. (Actually, a majority of Catholic theologians disagree with this position.) Only in the last 30 years has the concept of self-gift come to coexist with procreation in the Catholic Church as the criterion for the moral rightness of a sexual act, according to Richard McCormick, professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame. Self-gift, the seminarians are taught, can be used to explain what is wrong with masturbation (it involves no giving to another), lust (it involves taking rather than giving, thus reducing one's partner to the status of an object) and homosexuality (the other is not other, and thus self-gift is not really possible).
Note meant n.o.d.--notification of death. In other words, he wanted me to go tell somebody that somebody close had died. That somebody they loved had died: This was already clear, from his voice. And died suddenly. And violently. I considered. I could have said, I don't do that anymore (though Asset Forfeiture, in fact, is hardly corpse-free). And then we might have had one of those bullshit TV conversations, with him saying You got to help me out and Mike, I'm begging you, and me saying Forget it and No way and Dream on, pal, until everyone is bored blind and I finally come across. I mean, why say no when you have to say yes? For things to proceed. So I just said, again: Well, let's hear it.
The man, Robert Sanford, is charged with assaulting a law enforcement officer engaged in the performance of official duties and civil disorder among other crimes. Mr. Sanford went to the Capitol following the president's instructions, a complaining witness told the F.B.I. Another man was charged on Thursday after law enforcement officials identified him as the person seen repeatedly striking an officer with a flagpole on the stairs of the Capitol in a video posted on Twitter. That man, Peter Stager of Arkansas, was charged with obstructing law enforcement, according to the criminal complaint. The complaint also identified Mr. Stager as saying in another video posted on Twitter that everyone in the Capitol is a treasonous traitor and that death is the only remedy for what's in that building.

Win Mcnamee/Getty Images Also on Thursday, an employee with Cleveland public schools was charged with entering and committing unlawful activities on the grounds of the Capitol. The woman, Christine Priola, was traced through an anonymous tip to the F.B.I. after she was recognized in photographs posted to Twitter, according to court documents. Photos from last Wednesday showed Ms. Priola inside the Capitol and holding a sign that read, The children cry out for justice, which law enforcement later recovered from her home.
Washington these days resembles nothing so much as an unruly sandbox. As the shutdown drags on, septuagenarian politicians are squabbling like 7-year-olds, House freshmen staged a boisterous protest march to the empty office of the Senate majority leader and the president's lawyer went spectacularly off the rails in a television interview. There did not seem to be an adult in sight.
JW: Are you concerned that you wouldn't be triggering a sort of a war of — a back and forth between Republicans and Democrats, who were continuing to add justices to the bench with each new administration to satisfy their own policy priorities?
I take sort of an opposite side because I think it's a little romantic on Hollywood executives' part because they make more money doing that, also. And it's also sort of a faint because most consumers really do like watching limited series. They like binging. They like their home things. Consumers seem to be saying a different thing. If anything this technology has taught us is they will get what they want when they want it and where they want it. Is that a problem for you, from a creative point of view?
The director Martin Scorsese and his crew turn their cameras on the outspoken New York humorist Fran Lebowitz, and then just let her riff at length about the past, present and future of human existence. Scorsese and Lebowitz collaborated previously on the feature-length documentary Public Speaking, about her life and career as a writer and raconteur. But the docu-series Pretend It's a City is much less formal. It's more of an extended hangout session, edited together from different interviews and public appearances, shot all around the city — New York — that these two love the most.
Every time I see my name up there, I can hardly breathe because of the responsibility that goes with it, King said. If I'm going to have my name on anything, I would welcome Margaret, I would welcome Pentecostals, I would welcome whoever. Whether I agree with them or not is not important; I would just be more welcoming. I just feel like she's gotten really derogatory.
Unlike four years ago, when many of the participants in the post-inaugural prayer service were conservative evangelicals or prosperity gospel preachers, this year's Thursday service included a broad array of religious progressives, including two transgender faith leaders. Rabbi Sharon Brous of IKAR, a Jewish community in Los Angeles, prayed for the coming of a new America, one built on love, rooted in justice and propelled by our moral imagination.
On Monday, however, the new Democratic leadership in the Capitol intends to pass identical bills to cap contributions from L.L.C.s at $5,000, bringing them in line with limits on donations from corporations.
Like his contemporaries Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, Mr. Rosenquist developed a powerful graphic style in the early 1960s that traditionalists reviled and a broad public enthusiastically embraced.
Yeah, I think if you put that in practice, and then you start doing a cost analysis on it, it could actually lower the budgets. And I'm not even saying now that the budgets shouldn't be looked at, and seeing if there's another way to do that. Because look, a lot of officers, we're social workers. We're marriage counselors. We're doctors sometimes. We're more than actually what we were trained to be. I mean, we try to train for everything that we can, but we just can't be. And then, but you then expect us to. Not you; I'm just saying as a society —
The phenomenon isn't unique to Mr. Morrill and Donut. People with dogs are often perceived to be more approachable, happier and more empathetic, research shows. The presence of a dog can also serve as an indication a man is nurturing and capable of caregiving, said Dr. Helen Fisher, a senior research fellow at the Kinsey Institute and a chief adviser to Match.com. And that, she said, is a powerful mating signal.

For some, the conversion experience rescued them from paths that Holloway refers to, in his own case, as serious darkness and sin. A onetime actor and a singer in an alternative-rock band, Holloway had dropped out of college and was living with fellow musicians when his parents persuaded him to attend a weekend conference devoted to the Virgin Mary. At the end, the keynote speaker invited all of those who believed they might have vocations to approach the stage. Holloway remembers: I had an interior experience almost as if Our Lady was standing behind me with her hands on my shoulders, leaning down to say, 'If you will put your vocation in my hands, I will take care of all the things you consider obstacles.' My heart was pounding. And I found myself climbing over this balcony and going down there.
The eighth item on the application's Articles of Employment, which requires applicants to sign their initials next to a list of beliefs, outlines Immanuel Christian's definition of marriage and stances on sexual identity.
Mr. Yang has frequently said that automation contributed heavily to Mr. Trump's win, because voters feel disaffected and worry that the futures of their jobs and industries are in jeopardy.
I often wrote about my experience as a mixed-race young adult for class, but would keep these essays hidden from all but the instructor and my grandmother. In one of my grandma's magazines, I discovered the book Black, White, Other — a seminal text for mixed-race scholars of my generation. It was my first purchase from Amazon, the company my uncle soon left the nest to work for. One cousin was bound for art school, another for music school, and I was bound for nowhere but knew I wanted to write.
This is what's so tough right now is that countries are trying to figure out what are the benefits of being an ally of the United States and doing what we want them to do, and then what are the costs. Unfortunately that calculation is going against us more and more. Turkey's relationship with the U.S. has been stronger than our relationship with many other countries in that region. I think we should invest in that relationship if we're going to be able to accomplish any of our goals there. And that includes, to me, being a little bit more accommodating about behaviors that we might find objectionable or troubling from them than we might from another country.
In 2017, Simon & Schuster canceled a book by the professional provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos after he gave an interview in which he appeared to condone pedophilia. His contract reportedly did not include a morality clause, and he sued, though he later dropped the suit. If a morality clause did lead to a book's cancellation, we probably wouldn't know it, according to Devereux Chatillon, a partner in the media and intellectual property law firm Chatillon Weiss who has represented both The New Yorker and writers. It wouldn't be public unless somebody sued over it, she said. And even then, the lawsuit probably wouldn't come to light.

The dance begins after Martin, who took jazz ballet lessons in his past, has attended the funeral of a friend and received text messages from his wife that hint at reuniting; he and his friends greet graduating students at the harbor as the song What a Life, by the Danish band Scarlet Pleasure, plays. At first, his movement is a little tentative, full of stops and starts. But once he gets going, he throws himself into it, taking wide crossover steps, swaying and, with a silky vigor, spinning to the ground and springing up — all the while taking sips from a can of beer.
Under the pen name Catherine Aydy, Ms. Tennant published The Color of Rain, a dark satire about the British upper classes, in 1963. Her publishers submitted it for the Prix Formentor, awarded yearly in Majorca, Spain. The chairman of the judging panel, the Italian novelist Alberto Moravia, denounced it as a prime specimen of the decadence of the British novel.
The Jews in the Novogrudok ghetto sent word to Bielski: they wanted him to mount an attack to release them from the ghetto. Bielski smuggled a message back: he reiterated his offer of shelter, but he didn't have the resources to help them escape. With no other option, the last survivors of the Novogrudok ghetto, including Rae, Lisa, Chanon and Naum Kushner, Sonya Oshman, and Jack Kagan, began to dig day and night. They smuggled implements from their work sites: pieces of wood, spoons. After long hours of labor under Nazi overseers, they stayed up all night, removing bags of dirt from the tunnel and passing them along a human chain to be stacked behind the walls to hide their activity. They worked like this for three months, at one point assigning the Jewish electrician to wire the tunnel with lights. The initial plan was to build a 150-meter tunnel to terminate in a cornfield, but the harvest came, and they had to more than double the length. Chanon Kushner, by now eighteen, was among the dozens of Jews who dug out the earth. As the tunnel neared completion, one of their number became frightened, saying the Nazis would surely catch and kill them all. The others worried he was going to inform on them to the Nazis, so they took him into the tunnel and choked him to death.
Zoe Chance, a professor in Yale University's school of management, has shown that even when people do well on a test because they were allowed to cheat, they still see themselves as responsible for their success. People in her experiment who were allowed to cheat on a test in which an answer key was accidentally made visible kept predicting they would do well on future tests that didn't contain an answer key. It took them doing poorly on two more tests before they finally realized they probably weren't going to do so great without the answer key they had on the first test.
And yet, I know this is indulgent. Aggression for aggression's sake goes against the practice of generations of black struggle that have made justice bigger than everybody's anger, black and white. Going off on a white person because she deserves it or because you can is not something Malcolm X, or Martin Luther King Jr., would have approved of — not because it's unwarranted but because it's undisciplined. It's a waste of resources. And then there's the fact that public displays of anger are still risky for black folk. They might land you in jail, or at the very least on the wrong side of authority, potentially heaping injustice on top of waste.

I saw the headlines about how people were making fun of him. I was like, Oh man, this is really — we really have to put an end to this administration.
Yet I think the intensity gap might also have to do with the way internal dangers allow for richer narrative tension than external ones: A marriage collapses from the inside, while the weather is external. It's a deeper gut-punch when the call is coming from inside the house. The same is true for climate change. We've made the call. We are the threat. But the antagonism feels faceless and less psychologically complex than the domestic torment of intimate betrayal, and the vexed hope of rebuilding.

NASHVILLE — Brothers Osborne broke an unspoken rule at a recent songwriters round — a show where groups of writers take turns singing their songs in their most unadorned forms, spotlighting the lyrics and melody. But when the duo performed its hit Stay a Little Longer, the singer T.J. Osborne reached the end of the final chorus and tilted his head toward his older brother John, who promptly went into a rhapsodic acoustic guitar solo.

Charlie Warzel: You were talking about data and that's a good segue into some of the — I mean, you're probably the candidate who sort of runs on understanding the internet better than anyone right now. And I'm curious first about this worldwide data organization. For someone like China, wouldn't it actually be better for them to sort of hoard that data and hoard that information and keep that closed system?
I think the number of aircraft carriers is either seven or nine. I confess to not knowing precisely. In terms of our investment, we're spending $650 billion plus on our military. Certainly more than any other country, but I think more than the next four countries combined, and we have to examine, at this stage, whether that $650 billion is making us safer and more secure.
Seen on the page, the words scattered amid expanses of white, it can seem more like modernist poetry than theater. It is, in other words, as easily made into a score as into anything.

I had that discussion last night. I have two teen sons, and I thought, I would turn him in.
For these reasons, it helps to have a guy at the top of a 501(c)(3) who both knows business and has the chutzpah to march up to an Oscar-winning actress at the dog run to ask if she'll come to a benefit. Which is exactly what Mr. Kratz did with Jennifer Connelly in Brooklyn in 2010, after which she became a fixture at his events.
Labor force participation — the share of Americans either employed or actively looking for work — declined precipitously from the late 1990s, dropping to 62.7 percent in 2014 (its lowest rate since the Carter administration). Critics of President Obama liked to argue that this was because of government handouts. But there's a counterargument to be found in demographic trends — the Congressional Budget Office estimates that a sizable portion of the decline in labor-force participation is a result of the aging of the work force.
Nor is this misperception limited to California. According to journalist J.J. Goldberg, [T]he percentage of Jews who tell pollsters that anti-Semitism is a `serious problem' in America nearly doubled during the course of the 1980s, from 45 percent in 1983 to almost 85 percent in 1990. Yet by every objective assessment, the problem was less serious in 1990 than it was in 1983, and the trend has clearly been in the direction of improvement.
Now, I watched the district attorney's news conference. And what he said was that at the time that Rashard Brooks was shot twice in the back by Officer Rolfe, he had twice shot the taser in such a way that it was essentially empty and unusable. And that this would be something that an officer like Officer Rolfe would know — having carried a taser, used a taser — that it contained two taser shots. So in that case, does that complicate the point that you're making here?
To this day, he said, his mother has no clue what her son does for a living. The idea of me putting a black man in a dress and having him prance around the world like that. … To her, that would be blasphemy.
Yeah, that I've heard, too. That apparently I am racist because I say I don't see color.
Then, two years ago, my husband took a job in Luxembourg, where the lingua franca is French. He's fluent in French, whereas on a good day, I speak it like a 5-year-old. Suddenly, the entire dynamic between us changed.
Conversion usually entailed a jolting loss of social status. George Tyrrell, a young Anglican from a poor but genteel Irish family, was intellectually convinced by Catholic arguments, but his biographer notes, he recoiled from `the dirt and tinsel, and flashy gew gaws' in the Catholic chapels, from the `essential commonness' of Romanism, and when he overcame his distaste and announced his conversion to his parents, what pained his mother was `that a son of mine should go to Mass with the cook.' Moreover, as David Newsome writes, the convert became, as it were, an exile in his own land.... In addition to the humiliation of social ostracism, the pain of severed friendships and the torment of past memories, there was the inescapable problem of beginning life again within an alien community, while recognizing that all one's past distinctions and achievements counted for nothing. It is difficult to find any example of an intellectual who derived either social or monetary gain from conversion. For many, on the contrary, the material and prestige losses were considerable. The many Anglican and Episcopalian priests who converted were especially hard hit. Being, in many cases, married, they were ineligible to join the Catholic priesthood and so faced an economically precarious future. One such married clergyman, T. W. Allies, reported extreme depression of spirits due to the utter destitution of my temporal fortunes.
Good point. I mean, and I can't disagree with that.
Is that different when you're on stage, versus in a TV series?
The plan gives billions of dollars in aid to renters struggling to keep up with mounting unpaid liabilities to landlords, and it would give grants to millions of the hardest-hit small businesses.
As she travels the stage in an introductory zigzag, greeting her friends and family with upper body gestures, her feet sing with youthful brilliance — small sideways jumps (pas de chat) and incisive pointwork. After the first 10 seconds, her energy changes to even higher spirits and bigger contrasts. In one repeated phrase (13 seconds to 24 seconds), her torso leans forward as she gives special emphasis to one small step (petit développé); then another step (a turning relevé grand développé) opens her body up more expansively; and there follows a bigger, quicker jump.
But in Hollywood in general, everything will have to be renegotiated, every single contract?
Last year was also a period of transition for Mr. Cuomo: For the first eight years in office, Mr. Cuomo worked with a Republican State Senate, which often backed his pleas for fiscal austerity and batted back progressive reforms. That changed in the 2018 midterm elections, when Democrats took control of the Senate with the help of a number of young, liberal candidates who repeatedly challenged Mr. Cuomo, sometimes leading to heated conflicts.
JW: And let me just, one last follow-up on that. If Democrats don't take back the Senate, how do you feel with the Supreme Court — how do you, I mean, put aside expanding the number of justices, how do you even get a justice onto the court in the first place?
She continues to reckon with the suicides of her father and brother. She describes her brief and terrible marriage, while still at Sarah Lawrence, to an abusive painter.

The concern was underscored this weekend with the release of census data that showed South Korea's population fell in 2020 for the first time on record. A declining number of newborns was exceeded by a growing number of deaths, according to census data released by the South Korean government.
Mr. Yang has scored internet points with some tweets paying tribute to former 2020 Democratic rivals, for example by tweeting I miss Beto.
If you run an organization, imagine having an organization that has the wrong measurements. How is that organization going to fare over time? That is where we are in the United States of America right now. We're riding a century-old measurement off a cliff, while our way of life deteriorates underneath our feet. If you looked at levels of anxiety, stress, mental health, depression, suicides, drug overdoses, you would see that we're in a mental health recession or depression, we're in a wellness or life expectancy recession or depression, and the corporate profits are going to keep on going up, because in the 21st-century economy, companies can do very, very well while not hiring a lot of people, not treating them as full-time employees, and they don't need to care what happens in their own backyard because they sell everywhere.
Mr. Yang has prided himself on injecting the race with new thinking through proposals like yearlong daylight saving time. Daylight saving time was instituted during World War I for energy-efficiency purposes. Mr. Yang argues that extending it year-round would decrease traffic accidents, increase economic activity and lower crime.
Well, it sounds like you've been there.
A homicide come dressed to the ball as a suicide: This you expect from a braindead jackboy in the Seventy-Seven. But from Trader Faulkner, Associate Professor of Philosophy of Science at CSU? Please. The smart murder just never happens. That's all bullshit. That's all so...pathetic. The Professor did it. Oh, sure. Murder is dumb and then even dumber. Only two things will make you any good at it: Luck and practice. If you're dealing with the reasonably young and healthy, and if the means is violent, then the homicide/suicide gray area is TV, is bullshit, is ketchup. Make no mistake, we would see it if it was there--because we want suicides to be homicides. We would infinitely prefer it. A made homicide means overtime, a clearance stat, and high fives in the squadroom. And a suicide is no damn use to anyone.
We do our sons no favors when we tell them that they don't have to answer that voice inside them that tells them to be strong, to be brave, and to lead. We do them no favors when we let them abandon the quest to become a grown man when that quest gets hard. Yes, we do them no favors when we're not sensitive to those boys who don't conform to traditional masculinity, but when it comes to the crisis besetting our young men, traditional masculinity isn't the problem; it can be part of the cure.
No, I give a numerical value to — Number one is the story. I give it from one to five on the value of just the story. Did it move me? Was it important? Did it resonate? Did it stay with me? From there, I go to the written word, which I separate from the story. Because you can have a great story, and you read it, and it's like, oh, I don't think the writer really got it. So I have to give that a separate rating. And the third thing is the character because I truly believe that it's the story and the power of the written word first that inspires a character. And I say this with all great respect to Meryl. I say, if you gave Meryl Streep C-level material, she could get it to a B. Her ability is unbelievable.
archived recording — if foreigners, if Russia, if China, if someone else offers you information on an opponent, should they accept it, or should they call the F.B.I.? archived recording (donald trump) I think maybe you do both. I think you might want to listen. I don't, there's nothing wrong with listening. If somebody called from a country, Norway, we have information on your opponent. Oh, I think I'd want to hear it. archived recording Do you want that kind of interference in our elections? archived recording (donald trump) It's not an interference. They have information. I think I'd take it.
I mean, the reason I'm asking these questions is because some police unions around the country have resisted efforts to make public complaints against police officers, and they have fiercely resisted eliminating, firing police officers who are accused of a pattern of misconduct. Do you feel like unions are invested in the status quo in ways that mean that it is going to be hard, is hard, will always be hard to change policing in this country?
Either you're a crunchy person or you're not. — Marion Cunningham, The Breakfast Book
Ms. Green said she preferred to assign primary sources that encourage students to explore history on their own. But she said she would welcome textbooks that contain more historical documents and a greater diversity of voices and themes from the past.
Thanks to the guards' ad hoc structure, the relationship between the Revolutionary Guards and Iraqi and Lebanese Shiite armed groups is a long and deep one. During my time in Lebanon and Iran, I met foreign militants who spent long stretches in Iran, for both work and pleasure. They spoke fluent Persian and fully understood the Revolutionary Guards ethos. The ties that bind many of these groups together include generations of marriage, commerce, history and culture. General Suleimani, as important as he was, was not singular.
Mr. Yang has argued that more legislative oversight on reproductive issues should come from physicians rather than politicians. He tweeted: I personally don't think male legislators should be weighing in on women's reproductive rights and freedoms.
They have actually gone ahead and started this new life.
As it happens, the following evening Marianne Crebassa, a lively 33-year-old French mezzo, made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera, just across the street from Tully, as Cherubino in Mozart's Le Nozze di Figaro.
This, to me, is an emblem of what's gone wrong in American life. Where the market is all knowing and all powerful, and if the market decides that local journalism has zero value, then it has zero value. And that is not the way forward for us. We need to make our own independent determination of our own value as people, of the value of local journalism, of the value of arts, of the value of volunteering, of caregiving, of — like all the most important things in American life. And so you, in many ways, you're like the guardians of this incredible journalistic tradition, and it's like a unique privilege because the people who've pursued the same vocation in other parts of the country are just seeing it disappear.
Mr. Yang confirmed this summer that he would like his running mate to be a woman.
To help make his point, the evidence was laid out on tables: a big bag of cash, bundles of drugs, high-powered firearms, all confiscated by law enforcement agents working the borderlands in South Texas.
A look at the archive of reviews, and a sampling of his prolific body of work, reveals that his reputation as a major artist — as something more than a comedian or an observer of the social mores of New Yorkers, a prisoner of his own mannerism and preoccupations — rests on the movies he made in the mid-1980s and early 1990s, the years of his involvement with Mia Farrow.
You've got to be able to pick yourself up, brush yourself off and do it all over again, he said in a 2007 interview with the American Comedy Archives. Persistence alone is omnipotent; you have to keep hanging in there.
A few days later, Jodi has completed her quest and fulfilled her decades-old promise to Paula. Except the abused boy, Ricky, is now a troubled and troubling adult, rescued but not always grateful to his savior. Along the way Jodi has also found a new locus of desire, Miranda — a beautiful, impulsive young woman with an addictive personality and three young children from her broken marriage to a faded country music star. Jodi and Miranda's complex relationship, with its tough and delicate moments of attraction and then romance, shapes one of the book's strongest movements.
After doing a halftime show at Grand Canyon University in Phoenix on March 7, Borstelmann packed up his Chrysler minivan and made the four-day cross-country drive to Greensboro, N.C., where he was scheduled to perform during the Atlantic Coast Conference men's basketball tournament. About 15 minutes after he checked into his hotel on March 11, he got the news that conference officials were canceling the tournament. Borstelmann sat on his bed watching ESPN's SportsCenter and tried to digest what it all meant.
As youngsters, the Wurtele twins took up many sports, including swimming and tennis, before concentrating on skiing. In 2015, they were jointly inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in Calgary, Alberta.

All the members of the California panel were educators selected by the State Board of Education, whose members were appointed by former Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat. The Texas panel, appointed by the Republican-dominated State Board of Education, was made up of educators, parents, business representatives and a Christian pastor and politician.
In this second-echelon American city, mildly famed for its Jap-financed Babel Tower, its harbors and marinas, its university, its futuristically enlightened corporations (computer software, aerospace, pharmaceuticals), its high unemployment, and its catastrophic inner-city taxpayer flight, a homicide police works maybe a dozen murders per year. Sometimes you're a primary investigator on the case, sometimes a secondary. I worked one hundred murders. My clearance rate was just above average. I could read a crime scene, and, more than once, I was described as an exceptional interrogator. My paperwork was outstanding. When I came to CID from the Southern everybody expected my reports to be district quality. But they were downtown quality, right from the start. And I sought to improve still further and gave it a hundred percent. One time I did a very, very competent job, collating two rival accounts of a hot-potato homicide in the Seventy-Three: One witness/suspect versus another witness/suspect. Compared to what you guys give me to read, pronounced Detective Sergeant Henrik Overmars, brandishing my report at the whole squad, this is fucking oratory. It's goddamn Cicero versus Robespierre. I did the work as best I could until I entered my own end-zone and couldn't do it anymore. In my time, I have come in on the aftermath of maybe a thousand suspicious deaths, most of which turned out to be suicides or accidentals or plain unattendeds. So I've seen them all: Jumpers, stumpers, dumpers, dunkers, bleeders, floaters, poppers, bursters. I have seen the bodies of bludgeoned one-year-olds.
Some in the media have focused on the possibility that there would be fallout for Amazon from the Bezos divorce, suggesting that Ms. Bezos might seek to control and change the company. I knew them both in the early days of Amazon's history, a history in which Ms. Bezos was quite present and important. While things can change, I would be utterly surprised by either of them indulging in any acrimony that would hurt the company. But we use this as an excuse to stare at their private lives anyway.
A pair of mesmerizing and eccentric story collections would make excellent additions to your reading list. Carmen Maria Machado's inventive, sexually exuberant debut, Her Body and Other Parties — which includes a novella-length section outlining 272 speculative, alternative views of Law & Order: SVU episodes — reveals characters with crystalline consciousnesses clouded by their fabulist circumstances. In Kōno Taeko's Toddler-Hunting and Other Stories (published in Japan throughout the 1960s and translated by Lucy North and Lucy Lower), it is the women themselves — alienated, but composed — who push past boundaries to enact lucid waking nightmares.
Charlie Warzel: You were talking about data and that's a good segue into some of the — I mean, you're probably the candidate who sort of runs on understanding the internet better than anyone right now. And I'm curious first about this worldwide data organization. For someone like China, wouldn't it actually be better for them to sort of hoard that data and hoard that information and keep that closed system?
So if you had, for example, a rule that said, Look, the government is allowed to match whatever salary a private sector employee is being offered, then you'd have more success. If you said, Look, you don't need to move to Washington, D.C., and sit in the thing that was built decades ago, that's like solace, and you have this giant parking lot and you just feel miserable being there for like a day, let alone a career.
Most important, Marcel and his mother both loved to laugh--gently, satirically--at the people around them, and in her letters to him she sends up the other guests at a spa or hotel with the same spirit of wickedly close observation and good-natured if prickly fun that was to inspire so many of his best pages.
For the next six hours, he was questioned about his hometown — where the schools and factories were, details about his family, including dates of birth. Finally, he was released.
The battle for best picture, on the other hand, is just getting started.
BA: But just to be clear, it's still not a progressive tax. There's no model that says that you can use these kinds of exclusions and exemptions to make that progressive. You can make it less regressive. You're still fundamentally proposing a nonprogressive means of revenue raising.

After a 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck Turkey in August 1999, resulting in an estimated 17,000 deaths, those in Romania who knew Mr. Constantin wondered if he had been among the dead.
La Wilson, an enigmatic assemblage artist who took ordinary objects — from dice, plastic forks and alphabet blocks to bullet casings, fake guns and jewelry — and arranged them in boxes, giving them enthralling new life, died on March 30 in Hudson, Ohio, a suburb of Akron. She was 93.
So if that's your problem, you have to go and try and solve it directly by getting into the guts of the apps and say, What are the design choices you made? Let's calibrate them so they actually balance our kids' health and not just your financial returns. So that's one way she's missing the point.
Wow, these questions are really fun. Who's broken my heart?
Gross domestic product is a measure of a country's entire economic output. Its inventor worried that it might be mistaken as a measure of citizens' well-being. Mr. Yang's campaign has proposed that America measure its economic prosperity with a different index that accounts for human and not just monetary factors, including inequality and quality of life.

By her early 20s, Ditlevsen has married her first editor, a stout, impotent man three decades her senior who prints her work in his small literary journal, a spin on the stable skilled worker her mother imagined as her destiny. (Ditlevsen publishes her first book of poetry, Girl Soul, in 1939, her truth-telling landing her a devoted readership.) But nothing in her memoirs' first two volumes quite prepares you for what's to come. Her third marriage, to a sociopathic doctor who injects her regularly with Demerol — the name sounds like birdsong — nearly kills her. It does kill, for years, her urge to write, the protective membrane of words that has accompanied her since childhood dissolving into chemical oblivion. So unsparingly abject is her rendering of addiction — I frequently found myself having to pause, finger in book, and take a breath — that an episode involving Evelyn Waugh, whom she charms at a literary party before being dragged off humiliatingly by her lunatic husband, has an almost leavening effect.
Though the powerful pulls of land and home and sense of place persist, one of the primary questions Sugar Run asks is what these concepts even mean now in this country. Maren is masterly at describing America's modern wastelands, the blasted towns not yet and maybe never-to-be the beneficiaries of rehabilitation and reoccupation. The book's landscape is dotted with roadside casino trailers, abandoned mining operations, country brothels set up like prisons with chain-link fences and armed guards to control both the customers and the immigrant prostitutes. Jodi's own brother uses her in an opioid transaction and then threatens her by suggesting that locals might consider Miranda's children better off with a more Christian family. How do you possibly find or make a home under such conditions?
But the prosecutor countered that Mr. Zhao had confessed the killing to the police, including that he had used a power saw to cut up the body. As the judge read aloud the decision, Mr. Zhao, who was wearing a navy blue suit, stared forward calmly, listening intently to his interpreter.

He longed to produce some work for the glory of God but was condemned to the most anxious thoughts as to what I shall eat and what I shall drink, wherewithal I shall be clothed, I and mine, and to the drudgery of teaching dunces. Such cases strongly suggest that the motive for conversion was genuine religious conviction. There are few plausible ulterior motives to explain it, though it may be true that certain character types were more receptive to the demands of Catholic life than others.
Rock's extended version remains tougher-minded but moves closer to this posture. He removes the extreme close-up, which, along with its role in drawing attention to the material, is something of a signature Burnham shot. He used it at the start of his direction of Jerrod Carmichael's game-changing special 8 — whose filmic aesthetic inspired Rock to hire him. In place of that touch, Rock adds a new shot, a mouse-eye view of the star from the front of the stage partly obscured by what appears to be a member of the audience. This new angle looks up at a performer, in awe.
By this time last year, Oscar's top race had become a head-to-head matchup between Green Book and Roma, but 2020 has brought us the most wide-open best-picture contest in ages: As many as five nominees (out of a field of nine announced Monday) all have a very real path to victory. Below, your Carpetbagger surveys Oscar's most crowded field, but be forewarned: This contest is going to go down to the wire.

In government, that's radical. A quick caveat here: Helping governmental agencies treat their constituents like customers they hope to retain should in no way be translated as advocacy for the privatization of those functions (as seems to be the desire of the current administration). Rather, government can benefit from public-private partnerships that bring some private best practices into public sector work. Brooks said: Trust is our share price. We don't have market pressure, but we do have to deliver on our promise to care for veterans. We're trying to measure how we're doing with our customers just as the private sector has been doing, so we can quickly make improvements where people are getting stuck.

A few months after my release, my uncle was severely injured in a suspected terrorist attack in Sinai, where he was stationed. My mother implored me to offer sympathy. I refused to call. I almost felt a sense of justice.
Ms. Yao, the daughter from Mr. Ren's second marriage, unquestionably grew up in privilege, perhaps more than her older half siblings. She traveled widely, living in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Britain, according to her own biographical descriptions. Her globe-trotting was such that she recently had to fend off the Chinese news media's questions about her nationality, saying she was born in Kunming, a city in southern China, and carries a Chinese passport.
She was soon arrested again, on grand larceny charges. It was revealed that she had told numerous associates that their investments — in oil and mineral deals — had been guaranteed by the banker David Rockefeller, to whom she claimed to be secretly married. That lie was bolstered by at least one fake marriage license and by a framed silver photo of him at her bedside. It was later reported that the photo had been clipped from a magazine.
Wow. I want to ask you, as a union head, about what appears to be a growing consensus. That in this discussion and this debate about changing policing, that unions have been a barrier — that they have created systems. And I know you may disagree with this, but let me just get through it. The perception is that unions have created systems that protect police officers — at times, even the most problematic officers — by making it challenging to see complaints against those officers and by erecting significant barriers to firing them. Do you think that that's fair?
Justice Bader Ginsburg has had a series of health scares in recent years, including surgery for lung cancer and radiation treatment. She also had surgery for early-stage pancreatic cancer in 2009.
Andrew Yang's message is remarkably similar to Elizabeth Warren's and Bernie Sanders's — the American economy is not working for enough Americans, and it's going to require structural change to do better. Where Mr. Yang differs — beyond his almost complete lack of government or political experience — is in his prescriptions, including his signature Freedom Dividend.
Thank you, good to be here.
Yet Becca Blackwell's tentative performance as Diane has no magnetism. Subdued to the point of flatness, it drains the life out of Ms. George's humor — a particular shame for the beautifully written monologues. Instead of an enigmatic god, the Diane before us is closer to a nonentity, and the sexual energy among her and the women, vital to moments of attraction and abandon, is nowhere to be found. It's not credible that this outsider would succeed at not only insinuating herself into the group but also commanding it.
So, that to me was the biggest missed opportunity in the Obama administration, and it happened very, very early on. I wish that they owned and reflected a little bit on the fact that maybe they could have done some things differently at that stage, because we're still angry. This country is still angry. I was so shocked by what happened in the financial crisis, I quit my job and started a national nonprofit and ran it for seven years. I had — my wife was pregnant. I mean, what happened to this country then is still tearing us apart.
But at the same time, in order to have someone at that level of relationship, you need to have as much trust as possible and I'm still developing that kind of relationship with some of the other, not just candidates, but also people who could be running mates that are not currently running.

When they'd all gone, Bashista unvested, returning the white alb and patterned green dalmatic to their hangers in the vestry. Clearly, the Mass and the meeting with parishioners afterward elated him. I'm in the honeymoon phase, he said. But what you're seeing is the future -- I wouldn't be here if I didn't believe that. Others in the church anticipate more conflict. The Rev. Richard McBrien, a professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame, told me that the shortage of American priests would deepen the division between clergy and laity. What happens now is that people shop, he said. They go where they can get the best Mass, the best music, the best sermons. But when the day comes that there aren't enough good priests left, I think the people are absolutely going to demand from the government of the church that they have married priests. Progressive Catholic organizations hope that the successor to John Paul II will be less authoritarian and more collegial -- the true spirit of Vatican II, they believe. There is talk of the resentment many bishops are said to feel toward John Paul II, who has centralized authority at their expense. (He treats bishops like altar boys is a phrase I heard more than once from liberal priests and nuns.)
So, that to me was the biggest missed opportunity in the Obama administration, and it happened very, very early on.

From a more academic vantage point, Steven Pinker, a professor of psychology at Harvard, replied to my inquiry with a detailed critique of the A.P.A. guidelines.
But for them the challenge is not even what's happening internally. The challenge is whether or not they can get developing countries on board with their technology standards to be able to roll them out internationally. So if you're a third party, let's say you're a developing country in Africa or Latin America, then you have a choice essentially between the global standard and the Chinese standard. And if you're the Chinese, you do not want a standard that only you are using over time, because that's going to curb your economic upside to all of the software that you're building. One of the reasons why our tech companies are so successful is that they export it to virtually the entire rest of the world, and China does not want to be in the opposite position.

This is what's so tough right now is that countries are trying to figure out what are the benefits of being an ally of the United States and doing what we want them to do, and then what are the costs. Unfortunately that calculation is going against us more and more. Turkey's relationship with the U.S. has been stronger than our relationship with many other countries in that region. I think we should invest in that relationship if we're going to be able to accomplish any of our goals there. And that includes, to me, being a little bit more accommodating about behaviors that we might find objectionable or troubling from them than we might from another country.
In an interview on Dec. 4, it was clear that Mr. Yang has done his homework, traveling across the country and listening closely. He really seemed to have an almost emotional sense of what people have been going through and what the problems are, a board member [Related: What Is an Editorial Board?] said afterward. His portrait of the fundamental economic problems were more moving than Bernie's, and Bernie has been selling this for 30 years.
Donald Trump does not speak for every non-politician or nonmilitary officer. But there is a deep need, and you've seen this, because you spent time in D.C., the D.C. establishment will not generate big solutions.
The Texas book also states that American action on global warming may not make a difference if China, India, Russia and Brazil do not also act.

When Rock confessed his mistakes, Burnham moved into a rare close-up. And he stayed on the star's face, with no cutaway shots, as Rock talked about cheating on his wife. When the crowd chuckled, Rock looked grave, emphasizing that he wasn't proud. He said he knew what people were thinking: What is wrong with men?
The last decade of the twentieth century has witnessed the end of state-sponsored and church-supported anti-Semitism. The fall of the Soviet Union, a nation that, since the time of Stalin, had been a major source of international anti-Semitism, had a domino effect on ending the state sponsorship of this oldest of bigotries. Other nations within the Soviet sphere of influence stopped espousing anti-Semitism as a matter of government policy. Even most Arab and Islamic countries dropped their overtly anti-Semitic policies. As a result, the United Nations has changed its tone, condemning anti-Semitism and reducing somewhat its pro-Arab and anti-Israel bias. Equally important, the Catholic church--the single institution most responsible for the persecution of Jews over the past two millennia--approved diplomatic relations with Israel, thus annulling its entrenched view that Jewish homelessness ... was the Divine judgment against Jews for rejecting Jesus. The American Lutheran Church explicitly rejected Martin Luther's anti-Semitic teachings.
If you were a person in that town in Missouri and you wanted to start a bakery, before the dividend, it's a dumb idea. Post-dividend, it might be a great idea. You can hire someone to help staff the bakery, you know if the bakery fails, you're going to survive because you have this income that you can rely upon. This is the most stable and secure way to create jobs that actually reflect our community's needs and values. What are the other alternatives?

Ruth Ann Koesun, a principal dancer in American Ballet Theater who epitomized the company's early eclectic profile by excelling in roles that ranged from Billy the Kid's Mexican sweetheart to the Bluebird pas de deux from The Sleeping Beauty, died on Feb. 1 in Chicago. She was 89.
Yeah. And I think in some ways, there's some positive lessons to be drawn from that time, because there were some significant accomplishments during that era.
According to a 2018 defense motion, the woman who told the authorities that Mr. Weinstein had raped her in March 2013, who has not been identified, sent him an email on April 11, 2013 saying: I hope to see you sooner rather than later.

Christine McGuire, the eldest of the singing McGuire Sisters, who struck gold on the pop charts in the 1950s with Sincerely, Sugartime and other close-harmony hits that won young American hearts not quite ready for rock ′n' roll, died on Dec. 28 at her home in Las Vegas. She was 92.
Unlike universal basic income, a system that would provide some cash to every person regardless of income level, a negative income tax system would give cash to people below a certain income threshold. Milton Friedman made the case for the tax as a poverty alleviation tool in his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom.
Over time, others, including Mr. Dylan and Ms. Baez, have given the group more credit for popularizing folk music and for serving as a bridge to the more adventurous folk, folk-rock and rock of the 1960s.
To your earlier concern, I think we should examine the filibuster. I think that gridlock is bad for anyone trying to get anything done and solve problems. This might be controversial in this room, but I am for the restoration of earmarks, because it helped make legislation possible. That if I was a congressperson in a district, and there was a bill being passed, it's, Hey, at least I can get some pork for my local museum. And that's a very small price to pay for a functional legislature. So, getting past the filibuster to me is one possible necessity, and the restoration of earmarks could be another.
Yeah, it's a little fucked up. But it's the way we're going to do this.
That's the way you want to ask the question?
The American cities with the highest number of high-net-worth individuals are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington. California has the most number of people on the Forbes list of wealthiest Americans.
A musical? You're going Hugh Jackman on us here? What do you want to do? What musical would you like to do?
That too. I mean, it's rough. But I mean, New York's going through — I just want to bring some things to you from experience. Like yeah, the infrastructure breaking down. I mean, we're coasting on the investments made decades ago and they're starting to fall apart. But also what you all do in terms of journalism — I've been campaigning around the country and over 1,200 local papers have gone out of business because the local establishments that used to advertise are gone. All of their classified revenue went off to Craigslist and democracy works much less if you don't have local journalism.
Less auspicious was Mr. van Zweden's conducting on Wednesday night at David Geffen Hall. The concert, a program pairing the New York premiere of a short, recent work by John Luther Adams with a concert performance of Act I from Wagner's Die Walküre, was an opportunity to find out more about what he might bring to the Philharmonic, and to New York audiences. If anything, Mr. van Zweden can be too feisty and forceful in his performances of the standard repertory. So I was surprised that his account of this 70-minute Wagner act often lacked tension and urgency.
NASHVILLE — In 1986, Paul Simon released his seventh solo album, Graceland. One year later, my fiancé Haywood and I moved to Nashville. Haywood was driving my father's secondhand panel van with the fake wood-grain wraparound made of shelf liner that masked the previous owner's business logo. Attached to the van was a trailer too heavy for the hitch. I was driving the Exploding Pinto, the nickname derived from that car's fuel-tank fires, and on top of the Pinto were several hundred pounds of books in a homemade roof rack built of two-by-fours.
Mr. Newsom's agenda is likely to be costly, and thus likely to face obstacles as the new governor prepares to offer a new budget. Mr. Brown, among others, has warned that California is heading into a recession, and there are concerns in the business community and among some moderate Democrats that the former San Francisco mayor might take a decidedly different approach to spending than Mr. Brown.
He hosted a rally at his church to protest the killing of Trayvon Martin. Last year, he wrote a letter to the mayor of St. Louis suggesting that if police practices were not reformed, his denomination could take its annual convention — and the millions of dollars that come with it — elsewhere. And at a gathering of black congressional leaders, his raspy voice grew louder as he declared that black people needed to take charge of our destiny.
It would be easy to chalk up these difficulties to postpartum depression if it weren't for the periodic reminders of Blythe's traumatic family history, woven through the book in stand-alone chapters. Blythe's mother hit her and often disappeared for a night or two at a time. Blythe's grandmother routinely locked Blythe's mother out of the house after school and once held her head underwater in the bathtub, nearly drowning her.
It wasn't until 2013, after not hearing from her husband for 14 years, that Mr. Constantin's wife asked a court to declare him dead. With family and friends testifying that they had not heard from him since 1999, and the Turkish Interior Ministry saying they had no record of him for that period, the Romanian court concluded that he was most likely dead.
The idea that moral hypocrisy hurts you among evangelical voters is not true, if you're sound on all of the fundamentals, said Wayne Flynt, an ordained Baptist minister and one of Alabama's pre-eminent historians. Being sound on the fundamentals depends on what the evangelical community has decided the fundamentals have become. At this time, what is fundamental is hating liberals, hating Obama, hating abortion and hating same-sex marriage.
While they had been preceded a decade earlier by pioneers like Marlene Sanders, Ms. Chase and her contemporaries were members of a freshman class still more concerned with getting into broadcast news on the ground floor than worried about being passed over for promotion later on because of a glass ceiling.
Alas, I didn't encounter the likes of Roald Dahl. The locals were still obsessed with the Great Train Robbery. Like Plimmer and countless other youthful reporters, we were assigned the birth, marriage and death columns before we could rise to features. All a necessary grounding before Fleet Street.
Through Venture for America, Mr. Yang created opportunities for college graduates in under-resourced American cities — but almost half of V.F.A. alumni left the cities they were placed in through the fellowship.
This endeavor took human-centered design as its starting point, and Schleuning's use of smushy is appropriate. Human-centered design means designing for people by first understanding what they actually need. In the case of the V.A., not having the input of staff members and the veterans themselves would have made this project untenable.
Washington these days resembles nothing so much as an unruly sandbox. As the shutdown drags on, septuagenarian politicians are squabbling like 7-year-olds, House freshmen staged a boisterous protest march to the empty office of the Senate majority leader and the president's lawyer went spectacularly off the rails in a television interview.

Though many of the darker scenarios in Brown's novel don't elicit the heavy emotions they're meant to, and the 1950s references can feel gratuitous more than textured (housewives cooking while listening to Hound Dog; doctors casually prescribing Thalidomide and recommending cigarettes to pregnant women), it's easy to keep turning the pages as we toggle back and forth between Alice and Nellie, who — breaking news — has a far more complicated life than a stack of Ladies' Home Journals would lead Alice to believe.
In this respect, as in so many others, Marcel was the opposite of his hearty, healthy brother, Robert, born two years later, on May 24, 1873, in more prosperous and settled times. The two brothers were perfect companions as children and remained very close all their lives, although it was the robust younger brother, Robert, who often played the role of protector to the asthmatic Marcel. Like his father, Robert became a doctor--and a womanizer--yet the two brothers never quarreled, and lived their whole lives in the most complete harmony. In the 1890s both brothers were Dreyfusards. At the end of his life Marcel asked Robert to intervene and secure for him the Legion of Honor and, once this honor was obtained, to confer it on him. Robert was at Marcel's bedside when he died, and after his death it was Robert who oversaw the publication of the last two volumes of his masterpiece as well as his selected correspondence.
The zero tolerance on issues of race also played out in the almost immediate demands by nearly all the Democratic presidential candidates that Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia resign over a racist yearbook photo. (Mr. Northam began with an apology but pivoted to a new defense when he triggered a crush of calls for him to resign.)
Mr. Yang, a former technology executive and entrepreneur, has distinguished himself from Senator Sanders and the far left of the Democratic Party in making the case for a more humane capitalist system, what he calls human-centered capitalism.
Male children are falling behind in school not because schools indulge their risk-taking and adventurousness but often because they relentlessly suppress boys and sometimes punish boys' essential nature, from the opening bell to the close of the day.
Abigail Bengson, who narrates much of the quasi-autobiographical electro-folk singspiel, is painting the scene of her childhood in a hippy tolerant extended family. Her mother and father and aunt all teach at the super-crunchy Blue Mountain School in a part of Vermont that happens to be in Maine; their five children, from teenagers to young adults, make a seemingly undifferentiated puppy pile, frolicking happily.
Here, it's as if the costume designer Sarah J. Holden has placed lead weights in Mr. Ruffalo's epaulets and helium lifts in Mr. Shalhoub's shoes. Mr. Ruffalo's body looks slumped and stunted, his speech a mumble. Mr. Shalhoub meanwhile keeps straining upward. His arms and hands reach high, his voice rises until it cracks.

In the 1980s, some enterprising drug traffickers figured out how to convert the high-end luxury narcotic cocaine into a form that was cheaper, more potent, and easier to mass produce. Almost overnight, crack began devastating Black communities across America, raising alarm in the media and giving a few Reagan-era politicians new ways to terrify their constituents. In Stanley Nelson's fascinating documentary Crack: Cocaine, Corruption & Conspiracy, the filmmaker reflects on the origins of the epidemic, considering the many ways powerful people used it to exploit the vulnerable.
Gary Gensler has been tapped to head the S.E.C. under Biden. Gary Gensler in 2018 at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, where he teaches financial technology. Credit... Kayana Szymczak for The New York Times The Biden administration is tapping two financial regulators from the Obama administration to oversee key departments that had loosened their grip of the industry under President Trump, according to two people with knowledge of the plans. Gary Gensler, who led the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the Obama administration from 2009 to 2014, will be President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s nominee to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, these people said. Also, Rohit Chopra, the former assistant director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has been chosen to run that agency. Mr. Gensler is a veteran regulator who played a central role in bringing the big banks to heel in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, giving new teeth to a watchdog agency. Lately, as an academic, he has been schooling himself on digital currencies like Bitcoin that have become an important part of the S.E.C. 's regulatory mandate. Mr. Gensler, 63, will step into an agency that has faced criticism as being too lenient in pursuing high-profile cases involving Wall Street and corporate America. The agency that Mr. Chopra will take over has been defanged under Mr. Trump.
Over and over during the semester, I heard you, too? as students discovered points of connection that bridged their distinct cultural experiences. We all found common cause with Sor Juana, a 17th-century nun from what is now Mexico, who avoided marriage and motherhood by taking religious vows, thus freeing her to write and study. A student from Pakistan remarked wryly that Sor Juana had the right idea because once she became a nun, people probably stopped introducing her to eligible bachelors.
But others said it had become clear that for conservative Christians, the cultural and political issues that define modern conservative politics mattered at least as much as moral piety. That was why, they suggested, Mr. Bentley was able to cling to his job for nearly 13 months after his reputation as a paragon of probity came under fire.

The more you learn about Pete, the more you understand Jess's interest in extracurricular activity. He's another example of the character that TV and films find inexplicably fascinating: the man-boy, in this case one who appears to have never had a job. He went straight from his mama's knee into an early marriage with Jess, who has been supporting him while he tries to break into stand-up comedy.
I believe that Jewish life can thrive in the next century, not despite the end of institutional anti-Semitism, the end of Jewish persecution, and the end of Jewish victimization, but because of these positive developments. The ultimate good news may be that the denouement of negative Judaism--Jewish identification based largely on circling the wagons to fend off our enemies--compels us to refocus on a more positive and enduring Jewish identification, which will be more suitable to our current situation and the one we will likely be facing in the twenty-first century, when Jews will have the unconstrained choice whether to remain Jewish or to assimilate. We may be entering a true Jewish golden age, during which we will prove, once and for all, that Jews do not need enemies to survive. To the contrary: We can thrive best in an open society where we freely choose to be Jews because of the positive virtues of our 3,500-year-old civilization.
In October, less than two months before he died, a frail Mr. Agee, who suffered from scleroderma, a degenerative disease of the immune system, reconnected with his first family. Legal documents show that he gave Suzanne Agee power of attorney (along with his 32-year-old daughter with Ms. Cunningham Agee, Mary Alana Kurz), filed for divorce and rewrote his will to divide his assets among Ms. Cunningham Agee and his five children. (Previously, the will had left everything to Ms. Cunningham Agee.)

Because of an editing error, a picture caption with an article on Sunday about a new rule that will allow federal agencies to disregard climate change when assessing the environmental impact of infrastructure projects misidentified a pipeline in Walsh County, N.D.

The pandemic has reshaped a heated market for sperm donations. Yael Helin, a biological analyst at the Seattle Sperm Bank, returning sperm samples to deep storage after preparing some for shipment. Credit... Grant Hindsley for The New York Times Sperm banks are running low on supplies because of an overwhelming demand for pandemic babies, so women are trying something unconventional: joining unregulated Facebook groups to find donors. People are fed up with sperm banks, said Kyle Gordy, 29, who lives in Malibu, Calif. He invests in real estate but spends most of his time donating his sperm, free (except for the cost of travel), to women. He also runs a nearly 11,000-member private Facebook group, Sperm Donation USA, which helps women connect with a roster of hundreds of approved donors. His donor sperm has sired 35 children, with five more on the way, he said. There have always been infertile straight couples in need of donor sperm, but with the legalization of gay marriage and the rise of elective single motherhood, the market has expanded over the last decade. About 20 percent of sperm bank clients are heterosexual couples, 60 percent are gay women, and 20 percent are single moms by choice, the banks said. To meet this demand, men provided sperm at a steady rate for years, some banks said. But the coronavirus changed things. Existing donors were scared to go in. New donor sign-ups stopped for months during lockdown and never really bounced back at some banks.
A major development since the end of the Great Compression of the 30 years or so after World War II, when there was less inequality and relatively greater job security, at least for white male workers, is that the differential rate of return on education and training is now much higher.
Erika Jayne as Roxie Hart in 'Chicago.' The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star knows a thing or two (or eight) about drama.

In the Danish director Thomas Vinterberg's Another Round, a film about breaking the rules and, in doing so, breaking free, Martin is one of four high school teachers who decide to test a theory about alcohol: As long as they maintain a consistent level of it in their blood, their lives will improve.
Back then, the Osbornes naïvely assumed that copying country's familiar templates might get them somewhere. Later, they concluded it was far more important, and satisfying, to commit to a musical identity they could inhabit convincingly. The one they chose — a groove-driven, occasionally jammy singing-and-shredding duo — has made for a rather exotic presence in contemporary country over the last half-decade. Guitar heroes have receded from the spotlight, and even in Nashville, once nicknamed Guitar Town, studio production is frequently powered by drum machines, programming and synthesizers these days.
Still, more than any group of its time, the Kingston Trio captured the youthful optimism of the Kennedy years. The title song of a 1962 album was The New Frontier, echoing President John F. Kennedy's own phrase and alluding to his inaugural address with the lyrics Let the word go forth from this day on/A new generation has been born.
A coronavirus infection at an air traffic control center near Washington causes delays. The Washington Air Traffic Control Center in Leesburg, Va., in 2001. Credit... Paul Hosefros/The New York Times Delays were reported at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport after an air traffic control center that serves the area reported a coronavirus infection and closed for cleaning on Sunday, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center, located in Leesburg, Va., was closed from 11:45 a.m. to 1:45 p.m. for cleaning. It is one of 20 such centers in the United States, which generally provide service to aircraft while they are en route, as opposed to airport control towers, which handle takeoffs and landings. While the center was closed, the controllers worked from an alternate location, the F.A.A. said, and airplanes were routed around the airspace or handled by underlying facilities. Reagan airport attributed delays of more than 45 minutes to the Washington Center's closure but no others in the region did. The delays appear to have been resolved by midafternoon. There have been at least 13 prior reported cases at the center, according to the F.A.A. It was not immediately clear if any of those had resulted in closures of the facility. Other air route traffic control centers have similarly closed for cleaning after infections were discovered over the past few months, resulting in widespread delays. In December, the one in Memphis was closed for cleaning after an employee tested positive, resulting in slight delays.
It would be easy to chalk up these difficulties to postpartum depression if it weren't for the periodic reminders of Blythe's traumatic family history, woven through the book in stand-alone chapters. Blythe's mother hit her and often disappeared for a night or two at a time. Blythe's grandmother routinely locked Blythe's mother out of the house after school and once held her head underwater in the bathtub, nearly drowning her.
But while that case spun out from a 1972 break-in at Democratic headquarters in the Watergate complex, this began with a murky land deal in Arkansas in 1978. Through the efforts of Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel, under the law enacted in the wake of Watergate, the investigation spread to examine Clinton's affair with an intern.
Mr. Gillis issued what some saw as a non-apology, writing on Twitter that he is a comedian who pushes boundaries and his intention is never to hurt. He added, I'm happy to apologize to anyone who's actually offended by anything I've said.
The work now has a chance of really having traction, he said. I'm very optimistic about what can unfold.

Tuesdays I'm working the midnights. So Tuesdays I generally put in an afternoon at the Leadbetter. Attired in a taupe pants suit, I sit in my own office eighteen floors above where Wilmot deadends into Grainge. I am part-time security consultant here and I will go half-time or better when my EoD finally gets to be the mandatory twenty-five behind me. That date--my Entrance on Duty--is September 7, 1974. Retirement is already sniffing me up to see if I'm ripe.
The wealth of individual Jews grew perceptibly during this decade, with 25 percent of America's richest people being of Jewish background. (If only earned, as distinguished from inherited, wealth is counted, the percentage would be even higher.) An American Leadership study in 1971-72 found that Jews represented more than 10 percent of America's top movers and shakers in business, a higher percentage than any other ethnic group. Jews' per capita income is nearly double that of non-Jews. Twice the percentage of Jews as non-Jews earn more than $50,000 a year. And twice the percentage of non-Jews as Jews earn less than $20,000. Jewish charitable giving has increased along with Jewish wealth. Jews are now among the largest contributors to universities, museums, hospitals, symphonies, opera, and other charities. In 1991, the United Jewish Appeal raised more money than any other charity in America, including the Salvation Army, American Red Cross, Catholic Charities and the American Cancer Society. Yet only one-tenth of Jewish philanthropists limit their giving to Jewish charities alone, while one-fourth give only to non-Jewish causes.
Cardinal Keith O'Brien, who was removed in 2013 as Scotland's ranking Roman Catholic cleric after acknowledging that he had engaged in the very sort of homosexual behavior he had earlier denounced, died on Monday in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in Northeast England, where he had been living in exile. He was 80.
Ms. Srour, Ms. Saab and Ms. Sabbag are among the women featured in Rebecca Hillauer's Encyclopedia of Arab Women Filmmakers. Ms. Hillauer notes in the preface that the book started with an investigation into the question Arab women filmmakers — do they exist? By the time she completed her research, she had enough material to expand what she had conceived as a small reference work into a tome of some 400 pages, covering women from Iraq to Egypt to Tunisia.

Well, in this case, what's interesting is it's up to the employer, and it was NBC and Saturday Night Live. Even as I made the statement saying I didn't think he should be fired, I thought he probably would be fired. Because if you're NBC and SNL, you look up and say, what is my upside for keeping this guy? He's not exactly a huge moneymaker, he hasn't worked a day on the set. Like, that's not a really powerful set of incentives. And so I thought they probably would fire him. I'd suggest that the extent there are consequences for people's misstatements, they should be somewhere commensurate to the level of power and influence they have and the harm that they're doing. In Shane Gillis's case, he was a comedian. I'd never heard of the guy before.

California has battled dual crises, with the largest wildfire season on record breaking out in the midst of the pandemic. At the close of 2020, as millions of Californians were put under a second lockdown in a bid to quell a massive second surge in Covid-19 cases, more than 4.2 million acres of the state had been scorched by nearly 10,000 fires. But in many ways, the crises have split the state into two: Northern California continues to reel from multiple megafires, including the August Complex Fire and the SCU Lightning Complex Fire that exploded in late summer. And in Southern California, Los Angeles is now the epicenter of the pandemic, leading the nation both in confirmed cases and in numbers of deaths.
As the poet Bill Berkson once wrote, Martha Diamond, who is known for her indelible New York cityscapes rendered in thick, gestural brush strokes and bold, contrasting colors, builds edifices that bring citified chaos into focus as character, condensing the rush and stabilizing it as an emblem. Next week sees the opening of a new show, at Magenta Plains gallery on Manhattan's Lower East Side, that explores the depths of Diamond's affinity for these structures. Culled from pieces completed in the '80s, a pivotal decade for the artist that culminated in her work appearing in the 1989 Whitney Biennial, the six large-scale oil paintings to go on view share a palette of muted grays, midnight blues, glowing yellows and burnt scarlets — shades encountered on a lonely stroll at night, or thanks to a peek through the blinds after dark. (A number of preparatory studies on Masonite will also be on display.) Having lived and worked on the Bowery since 1969, Diamond indeed draws on scenes from her own walks through the city, depicting grids of buttery windows (as in Moonlight/City View #2, 1981) or stacks of green fence screens on identical balconies (Untitled 11, 1987). She also paints with her nondominant hand, which gives her canvases their intimate, figurative quality. They brood, slump and occasionally menace, and yet they're also solitary and anonymous — in other words, the works themselves are true city dwellers.
These large paintings would have been displayed in the reception rooms of Rauwaert's grand Amsterdam house. What did visitors think about all these lovingly limned male limbs? Probably nothing at all. Like the art historians who followed them centuries later, they would have remarked only on the thematic content. When the American art historian Julie L. McGee published a pioneering biography of Cornelis in 1975, she saw in The Massacre of the Innocents simply the theme of religious persecution, timely for Protestant resistors (Cornelis himself was raised Catholic) to Spanish rule. Pieter Van Thiel, in the compendious Cornelis catalogue raisonné that was his life achievement, ignores any homoerotic content in the oeuvre and writes, risibly, that a tepid late painting provided evidence that he possessed more libido than he usually showed. A more recent article by Lisa Rosenthal, an associate professor of art history at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, analyzed The Marriage of Peleus and Thetis of 1592-3 as a commentary on civic virtue. In the four centuries since Cornelis's death, only Hyman, in a 2016 essay, has addressed the randy elephant in the room.

As we leave behind a year of plague and solitude and hope for an age of renewal and togetherness, readers may yearn for uplifting stories about family, love and community.
You're assuming, of course, that she doesn't already know of his behavior. Either way, she'll no doubt suspect your motives. But then you, too, suspect your motives. One way to make an assessment is to ask yourself whether, had the situation been reversed, you would have wanted to be told by the other woman. Am I right to think that you would? If you tell her your story and she then proceeds with the wedding — perhaps after a confrontation and a resolution — it would presumably be with a clearer sense of what she is letting herself in for: She would be marrying him with a fuller appreciation of his faults, and if the marriage doesn't work out, it won't be even partly your fault. But notice that he didn't, in the end, choose to extricate himself; he chose to make a life with her. His betrayal of you is one truth; it is not the only one that matters.
Mr. Yang has been critical of China's increasingly authoritarian behavior and told the Council on Foreign Relations the United States must in reply demonstrate a model for democratic capitalism.
They have since performed at a circus in Indiana, at a private event for a hotel and at a Toys for Tots fund-raiser. They have mixed feelings about doing their act at all. They have wanted to do their part during the pandemic, they said, which has mostly meant staying home. Maas of Quick Change was distantly related to Lyric through marriage.
Well, I guess the first reaction I had was that it's kind of interesting that after 27 years at this newspaper, I have risen up to the exalted position of being a gossip reporter.
Binyamin Appelbaum: Yes. After every invention basically since the plow, people have found new uses for the time saved by new technologies. You've argued that this time, this won't happen quickly enough. Why will this time be different? What gives you the confidence that we're confronting something new in all of human history?
Nothing about the March sisters of Louisa May Alcott's perennial best seller particularly stuck with me, and as an adult, annoyance overshadowed apathy as I tried to understand how the literary heroine of so many women I admired — the spunky, independent writer Jo March — would, by the end of the novel, relinquish her art for marriage, and then proclaim that she is the happiest she'd ever been.
Oh wait, you can sing. What are you talking about?
Kamala Harris will resign from her Senate seat on Monday. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris speaking in Wilmington, Del., on Saturday. Credit... Amr Alfiky/The New York Times Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, who remains a United States senator from California, plans to resign from her seat on Monday ahead of her inauguration two days later, a Harris aide said. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, a fellow Democrat, will appoint a successor to Ms. Harris, who was elected in 2016. Mr. Newsom said last month that he intended to tap Alex Padilla, California's secretary of state, for the seat. Mr. Padilla's Senate term will expire in 2022, when he can seek re-election. Ms. Harris continued to attend Senate sessions after her November election, and was in the Capitol for the certification of the election results this month when the building was stormed by a violent mob of Trump supporters. Ms. Harris will be sworn in as vice president on Wednesday by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a ceremony in which the first woman of color to become vice president will take her oath from the first woman of color to sit on the Supreme Court. Ms. Harris chose Justice Sotomayor for the task, according to a Harris aide who was confirming a report by ABC News. The vice president-elect and Justice Sotomayor have a shared background as former prosecutors. And Ms. Harris has called the justice a figure of national inspiration.
A crisis is a terrible thing to waste is a quote attributed to the Stanford economist Paul Romer. He made the comment at a meeting in 2004, referring to the competition America faces from the rising education levels around the globe. Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's chief of staff, later echoed the statement after President Obama's election.
Think of major threats to South Korea, and its nuclear-armed neighbor North Korea may come to mind. But a subtler risk to South Korea's future well-being lies within its borders: a shrinking and rapidly aging population.
A sprawling, populous complex that serves 3,600 families and runs an elementary school, Blessed Sacrament has a pastor, three associate priests and Bashista, reflecting a bounty of vocations in and around Arlington that is out of keeping with the general trend. Bashista assumed at first that he would join a diocese in greater need of priests, he said, but in that process, some doors open, other doors close. The match seemed to be in Arlington. Bashista may spend as many as 15 years as an associate pastor, whereas in priest-starved dioceses like Denver, where Crisman will be ordained, a new priest might be placed in charge of a parish as soon as two years after ordination -- thrown into a vast organizational and fiscal job (parishes are financially independent, though they may borrow money from their dioceses) that can put a great deal of pressure on an inexperienced priest. After the Mass, parishioners gathered around Bashista and the other priests outside the church. Several complimented Bashista on his homily. One woman had a little boy with her who was afraid to make his first confession; would Bashista talk with him? A young drummer with an Army band thought he might have a vocation; Bashista promised to send him some information. A number of people asked him to pray for them, and he always assented -- and asked them to pray for him, too. (Later, he recorded the names of new parishioners he had met in a small book to help him remember them.)
No matter what Axe does, he will always be on the outside looking in. Even if he were interested in making people forget his working-class roots, the manner in which he earned — and continues to maintain — his billionaire status cannot be forgotten. To a certain extent, Axe knows this already, which is why he delights in wearing a heavy-metal T-shirt to formal occasions, thumbing his nose at New York City royalty. Yet no amount of money is enough for him to buy out Foley's scrap metal supplier, who will lose in penalties, fines, and endless governmental harassment whatever he gains upfront. And while Axe's gambit of arranging an animal conservation honor to present to Foley earns him a meeting, Foley uses the opportunity to make it clear that certain pathways to power aren't available to him. Nice try, but don't bother, Foley effectively tells him. There's nothing for you here.
In the late 1980s, she attempted a comeback with Senator Joe, a pop opera about Joseph McCarthy. (Mr. Cohn had been his right-hand man in pursuing suspected Communists in government.) But the show never opened, partly because of financial problems.

At the time, Watkins was accused of, among other things, a distinctly heteronormative frame of reference, of presuming that only straight women writers were capable of being ensnared in the blithely wielded cross hairs of men. But the truth is, all women writers find themselves turning the crystal tumbler of their experience against men's light. (Men, on the other hand, just get to write about the light, and are applauded for it.) And so the question remains, grows ever larger: How do writers divest themselves from the pressures of the dominant culture while also addressing the burdensome weight of that dominant culture?
Here are two novels that are, in some ways, opposites: one by an author who's been publishing celebrated work for 40 years, and one a debut; one that blends numerous genres with a skillful and inquiring hand, and one that glories in modeling a single genre by hitting every one of its notes. Between them they contrast the pleasures of surprise with those of satisfied expectations.
I rapped on the half-glass back door.
Seen on the page, the words scattered amid expanses of white, it can seem more like modernist poetry than theater. It is, in other words, as easily made into a score as into anything.
California and Texas textbooks sometimes offer different explanations for white backlash to black advancement after the Civil War, from Reconstruction to housing discrimination in the 20th century.
And although there was great interest in him before take-off time (his hope and that of his rivals to fly the Atlantic had excited wide newspaper coverage), Lindbergh had not calculated the response to his achievement, the degree to which he would be lionized or the extent to which he would be regarded as public property, especially by reporters and photographers, whom he came quickly to detest. 'Extraordinary Situation' The situation I encountered was extraordinary in the extreme, and often fantastic, he recalled, and cited, as an example, a woman who wanted to rent the hotel room I was leaving so she could take a bath in the same tub. Overwhelmed, without precedents to guide him, pressed by dizzying demands on his time, Lindbergh was happy to accept an invitation from Harry Guggenheim, a very rich and very conservative financier who was connected with the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics, to escape for a while to his Long Island estate. The invitation was at the suggestion of Dwight Morrow, the Morgan banker, who told Mr. Guggenheim, Harry, almost everyone in the country is after this young fellow, trying to exploit him. Isn't there something you and the fund can do, to save him from the wolves? At Falaise, the Guggenheim castle, which was perhaps the most opulent private home he had stayed in, the aviator was able to catch his breath for three weeks and rewrite the ghostwritten manuscript that became the book We.
The books have the same publisher. They credit the same authors. But they are customized for students in different states, and their contents sometimes diverge in ways that reflect the nation's deepest partisan divides.
That's quite a soap opera to pile onto poor Dvorak's wonderful and large-spirited quartet. Mr. Gomes is not short of ideas; but almost none of them feel organic. There are forcefully folksy handclaps where the music doesn't call for them; later, when the music develops a folk atmosphere, Mr. Gomes ignores it. Though I believe that there are many such small-town stories to tell, I don't believe the way Mr. Gomes tells this one. He keeps nudging us to notice the same points about the same relationships. The long pas de deux between the husband and wife creates its own clichés.
CW: Going back though, my question is, there's an issue of power here. I mean, sure. You might not want to. You might not be able to address the problems of Facebook if you break it up from Instagram, and I understand that, and there's still going to be addictive products, but there's an issue of the consolidation of actual power, the ability to buy those companies, to make those acquisitions. Just simply the leverage that Mark Zuckerberg can use to have a meeting with Donald Trump that they won't tell us about, I mean, how do you — if you don't break them up, how do you get rid of that conglomeration of power?

One of Proust's ex-lovers and his most constant friend, Reynaldo Hahn, the composer, recalled that soon after he met Proust they were walking through a garden when suddenly Proust stopped dead before a rosebush. He asked Hahn to continue walking without him. When at last Hahn circled back, after going around the chateau, I found him at the same place, staring at the roses. His head tilting forward, his face very serious, he blinked, his eyebrows slightly furrowed as though from a passionate act of attention, and with his left hand he was obstinately pushing the end of his little black mustache between his lips and nibbling on it.... How many times I've observed Marcel in these mysterious moments in which he was communicating totally with nature, with art, with life, in these `deep minutes' in which his entire being was concentrated.... Typically, Proust also invoked this very scene, but said that inhaling the moment was ineffectual; only the sudden, unprompted awakenings of memory, triggered by something illogical and unforeseen (the madeleine, for example), could invoke the past in its entirety.
MC: He has my vote. All right. [LAUGHTER]
Mr. Yang was raised in New York; his parents immigrated from Taiwan.
Is there ever cruelty in your work now?
Time passed. She sold her house, she moved to a retirement community. This is the shrinkage that takes place in the modern story of the very long life: First comes love, then marriage, the baby in the carriage, and after decades, the retirement joint with craft classes, edifying programs, exercise routines, followed by the broken hip, assisted living, and finally, the dementia unit, the lockup.
Never before has such a large portion of humanity been literate, enjoyed a middle-class cushion, lived such long lives, had access to family planning or been confident that their children would survive. Let's hit pause on our fears and frustrations and share a nanosecond of celebration at this backdrop of progress.
Not all his big bets paid off. Perhaps his best-known debacle was Jobriath, a gay performer whom Mr. Brandt backed with a lavish promotional campaign in 1973 and '74, hoping to create an American version of David Bowie's androgynous Ziggy Stardust persona. The concertgoing and record-buying public soundly rejected the attempt to manufacture a star, and Jobriath, whose real name was Bruce Campbell, faded quickly.
We still haven't gotten over it, and even in this advanced time of always-on, I'm not sure we should. The sweet nothings that Mr. Bezos was sending to one person should not have turned into tweets for the entire world to see and, worse, that most everyone assumed were O.K. to see.
I'm going to say I do not have confidence that any of my opponents ge
So you definitely need to bring the tech companies to heel and say, Look, here are the list of problems we're concerned about. But the solution to the abuse of power is not to say like, Hey, we're just going to try and keep anyone in the country from having the ability to do wrong. What you have to do is you have to figure out what the abuses you're concerned about are, and then actually address them directly.
I wasn't opposed to A.B. 5. I wanted to amend it and make it more open to people like freelance writers, and drivers and other people who find themselves caught in a situation that's very difficult for them.
One, it's a lot easier and cheaper for us to throw kids into a classroom with textbooks and a teacher and say, You're going to go to college, than it is to try and train them in skills that are going to give them a secure livelihood. Number two, we have fetishized college and stigmatized anything that's not college. We've beaten Americans over the head, pretended everyone's going to college and say, It's going to work for you. And the Democrats are guilty of this. That's why they're yelling, Free college, free college. Meanwhile, again, only 33 percent of Americans are going to go to college, and that is a relatively stable number.
Mr. Bernstein's politics — he called himself a secular, self-loving Jew of a leftist persuasion — influenced both his life and his art.
The front desk called to say I had a visitor: Colonel Rockwell. Frankly, I was surprised that he was up and around. My understanding was that the boys were down from Chicago and the phone was off the hook. The Rockwells were digging in.
Something happens whenever Aaron Morrill takes his large and fluffy mutt, Donut, for her daily walk, and it's something that always catches him a bit by surprise.
And it's not just the leading edge N.S.A.-type stuff. If you look around congressional offices or the I.R.S., they're all using technology from the '90s or whatever it is. I had a whiz kid who said he got yelled at for writing a script in a congressional office that automated a task. They were like, No, we just wanted you to do it manually forever. So there needs to be a massive modernization effort. Not just in terms of how we recruit tech talent at the highest levels, but how we function even in the basics.
It has also been interesting to watch in recent years how businesses have worked to scoop up some of the spending around this major global holiday.
No matter how much free time you have this weekend, we have TV recommendations for you. Come back every Friday for new suggestions on what to watch.
The word testosterone appears nowhere in the report, and the possibility that men and women's personalities differ for biological reasons is unsayable and unthinkable.
But that's what we did. That's what you did. You were the change. The answer to people's hopes and, because of you, by almost every measure, America is a better, stronger place than it was when we started.
But the law enforcement official said that it was too soon to expect a raft of conspiracy charges. Such cases can be tough to prove in court, and investigators would need to seek additional evidence of coordination, such as financial ties, planning around logistics and travel or messages between any alleged group members. On Thursday, the Justice Department charged two off-duty police officers from Rocky Mount, Va., Jacob Fracker and Thomas Robertson, with unlawful entry and disorderly conduct in connection with the riots. Mr. Robertson said on social media that the media and the left were upset because we actually attacked the government who is the problem and not some random small business, according to the criminal complaint. Keep poking us, Mr. Robertson warned. In a nod to concerns that members of the military might have been involved in or supported the Capitol riots, the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff issued an unusual message to all military personnel this week, reminding them that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. would soon be their commander-in-chief and that they must continue to defend the Constitution. The Defense Department declined on Thursday to directly address whether members of the military were involved in attacking the Capitol. We in the Department of Defense are doing everything we can to eliminate extremism, said Garry Reid, the Pentagon's director for defense intelligence. He said that all members of the military, including members of the National Guard, go through extensive screening for participation in hate groups and militias.
After Mr. Gillis was fired, Mr. Yang tweeted that the comedian had reached out to him. Looks like we will be sitting down together soon, Mr. Yang wrote. Neither the comedian nor the candidate appears to have spoken publicly about the content of the meeting.
JI: In that system, a lot of that money didn't actually go to treating tobacco-related health problems. A lot of it went to shoring up state budgets, and some of them even went to the tobacco industry actually, so I don't know if that's the best model.
Maher diligently traces Baloch's steps from her family home to an abusive marriage to the women's shelter where she resolves to leave her husband but also, permanently, her son, behind. From there Baloch moved through a series of disillusioning way stations, the limited menu for a woman on the make: bus hostess, model. Everywhere in these subcultures Maher finds women confined and commodified, desperately trying, and rarely succeeding, to govern their own lives. No wonder the internet seemed to offer Baloch a new kind of freedom, one worth the price of the abuse she received. Social media is not someone's father's property, she tells her critics. Everyone has the right to express their opinion on it. And yet this is a dark book, in which loyalty and kindness are outdone by exploitation and cruelty. Maher, for example, finds the young reporter who breathlessly raced to Baloch's family home after receiving a police tip about her murder. Dissatisfied with his scoop, he arranged to have the sheet covering her corpse removed so that he could photograph it, so he could see for himself. This is amorality without a floor.
Courtney Maum visits the podcast to discuss Before and After the Book Deal, her guide for writers publishing their first book. We're in a culture where there's a lot of books and M.F.A. programs and summer conferences that teach you how to write and learn to revise well enough to get a book deal, Maum says. But the minute you realize your dream and you actually do get a book deal, there's nothing. There's not a lot of resources. There's certainly no books about it. And the conversations that you do have are a little loaded and icky. … So I wanted to put something out there for people who are navigating this immense privilege that nevertheless leaves you pretty raw and vulnerable.
One criticism of government subsidized journalism is that it could stifle the media's capacity to serve as a watchdog.
KK: So, can you give us some names of people you would nominate to the Supreme Court?
A WORLD WITHOUT 'WHOM': The Essential Guide to Language in the BuzzFeed Age, by Emmy J. Favilla. (Bloomsbury, $18.) The BuzzFeed copy chief discusses her plan to codify language in a digital era, balancing a need for logic with flexibility to account for how people actually talk. Along with a look at the rules she devised, the book offers a guide to the quandaries we face as the way we communicate online reshapes language itself.
A lot of their recruiting goes on around fraternities, but fraternities aren't getting together, said Rosanna Hertz, chair of women's and gender studies at Wellesley College and co-author of Random Families, a book on donor conception. People want college-educated sperm, so to speak.
I saw her in Prom, and I'm like, she's still fantastic, and this is very light.
Larger than each work is the engaging impression created by Ms. Kent's dancers. They carry the evening. They aren't, however enriched or extended by it.
Margo St. James was an artist working as a waitress and living the Beat life in San Francisco in the 1960s when her home became a counterculture hangout. As she told The Windy City Times of Chicago in 2011, there was a lot of pot-smoking and sex and, you know, whatever.
would love to have someone argue that competitiveness without aggression is somehow undesirable. That sounds exactly like redirecting traits toward more productive activity and behavior.
I'm curious what conversations you and your colleagues are having in this moment. I have to assume that you go into the office each day, the union headquarters, or you meet with rank-and-file officers, and you're all absorbing these protests. And I'm curious what kinds of conversations you all are having in this moment.
The decision to move ahead with the bill — which, if approved, will be the first law of its kind in Iran's penal code — comes in the aftermath of a groundbreaking #MeToo movement and shocking reports of so-called honor killings that have gripped the public over the past six months.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, like Mr. Yang, has argued that the country's approach to antitrust regulation is outmoded. In early 2019, the Federal Trade Commission created a new task force focused on monitoring competition in technology markets, which the foundation celebrated as a step toward modernizing antitrust.
Tim Severin, a British adventurer who for 40 years meticulously replicated the journeys of real and mythic explorers like St. Brendan the Navigator, Sinbad the Sailor and Marco Polo, died on Dec. 18 at his home in West Cork, Ireland. He was 80.
I also have a unique window into the mind of the anti-Semite, since I continue to receive hundreds of anti-Semitic letters and calls each year, some quite lengthy and revealing.
It was very difficult, but I'd have to say yes. I'm a terrible mother.
Ms. Harris did not have children. In her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in August, Ms. Harris spoke about her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, an immigrant who came to California as a teenager and raised Kamala and her sister, Maya, after she and their father divorced. For most of Ms. Harris's life, it was the three of them. When Maya became pregnant at 17 with her daughter, Meena, it became four. When their family gathers this week in Washington, it will be the first time they've all seen each other in more than two months. The last time was the week of the election, gathered at a house in Delaware, where they passed the time with games, karaoke, food — and waited, anxiously, for the official results to come in. There was one night that just turned into a dance party, Cole said. In other words, just a family hanging out — hoping for history to be made.
Dash was a really good listener, and didn't judge me or push me in any way, she said. He was just a friend that would listen.
The decline of male status in the family is more sharply articulated than in Europe, hastened in the U.S. by economic inequality (men fall further under changing economic circumstances) and religiosity (leading to pockets of greater male resistance to the redefinition of gender roles).
This is — I mean, this is going to make me very sad to say, but I feel like I had an arc or a relationship with President Obama, where it was inspirational when he won. I was celebrating with my wife in the streets. And then over the years I began to feel like we'd missed a great opportunity. So, I'd say there was some heartbreak attached to that. And I worked with the president afterward, and I still admire him a great deal, but I think we could have done a lot more, and I don't think opportunities like that come along very often.
All right, you turn the table. Turn them away. Lazy Susan me, as I like to say.
You were the good, and you stayed good. Never amnesia or brain surgery that caused you to —
That'd be my first question if I got in there, I'd be, All right, let me see them. Let's see what we've been hiding all of these years.
Well to me, playing the relative benefit game, I mean of course in any large scale national program, it's you can't calibrate it precisely to everyone's individual situation. To me the test is more, is that person going to be better off tomorrow than they are today?
On Thursday night, Mr. Gabbard said all of that was in his daughter's past.
But Mr. Lesh's strangest misadventure happened several years ago in Chicago, where he works as an inspector, and had nothing to do with misguided home improvement projects. He was checking the carbon monoxide levels in an apartment when he heard banging from the outside wall. He opened the front door to find a team of officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, who promptly swarmed the apartment and arrested the owner. I look down the hall and say, 'My check!' recalled Mr. Lesh, who never got paid for the job. As for the carbon monoxide, he said, It was high. Had this not happened, I would have told my client, 'You need to get your C.O. fixed.'
In a 1985 study of college men, Hoge concluded that making celibacy optional, as it is for Eastern Orthodox and Protestant clergy (celibacy has been required of Catholic priests only since the Second Lateran Council in 1139), would increase the number of candidates fourfold. So far, though, the church hierarchy has shown no interest in such a reform, and with the exception of Bishop Raymond A. Lucker of New Ulm, Minn., who called in a pastoral letter last fall for a dialogue on celibacy, very few American bishops have spoken publicly on the issue. A former architect who practiced for seven years before entering the seminary, Bashista would have been an anomaly 30 years ago, when nearly three-quarters of entering seminarians were under 25. But today he is the norm; 86 percent of seminarians are older than 25 when they enter, and 16 percent are older than 40, meaning that -- with four years of theology in front of them, often preceded by a year or more of pretheology and sometimes interrupted by a mandatory year of ministry or reflection -- some will be 50 or older by the time they become priests. The student body at Mount Saint Mary's includes a doctor, a concert pianist and several military officers -- evidence of the rising number of second career priests who embarked upon secular lives after college, but then experienced spiritual epiphanies that upended those lives and remade them.
I won't spoil that bit here but now you know where to find it. It was my stealthy way of making sure my dad was at my wedding after all.
She continues to reckon with the suicides of her father and brother. She describes her brief and terrible marriage, while still at Sarah Lawrence, to an abusive painter. As an actress, she discovers, to her disgust, that the casting couch was no myth. She loses roles by refusing to become a plaything.
Like some American colleges, it is testing people extensively and even sifting through sewage for traces of the virus. The goal, Professor Tan said, is to make sure there are no infections among the students, faculty and staff members at N.U.S.
And I think this timing is crucial to understanding how this debate is playing out in Britain. Because as you see the country charting a new identity, casting off from Europe, there's a great deal of uncertainty, of uneasiness about the future of this country. What kind of a role will it play in the world? Will it be diminished? Will it be isolated? What will the post-Brexit Britain look like? So at this time of national uncertainty, there is a yearning for symbols. There's a, a sort of an urge to reach out to things that symbolize British history and the immutability of the British idea. And there's no greater symbol of that than the monarchy.
With the words Hung on You painted in oversize letters on its storefront and a large mural inside, the shop became a groovy place to be seen, especially if rockers and other celebrities were known to have bought clothing there.
A little slice? Come on. No, I'm happy for that, and I know Showtime is happy for that.
To address the racial disparities in health exposed by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately claimed the lives of people of color, he pledged to increase funding for community health centers, and also intends to fund efforts to mitigate the pandemic in prisons and jails, where African-Americans and Latinos are overrepresented.
My sister divorced her husband years ago. Until recently, we remained on friendly terms with my former brother-in-law, socializing at family events he hosted and exchanging holiday gifts. Lately he has become so radical in his political and world views that I am no longer comfortable maintaining a relationship. He has a blog and is an occasional radio host, so his are very public opinions that are filled with hate and even calls to violent action. I find this horrifying, and I am firmly in the category of people he is calling for violence against, along with most of my family. This is more than simply differing ideologies. (I do not believe he is a physical danger. I believe he needs help, the way Alex Jones needs help.)
She doesn't think that four years from now, when she is 80, economic conditions for people in her situation will be great. But I'll be O.K., she said, because I know how to do without.
Alex Kingsbury: Another thing the country's invested in quite a lot is the military, and as commander in chief, you'd be in charge of that. Can you tell me how many aircraft carriers the United States Navy has?
By the time he became a senator in May 1991, appointed after his predecessor was killed in an aircraft accident, Mr. Wofford was already 65. He had been a lawyer, an author, a professor, the president of two colleges, a special assistant to President John F. Kennedy, an adviser to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, the state's secretary of labor and industry, a champion of civil rights and a leading force in America's national and community service movement.
To them, I'll let the Rolling Stones answer: You can't always get what you want, but sometimes you get what you need. My students need to learn how to be lawyers and professionals. To succeed they must internalize an ethos of caution, care and respect. To instill these values and skills in my students, I have no choice but to limit laptop use in the classroom.
Cloris Leachman, who won an Academy Award for her portrayal of a neglected housewife in the stark drama The Last Picture Show but who was probably best known for getting laughs, notably in three Mel Brooks movies and on television comedies like The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Malcolm in the Middle, died on Wednesday at her home in Encinitas, Calif. She was 94.
Yes, too soon, his friends said. (But it was funny.)
Kuechenberg joined the Dolphins as a free agent in 1970, the future Hall of Fame coach Don Shula's first season, and played for them until 1983. He was part of a daunting offensive line that included guard Larry Little and center Jim Langer, both enshrined in the Hall of Fame.
Yeah, Mike. You see? If not you, who?
So for a high school graduate in America to get by, if you have one health problem or car breakdown, it can take a very tenuous financial situation and send it in a downward spiral. Then how do you put food on the table? In theory, there are nonprofits and food pantries that would see to this, but we all know that they're dramatically underresourced relative to the need. And so when you look at the causes of food poverty, to me the best solution is instead of trying to create organizations that will put food into people's hands, which we should do obviously, we should just put money into Americans' hands and then they would be able to procure food to provide for themselves and their families.
Pain. Why was she naked, Mike? Jennifer. Miss Modest. Who never even owned a bikini. With her figure.
Her arrest came three days after she posted a thread on Twitter extolling the ease of her low-cost life in Bali and its tolerant community, and promoting an e-book, Our Bali Life Is Yours, that she wrote with her partner, Saundra Alexander. The couple also offered tutorials for people wanting to move to the island.
This week, a six-part documentary on Lifetime is taking an expansive look at the allegations against Mr. Kelly, a chart-topping artist whose history has invited extra scrutiny in recent years.
FINDING YOUR ROOTS 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). The ancestral roots of the broadcast journalist Norah O'Donnell, the fashion designer Zac Posen and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will be excavated in the Season 6 finale of Henry Louis Gates, Jr.'s long-running familial history show. Highlights include a sequence in which Pelosi pores over the passenger manifest of a ship that arrived in New York in 1912 carrying her grandfather, her grandmother and their children, including Pelosi's mother. I take great pride in the courage that they had to come to America, Pelosi says, and to take a chance on America.
We love to see people who are new people, new immigrants, because they don't know anything — they need guidance, Ms. Gendy, 58, said. Those are the people we really focus on.
Equally passionate, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, said men were imperfect, and he asked Livingston not to resign, for a moment drawing a bipartisan standing ovation.
She was an integral part of its origin story, driving to Seattle in 1994 while Mr. Bezos sat in the passenger seat, working on the nascent company's business plan. She was Amazon's first accountant and was involved in its transformation from a small online bookseller to the e-commerce behemoth it is today, the second company in American history to be valued at over a trillion dollars.
That too. I mean, it's rough. But I mean, New York's going through — I just want to bring some things to you from experience. Like yeah, the infrastructure breaking down. I mean, we're coasting on the investments made decades ago and they're starting to fall apart. But also what you all do in terms of journalism — I've been campaigning around the country and over 1,200 local papers have gone out of business because the local establishments that used to advertise are gone. All of their classified revenue went off to Craigslist and democracy works much less if you don't have local journalism.
I'm not a millennial. I'm older than you. I think I might be older than you, or very close. I am no millennial. I'm millennial thinking is what I am.
a living document and will undoubtedly evolve over time. What is important is that we are grappling with the impact of destructive expectations that may thwart positive development and diminish the physical and emotional health of men and boys.
Right now we have three flagship numbers we're beating the American people over the head with, telling them that things are going great. No. 1, the headline unemployment rate. No. 2, gross domestic product, which is obviously putting up record highs even as our life expectancy is declining. And No. 3, corporate profits and shareholder value. Stock market prices correspond to the fortunes of the top 20 percent of Americans, many of the people, obviously, who live here in Manhattan. The bottom 80 percent of Americans own 8 percent of stock market value. The bottom 50 percent own essentially zero.
Once they move in, this dynamic infuses every part of their marriage, right down to the night she makes a mess of the kitchen and Nate doesn't lift a finger to help, something that never would've happened in their old life when they were both working, i.e. equal partners. Before she knows it, the resentment begins to fester and Alice starts taking her lead from 1950s Nellie — whose first lie to her husband coincided with the first time she discovered another woman's lipstick stain on his shirt collar — misleading Nate about everything from birth control to the humiliating career scandal that drove Alice to leave her job.
KK: Have you spoken to Republican lawmakers about the Freedom Dividend?
Yeah, it does. It's one reason why I think we need to de-emphasize — excuse me.
He remembered learning as a boy that Britain's millions of pet hamsters were descended from a single female caught in the wild, in Syria. In 1990 he contacted the head of the hamster council, who put him in touch with thousands of owners. They gladly sent him samples from their pets' stool, a DNA analysis of which showed that indeed they shared a common ancestor. Professor Sykes was right.
From a more academic vantage point, Steven Pinker, a professor of psychology at Harvard, replied to my inquiry with a detailed critique of the A.P.A. guidelines.
The jury is still out on women police. On whether they can take it. Or for how long. On the other hand, maybe it's me: Maybe I'm just another fuckoff. New York PD, for instance, is now fifteen percent female. And all over the country women detectives continue to do outstanding work, celebrated work. But I'm thinking that these must be some very, very exceptional ladies. Many times, when I was in Homicide, I said to myself, Walk away, girl. Ain't nobody stopping you. Just walk away. Murders are men's work. Men commit them, men clean up after them, men solve them, men try them. Because men like violence. Women really don't figure that much, except as victims, and among the bereaved, of course, and as witnesses. Ten or twelve years back, during the arms buildup toward the end of Reagan's first term, when the nuclear thing was on everyone's mind, it seemed to me that the ultimate homicide was coming and one day I'd get the dispatcher's call alerting me to five billion dead: All of them, except you and me. In full consciousness and broad daylight men sat at desks drawing up contingency plans to murder everybody. I kept saying out loud: Where are the women? Where were the women? I'll tell you: They were witnesses. Those straggly chicks in their tents on Greenham Common, England, making the military crazy with their presence and their stares--they were witnesses. Naturally, the nuclear arrangement, the nuclear machine, was strictly men only.
Caldwell's book is noteworthy for being a conservative account that effectively reinforces a liberal ideological narrative. It is usually liberals who argue that on every new culture-war battlefield their side is just extending Martin Luther King Jr.'s vision, while conservatives respond that the civil rights acts were supposed to correct a specific historical injustice and their application to debates over gender or marriage or abortion or the rights of illegal immigrants warps that purpose. Caldwell shrugs off this idea as a pleasant illusion; in his account the original critics of civil rights legislation were probably correct to warn against its revolutionary implications, which include the steady subsequent advance of cultural progressivism, an enormous expansion of deficit spending and the economic abandonment and cultural vilification of the white male working class.
He began by doing voice-overs on radio when he was 6 and struck up an enduring cross-country friendship by telephone with Stan Laurel when he was 12 — leading to roles impersonating Laurel's huskier other half, Oliver Hardy. (He was a founder of the Laurel and Hardy fan club Sons of the Desert.)
I mean, the question is what trade-offs you're willing to make, really. The N.S.A. is going to be able to recruit the tech talent that he can recruit and you want to try and ramp that up. So one thing ——
Mr. Yang was asked on CNN's The Van Jones Show about cancel culture and whether Americans have gone too far in the direction of a lack of grace or a lack of forgiveness. He responded: I'm new to politics, but I certainly would hate to be judged by something I did 25 years ago.
The converts' position was doubly difficult because the Catholic Church received them with mixed feelings, an uneasy blend of gratitude and disdain. Catholic bishops were understandably glad that brilliant and influential men and women had decided that Rome represented the one true church, and delighted to learn that they were willing to put their skills at the service of Catholicism. But the bishops soon discovered that converts, intellectually adventurous and unused to clerical censorship, were likely to take speculative excursions that challenged orthodoxy rather than fortifying it. One part of the history of these converts is, accordingly, the story of conflicts with their bishops over what was or was not intellectually permissible. Newman, whose superiors often viewed him with suspicion for his ideas on the development of doctrine, the role of the laity, and the nature of religious certainty, once told Lord Acton that in the hierarchy's view all converts are dangerous. His fellow Oxford convert Richard Simpson, coeditor of the Rambler, the leading liberal Catholic journal of the mid-nineteenth century, had a long succession of conflicts with the hierarchy, which threatened to close the journal down as a hazard to the religion of the faithful. Isaac Hecker, the American Transcendentalist and Brook Farm communard who converted in 1844, also ran into official disapproval when his book Aspirations of Nature (1857) appeared to maintain that by nature human beings were good, minimizing the power of original sin, and hence the need for grace, well beyond what his superiors found admissible.
CW: Who else besides you that you're running against understands the internet?
But on Wednesday, Dr. Biden arrived at the White House with a higher profile, a platform similar to the one she had as second lady, and an East Wing stocked with aides she trusts. They include Anthony Bernal, a senior adviser who has been with the Bidens since the Obama campaign. Julissa Reynoso Pantaleón, an Obama State Department alumnus, is her chief of staff.
archived recording (michael bruce curry) — once said, and I quote, We must discover the power of love.
Things had changed in 2001, when she was arrested yet again, this time charged with 39 counts of fraud. At the time, she was using a different surname, Rosian — she was living with a man named Vladimir Rosian on the Upper West Side — and the stakes were much lower. She had been charging immigrants $2,000 to $2,700 each, falsely telling them that she had influence on immigration legislation and could help them gain permanent resident status.
Oh, you might not want to push the money to the states and then have them determine how to use it in their budgets. You could empower a national program or an agency to help administer it at the federal level, if you didn't trust the states to actually use it in the right way.
My mother and father both worked outside the home, but like many women of their generation, my mother was in charge of keeping the home and caring for the children on top of her paying job. When my boyfriend and I moved in together, I made sure not to take over the housekeeping. We both cooked and cleaned and knew how to operate the washing machine. Home maintenance was either a joint effort or jointly neglected.
This, to me, is an emblem of what's gone wrong in American life. Where the market is all knowing and all powerful, and if the market decides that local journalism has zero value, then it has zero value. And that is not the way forward for us. We need to make our own independent determination of our own value as people, of the value of local journalism, of the value of arts, of the value of volunteering, of caregiving, of — like all the most important things in American life. And so you, in many ways, you're like the guardians of this incredible journalistic tradition, and it's like a unique privilege because the people who've pursued the same vocation in other parts of the country are just seeing it disappear.
It seems like a nice place to work. Then you might have greater success. We also saw this happen even with the rollout of healthcare.gov. Remember this? It's like they had the consultant and then they totally botched it and then they needed to bring in the ——
In the same way marxism, for complex political and intellectual reasons, lost its allure; its predictions were falsified, its scientific pretensions exposed as a sham, and it too became closely linked with a brutal tyrant, Stalin, whose career in scientific politics was almost enough to give political science itself a bad name. The failure of the alternatives does not, in itself, demonstrate the correctness of the Catholic faith, to be sure, but it lends credence to the Catholic opposition to marxism and eugenics. It seems now that dogmatic Catholics enjoyed an insulation against some of the utopian currents that swept the Western nations in the first half of this century. It would be rash today to say that Catholicism was wrong when its adversaries were right. Our age, more jaded and skeptical in the face of successive disappointments, can pay it at least backhanded compliments, acknowledge its strengths as well as its weaknesses, and recognize that it provided the standpoint from which to make a telling critique of its secular rivals.
Well, only to correct because of the severity, he's actually in Georgia, being charged with felony murder. Which means that if he's not put to death, he will spend the rest of his life in prison without a chance for parole. And to answer your question, it's heavy on my heart and disheartening, not so much of the charge, as the fact that the due process and the investigation that led to the charge was not done at all, and very done improperly.
The early 20th century, he noted, had brought us large-scale factories, efficient systems of transport, huge enterprises with disciplined work forces and pseudoscientific ideologies like eugenics. These were essential elements, alongside anti-Semitism, of Hitler's mass slaughter. Mr. Bauman argued that we must not celebrate the achievements of the modern age without also paying attention to its dark side.
Well, the labor force participation rate has declined precipitously, so I don't buy that somehow the government started giving people more money over the last number of years. And the headline unemployment rate, and I'm sure you know this, it doesn't measure underemployment, 40 to 44 percent of recent college graduates are now doing a job that does not require a college degree. It does not measure the fact that 94 percent of new jobs in the economy are temp, gig or contract jobs that do not have health care benefits and can disappear at any moment. It doesn't include the fact that you might be doing two or three jobs to make ends meet.
JI: I actually really quickly want to go back to a question that Binya was asking you. You said, you gave us the example of parents with two kids and you're on food stamps and you're worried about your kids' future. And at the end of that explanation, you said that you are not for curtailing social supports, but isn't your plan such that, that mother, aside from what the kids would get in the future, that mother would have to choose between the food stamps and the actual U.B.I., right? Is that correct?
AN AMERICAN MARRIAGE, by Tayari Jones. (Algonquin, $16.95.) The lives of a young black couple in Atlanta are thrown into chaos after the husband, Roy, is imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit. As the couple grapple with their grief, they must also confront the failed hopes of a marriage and romantic love. The grave miscarriage of justice forms the core of Jones's deeply compassionate and heartbreaking novel.
Ms. Bosworth does not recount these stories as a striding march through Manhattan and Hollywood. The Men in My Life attends just as fully to loneliness and darkness, to the slivers of dread that prickled her psyche. There is a good deal of talk in this book about what she calls the bereaved creature inside me.
His youth, said Louann Cooling, 62, of Le Grand, Iowa. It was the same answer — his youth, or his inexperience — that others gave. No one mentioned his being openly gay.
For the first two episodes of Season 3, the show had been taking a conservative, back-to-basics approach to the procedural that seemed like a correction to the indulgences of the previous season, which got lost in the tangled psychology of four lead characters who were the same brand of edgy.
Their partnership has endured through distance, even as both pursued solo projects. About 15 years ago Mr. Torres left New York for Orlando, Fla., while Mr. Ahearn continued working in his South Bronx studio. With Mr. Ahearn the one with connections to the city's art world, people sometimes forget about Mr. Torres's equal contributions to their oeuvre. But if anything, Mr. Ahearn was relieved and excited when Mr. Torres returned to his studio recently to prepare several pieces for a show in Chelsea in the fall.
As Jews and Israel become more secure against external threats, the internal threats are beginning to grow, as graphically illustrated by the recent assassination of an Israeli prime minister by a Jew, the growing conflict between fundamentalist Jews and more acculturated Jews, the increasing trends toward intermarriage and assimilation, and the decline of Jewish literacy.
Who was being charged with murder and who, if convicted, would face life in prison or the death penalty.
A new generation of converts in the United States joined the Catholic Church in the interwar years. The best known, Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton, each gradually won a wide and sympathetic audience in the non-Catholic world, eventually becoming spiritual celebrities. Less celebrated but equally important, a succession of converts from the ranks of academia--among them the historians Carlton Hayes, Ross Hoffman, and Elizabeth Kite, and the sociologist Eva Ross--brought a measure of intellectual respectability to Catholic education. This generation of converts was made up of white Anglo-Saxon Protestants. They had enjoyed an education in the leading American graduate schools--Hayes at Columbia and Hoffman at the University of Pennsylvania, for example--and they felt none of the immigrant insecurities and defensive belligerence still common among their ethnically assimilating Catholic contemporaries. They were as much a part of the American establishment as the convert sons of English Anglican bishops were part of the British establishment. They brought to Catholic academic life a new sense of ease and possession. Demonstrating a high level of technical skill in their disciplines, they began to win more sympathetic attention from non-Catholic academics. They also ran graduate programs, training young cradle Catholics to high standards, with the eventual effect of reducing the prominence of converts. Many non-Catholics found their critique of science and their philosophical antitotalitarianism germane to the total war of the 1940s and the Cold War of the 1950s.

I lit another cigarette. I don't drink anymore but man do I smoke. I said, I've known Jennifer Rockwell since she was eight years old.
That is why many manuals offer advice for navigating communication traps. They counsel asking your partner whether it is a good time to talk (since couples routinely broach complicated topics on the fly), and striking a balance between empathy and problem-solving. If your partner is an avoider, don't give up trying to connect. If your partner is an emoter, stay compassionate and firm: I'll be able to respond better if you take it down a couple of notches. In bad moments, we all need these skills.
And that's probably a generous response. Some of the responses would be worse than that. So if you get the boot off people's throats, then you can start making progress on our health, on our educational outcomes, on our political polarization.
'THE GOVERNMENT INSPECTOR' at the Duke on 42nd Street (in previews; opens on June 1). Anyone panicked by the current political reality can escape into an arguably more problematic one. This Red Bull production of Jeffrey Hatcher's adaptation of a Gogol masterpiece stars Michael Urie as a man who thrusts a small town into paroxysms of anxiety and bribery. Jesse Berger directs a cast including Mary Testa, Arnie Burton, Stephen DeRosa and Michael McGrath.
Trader. He was there, Mike. He was the last to see. I'm not saying he...But it's Trader. Trader owns her. It's Trader.
archived recording (paul howard) What we discovered is that Officer Rolfe actually kicked Mr. Brooks while he laid on the ground, while he was there fighting for his life. We were able to conclude that, based on the way that these officers conducted themselves while Mr. Brooks was lying there, that the demeanor of the officers immediately after the shooting did not reflect any fear or danger of Mr. Brooks, but their actions really reflected other kinds of emotions.
These young architects are heirs to a deep tradition of architecture beyond building — and right now they can discover one of the greatest paper architects of a time before AutoCAD. Jean-Jacques Lequeu, more than two centuries ago, also saw his career upended by political shifts and economic crises: in his case, the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. He, too, had to settle for a career of diminished scope, grinding out maps and renderings for a land registry office and other bureaucracies.
Mr. Yang told Vox's Recode that one of the reasons he quit Venture for America, the nonprofit he created, was because he realized it couldn't achieve the change he wanted at the necessary scale. For instance, it had fallen short of the 100,000 jobs he set out for it to create.
Next up are more things to slurp. One of the goals of Julia Sullivan, the chef and an owner, who opened the restaurant with the general manager and sommelier Allie Poindexter, was to fill the void in Nashville's oysterscape. A small, perfectly nice selection hailing from both coasts, Canada and the Gulf, comes with a seasonal mignonette (in our case, juicy watermelon) in addition to the usual condiments. The best oysters, though, come out of the wood-burning oven, slathered with a grassy pesto-like green curry then cooked until custardy.
Johnny Mac and myself pulled up in the unmarked. Whitman Avenue. Detached and semidetached residences on a wide tree-lined street: An academic dormitory on the edge of the Twenty-Seven. I climbed out in my stretch pants and my low pumps.
Oltan O'Boye would be riding east, to campus. Taking the news to Trader Faulkner.
Oh, you might not want to push the money to the states and then have them determine how to use it in their budgets. You could empower a national program or an agency to help administer it at the federal level, if you didn't trust the states to actually use it in the right way.
His sense of humor has remained more or less intact, if differently delivered. For the first Halloween after his crash, he dressed up as a person with a head injury, wrapping his head in gauze upon which he'd dribbled red food coloring. Around his neck he wore a sign that read: Too soon?
OZU IN COLOR at the Metrograph (May 27-31). Yasujiro Ozu had been directing for three decades before he made his first color film, Equinox Flower (Wednesday), in 1958. Its sophisticated, brightly hued compositions only add to the complexity of what, for Ozu, was by then a familiar narrative, that of a father who is reluctant to consent to his more modern-minded daughter's marriage, which he did not arrange. The series opens with Good Morning (Saturday and Sunday), from 1959, in which two brothers push their parents to buy a TV set.
California is one of many states to ask teachers and textbooks in recent years to cover the contributions of specific immigrant groups, including Asian-Americans, Pacific Islanders, European-Americans and Mexican-Americans.
His wife, who now lives in Italy, did not respond to repeated attempts to reach her.
If you have term limits, it is bipartisan. Because ——
In the early 1950s she took acting classes and was cast in several plays but did not have much success onstage. Her first film role was in 1957 in Le Jeu de la Nuit (The Game of the Night), but her career accelerated when Mr. Chabrol began casting her. In their almost two-dozen films, she often played a bourgeois woman.
Federal officials said last week that they would accelerate the start of a program in which some 40,000 pharmacy locations will give vaccines to people in high-risk groups, such as the elderly and frontline workers. Only a few thousand will be involved at the start, though. A lot of senior citizens aren't going to want to go to a stadium to get an inoculation, Dr. Gottlieb said. They're going to want to go to a local pharmacy or doctor's office. So we need to provide more opportunity for people to get vaccinated where they're comfortable getting it.
So when I heard that Shane Gillis had called me Jew chink — I think was the slur — my reaction was the same reaction anyone would have, which was like, who the heck is this guy, and he sounds like a total jackass. Well, my wife actually had heard about it independently and was also like, Who the heck is this guy? And so then I sat down and started to figure out who Shane Gillis was, what he did for a living, and then I sat down and watched some of his comedy to try and get some context.
Because that narrowing list has begun to exclude not just some of the most exciting performances and films of the season, but also many of the movies directed by women or featuring people of color. And though the academy, which is due to release its nominations next week, has taken great pains to diversify itself since the years of #OscarsSoWhite, this past week suggests that other awards bodies still have a lot of soul-searching to do, and that this issue may require a total shift in what's considered weighty and worthy.
People ask me, do you really want a general election between two New York billionaires? he said. To which I say, who's the other one?
After the owners were ordered to reinstate Mr. Roberts so that he could finish hearing the case — which the news media came to call Collusion I — he ruled that owners had conspired to curtail the free market for players' services after the 1985 season.
WHITNEY CUMMINGS at Carolines on Broadway (April 7-8, 7:30 and 10 p.m.). Ms. Cummings became a household name in 2011, when she created and starred in the NBC sitcom Whitney and also created — with Michael Patrick King — the CBS hit 2 Broke Girls. Since then, she's branched out into directing and writing, all while continuing her successful stand-up career. A veteran of the Comedy Central roasts, she has a skill for sharp insult comedy, but her material consists mostly of observational comedy about sex and dating.
Andrew Yang's message is remarkably similar to Elizabeth Warren's and Bernie Sanders's — the American economy is not working for enough Americans, and it's going to require structural change to do better. Where Mr. Yang differs — beyond his almost complete lack of government or political experience — is in his prescriptions, including his signature Freedom Dividend.
The other cancer survivor was already a devotee of Ms. Oliver's, and of that poem in particular. She said she'd taken it as her personal mantra. This was years before mindfulness became a thing, but my fellow traveler with cancer quoted another of Ms. Oliver's lessons for living: To pay attention, this is our endless and proper work.
But the taser is considered a deadly weapon under Georgia law.
It was really moving, she said, to see him point to his partner and all the support that his partner gave him, to have someone acknowledge their partner … We were both kind of crying.
I saw the headlines about how people were making fun of him. I was like, Oh man, this is really — we really have to put an end to this administration.
A working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that U.B.I. could redirect spending to more affluent and middle-income families, therefore leaving low-income families worse off; a U.B.I. large enough to direct more funds to low-income households would be extremely costly. Read the paper here.
Mr. Yang's candidacy has centered on the idea of his Freedom Dividend, essentially universal basic income — which has a long history, drawing support from Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King Jr. and Friedrich von Hayek, but also a controversial one. (Later annotations will look at why.)
Several more Capitol rioters have been arrested including man who carried a Confederate flag inside building. Kevin Seefried has been identified as having carried a Confederate flag into the Capitol during the siege last week. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times A man seen holding a Confederate battle flag, a person identified as striking a police officer with a flagpole and a retired firefighter identified as having thrown a fire extinguisher at officers were among those arrested Thursday for their role in the riot at the U.S. Capitol last week. A federal prosecutor in Texas also said on Thursday that a retired Air Force officer who stormed the Senate chamber dressed in military-style clothing and holding zip ties had intended to take hostages. The retired officer, Larry Rendell Brock, was arrested in Texas on Sunday on one count of unlawfully entering a restricted building and another of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, the Justice Department said at the time. He means to take hostages, the Texas prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Weimer, said on Thursday, The Associated Press reported. He means to kidnap, restrain, perhaps try, perhaps execute members of the U.S. government. The Justice Department has said that images from the Capitol siege appeared to show Mr. Brock wearing a green helmet, a tactical vest, a camouflage jacket and trousers holding zip ties that are used by law enforcement officers to restrain and/or detain subjects. But the A.P.
You can take the boy out of Yonkers, but you can't take Yonkers out of the boy.
There are also differences in approach. Pastors often want to work within the system to effect change, while many activists try to disturb and upend the system.
H. L. Mencken once wrote that his definition of happiness included a comfortable feeling of superiority to the masses of one's fellow men. And yet his quest to be exceptional didn't appear to make him all that happy. But does the compulsion to excel make anybody happy?
Sex might be easy, but relationships are hard. And a 400-page novel can teach you more about them than any X-rated clip. Fiction has time to draw a deeper picture, covering the getting-to-know-you stuff, the starts and stops and circling back that take boy and girl from first date to first kiss to the moment where they're both naked and hopefully into what's going to happen next.
There were, however, plenty of good reasons for not converting. Quite apart from the religious wrench of conversion, becoming a Catholic in Britain or the United States often prompted accusations of disloyalty to the nation, its Protestant heritage, even its sense of common decency. When Thomas Arnold (Matthew Arnold's brother) converted, his wife wrote a furious letter to Newman, accusing him of persuading her husband to ignore every social duty and become a pervert. She added, From the bottom of my heart I curse you for it. In 1848 the poet Christina Rossetti refused an offer of marriage from a young artist, James Collinson, because he had converted. She accepted him when he reverted to Anglicanism but canceled their wedding plans when he went over to Rome for a second time. Collinson's parents disowned him, and he was reduced to begging from his friends in the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.

This is no doubt my favorite place, to see four generations rise up and appreciate it, for the pageantry, the ambience, said Jackson, standing inside the stadium's broadcast booth before last Saturday's game against Penn State. Michigan has such grandiosity. It has all those all-Americans. You can't go anywhere without finding a Michigan graduate.
Labor force participation — the share of Americans either employed or actively looking for work — declined precipitously from the late 1990s, dropping to 62.7 percent in 2014 (its lowest rate since the Carter administration). Critics of President Obama liked to argue that this was because of government handouts. But there's a counterargument to be found in demographic trends — the Congressional Budget Office estimates that a sizable portion of the decline in labor-force participation is a result of the aging of the work force.
So Tom Bradby asks Meghan Markle —
It's an interesting dichotomy because I want to talk about Lyndon Johnson, then, in All The Way because he was blocked everywhere he went. It was different groups pulling at him at all sides. So what was your approach to figuring out his power?
The Girl Scouts of Greater New York announced this week that they were trying to get out of a 15-year lease in a Manhattan building owned by the Trump Organization. Meridith Maskara, chief executive of the Girl Scouts chapter, said it was a matter of very high priority.
California and Texas textbooks sometimes offer different explanations for white backlash to black advancement after the Civil War, from Reconstruction to housing discrimination in the 20th century.
The grassroots progressive Christian movement is center stage in Mr. Biden's Washington.

My question is this: Do I tell him that his behavior offends me and I wish to cut off contact, or do I simply decline invitations and cease sending gifts? Is one behavior more ethical than the other? Name Withheld
The scholars, artists and musicians I met over four days embodied that complexity. They all shared some version of the same story: of boundary crossing, first by their parents, then by themselves, in lives that unavoidably tested rigid racial assumptions and expectations. For all that, they seemed comfortable in their skins, and strikingly creative: A singer-songwriter, Kat McDowell, of New Zealand and Japan, trying to make it in Los Angeles. A pop and hip-hop trio, the Yano Brothers, who were born in Ghana, grew up in Japan, and rapped smoothly in Japanese. Tetsuro Miyazaki, a Belgian-Japanese photographer. Jeff Chiba Stearns, a Japanese-Canadian filmmaker whose documentaries include One Big Hapa Family.
Morgan Stanley said it was suspending all PAC contributions to members of Congress who did not vote to certify the results. Marriott said it would pause donations from its PAC to those who voted against certification of the election. And the chemicals giant Dow said it was suspending all PAC contributions to any member of Congress who voted to object to the certification of the presidential election.

But the display at the president's Jan. 10 round table, it turns out, had little to do with what happens along unfortified reaches of the border. An examination of the seized items suggests that a border wall would not have stopped most of the items from entering the United States, or, in the case of several weapons displayed in front of the president, from leaving the United States for Mexico.
KK: Do you think — speaking of allies, do you think Turkey is still an ally to the United States, and do you think the U.S. should have nuclear weapons there?
In a 2011 interview with Atlanta magazine, which noted that she had a cardboard cutout of President Barack Obama in her living room, she credited her father for her lifelong affiliation with the Democratic Party. I remember someone asked Daddy if he would ever think of voting for a Republican, she said, and he said, 'Sure I would, if I ever found one worth voting for.'
I disagree, very much, with the way that he went about it in a number of areas, but the basic principle was the right one, Mr. Blinken told senators last week, referring to Mr. Trump's approach toward China. And I think that's actually helpful to our foreign policy.
Prayer Break: Michael Dobbins (left) and Brian Bashista in an afternoon ritual.
Mr. Gillis was hired by Saturday Night Live last September, then dropped days later after clips surfaced showing him using slurs and language offensive toward Asian and L.G.B.T.Q. people, including one specifically about Mr. Yang. Mr. Yang later said the comedian should have had the chance to keep his job and explained: As a society, we have become unduly punitive and vindictive about people making statements that some find offensive or distasteful.
Mr. Gomes uses Dvorak's American String Quartet (No. 12 in F major, Op. 96) to tell a tale of social relations in small-town America. One man wants to leave (with suitcase) despite his powerful affection for the woman we may assume is his wife. Two pairs of male-female lovers spend time together, with one couple reaching the marriage ceremony as the ballet ends (veil, bouquet, trousseau, confetti); but one of these two men is keener on the other man than on his own girlfriend, and so sulks when his devotion is rejected.
A report released by PEN America in November found that more than 1,800 local print outlets have closed since 2004, and at least 200 counties have no newspaper.
More precisely, I lumbered, jogged, waddled and generally humiliated my way around a track as I tried — and failed — to keep up with the world's most exceptional race walker.
Robert Conrad, a television tough guy best known for his lead role in the mid-1960s series The Wild Wild West, died on Saturday at his home in Malibu, Calif. He was 84.
Mr. Yang has scored internet points with some tweets paying tribute to former 2020 Democratic rivals, for example by tweeting I miss Beto.
In their separate spheres, Davis and Crawford deal with the success of Baby Jane very differently. In real life, Davis did tons of publicity for the film (Sarandon re-creates Davis's appearance on the Andy Williams Show when, in a flowing, sky-blue dress, she sings a funky pop song called Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?). Crawford did very little publicity, despite Warner's warnings that this could hurt her come Oscars season. The reviews of Baby Jane focus mainly on Davis, causing Joan to toss down a newspaper in fury: It's like I wasn't even in the damn thing!
MARADI, Niger — He didn't hit her. He didn't yell. He didn't cheat, as far as she knows. It was just that, less than two years into their marriage, Zalika Amadou's husband had changed. He'd become far too neglectful and indifferent for a young woman who expected, well, more.
Blythe's postpartum experience is familiar, and Audrain renders it flawlessly. Breastfeeding isn't a spontanous success, for one thing; a nurse stood over us and stared at Violet and my huge brown nipple as she tried to latch again. Blythe struggles to adapt to motherhood and she sees seismic shifts in her relationship to her husband, Fox. Noticeably absent is any sense of joy or wonder. I was so disappointed she was mine, Blythe says of Violet. She admits to ignoring her baby's cries for hours on end.
The two spent some time together, and a couple of months later, they saw each other again at the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association world conference in Bangkok. While they felt a strong attraction at both gatherings, Ms. Hartman was up front with Ms. Michels about already having a partner, though that relationship was rocky. Their budding friendship remained platonic.
Colonel Tom, you know I love you and I'd never lie to you. But it seems your baby girl took her own life, sir. Yes she did. Yes she did.
So in your mind, there's not sufficient evidence to discount the possibility that Officer Rolfe felt his life was in danger, despite the distance, despite this state of the taser?
BlackRock's big move on climate change
No, I didn't touch her. I just made my notes and drew my stick-figure sketch, with professional care--like I was back in the rotation. The .22 lay upside down and almost on its side, propped against the chair leg. Before I left the room I turned off the light for a second with a gloved hand and there were her eyes still moist in the moonlight. Crime scenes you look at like cartoon puzzles in the newspapers. Spot the difference. And something was wrong. Jennifer's body was beautiful--you wouldn't dare pray for a body like that--but something was wrong with it. It was dead.
I really feel like I'm in love. I'm engaged, and I'm getting ready to get married.
There's also this: Telling kids the difficult or awkward truth is a great chance to impart values. I learned this from the sex educator Amy Lang, author of Birds + Bees + Your Kids. So when my very curious middle-schooler asked me if a certain slang term meant oral sex, instead of changing the topic or squirming out of answering, I was able to say, Yes, and … oral sex is a way that people like to be sexual without worrying about getting pregnant. It's part of a healthy sex life. But it's definitely not for kids. It's for later.
SS: O.K. Again, about your responsibilities as president. One of the heaviest ones would be waging war. When you look back on the conflicts into which recent presidents have put us, would you support this? Is this something you would have done in Syria, in Libya, in Kosovo? Would you have sent troops there?
The writer, a psychotherapist and sex therapist, is the author of For Better, for Worse, Forever: Discover the Path to Lasting Love.
But you can't do that. I mean, you can't, because you don't know. You haven't done time-distance. You don't know the time that it takes for a person to think, to squeeze the trigger. You don't know how much time it took him to draw his weapon. So I don't know how you can make any assumptions from that video. And if you're asking that, that's what you're asking for — assumptions, not facts.
BA: Your proposal is oddly regressive. On the benefits side you're proposing that people will have to choose between this benefit and their existing federal benefits while someone like me just all the sudden gets a new check in their mailbox every month. On the funding side you're relying on a VAT, which is an inherently regressive funding mechanism. You've proposed some offsets, but I still don't understand why you don't just embrace a progressive approach to taxation. Either raise top rates or a wealth tax. If there are people who need help, why aren't you trying to help them as much as possible?
Does that affect your income, this idea of Netflix started it by paying people up front and then moving on?
When read in order, the answers to the starred clues will reveal the ultimate 60 Across. (Those starred clues are 16-across, 36-across, 65-across, and 68-across.) During the party, I cryptically told Will (Yes, Will Shortz was at my wedding!) that I was counting on him for something but he'd have to figure out what it was. He nodded, grinned, and accepted my challenge. (None of my five test solvers had grokked this last layer, so I deemed it best to offer the prompt, even to the puzzle master himself).
The most powerful proponent of far-reaching changes, Gov. Gavin Newsom, is threatening a state takeover if the giant utility fails to reshape itself to his liking. With a key deadline approaching in PG&E's bankruptcy case, the question is whether he is prepared to follow through — and what consequences could follow.
Revelations about Mr. Weinstein's treatment of women in The New York Times and The New Yorker set in motion the global #MeToo movement, a public reckoning about the harassment endured by women for centuries. The prosecution's case largely hinges on the jury believing the women's accounts; there is no physical evidence to support the allegations.
And yet mystery — truly unfathomable and utterly ordinary — is at the center of this deceptively modest Manhattan Theater Club production, which originated in London and is directed with quiet care by Richard Eyre. I'm not referring to the classic suspense-making withholding of information that is usually a requisite of entertaining storytelling.
Other candidates have taken a different approach to creating a nest egg for low-income youth — Senator Booker, for example, favors baby bonds, which would provide every infant with a savings account that the government would contribute to annually depending on family income.
In the history of creative duos, John Ahearn and Rigoberto Torres may not have name recognition — or money — but they have longevity. For almost 40 years the two artists have collaborated on life casts, making them from the South Bronx to Taiwan and from Brazil to Puerto Rico. Creatively, they are like John Lennon and Paul McCartney, sharing credit on life-size sculptures of famous and obscure people. Temperamentally, Mr. Torres can be reticent to the point of being more like George Harrison, the quiet Beatle.
Your honor, she told the judge, I've never turned a trick in my life.
But marriage was also a necessity for our relationship's survival. When I moved to Paris with my sons, my lover's Tunisian passport made it nearly impossible for him to spend time with me here. We fixed our problem by flying to California and tying the knot.
In the many years since then, Mary Oliver's gentle insistence that we do not end up simply having visited this world became my touchstone. When scared, I did my best to stand up to the fear (I don't want to find myself sighing and frightened…).
How Two Pioneering Sisters Brought Medicine to Women and Women to Medicine
So if that's your problem and you break Facebook into Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, does that somehow make the kids stronger or healthier? No. If anything, it actually ratchets up the incentives to try and further their engagement.
I'm right at the age for a revival of La Cage.
Rebounding from this mortifyingly dumb opening proves less difficult for Stuart than for the movie, directed by Archie Borders. The film is yet another ode to the restorative magic of wine country sunshine, which apparently also has the power to expose the story's egregious midlife-crisis clichés.
They were and they weren't. Aftershocks knits together the author's own experiences with the histories of some of the places she has lived. She has seen poverty and suffering and civil wars, but always at a remove, while ensconced in the privileged bubble of expat life. She was in high school in Kampala, Uganda, when there was a string of grenade attacks in the city, but she doesn't remember feeling worried. What was the worst we could imagine while watching 'Melrose Place?' she writes. Her view of herself is exacting and remorseless. I did not fear for my life because I knew my life would be protected over the lives of others.
Mr. Yang, a former technology executive and entrepreneur, has distinguished himself from Senator Sanders and the far left of the Democratic Party in making the case for a more humane capitalist system, what he calls human-centered capitalism.
Among the first projects was a tool to improve the V.A.'s benefits claims process. Few of us, veterans or not, would report many satisfactory experiences filing claims anywhere, but trying to do that at the V.A. was on another level. Tens of thousands of veterans already wait longer than five years for a final appeals decision, and the V.A. continues to face rapid growth in its appeals workload. Some 80,000 veterans have appeals older than five years; 5,000 have appeals older than 10. The number of pending appeals climbed by 35 percent to more than 450,000 between 2012 and 2015 and is projected to soar to more than 2.2 million by the end of 2027 if there's no significant reform.
KK: Think you might be overly optimistic. Maybe we'll move on to foreign policy, if you don't mind?
The cause was a heart attack, said Leonardo Pavkovic, Mr. Holdsworth's former manager.
OK. Because it's kind of offensive.
Mr. Duncan is best known for his work in Washington, D.C., as the former general counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a conservative organization that defends religious liberty for all. He played a leading role in opposing the provision of the Affordable Care Act requiring employers to provide insurance coverage for contraceptives. Mr. Duncan also defended North Carolina's photo ID law that the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit wrote had targeted black voters with almost surgical precision. He also defended Louisiana's ban on gay marriage in several different courts before the Supreme Court prohibited state bans on gay marriage.
Not really, unless I set out specifically to do a self-portrait, which is almost never. As I've aged, my women have aged. In that sense I'm following my physical shift through time. Hair has gotten grayer, things are drooping more, waistlines are expanding.
In my grief, Rory made sure that I knew she was by my side, said Ms. Carryer, who graduated from Stanford and received three master's degrees: one in library science from the University of Illinois, another in fine arts from the University of Victoria and another, in education, from the University of California, Berkeley.
We should definitely do that, in a very big and dramatic way. And I have proposals to help move us toward a better model of high school education. Only 6 percent of American high school students are in technical, trade or apprenticeship tracks. In Germany, that's 59 percent. Think about that gulf. Meanwhile, there are millions of those trade and middle-scale jobs that are left unfilled. Why is this?
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's Future of Education and Skills 2030 project is exploring the ways education systems internationally need to change to prepare students for a rapidly automating economy.

I lit another cigarette. I don't drink anymore but man do I smoke. I said, I've known Jennifer Rockwell since she was eight years old.
And so then later he tells Bradby that he's also grown distant from his brother William.
MANCHESTER, N.H. — For months, he played the big-talking front-runner, swaggering if rarely steady, hoping voters would not linger long on the tautology of his premise: Joe Biden was the candidate who should win, he told fellow Democrats, because he was the candidate who could win.
Sometimes Anna has had to borrow: to buy the house; to replace the heating and air-conditioning, for which she still owes $500; and for new windows to reduce utility bills. The hardest lesson she's learned about money: Budget.
AH: I mean, I don't think most people had.
Mr. Yang has been the most vocal of all candidates about privacy issues. Tristan Harris, whom he has alluded to in discussing the Department of the Attention Economy, spent three years as a Google design ethicist. He left to found the Center for Humane Technology, a nonprofit that seeks to address the digital attention crisis.
archived recording 1 And I got some breaking news. And it is about Harry and Meghan and a statement — archived recording 2 In a statement, they said, We have chosen to carve out a progressive, new role within this institution. archived recording 3 We intend to, and here is the key bit — step back as senior members of the royal family — archived recording 4 — and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty, the Queen. I mean, it's virtually a letter of resignation, isn't it? archived recording 5 Harry and Meghan didn't consult with any of their relatives before releasing that statement, meaning even their closest family members had no idea how this was going to work. archived recording 6 Buckingham Palace is now in crisis after it was blindsided by Prince Harry and wife Meghan's announcement.
Civil rights groups, however, said the program risked disenfranchising millions of people who already face systemic challenges getting the documents required to obtain biometric ID cards. To enroll, adults had to provide a national identity card, and birth certificates for those under 18.
Personally, I don't really focus on making money. I have more money than I ever thought I would have. It's certainly not what motivates me to work. But I don't want to sound flippant because money is important, and it's great. I have been very, very poor in my life, and it's not as good as being wealthy.
(It is customary for family members or friends to pay for a seminarian's gold or silver chalice, the cup in which wine and water are believed to be transformed into Christ's blood, and whose essential role in a priest's life is likened to a doctor's stethoscope.)
Republicans are scrambling to determine the political consequences of doing so, and whether they would pay a steeper political price for breaking with the president or for failing to. Senate Republicans are facing just such a dilemma as they contemplate how to vote in an impeachment trial that could start as early as next week. Both Representatives Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the minority whip, voted against impeaching Mr. Trump, though Mr. McCarthy said the president bore responsibility for the siege and deserved a censure. Ms. Cheney, by contrast, had issued a scathing statement the day before the impeachment vote in which she said: There has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution. But she chose not to speak during debate on the House floor. Many Democrats — who have long reviled her and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney — quoted her approvingly in their own speeches.
What I realized early on, when you're in school and someone humiliates themselves or trips and falls or is embarrassed publicly, your age doesn't permit you to be mature enough to really embrace that person. Instead, you want to distance yourself and laugh and like, oh, I'm glad I'm not that idiot who just fell down or whatever. But once people mature — and I think that's college and above — and you see someone in a vulnerable situation or embarrassed or humiliated, the great thing about human beings is that they don't feel they want to point the finger. They don't want to separate. What they feel is they want to embrace that person. They want to protect that person. And it's a really lovely human trait. Well, if you can understand that and put that layer of vulnerability in your characters, that will happen to an audience, viscerally, when they sense that. They will emotionally wrap their arms around the character. And so I look for those opportunities to develop sympathies from the audience by way of vulnerability.
Vicki Lansky, a best-selling author who dispensed recipes and practical advice that helped a generation of parents cope with child-rearing challenges and housekeeping, from cradle cap to divorce, died on Jan. 15 at her home in Plymouth, Minn. She was 75.
My husband had to confront the alienation of his Tunisian family, who refused to acknowledge my existence, even after our wedding. Yes, we had fallen deeply in love, but choosing to marry was also an act of rebellion for each of us, a rejection of what society and friends and family expected. It felt like setting out into uncharted territory. It was exhilarating.
'THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS' at Village East Cinema (May 31, 7 p.m.). The Magnificent Ambersons, Orson Welles's 1942 feature — his second, after Citizen Kane — is one of the most crushing stories in cinema: not because of the movie itself, though it's extraordinarily moving, but because the studio lopped off Welles's original ending and shot a rushed, unconvincing coda. Even an untrained eye can spot the moment when the visual pizazz (courtesy of the cinematographer Stanley Cortez) suddenly stops. The missing footage, if ever located, would be an archivist's holy grail. And despite being compromised, Welles's adaptation of the Booth Tarkington novel routinely ranks among the greatest movies ever made. The moment when Tim Holt's character gets his just deserts (George Amberson Minafer had got his comeuppance. He'd got it three times filled and running over) features some of Welles's best voice-over work.
SS: O.K. Again, about your responsibilities as president. One of the heaviest ones would be waging war. When you look back on the conflicts into which recent presidents have put us, would you support this? Is this something you would have done in Syria, in Libya, in Kosovo? Would you have sent troops there?
While most marriage stories are concerned with the first flush of wedded life, Nissen's new novel, set during the 2004 Bush-Kerry election, skips straight to the end. From the moment I saw Lucius Bocelli, the first sentence reads, I wanted to go to bed with him. One problem: The narrator, 50-year-old Phillipa Maakestad, is already married. Since its origins, the novel has been a form well suited to adultery narratives, but despite Phillipa's insistence that she and Lucius are destined for each other — Lucius and I collided like a force of nature — their affair takes up relatively little space in the book and feels curiously secondary. In fact, the driving passion of this novel is not love or desire, but hatred: Phillipa's powerful loathing for her elderly mother-in-law, Bernadette.
And that's probably a generous response. Some of the responses would be worse than that. So if you get the boot off people's throats, then you can start making progress on our health, on our educational outcomes, on our political polarization.
We would not have Trump as president if the Democrats had remained the party of the working class. The decline of labor unions proceeded at the same rate when Democrats were president as when Republicans were president; the same is, I believe, true of loss of manufacturing jobs as plants moved overseas.
Mr. Trump canceled a planned news conference at a NATO gathering in December after a video circulated that showed world leaders including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Emmanuel Macron of France in what appeared to be a conversation mocking Mr. Trump.
Pearson said in a written statement that the differences between the books could be attributed mostly to the fact that the California book was published several years later, and that concerns over coastal flooding have become more heightened in recent years.
When a neighbor hands Alice a bundle of unsent letters written by Nellie to Nellie's mother, the mystery begins in earnest, and it turns out Nellie has a lot more to teach Alice about being a wife and a woman than how to bake a good batch of cookies. The most important? Take those trappings you resent so much — cooking, gardening, bearing children — embrace them, then wield them like weapons.
When I describe some of the multiple roads we must take if we are to maximize our chances for survival, I think of a variation of the old story of the rabbinical judge who, after hearing a wife's complaints about her husband, says, My daughter, you are right, and, after hearing the husband's complaints, says, My son, you are right. When his student observes, Rabbi, they can't both be right, he replies, My son, you are right. Under my variation, the rabbi responds to his student, No, you are wrong. They can both be right. To the differing and sometimes inconsistent approaches to Jewish survival, I would say, You may all be right. Don't you dare tell each other that you are wrong. Nobody has a monopoly on the truth about the Jewish future. Everything that may work must be tried.
On Thursday night, audiences were also introduced to some of Mr. Kelly's former employees, including Lindsey Perryman-Dunn. She said that she did not believe the waves of allegations against him, even though she had seen the videotape at the center of his 2008 child pornography trial and believed it showed him having sex with an underage girl.
Yes, too soon, his friends said. (But it was funny.)
We analyzed some of the most popular social studies textbooks used in California and Texas. Here's how political divides shape what students learn about the nation's history.
In both novels, Offill's fragmentary structure evokes an unbearable emotional intensity: something at the core of the story that cannot be narrated directly, by straight chronology, because to do so would be like looking at the sun. In Dept. of Speculation, that white-hot core was the heartbreak of domestic collapse. In Weather, the collapse exists on a scale at once broader and more abstract: the end of the world itself. The thing that cannot be stared at directly is not the sun, but our own doomed planet.
In the months that followed, he made other radio speeches and worded actively with other antiwar personalities in public and private life, including Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana; Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia; former President Herbert Hoover; Senator William Borah of Idaho; Henry Ford; Merwin K. Hart, an avowed right-winger; William Castle, a diplomat; Dean Carl Ackerman of the Columbia Journalism School; Theodore Roosevelt Jr.; and James E. Van Zandt, head of the American Legion. Lindbergh spoke and worked under his own auspices until April, 1941, when he joined the national board of the America First Committee, the country's principal antiwar group. Although its membership was heterogeneous, its effective leadership rested with Robert E. Wood, board chairman of Sears, Roebuck & Co., and Robert R. McCormick, publisher of The Chicago Tribune. Both were archconservatives and zealous haters of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. America First was strongest in the Midwest, the traditional seat of the nation's isolationist attitudes; but it was also a powerful force in New York and Boston. Popular support for its antiwar objectives was widespread, and Lindbergh epitomized that support. He rallied millions to the cause with such effectiveness that Roosevelt considered him a major threat. The President vented his anger at a news conference in April, 1941. Roosevelt was asked why he did not call Lindbergh, an Army officer, into uniform.
But as Duncan Ryuken Williams, a professor of religion and East Asian languages and cultures at the University of Southern California, who organized the festival, explained, it's more complicated than that, a subject worthy of deep — and optimistic — exploration. The festival coincided with a conference at the University of Southern California on critical mixed-race studies, and the publication of Hapa Japan, a two-part volume of essays that Professor Williams edited.
So if that's your problem, you have to go and try and solve it directly by getting into the guts of the apps and say, What are the design choices you made? Let's calibrate them so they actually balance our kids' health and not just your financial returns. So that's one way she's missing the point.
But for Ms. Amadou, who married at 16, simply having a husband was not enough. She never wanted to depend on a man in the first place. So, on a busy morning in Maradi, Niger, she sat in front of a judge at a crowded Islamic court on the sidewalk and asked for what young women across the region are seeking like never before: a divorce.
'THE GOVERNMENT INSPECTOR' at the Duke on 42nd Street (in previews; opens on June 1). Anyone panicked by the current political reality can escape into an arguably more problematic one. This Red Bull production of Jeffrey Hatcher's adaptation of a Gogol masterpiece stars Michael Urie as a man who thrusts a small town into paroxysms of anxiety and bribery. Jesse Berger directs a cast including Mary Testa, Arnie Burton, Stephen DeRosa and Michael McGrath.
Slowly but surely, Germany has played catch-up with Weill's music — in particular through the Kurt Weill Festival in Dessau, currently celebrating its 25th anniversary. The festival, which ends this year on Sunday, March 12, began as a fantasy and has since grown into a microcosm of the work Germany has done to restore the legacy of a musical hero.
I'm a little worried that there's going to be too much content. And by having too much content, the bar of high-end storytelling will be dropped because they need more product on these platforms. Yeah, they'll just say, that's good. Bring it in. We need it, we need it, we need it. Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on. On the other side, that kind of thirst for product gives unproven writers or new writers a chance to shine. And there will be exceptional writers that will come out of that. And like my experience on a soap opera, they will say, well, I'm doing this kid's series on Disney+. And it's not tremendously challenging, but man, it started my career. I think what you'll see is the further erosion of broadcast television and the platform scenario, that when you turn on a television, it'll all be just platform. It'll be like, you have to go to Warner Media. And then you go, oh, let's go to HBO.
For pastors like Bishop Blake, that means embracing the parts of the movement he agrees with — ending police violence and empowering black entrepreneurs, for instance. But it also means holding the line on church teachings that young activists disagree with.
I suppose this was inevitable in the age of Donald Trump. Before his election, I had a wariness about racism that was abstract and low key; it noted things, like being the only black person in an E.R., but it was chiefly interested in gathering information, reflecting, analyzing. Now, that racial awareness has become visceral and overstimulated. When something racially questionable happens, I tend to leap immediately to anger. This happens even when I know distinctly I shouldn't leap. But it doesn't matter.
Aisha Harris: Back in September, you actually spoke out on behalf of the comedian Shane Gillis, who had been hired on SNL and then was quickly fired after some racist comments were stirred up that he had made in the past on one of his podcasts. And you said you didn't want to be judged for something you had done 25 years ago. But Gillis's comments were maybe a year ago. So I'm curious as to, in your mind, how long of a period of time should it be before someone faces some sort of consequences for something they've done in the past?
JW: And let me just, one last follow-up on that. If Democrats don't take back the Senate, how do you feel with the Supreme Court — how do you, I mean, put aside expanding the number of justices, how do you even get a justice onto the court in the first place?
The reaction to the A.P.A. guidelines — largely but not exclusively from the political center and right and much of it critical — was swift. Even Gillette has joined the debate with its new television commercial, We Believe: The Best Man Can Be, a critique of toxic masculinity:
I have family in Hong Kong. I spent a semester there in college, and so when I see those streets wracked with riots and violence, I actually remember being on those streets. And so it's incredibly jarring, and it's an extraordinary situation because of Hong Kong's status as this semiautonomous region that's being reintegrated back into China.
In my 10 years in Iran researching the Revolutionary Guards and their depiction in Iranian media, one of my key observations was that wherever they operate, in Iran or on foreign battlefields, they function with that same ad hoc leadership: Decisions and actions don't just come from one man or even a small group of men; many within the organization have experience building relationships, creating strategies and making decisions.
I said, Colonel Tom? Miriam? But Miriam was already falling away and fading from my sight. Falling away at thirty-two feet per second squared. You lost your daughter on this day. You lost your Jennifer.
Experts say the slowdown is rooted in several trends, including the rise of women in the work force who are educated and don't see marriage as necessary to achieving financial security, at least for themselves. For Chinese couples, many cannot afford to have children as living costs increase and their jobs demand more time and energy. And attitudes have shifted.
MR. DAWSON Did you have a gun?
After 14 years of a marriage, Warren Clark, who worked in the shipping and airline industries, died of a heart attack in 1964, when Ms. Higgins Clark was 37. Soon she was looking for a job again, but she did not abandon her fiction writing. She rose before dawn to churn out pages while her children slept, then car-pooled to Manhattan to work at the Gordon R. Tavistock advertising agency.
A progressive tax is one in which the rate increases with income, while a regressive tax increases inversely with income.
This new orientation was reflected in The Time of the Crack and the two novels that followed, The Last of the Country House Murders (1974) and Hotel de Dream (1976).
Today the clauses are widespread in sports, television and advertising. Religious publishers have used them for at least 15 years, which seems fair enough. You can't condemn a Christian publisher that cancels publication of a book called The Ridiculously Good Marriage after the author is accused of having sexually assaulted an underage girl when he was a youth pastor. (He apologized for a sexual incident.) Children's publishers have been including the clauses for a decade or more, and they, too, have a case. It would be challenging to sell a children's book written by a pedophile.
After the Murder of Albert Lima
Christine McGuire, the eldest of the singing McGuire Sisters, who struck gold on the pop charts in the 1950s with Sincerely, Sugartime and other close-harmony hits that won young American hearts not quite ready for rock ′n' roll, died on Dec. 28 at her home in Las Vegas. She was 92.
These portraits already suggest the outlines of Proust's extraordinary personality. He was attentive to his friends to the point of seeming a flatterer, though he thought friendship was valueless and conversation represented the death of the mind, since he believed only passion and suffering could sharpen the powers of observation and the only word of any value was the written. He could stare transfixed at a rose--or at anything else or anyone who was on his peculiar wavelength--but though he read everything and was deeply cultivated, he had little interest in disembodied ideas. He wasn't an intellectual, though he was supremely intelligent. He applied his attention to flowers and people and paintings, but not to theories about botany nor to psychology nor aesthetics. He never read a word of Freud, for instance (nor did Freud ever read a word of Proust). He was hilariously funny and entertaining, but he emanated a calm spirituality except, perhaps, when he was doubled up with a crazy bout of laughter (his famous choking fit of hilarity, his fou rire, which could go on so long it struck strangers as weird, even slightly mad). He was such a presence that many people spoke of him as tall, but in fact he stood just five feet six inches.
Critical language about nonwhite cultural movements also appears in a Texas book from McGraw-Hill. It is partly a result of debates, in 2010, between conservative and liberal members of the Texas Board of Education over whether state standards should mention cultural movements like hip-hop and country music. Their compromise was to ask teachers and textbook publishers to address both the positive and negative impacts of artistic movements.
I grew up in an entirely secular household. My parents did not talk about God in the house, but I had this instinctive belief in a higher power. I had many Christian relatives. I went to church over holidays growing up quite often. And then I married my wife, Evelyn, who's Christian. And so, we're raising our kids in a Christian church. I go to church when I'm home, which is not very often unfortunately nowadays. I enjoy it. My faith is still very much a journey, but I'm unreservedly thrilled about the impact it has on my wife, my boys, my family, my community.
But PG&E has to emerge from bankruptcy by June 30 — on terms acceptable to the governor — in order to take part in a new $20 billion state fund designed to shield large utilities from large wildfire claims. Without that protection, PG&E's restructuring plan would fall apart and its viability would be in question.
archived recording (gordon sondland) Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing the investigations of the 2016 election, D.N.C. server, and Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the president of the United States. And we knew these investigations were important to the president.

In hindsight, this was not an accurate assessment of the next question.
They would say: 'Unless you ask us not to come, we'll be there,' Ms. Chau said. Even Hong Kong's strict quarantine protocol, a mandatory period of three weeks of isolation in a government designed hotel, didn't dissuade them.
If you want to solve the hyperacquisition problem, which is a problem, then you have to go in and say, Look, you have to not acquire businesses that are in your space with these criteria. That would be a legitimate stance to take, because right now the business model in Silicon Valley is not to try and outcompete the behemoth. It's just to get bought by them. If you get to a point where they'll offer you $1 billion and you win, your investors win, you're rich and then these get folded in, and it doesn't even matter what they do with your business at that point.
Below: an incomplete account of the material trappings of Undine's costly lifestyle, in which several experts estimate, to the best of their abilities, how much various items may have cost. Though there are a number of clues in The Custom of the Country as to the precise years in which the novel takes place, we settled on 1908 as our point of comparison, which was the year Edith Wharton began writing the novel in earnest.
KK: And, who has broken your heart?
Yes. I have three major pro-journalism proposals on my website, including federally funding journalists for every congressional district, billions of dollars in grants to help transition local journalism. Matching grants, so you're not like saying, Hey, we're going to do this. But matching grants to help transition them to cooperative models of ownership to nonprofit and philanthropic models.
HARKNESS DANCE FESTIVAL at the 92nd Street Y (March 24, 8 p.m.; March 25, 4 and 8 p.m.). The festival winds down with Jillian Peña's latest evening-length work, The Natural Order, which explores what it means to be a part of a group, namely one whose members — Alexandra Albrecht, Leigh Lotocki, Jocelyn Tobias and Madeline Wilcox — strive to embrace both magic and the power of dance. (Aren't they one and the same?) Here, Ms. Peña, known for her use of repetition and mirrored bodies, examines how individuals navigate relationships.
I've always sort of wondered what I wasn't getting about Little Women.

What the conversations are becoming are more of, more of digging down in our personal being to decide is, did we do this job for the right reason or the wrong reason?
Booking.com, one of the world's largest accommodations booking sites, surveyed 21,500 travelers this summer about their dream trips, and 40 percent reported that they wanted to take or had actually taken a trip based on the results of home DNA tests.
Democrats and progressives will be so thrilled to have defeated Donald Trump, they will love the fact that we're going to put buying power into families' hands, make children stronger and healthier. But here's the great thing: The Republicans will look up and say, Wait a minute, do I hate the Freedom Dividend? And they look up, and they notice only one state's had a dividend for almost 40 years, and it's Alaska, a deep red conservative state, that was passed by a Republican governor.
Here's one example: On this annotated Bill of Rights, a California textbook explains that rulings on the Second Amendment have allowed for some gun regulations.

The Scarecrow role still is there, you know. You could redefine it. We've forgotten about Ray Bolger.
In the chaos, the past comes rushing into the present. Out tumbles a box in which Aldo had kept photos of Lidia, and the letter from Vanda that opens the novel. He thinks back to that fraught time, to the day he told his wife he was leaving. I tried to explain that it wasn't a matter of betrayal, that I had enormous respect for her, that real betrayal was when you betrayed your own instinct, your needs, your body, yourself, Aldo recalls, but Vanda, raging and cursing, would have none of it. She shrieked, but then immediately she contained herself so as not to wake the children.
Fans who find their way back will be rewarded with another elaborate story line, across 12 episodes, tied to the tortured relationship between Ciro (Marco D'Amore) and Genny (Salvatore Esposito), whose bond endures even though Ciro pumped Genny full of lead at the end of Season 1. They join forces once again and find themselves being den mothers to a hungry young gang at the bottom of the criminal pecking order in Naples, a circumstance that jibes with the show's penchants for junk-strewn locations and ragged formations of motorcycles.
What are the true threats of the 21st century? Climate change is number one, and then cybersecurity and A.I., loose nuclear material, military drones in the hands of nonstate actors. It's very hard to secure a location from something the size of a flying vacuum cleaner. That's very, very difficult. So we're entering an era where it's going to be much easier to be offensive than defensive, and you don't need massive levels of resources to cause significant levels of damage. To me, a new aircraft carrier does not make our elections any more secure from Russian hacking, which is the most direct threat to our democracy upcoming in this cycle. We're spending money on the threats of the 20th century, and we need to try and modernize our approach as quickly as possible.
A working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that U.B.I. could redirect spending to more affluent and middle-income families, therefore leaving low-income families worse off; a U.B.I. large enough to direct more funds to low-income households would be extremely costly. Read the paper here.
Harry Joseph Brant, a founding member of the next-generation jet set and a new-look It boy, was found dead on Sunday at age 24. The cause was an accidental drug overdose of prescription drugs, his family said. He had struggled with addiction for several years.
officer convicted of illegally disclosing classified information, and agreed to a $50,000 bonus if the president granted it, according to a copy of an agreement. And Mr. Kiriakou was separately told that Mr. Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani could help him secure a pardon for $2 million. Mr. Kiriakou rejected the offer, but an associate, fearing that Mr. Giuliani was illegally selling pardons, alerted the F.B.I. Mr. Giuliani challenged this characterization. After Mr. Trump's impeachment for inciting his supporters before the deadly riot at the Capitol, and with Republican leaders turning on him, the pardon power remains one of the last and most likely outlets for quick unilateral action by an increasingly isolated, erratic president. He has suggested to aides he wants to take the extraordinary and unprecedented step of pardoning himself, though it was not clear whether he had broached the topic since the rampage. He has also discussed issuing pre-emptive pardons to his children, his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, and Mr. Giuliani. A White House spokesman declined to comment. Michael S. Schmidt and
This is how you do it. You kind of wheel around slowly into the scene. Periphery first. Body last. I mean, I knew where she was. My radar went to the bed but she had done it on a chair. In the corner, to my right. Otherwise: Curtains half-drawn against the moonlight, orderly dressing table, tousled sheets, and a faint smell of lust. At her feet, an old black-stained pillowcase and a squirt can of 303.
It very much is. But if you were to apply resources, you would want to apply resources in ways that don't necessarily advantage the top third of your population by educational attainment exclusively. You would be trying to build more paths with the other two-thirds, which investing in trades and apprenticeships would do, and you would try and provide for the people who are the weakest and most vulnerable in the job market, which are not going to be the people that are attending college.
KK: Do you believe in government subsidies for journalism?
Well, the one thing I know for sure is that human beings love being told a story. And whether you're two or 102, you want to be told a story. You want to be taken away.
She voted for Hillary Clinton because she objected to President Trump's proposed border wall and his characterizations of immigrants. I can't say that I would have voted for her just because of the economy, Anna said.
The death was confirmed by her son Morgan Englund, who did not give a cause.
So this is the carrot and the stick. So imagine if you had data standards that were endorsed by the U.S., the E.U., and Japan, and it had certain technology protocols associated with it. Then China said, Hey, I don't want to adhere to that. Because like you said, they like to hoard data, and one of the reasons why they're in position to leapfrog us is they have more data than we do and they have essentially nonexistent privacy rights or regulations. They have complete surveillance. That's one reason why they've banned masks in Hong Kong, so that their surveillance technology can pick up who the protesters are. So China has its own vast hoard of data.
The reason I am drawing, in some polls, 10 percent or more of Donald Trump voters to my campaign is that Republicans and conservatives do not hate economic buying power in citizens' hands. What they hate is a giant bureaucracy making everyone's decisions. So you ask what my main priority will be as president, it will be to get the Freedom Dividend across the finish line and get buying power into Americans' hands, which will then lead us to be able to solve many other problems much more quickly.
is that repressing emotions is bad and expressing them is good — a folk theory with roots in romanticism, Freudian psychoanalysis, and Hollywood, but which is contradicted by a large literature showing that people with greater self-control, particularly those who repress anger rather than venting, lead healthier lives: they get better grades, have fewer eating disorders, drink less, have fewer psychosomatic aches and pains, are less depressed, anxious, phobic, and paranoid, have higher self-esteem, are more conscientious, have better relationships with their families, have more stable friendships, are less likely to have sex they regretted, are less likely to imagine themselves cheating in a monogamous relationship.

Harris Wofford, a former United States senator from Pennsylvania whose passion for getting people involved helped create John F. Kennedy's Peace Corps, Bill Clinton's AmeriCorps and other service organizations and made him America's volunteer in chief, died on Monday night in Washington. He was 92.
For these reasons, it helps to have a guy at the top of a 501(c)(3) who both knows business and has the chutzpah to march up to an Oscar-winning actress at the dog run to ask if she'll come to a benefit. Which is exactly what Mr. Kratz did with Jennifer Connelly in Brooklyn in 2010, after which she became a fixture at his events.
Everyone knows my flagship proposal is this Freedom Dividend of $1,000 a month for every American adult, which is not a new idea. And it's not my idea. Thomas Paine was for it at the founding of the country. Martin Luther King fought for it and was fighting for it when he was assassinated. So after I'm the nominee and I defeat Donald Trump, everyone will know that I'm in the White House because of the Freedom Dividend.

or the seminarians at Mount Saint Mary's, there is little question about what will ultimately happen. We already know the end of the story, Bashista says. God will triumph. The church will triumph. That doesn't mean that the present trials aren't there. Think of fourth-century Aryanism, when two-thirds of the church, including bishops, didn't believe that Jesus was God! But the threats will never succeed. The essentials will never change. How do we know that? Because Christ said so. Still, they admit, the sheer magnitude of what they're up against in their wish to transform a largely indifferent world can be crushing at times. I always think of 'Cliffhanger,' says Magat, referring to the Sylvester Stallone thriller. They have to climb up the cliff with no ropes, going backward. That is our life. There's a lot of skepticism out there, a lot of cynicism. The easiest thing is to say, Forget it, this is not my responsibility. Let someone else do it. And I think that's what a lot of guys are saying when they don't answer the call to the priesthood. Bashista keeps a folder titled Thanks Be to God, in which he places any cards or letters he receives describing the impact he has had on people's lives. When he mentioned the folder to the others at the diner that winter night, each admitted that he, too, was amassing a similar file. There may come a day when I say, Was this all worth it? Holloway explained, as dessert was cleared away.
Diane is problematic, though. Ms. George (The (Curious Case of the) Watson Intelligence) describes her in a stage direction as a butch charm factory, and charisma is as vital to the success of Diane's mission as it is to the success of the play. She needs to get the women in her thrall and seduce the audience as well.
A Jew today can live in any neighborhood, even those that were formerly restricted. Jews live alongside white Anglo-Saxon Protestants in the most exclusive neighborhoods throughout the country--Grosse Pointe, Greenwich, Fifth Avenue, Beacon Hill. And they have been welcomed into the best families, including the Roosevelts, Kennedys, Cuomos, and Rockefellers. Economically, socially, and politically, we have become the new WASPs, as a perusal of the sponsor list of any major charitable or cultural event will show. Indeed, terms such as J.A.S.P. (Jewish Anglo-Saxon Protestant) and W.A.S.H. (White Anglo-Saxon Hebrew) have become current in some circles to denote the full social acceptance that Jews increasingly enjoy.
If Herzl's and Sartre's entirely negative view of the reason for Jewish survival were to persist even as we enter this new era of equality and acceptance, then Judaism would not deserve to endure. If Jewish life cannot thrive in an open environment of opportunity, choice, freethinking, affluence, success, and first-class status--if we really do need tsuris, czars, pogroms, poverty, insularity, closed minds, and anti-Semitism to keep us Jewish--then Jewish life as we know it will not, and should not, survive the first half of the twenty-first century. We have been persecuted long enough. The time has come to welcome the end of our victimization without fear that it will mean the end of our existence as a people. We must no longer pray for the czar's victory out of fear that the end of our collective tsuris and the success of individual Jews will mean the failure of Judaism.

The question is, what is the means to creating those jobs? What I'm suggesting is that if you were to put $12,000 a year into the hands of every American adult … Let's say there's a town in Missouri of 10,000 people. Let's say after I'm president, their disposable income goes up by $10 million a month. Where is that money going to go? It's going to go into car repairs, day care expenses, Little League sign-ups, the occasional night out.
Meanwhile, the development of a Catholic ghetto, especially in the United States, with its own set of self-segregating schools, colleges, and journals, made ignoring the Catholics easier than if they had been forcing their attention upon their antagonists from adjoining offices. Non-Catholics rarely investigated the work of intellectuals in the Catholic Church unless they were searching for polemical ammunition.

Our youth, our drive, our diversity and openness, our boundless capacity for risk and reinvention means that the future should be ours. But that potential will only be realized if our democracy works. Only if our politics better reflects the decency of our people.

Mr. Little submitted the manuscript for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to 12 publishers. He received 12 rejections in response, before selling it for £2,500, or about $3,400 (the equivalent of about $5,800 today). It was a meager amount, but his genius was in the details: He sold only the rights to publish it in Britain and the Commonwealth, and he asked for high royalties.

The blueprint of executive action comes after Mr. Biden announced that he will push Congress to pass a $1.9 trillion package of economic stimulus and pandemic relief, signaling a willingness to be aggressive on policy issues and confronting Republicans from the start to take their lead from him. He also plans to send sweeping immigration legislation on his first day in office, providing a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people living in the country illegally. Along with his promise to vaccinate 100 million Americans for the coronavirus in his first 100 days, it is an expansive set of priorities for a new president that could be a defining test of his deal-making abilities and command of the federal government.

Although she had begun pitching her first short stories to confession magazines when she was 16, Ms. Higgins Clark endured a rain of rejection slips for the next several years before she sold her first story, Stowaway, to Extension magazine in 1956. By then she had three children: Marilyn, Warren Jr. and David. The fourth, born in 1956, was named Carol for a character in that story. The youngest, Patricia, was born in 1958.
In Under the Eiffel Tower, Stuart (Matt Walsh), an American bourbon expert fired for a lack of passion, likens his existence to the lives of quiet desperation described by Thoreau. Desperation seems too mild. When a friend (David Wain) invites Stuart to come along with him, his wife (Michaela Watkins) and their daughter (Dylan Gelula) on a French vacation, the trip has barely started before Stuart proposes marriage to the daughter — who is maybe half his age — at the base of the Eiffel Tower. And that's before the title card.

American Jewish life is in danger of disappearing, just as most American Jews have achieved everything we ever wanted: acceptance, influence, affluence, equality. As the result of skyrocketing rates of intermarriage and assimilation, as well as the lowest birth rate of any religious or ethnic community in the United States, the era of enormous Jewish influence on American life may soon be coming to an end. Although Jews make up just over 2 percent of the population of the United States--approximately 5.5 million out of 262 million--many Americans mistakenly believe that we constitute a full 20 percent of the American people, because of our disproportionate visibility, influence, and accomplishments. But our numbers may soon be reduced to the point where our impact on American life will necessarily become marginalized. One Harvard study predicts that if current demographic trends continue, the American Jewish community is likely to number less than 1 million and conceivably as few as 10,000 by the time the United States celebrates its tricentennial in 2076. Other projections suggest that early in the next century, American Jewish life as we know it will be a shadow of its current, vibrant self--consisting primarily of isolated pockets of ultra-Orthodox Hasidim.
distributed guidance to its field offices that says agents may nominate someone to be considered a known or suspected terrorist if they have particular negative information to support their suspicions, like an allegation that the suspect has terrorism ties that is corroborated by at least one other source. But mere guesses or hunches, the bureau said at the time, are not enough. The Terrorism Screening Database is maintained by the F.B.I. 's Terrorist Screening Center. Some of the data used by the Terrorist Screening Center comes from a larger database maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center, an interagency clearinghouse for intelligence about potential terrorist threats. Being on the watch list can restrict people from entering the country, deny them government benefits or contracts, and subject them to greater scrutiny at airports and by the police. A subset of the people on the watch list are also placed on the so-called no-fly list, which bars them from being aboard planes in American airspace. The vast majority of people included in the database are foreigners abroad, but some are American citizens or lawful permanent residents. Court records suggest that in 2017, the F.B.I. 's Terrorism Screening Database had about 1.2 million people in it, including about 4,600 such American or green-card holders. The government has said a broader database of terrorism suspects called the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment had about 1.6 million names in it, of which about 16,000 were Americans.

So you definitely need to bring the tech companies to heel and say, Look, here are the list of problems we're concerned about. But the solution to the abuse of power is not to say like, Hey, we're just going to try and keep anyone in the country from having the ability to do wrong. What you have to do is you have to figure out what the abuses you're concerned about are, and then actually address them directly.
LONDON — Lawmakers on the island of Jersey have approved scrapping a decades-old law that prevented married women from talking to the tax authorities without the permission of their husband or filing taxes under their own names, a mechanism described by a local senator as archaic.

Mr. Constantin, who was living in Istanbul at the time, was oblivious to all of this. When the authorities detained him, he was told that his case was classified and that he would never be allowed to return to Turkey. It was only upon landing in the Romanian capital after 26 days in Turkish detention that he was told he was legally dead.
So the Shane Gillis opinion was not based upon the timeline, it was just based upon my reaction as a person, and the person that was directly named. I certainly think there should be consequences for one's statements and actions, and I certainly think that obviously he made the statements within the year, and that if you did have some sort of time frame when you would want to overlook something, it would be much longer than a year.
For the first time since 1959, in other words, Cuba is ruled by someone other than a Castro, and it has handled the transition without the drama or bloodshed that many other revolutionary states have experienced after the death of their patriarchs.
LK: Speaking of women, I wanted to ask you about reproductive rights as well. You told some of our colleagues in the newsroom that you would consider some executive actions to protect reproductive rights, but I haven't seen any details about what actions you're considering. Do you have any details to share with us about that?
Yes. All of this is a prelude to say that, should some of the tech companies be asked to divest parts of their businesses? One hundred percent yes. Like Amazon should not be selling its own house brand to its advantage to other goods. These companies do have excessive power and influence. At this point you could argue they control our democracy.
Bill Clinton's presidency marked the end of discrimination against Jews in the upper echelons of government. For the first time in American history, the fact that an aspirant for high appointive office was a Jew became irrelevant in his or her selection. President Clinton--our first president who grew up in an age when anti-Semitism was unacceptable--selected several Jewish cabinet members, two Jewish Supreme Court justices, numerous Jewish ambassadors and other high-level executive and judicial officials. Nor, apparently, was Jewishness a bar to election to the United States Congress, which has ten Jewish senators and more than two dozen Jewish representatives, several from states with tiny Jewish populations. Though we have still not had a Jew at the top of either party's ticket, it is fair to say that in today's America, a Jew can aspire to any office, any job, and any social status.
KK: Yeah, that's literally our question.
Yes. I would say probably so. Could somebody, because of their upbringing and how they've lived their life and everything, subconsciously do that? Yeah. And the main reason that I would have to say yes is, when you're in a stressful situation, technically, you don't think. Your subconscious takes over, and you react. When a law enforcement officer has their training that they go through, you know, you try to just train that if you're going to be in a stressful situation, that your training is going to take over — not your thought process. So with that being said, your subconscious — if you've trained yourself over your years of living a certain way, and maybe you've, I don't know, suppressed those because it's not societally acceptable, and you're trying to be a good person in society, that under a stressful situation, could that bias come out, unstbeknowingly? I mean, that only would make common sense, since scientifically, it actually, it works. In training in and in other stuff. So yeah, I could see that that could be a true statement.

The domestic bonds that doom the female characters in the classics of the Western feminist canon — from The Yellow Wallpaper, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, to Wide Sargasso Sea, by Jean Rhys — find echoes in two arresting novels by Asian writers. The Waiting Years, Fumiko Enchi's psychologically astute 1957 novel of stifled emotions, traces the protracted humiliation of Tomo, a 19th-century Japanese wife obliged to procure a series of mistresses for her husband over the course of their marriage.
a huge and centuries-long change in Western history, starting from the Middle Ages, was a Civilizing Process in which the ideal of manhood changed from a macho willingness to retaliate violently to an insult to the ability to exert self-control, dignity, reserve, and duty. It's the culture of the gentleman, the man of dignity and quiet strength, the mensch. The romantic 1960s ethic of self-expression and escape from inhibitions weakened that ethic, and the A.P.A. report seems to be trying to administer the coup de grâce.

n a bright, crisp afternoon last fall, I joined all 159 Mount Saint Mary's seminarians outside McSweeney Hall, the seminary's main building, an eccentric, gabled edifice made of slabs of thickly grouted granite, perched midway up a hill among a patchwork of farms and woods. We boarded buses and rode an hour and a half to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, where the seminarians had been invited to view an exhibit of religious artwork from the Vatican Museums. Mount Saint Mary's is the second-largest seminary in the country, after Mundelein Seminary in Illinois, and is also among the most conservative -- scrupulously adherent to the magisterium, or teaching authority, of the Pope. A man seeking to become a diocesan priest must first be accepted to a diocese, whose bishop usually underwrites his education and chooses the seminary where it will take place; bishops appointed under Pope John Paul II tend to be morally conservative, upholding the Pope's stringent views on such controversial topics as contraception and the ordination of women. But conservative at Mount St. Mary's does not mean sour or grim. A mood of buoyant optimism surges among the men -- a sense, accurate or not, that the bad times are over for the priesthood, and something new and momentous is in the making. There was a period of confusion and uncertainty after the Second Vatican Council, even going into the 80's, the Rev. Kevin Rhoades, the cheerful rector of Mount Saint Mary's, told me.
Instead, you made a pragmatic call about the best way to deal with his ex-wife. (You rationalize it still, and I may agree with you.) But deciding how to interact with his ex, early in your marriage, was mostly your husband's call. You robbed him of that choice, probably accidentally, but you seem not to have acknowledged your mistake.

But, likewise, his suggestions about carbon taxes, infrastructure spending and modest tax increases on the wealthy are unlikely to gain much traction with Middle America. The Democrats must figure out a way to address the frustration and anger of those living in small towns where economies have crumbled and a lack of job opportunities has opened the door for a demagogue like Mr. Trump.
I started out as a beat cop in the Southern. I was part of the Neighborhood Stabilization Unit in the Forty-Four. We walked foot patrol and did radio runs. Then for five years I was in the Senior Citizens Robbery Unit. Going proactive--decoy and entrapment--was my ticket to plainclothes. Later, another test, and downtown, with my shield. I'm now in Asset Forfeiture, but for eight years I was in Homicide. I worked murders. I was a murder police.
The other way is that many of these competitive markets end up very quickly accelerating toward one or two winners and saying, I'm going to break you up. Does not solve that problem. I joke that it would be cruel and unusual punishment to say you have to use the fourth-best navigation app. Like what is that? Apple Maps. We all hate Apple Maps, right? If you use that thing, you're like, Oh. You curse the gods until you figure out how to get Google Maps going. So going up and saying, Look, you're the winner in the space. We're going to break you up, it doesn't revive Main Street businesses, and it doesn't actually end up solving the competition problem.

In the same book Athill reflects on how her relationship to sex had gone through several stages and had not always been a happy one, but that had always seemed central to my existence. Sex, she explains, obliterates the individuality of young women more often than it does that of young men, because so much more of a woman than a man is used by sex. And her individuality appears to be the quality Athill valued most as she made decisions that were unorthodox, and geared to maximize joy and minimize obligation. She wasn't the workaholic we expect passionately single women to be (in the movies, it seems everyone who's unmarried by choice wears a blazer and wields a Blackberry), proclaiming in Stet, I was not ashamed of valuing my private life more highly than my work; that, to my mind, is what everyone ought to do.

Oh, I think the market will work beautifully toward what it's designed to do. The market is designed for maximal capital efficiency, and it is doing a phenomenal job. That's why you see the returns on capital outstripping the returns on labor at historic levels. The market is not designed to maximize human well-being.
OZU IN COLOR at the Metrograph (May 27-31). Yasujiro Ozu had been directing for three decades before he made his first color film, Equinox Flower (Wednesday), in 1958. Its sophisticated, brightly hued compositions only add to the complexity of what, for Ozu, was by then a familiar narrative, that of a father who is reluctant to consent to his more modern-minded daughter's marriage, which he did not arrange. The series opens with Good Morning (Saturday and Sunday), from 1959, in which two brothers push their parents to buy a TV set.
I think, to many ears, there's going to be some skepticism to the idea there's not a lot of money spent on policing. And the question becomes, how is that money spent on policing? For example, let's go back to the therapist or the social worker who might go out and deal with a police call. Are you suggesting that a police officer needs to be with that social worker. Does there need to be two people at that scene? What if there's one? And if there's one, do we need that police officer? I guess one of the interesting questions of this moment is, are you all called too much? Is the system built too heavily around the idea that you dial those three digits, 911, and a police officer with a gun shows up? Is that not what we need? What do you think?

Always described as laid back and an eternal optimist by those who knew him, he was now quick to anger, especially when his things weren't where he expected them to be.

I am attracted to characters that are somewhat damaged, I suppose. Those are the most interesting, dramatic characters that I see, as long as you get a sense that they have some level of humanity. Otherwise, they're unrelatable. You could play a really dastardly character, a vicious killer, but you still need to find threads of humanity to where the audience understands or believes that part of you. That makes it more devastating, to me, about a human being gone wrong.
Efforts to get to the root of the problem, including seeing a qualified therapist, should be a priority before making the decision to have a secret life.
To those who look to Israel as Judaism's sole salvation, I say, Keep trying to get Jews from throughout the Diaspora to make aliyah. Maybe you are right. But we cannot count on Zionism and aliyah alone, because maybe you are wrong. Maybe most Jews will want to remain where they and their families have established a comfortable home. Maybe they will not come to Israel. Maybe Israel will not endure forever as a Jewish state. Maybe it will normalize--as Theodor Herzl put it--and become like most other states, which began as religious but became secular and multicultural over time.
I don't know. We're asking for due process and for an investigation. And if the investigation proves what you're saying is right, then that's an issue. If it's saying what you're saying is wrong, then it was a good shoot. But I don't have an opinion there, because I don't work on opinions. I work on evidence. And I haven't seen all the evidence. And I'm not going to answer or get painted into a corner or try to ask a question. What I answered you with is as a taser instructor — what we teach, what they say, what the law says. It doesn't matter, quite honestly, if you read Georgia law, it clearly says that the taser is a deadly weapon. So I mean, what's the difference? If a gun's a deadly weapon, a taser is a deadly weapon, you point either one of them, then you're justified for using deadly force.

She's with you, too. You're not suffering alone, O.K.? We're suffering with you. The woman watched him desperately over her bucking chest. She could not take Communion because of the respirator, so Bashista offered her a spiritual communion instead. He placed the heel of his palm against her forehead and spread his fingers to encompass the front of her skull. As he prayed aloud, she closed her eyes. Watching this, I remembered something Bashista told me once: If the church is your bride, intimacy is what you have caring for the sick. You're giving of yourself, and it's being received. There is nothing more gratifying. When the prayer was done, the woman relaxed into her pillow, as if some tension inside her had been set free. After some minutes, Bashista gently extricated his hand from hers. I'll be back in two weeks, he told her. You'll probably be home by then. I'll come find you. Afterward, he told me: If this life were all there was, I couldn't do that. Suffering and pain are senseless if there's not an afterlife. This woman might see Jesus face to face tonight, and don't get me wrong -- he chuckled -- life is wonderful, it's a gift from God. But we're pilgrims here. This is not our home. Later, the bright, modern church in Arlington was packed for 5:00 Mass, which features 11 white-gloved parishioners, known as dingers, ringing hand bells, and seven singing children.

So the clearest emblem of this is NASA and space travel where we all watched the Apollo 13 movies and we've seen the armies of research scientists helping launch these missions.

It's like if you're working in the private sector, you feel like you're going to go faster, you're certainly going to get paid more. You're going to be working with smarter people and you idolize Elon Musk, like who the heck, you know?
No, it was about that, and I was glad I did it.
Historically, we've endorsed a two-state solution, which has always struck me as the best way forward, and I think it's really unfortunate that Donald Trump has moved us away from that to the extent that he has. I would try to move us back in that direction.
Jamie Dimon, who is a Democrat but is a numbers person, has looked at the numbers and said, we should declare a national emergency around the fact that the economy is not working for most Americans. And he's proposing a negative income tax, which is a close cousin to the Freedom Dividend that I'm championing.
He has a backbone of steel. He has a tremendous amount of empathy and he seeks the better angels in humankind, said Valerie Biden Owens, Mr. Biden's sister and closest political adviser. His word is his bond.
AH: I mean, I don't think most people had.
Vaidehi is up against a lot: The first scenes of Badrinath remind us comically, but baldly, that baby boys are still considered assets while girls are liabilities. (Instead of the usual note that no animals were hurt during its filming, this movie starts with a disclaimer about the 1961 Dowry Prohibition Act.)
Last November, the writer Claire Dederer published a 5,000-word, much-talked-about essay in The Paris Review in which she re-examined Manhattan, a movie she had been unable to watch for years.
Walter, a successful surgeon in his fine camel coat, and Victor, an undistinguished patrolman in his clumsy uniform, are placed in opposition. Under Terry Kinney's direction, so, too, are Mr. Ruffalo — a late replacement for John Turturro — and Mr. Shalhoub. Both are intensely likable actors, though Mr. Ruffalo has a line in Everymen, whereas Mr. Shalhoub seems to gravitate toward more rarefied roles.
Mr. Yang has scored internet points with some tweets paying tribute to former 2020 Democratic rivals, for example by tweeting I miss Beto.
They flock to Donut — a particularly cute dog, he says — and he often finds himself surrounded by a gaggle of young women who want to know how old she is (4), if he raised her from a puppy (yes) and if they can pet her (sure).
I mean, you could make it so it's analogous to what happened in the tobacco industry, where there's a certain level of revenue that gets set aside and then you have various public service announcements.
Aftershocks is thematically structured like an earthquake, including the rumbling foreshocks and the shuddering ground after an upheaval. The narrative swings back and forth in time, from Owusu's earliest memories to a week she spent in her room a decade ago, when she was 28, barely moving from a blue rocking chair she had pulled off the street and hauled up to her Manhattan apartment. I have written for meaning rather than order, she says in a prefatory note. She keeps returning to her chosen metaphor, looking for the fault lines, closing in on the epicenter. The softer the soil, the stronger the shaking, she writes.
Binyamin Appelbaum: Yes. After every invention basically since the plow, people have found new uses for the time saved by new technologies. You've argued that this time, this won't happen quickly enough. Why will this time be different? What gives you the confidence that we're confronting something new in all of human history?
As we survey a culture that is rapidly attempting to enforce norms hostile to traditional masculinity, are men flourishing? And if men are struggling more the farther we move from those traditional norms, is the answer to continue denying and suppressing a boy's essential nature?
After his prodigious hit-making streak in the early 1960s, Spector found admirers eager to work with him during the 1970s: the Beatles (collectively and individually), the Ramones, even Leonard Cohen. Then Spector withdrew from music almost completely for the next decades. But through the years, countless others — among them the Beach Boys, Bruce Springsteen, the Walker Brothers, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Abba, Meat Loaf and Bleachers — would emulate the thundering beat, chiming chords and lavish percussion of his Wall of Sound. I still smile whenever I hear the music we made together, and always will, Ronnie Spector told Billboard in an interview after Spector's death. The music will be forever.
KK: So let's get into it. We have about 90 minutes together. In your assessment, what are the policy breakdowns that lead to Americans still being hungry today?
Yes. All of this is a prelude to say that, should some of the tech companies be asked to divest parts of their businesses? One hundred percent yes. Like Amazon should not be selling its own house brand to its advantage to other goods. These companies do have excessive power and influence. At this point you could argue they control our democracy.
Wow. I want to ask you, as a union head, about what appears to be a growing consensus. That in this discussion and this debate about changing policing, that unions have been a barrier — that they have created systems. And I know you may disagree with this, but let me just get through it. The perception is that unions have created systems that protect police officers — at times, even the most problematic officers — by making it challenging to see complaints against those officers and by erecting significant barriers to firing them. Do you think that that's fair?
Thousands of people have been evacuated in what was most likely the largest peacetime maritime rescue operation in Australia's history, the authorities said. About 3,000 army reservists, along with aircraft and naval ships, are also being made available to help with the evacuation and firefighting efforts.
What I am setting out here is an account of the worst case I have ever handled. The worst case--for me, that is. When you're a police, worst is an elastic concept. You can't really get a fix on worst. The boundaries are pushed out every other day. Worst? we'll ask. There's no such thing as worst. But for Detective Mike Hoolihan this was the worst case.
Republicans today took great pains to distinguish Clinton's case from Livingston's revelations that on occasion I strayed from my marriage.
Despite the high profile of the scandals involving the sexual abuse of minors by Catholic priests, there is no evidence that the incidence of sexual misconduct is greater among priests than among clergy of other denominations or the population at large. But this is of little comfort to Catholic clergy or parishioners -- nor is it likely to alter the widely held perception that men who choose to live celibate lives have psychological problems they wish to conceal. This perception is not lost on the seminarians. Magat was dating a woman before he entered the seminary, but he avoided telling her that he was considering a vocation until the last possible moment. I was afraid, he says. If I decided not to go to the seminary and I'd told her in advance, then I'm out of the vocation and I'm out of her. Because I knew she would have dropped me like a hat. For a long time, Bashista says, he was critical of the fact that priests cannot marry, and celibacy was a big impediment for many years as he struggled with the idea of becoming a priest. I really felt that I was called to be a father and a husband, he says. I thought that was why I was placed on earth. There was a girl I dated in college -- we'd even had talks about getting married. Bashista's initial aversion to celibacy is widespread among men of his generation, according to Dean Hoge, a professor of sociology at Catholic University.
Lauren Kelley: Mr. Yang, can you say who is on your short list for running mate?
We look forward to working with them to go further and enact public campaign financing, make Election Day a state holiday and ban corporate contributions once and for all, the spokesman, Rich Azzopardi, said.
Ms. Nguyen said that the calculations that daters are engaging in go beyond physical exposure. You're choosing to be physically vulnerable, physically risking Covid, but you're also being emotionally and mentally vulnerable, by trusting this person and believing what they're saying, she said.
For all these reasons, starting with smaller classes, I banned laptops, and it improved the students' engagement. With constant eye contact, I could see and feel when they understood me, and when they did not. Energized by the connection, we moved faster, further and deeper into the material. I broadened my rule to include one of my large upper-level courses. The pushback was real: A week before class, I posted the syllabus, which announced my policy. Two students wrote me to ask if I would reconsider, and dropped the class when I refused. But more important, after my class ends, many students continue to take notes by hand even when it's not required.
That's the question that preoccupies Jules Jacobson, the ambitious protagonist of Meg Wolitzer's remarkable novel, The Interestings, whose inclusive vision and generous sweep place it among the ranks of books like Jonathan Franzen's Freedom and Jeffrey Eugenides's Marriage Plot. The Interestings is warm, all-American and acutely perceptive about the feelings and motivations of its characters, male and female, young and old, gay and straight; but it's also stealthily and undeniably a novel of ideas. Wolitzer has been writing excellent fiction for 30 years, and it has always been this astute. From the start, her subject has been the practical, emotional and sexual fallout of women's liberation, particularly as it affects mothers and children. But here she has written a novel that speaks as directly to men as to women.
There are the Complete Disaster videos, where laundry, dirty dishes, grime and clutter have overwhelmed what would normally be an attractive house and the influencer restores order, sometimes in a video condensing two or three days of cleaning into 45 minutes.
In Under the Eiffel Tower, Stuart (Matt Walsh), an American bourbon expert fired for a lack of passion, likens his existence to the lives of quiet desperation described by Thoreau. Desperation seems too mild. When a friend (David Wain) invites Stuart to come along with him, his wife (Michaela Watkins) and their daughter (Dylan Gelula) on a French vacation, the trip has barely started before Stuart proposes marriage to the daughter — who is maybe half his age — at the base of the Eiffel Tower. And that's before the title card.
At points we would take each other's phone, she said, and swiped right for each other while sitting by the fireplace in the duplex Ms. Heyman shared with another friend on the Upper West Side. It was easily a night of 50 to 100 swipes. Not that I'm liking all of them.
While I agree with Bret Stephens's thesis that the defeat of Donald Trump in the 2020 election is not a given, I disagree with his prescription for a Democratic win. Yes, the more radical ideas of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, which in fact might help Middle America the most, would never pass Congress and will never gain favor with conservative rural Americans.
Mr. Biden's priorities reflect values that progressive faith leaders have pushed for, and that motivated many to speak out for him during the campaign, said Derrick Harkins, who led interfaith outreach for the Democratic National Committee this past cycle. There is a sense of moral synergy on the left, among not only progressive Christians but also humanists, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs and the spectrum of faith traditions, he said.
But Colonel Tom soon put my mind at rest.
After asserting that those groups responsible for seeking American entanglement in European affairs were the British, the Jewish and the Roosevelt Administration, he went on to say: It is not difficult to understand why Jewish people desire the overthrow of Nazi Germany. The persecution they suffered in Germany would be sufficient to make bitter enemies of any race. No person with a sense of the dignity of mankind can condone the persecution the Jewish race suffered in Germany. But no person of honesty and vision can look on their prowar policy here today without seeing the dangers involved in such a policy, both for us and for them. Instead of agitating for war, the Jewish groups in this country should be opposing it in every possible way, for they will be among the first to feel its consequences. Tolerance is a virtue that depends upon peace and strength. A few far-sighted Jewish people realize this and stand opposed to intervention. But the majority still do not. Their greatest danger to their country lies in their large ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio and our government. The speech evoked a nationwide outcry. Lindbergh, it was said, had not only impugned the patriotism of American Jews, but also had used the word race, a word many Jews considered both pejorative and inaccurate. Lindbergh never withdrew his remarks, which he considered statements of obvious fact.

AY: Yeah. And I will say on a personal level, I spent seven years recruiting some of our top educational products to Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis. So I have seen that essentially the tide has turned in the direction it's gone and we should not be relying upon the government as the primary employer of a lot of this tech talent. We have to face facts and say, at this point, most of the intellectual capital is being attracted to these private firms and we need to instead try and support and work with the private firms.
SHIVERING SOLDIER What is it you think you can do out there?! On this thing?!
For example, during one summer, they took two flights on vacation on private jets. And this raised a reasonable question. Prince Harry's a major campaigner for climate change.
'THE CONVENT' at A.R.T./New York Theaters (in previews; opens on Jan. 24). A girls' trip with monastic overtones, Jessica Dickey's new play goes on retreat with a group of women trying to live like medieval nuns (though likely practicing better personal hygiene). Daniel Talbott directs the all-female cast, which includes Lisa Ramirez and Samantha Soule, as they recede from modernity.

You know, just being in touch with it and having my own television production company for seven years now and realizing that it's shifting and adjusting. And the business will always shift and adjust. I hope that we don't see the end of movie theaters. They're on life support right now, understandably, and I don't want that to go away. I don't want it to only be the big superhero movies are in the theaters and everything else is on your home screens. That experience of witnessing a story being told in a cinematic way and you're in a room with a bunch of strangers is really rewarding, and I hope that comes back in the movie theaters and on Broadway.
The 21st-century framework. First, you don't use price as your primary determinant of whether or not there are antitrust problems, because the tech companies would say, What? We would never gouge anyone. It's free. We're underselling everyone. So that you have to get rid of, and that's not something she's advocating, but what she is advocating, which I find to be a bit backward looking, is thinking that competition is the answer in these spaces. And competition misses the point in one way and another way.
I haven't hung out with enough of them to know, but I'm confident I understand the internet better than the [cross talk]——
Her first novel, Aspire to the Heavens (1969), was not about a murderous psychopath or a jealous friend bent on bloody revenge, but rather about George and Martha Washington. It failed to make a splash, but was republished in 2002 as Mount Vernon Love Story and joined the other Higgins Clark titles on the best-seller lists.
Hizo falta una pandemia para enseñarnos lo que muchas culturas han sabido desde siempre: que los círculos de amistad pueden darnos vidas más saludables y felices. Dan Buettner, becario y autor de National Geographic, ha estudiado los hábitos de las personas que viven en zonas azules, que son áreas alrededor del mundo donde la gente vive mucho más tiempo que el promedio. Ha descubierto sistemáticamente que las culturas con una larga esperanza de vida valoran los lazos sociales fuertes. En Okinawa, Japón, por ejemplo, donde la esperanza de vida promedio de las mujeres es de alrededor de 90 años, las personas forman una especie de red social durante la infancia llamada moai: un grupo de cinco amigos que ofrecen apoyo social, logístico, emocional e incluso financiero para toda la vida. Los miembros de cada moai también parecen influir en los comportamientos de salud de los demás durante toda la vida.
I was wearing a helmet. I have a staffer with the helmet as proof.
James Rosenquist, who helped define Pop Art in its 1960s heyday with his boldly scaled painted montages of commercial imagery, died on Friday in New York City. He was 83 years old.
Jesse Wegman: Is the inside of the helmet warm?
Mr. Yang has been critical of China's increasingly authoritarian behavior and told the Council on Foreign Relations the United States must in reply demonstrate a model for democratic capitalism.
Harmful effects of unemployment are felt by men and women, but men are more likely to experience negative health effects including depression and increased risk of suicide.

The art world is increasingly turning to labs to understand how paintings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries are behaving. Vincent van Gogh's chrome yellows, some of which have started to brown, and his purples, some of which have turned blue, have been widely studied. But less is known about Munch's palette, and scientists, using updated technologies and tools like transmission electron microscopes, are breaking new ground.
JI: Yes. Regulating it heavily and using the revenue to treat gambling addiction. Can you talk through that? You say on your website that you think gambling addiction doesn't get nearly enough attention, and it is a really important issue. How does legalizing gambling, even if you use the revenue, not make that problem worse?
Mr. Biden's support for abortion rights is already causing tension in the Catholic church. Even before the inaugural ceremony had finished, Archbishop José H. Gomez of Los Angeles, the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, issued an extensive statement criticizing Mr. Biden for policies that would advance moral evils, especially in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender. Cardinal Blase J. Cupich of Chicago, who is known for his alignment with Pope Francis' social and economic priorities, pushed back on Twitter, calling the statement unprecedented and ill-considered.
The result, Federico notes, is that group consciousness is likely to emerge on the basis of education and training and when those with less education see themselves as being culturally very different from an educated stratum of the population that is more socially liberal and cosmopolitan, then the sense of group conflict is deepened.
A working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that U.B.I. could redirect spending to more affluent and middle-income families, therefore leaving low-income families worse off; a U.B.I. large enough to direct more funds to low-income households would be extremely costly. Read the paper here.
BS: The New Yorker cartoon. They had a secretary with like a floppy disk. With her glasses pulled down and her fingers crossed.
So do you have trouble turning it off? I don't mean going home and doing an LBJ accent. But you ever catch yourself acting the role of Bryan Cranston with your family or friends?
Some members of the Western Shoshone Nation ultimately accepted government cash in an attempt to end the dispute, but the Danns persisted. Representatives of the Western Shoshone Nation have appealed to international bodies, including the United Nations, and they pressed their case with U.S. government officials as recently as the fall of 2019.
you can have dignity, but it must be earned through market or entrepreneurial success (as the Reagan/Thatcher center-right would have it) or the meritocratic attainment of professional status (as the center-left would have it). But obviously, these are not avenues available to all, simply because society has only so many positions for captains of industry and educated professionals.
So this is the carrot and the stick. So imagine if you had data standards that were endorsed by the U.S., the E.U., and Japan, and it had certain technology protocols associated with it. Then China said, Hey, I don't want to adhere to that. Because like you said, they like to hoard data, and one of the reasons why they're in position to leapfrog us is they have more data than we do and they have essentially nonexistent privacy rights or regulations. They have complete surveillance. That's one reason why they've banned masks in Hong Kong, so that their surveillance technology can pick up who the protesters are. So China has its own vast hoard of data.
With such a public subject, what could there be left to tell? Maher, a journalist based in Karachi, answers that question handily, and originally. A Woman Like Her is a model of how to report on celebrity: by focusing on the seedy characters who feed and exploit it, and by harvesting the details, especially at the seam between public and private, that more conventional journalists leave behind. Maher has an often thrillingly slant gaze, an eye alert to the absurdities, ironies and small tragedies at play in the manufacture of images and personas. Her book is full of unforgettable scenes and vignettes — Baloch, pretending to be a clueless urbanite, her stilettos sinking into the mud on a reality show set in a village like the one where she was raised; a television talk show blurring her cleavage-spot to capitalize on her risqué image, even though she is wearing nothing revealing. This tension over who is in control of Baloch's life drives the book.
Cuba has also weathered the collapse of the Soviet Union, its main Cold War benefactor, and a slew of traumatic internal ructions including the Mariel boatlift in 1980 and the Cuban raft exodus in 1994. Last but not least, Cuba has managed its first major political transitions, following the death in 2016 of its defining leader, Fidel Castro; the presidential retirement, last year, of his younger brother, Raúl Castro; and Raúl's succession in office by Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, a 58-year-old Communist Party loyalist.
In 2017, Simon & Schuster canceled a book by the professional provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos after he gave an interview in which he appeared to condone pedophilia. His contract reportedly did not include a morality clause, and he sued, though he later dropped the suit. If a morality clause did lead to a book's cancellation, we probably wouldn't know it, according to Devereux Chatillon, a partner in the media and intellectual property law firm Chatillon Weiss who has represented both The New Yorker and writers. It wouldn't be public unless somebody sued over it, she said. And even then, the lawsuit probably wouldn't come to light.
And while some of that was perhaps legitimate, you also began to see just a more petty flavor to the coverage. And it's really perhaps most visible if you look at the coverage of Meghan Markle side by side with that of Kate Middleton, who married Prince Harry's brother, William.
This year was meant to be something of a Kurt Weill festival in Berlin, the city that shaped — and was shaped by — his partnership with Bertolt Brecht. There were going to be new productions of The Threepenny Opera and Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, as well as performances by the Berlin Philharmonic. Little of those plans remains, but the Philharmonic musicians are able to gather, without live audiences, for the online festival The Golden Twenties — which opens with Weill's First Symphony (1921), an unruly early work that reflects both the spongy mind of a precocious student and the gift for orchestration and scale that would come to define his Berlin-era sound. There's more Weill throughout the month: the Violin Concerto and Second Symphony (Feb. 16); a Mahagonny suite (Feb. 20); and Little Threepenny Music (Feb. 23) in a concert that also includes, fittingly, Berlin Lit Up. JOSHUA BARONE
HARKNESS DANCE FESTIVAL at the 92nd Street Y (March 24, 8 p.m.; March 25, 4 and 8 p.m.). The festival winds down with Jillian Peña's latest evening-length work, The Natural Order, which explores what it means to be a part of a group, namely one whose members — Alexandra Albrecht, Leigh Lotocki, Jocelyn Tobias and Madeline Wilcox — strive to embrace both magic and the power of dance. (Aren't they one and the same?) Here, Ms. Peña, known for her use of repetition and mirrored bodies, examines how individuals navigate relationships.
So you definitely need to bring the tech companies to heel and say, Look, here are the list of problems we're concerned about. But the solution to the abuse of power is not to say like, Hey, we're just going to try and keep anyone in the country from having the ability to do wrong. What you have to do is you have to figure out what the abuses you're concerned about are, and then actually address them directly.
We have learned--painfully and with difficulty--how to fight others. Can we develop Jewish techniques for defending against our own success?
As for your hurt feelings, they seem reasonable. Personally, I would be less hurt by her assessment of my looks (until I inspected her cosmetic surgery, anyway) than by her shame at associating with me. Still, you have shared your honest feelings, and she rejected them. If you are committed to this friendship, I would never dissuade you from trying again. But as my (brutally efficient) nana used to say: No use watering dead flowers. And don't out her as 50-something. Two wrongs. …
SS: O.K. Again, about your responsibilities as president. One of the heaviest ones would be waging war. When you look back on the conflicts into which recent presidents have put us, would you support this? Is this something you would have done in Syria, in Libya, in Kosovo? Would you have sent troops there?
The reason, he replied, was that Lindbergh was a defeatist, and he went on to compare him with Representative Clement L. Vallandigham, a Civil War Congressman from Ohio, the chief spokesman of a group called the Copperheads, who said the North could never win. Roosevelt's attack was perhaps set off by a Lindbergh magazine article that declared, While our leaders have shouted for peace, they have consistently directed us toward war. 'Insult From Roosevelt' Considering his honor impugned, Lindbergh resigned his commission. If I did not tender my resignation, he said in the published version of his Wartime Journals, I would lose something in my own character that means even more to me than my commission in the Air Corps. No one else would know it, but I would. And if I take this insult from Roosevelt, more, and worse, will probably be forthcoming. Thirty years later Lindbergh still felt wronged by the President, and professed not to see that he himself had questioned Roosevelt's integrity. With Pearl Harbor, America First collapsed and Lindbergh sought to join the armed forces. Now that we are at war I want to contribute as best I can to my country's war effort, he wrote. It is vital for us to carry on this was as intelligently, as constructively, and as successfully as we can, and I want to do my part. His bid to soldier was rebuffed, however, an action for which he blamed Roosevelt personally.

She found her signature role in Ballet Theater's revivals of Eugene Loring's Billy the Kid, from 1938. A brilliantly stylized experimental work that used occasional speech, the ballet had a biographical plotline by Lincoln Kirstein (who would become a founder of New York City Ballet), and a double role for Ms. Koesun, who portrayed both the sweetheart and the mother of the outlaw Billy.
So we need to have better, more holistic ways of measuring how our kids are doing educationally, and we need to empower teachers and let teachers do their jobs. Because if you are a teacher and you're teaching to the test, you end up making decisions in the classroom that you know are not right for the students.

The new governor also said he would propose in his new budget, due out later this week, mandating that all Californians obtain health care insurance, in direct response to the Republican tax bill last year that removed the mandate from the Affordable Care Act. Such a mandate in California would require approval of the Legislature, which is far from assured.

A 2016 study from the economists Lawrence Katz at Harvard and Alan Krueger at Princeton found that 94 percent of net job growth between 2005 and 2015 was alternative work, including independent contractors, freelancers and temps.
Ms. Lansky's path to publishing was serendipitous, but she churned out more than 30 books, wrote newspaper and magazine columns and produced a newsletter. She championed natural, do-it-yourself versions of store-bought baby food and more healthful alternatives to sugary snacks, and offered homespun counseling drawn from her experience.
So, and I know The New York Times, I mean you've had your issues with Facebook and the rest of it, and they made a change and then all sorts of things happen.
Even more intriguing than the support of the civil authorities is the early patronage of Jacob Rauwaert, a rich Amsterdam collector and dealer more than thirty years Cornelis's senior, who had apprenticed with Maarten van Heemskerck, an originator of Knollenstil, before redirecting his energies from making art to buying and selling it. Rauwaert provided the financial underpinnings for the group of Italian-influenced artists that was later termed the Haarlem Academy. The eldest of the three artists at its core was Karel van Mander, a painter who came from Flanders in 1583, having previously spent three years in Rome. He made his mark in Haarlem as a critic and theorist. Goltzius, a draftsman of genius, won fame through his engravings. Cornelis was the ambitious and productive young painter with a gloriously theatrical bent.
The editorial board recently called for the Trump administration to break the impasse on funding for the proposed rail tunnel under the Hudson River in an editorial titled: Build the Donald J. Trump Tunnel. The vital infrastructure project has stalled because of political infighting.

Cheney facing internal backlash for impeachment vote as Republican rifts deepen over Trump. Representative Liz Cheney had issued a scathing statement the day before the impeachment vote repudiating President Trump. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times A group of President Trump's most strident allies in the House is calling on Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican, to resign from her leadership post after she voted to impeach Mr. Trump, dramatizing the bitter rifts within the party and setting up a messy internal feud that could define its future. Members of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, including the chairman, Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, as well as Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio and Matt Gaetz of Florida, are circulating a petition calling on Ms. Cheney to step down from her role as chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, arguing that her vote to impeach Mr. Trump had brought the conference into disrepute and produced discord. Ms. Cheney was one of 10 Republicans to break with the party on Wednesday and vote to charge the president with incitement of insurrection for his role in urging on a mob that stormed the Capitol. One of those 10 cannot be our leader, Mr. Gaetz said in an interview on Fox News's Hannity on Wednesday evening. It is untenable, unsustainable, and we need to make a leadership change. Ms. Cheney has brushed aside calls to step down, saying that she was not going anywhere and calling her break with Mr. Trump a vote of conscience.
If there's one thing I've learned, it's that you have to shake off your mistakes and move on. And someday, by God, I will learn how to do that.
Since 1982, Alaska has been giving every resident an annual check from its $66.3 billion permanent fund, which gets at least 25 percent of the state's mineral royalties every year. The results of the experiment have been mixed — crippling poverty is low, but unemployment rates are among the highest in the country, and the fund's value fluctuates with oil prices.
'ABOUT ALICE' at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center (in previews; opens on Jan. 20). Based on what The New York Times Book Review called a slim but walloping book, this Theater for a New Audience play by Calvin Trillin relates his long, fine romance with his wife, Alice, who died in 2001. Under Leonard Foglia's direction, Jeffrey Bean and Carrie Paff portray Calvin and Alice.
The scandal broke on Feb. 23, 2013, when three priests and a former cleric were quoted in the British newspaper The Observer as saying that Cardinal O'Brien had made sexual advances toward them after drinking bouts in the 1980s.
The website of the school, Immanuel Christian School, which enrolls kindergartners through eighth graders at its campus in Springfield, Va., details its religious beliefs and expectations of both students and their parents, as well as those who wish to work there. The school's employment application requires candidates to describe their faith in Jesus Christ, affirm that they are a born-again Christian and vow to adhere to specific standards in their personal and professional lives.
Pearson, the publisher whose Texas textbook raises questions about the quality of Harlem Renaissance literature, said such language adds more depth and nuance.
In a 2013 interview in Vogue to promote Traps, Ms. Bezos said she met her husband when she interviewed for a job at D.E. Shaw as a research associate in 1992. After being hired, she sat in an office next to his. Ms. Bezos grew up in San Francisco and attended Princeton University, where she was an assistant to the novelist Toni Morrison. Ms. Bezos told Vogue that she asked Mr. Bezos to lunch and that within three months, they were engaged. They married in 1993.
So here's my antidote to that gloom: Let me try to make the case that 2018 was actually the best year in human history.

I guess the most difficult to date was LBJ. I went down to the LBJ library a couple of times and spent countless hours just trying to absorb the sense of him visually, vocally. There's copious amounts of books about him, which were all very helpful and endless. So you could just get completely absorbed, and I did. I got completely absorbed in developing the character that by the time I got to the ART in Harvard to do the out-of-town part of it, I was not prepared for the massive amount of dialogue that I was saying. I was so into developing the character that we did the table read, and I read through it, and I went, oh my god, I haven't started memorizing any of this. And I was panicked. I was really panicked that I wouldn't get it.
But Texas students will read that some critics dismissed the quality of literature produced.
But when King was asked about Court's name on the arena, she said: I know it's not as easy as people think, but I personally don't think she should have her name anymore. I think if you were talking about indigenous people, Jews or any other people, I can't imagine the public would want somebody to have their name on something. Maybe because of our community, the L.G.B.T.I.Q. community, people might feel differently. But we're all God's children. We are all God's children, so I probably don't think it's appropriate to have her name.
Kitschelt's listing of some of the reasons for American vulnerability to right-wing forces illuminates current events.
I want to say we raised maybe $5,000, and I was quite pleased. It was at a lounge.
If we are to counteract this trend, we must understand the dynamics of contemporary assimilation and not confuse them with past episodes of assimilation, which were based largely on the perceived need to escape from the burdens of Jewish identification. Today, there are no burdens from which to escape. Being Jewish is easy, at least in relation to external burdens. Jews today assimilate not because Christianity or Islam is better or easier, but because Jewish life does not have a strong enough positive appeal to offset the inertial drift toward the common denominator. Jews do not convert to Christianity; they convert to mainstream Americanism, which is the American religion closest to Judaism. They see no reason not to follow their heart in marriage, their convenience in neighborhoods, their economic opportunities in jobs, their educational advantages in schools, their conscience in philosophy, and their preferences in lifestyle. Most Jews who assimilate do not feel that they are giving up anything by abandoning a Jewishness they know little about. They associate the Judaism they are abandoning with inconvenient rituals and rules that have no meaning to them. As one young woman remembers her Jewishness: An old man saying no.
But after hours, alone in his little Parisian bolt-hole, Lequeu (1757—1826) birthed on paper an architecture of wild grandiosity. Styles collided. Historical epochs blended together. European forms mingled with those of Asia and the Middle East. Classical restraint gave way to sensuous, sometimes racy ornament. Buildings became enmeshed with bodies: sometimes human ones, sometimes those of giant farm animals.
The cause was ovarian cancer, her husband, Edward L. Alley, said.
Public arts funding has been declining. Faculty members and administrators are averse to change. Celebrities rarely give serious money, but benefits get little media coverage without them.
Marcel Proust was the son of a Christian father and a Jewish mother. He himself was baptized (on August 5, 1871, at the church of Saint-Louis d'Antin) and later confirmed as a Catholic, but he never practiced that faith and as an adult could best be described as a mystical atheist, someone imbued with spirituality who nonetheless did not believe in a personal God, much less in a savior. Although Jews trace their religion through their mothers, Proust never considered himself Jewish and even became vexed when a newspaper article listed him as a Jewish author. His father once warned him not to stay in a certain hotel since there were too many Jewish guests there, and, to be sure, in Remembrance of Things Past there are unflattering caricatures of the members of one Jewish family, the Blochs. Jews were still considered exotic, even oriental, in France; in 1872 there were only eighty-six thousand Jews in the whole country. In a typically offensive passage Proust writes that in a French drawing room a Jew making his entry as though he were emerging from the desert, his body crouching like a hyena's, his neck thrust forward, offering profound `salaams,' completely satisfies a certain taste for the oriental.
The reason, he replied, was that Lindbergh was a defeatist, and he went on to compare him with Representative Clement L. Vallandigham, a Civil War Congressman from Ohio, the chief spokesman of a group called the Copperheads, who said the North could never win. Roosevelt's attack was perhaps set off by a Lindbergh magazine article that declared, While our leaders have shouted for peace, they have consistently directed us toward war. 'Insult From Roosevelt' Considering his honor impugned, Lindbergh resigned his commission. If I did not tender my resignation, he said in the published version of his Wartime Journals, I would lose something in my own character that means even more to me than my commission in the Air Corps. No one else would know it, but I would. And if I take this insult from Roosevelt, more, and worse, will probably be forthcoming. Thirty years later Lindbergh still felt wronged by the President, and professed not to see that he himself had questioned Roosevelt's integrity. With Pearl Harbor, America First collapsed and Lindbergh sought to join the armed forces. Now that we are at war I want to contribute as best I can to my country's war effort, he wrote. It is vital for us to carry on this was as intelligently, as constructively, and as successfully as we can, and I want to do my part. His bid to soldier was rebuffed, however, an action for which he blamed Roosevelt personally.
officer convicted of illegally disclosing classified information, and agreed to a $50,000 bonus if the president granted it, according to a copy of an agreement. And Mr. Kiriakou was separately told that Mr. Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani could help him secure a pardon for $2 million. Mr. Kiriakou rejected the offer, but an associate, fearing that Mr. Giuliani was illegally selling pardons, alerted the F.B.I. Mr. Giuliani challenged this characterization. After Mr. Trump's impeachment for inciting his supporters before the deadly riot at the Capitol, and with Republican leaders turning on him, the pardon power remains one of the last and most likely outlets for quick unilateral action by an increasingly isolated, erratic president. He has suggested to aides he wants to take the extraordinary and unprecedented step of pardoning himself, though it was not clear whether he had broached the topic since the rampage. He has also discussed issuing pre-emptive pardons to his children, his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, and Mr. Giuliani. A White House spokesman declined to comment. Michael S.

The aviator's crucial assistance to Goddard did not become well known until Goddard's biography was published in 1963, a book for which Lindbergh wrote an introduction. For more than 15 years after the war Lindbergh virtually disappeared from the news. He was a member of Army Ordnance's CHORE project at the University of Chicago; he was consultant to the Secretary of the Air Force; he took part in the reorganization of the Strategic Air Command; and he was a member of scientific ballistic-missile committees of the Air Force and the Defense Department. In 1954, he was commissioned a brigadier general in the Air Force Reserve. Much of the aviator's work in these years dealt with security-classified projects; but it is believed that he was active in rocketry and space flight programs, where his technical expertise was valuable. He enjoyed top-secret clearance, and spoke of his tasks as having to do with security. In this period, Lindbergh completed his autobiographical account of his 1927 flight, which had been written in bits and pieces in various parts of the world over 14 years. The Spirit of St. Louis, published in 1953, won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1954 and was made into a movie three years later, with James Stewart as the lead. The book was intended to supersede We, which, written in haste, had never satisfied the aviator as an accurate account of his flight. Starting sometime after the war, he rejoined Pan American as a consultant for the nominal fee of $600 a month.
Yeah. I don't know why, but it just made me feel that, oh, I could do this, and I belong. And anything beyond making a living, to me, was gravy. I still feel that way.
I was a working actor since the time I was 25. I made a living as my career. That's the professional achievement I'm most proud of is that I crossed a threshold — somehow, some way — when I got a job in New York City, moved from LA to New York to be on a soap opera for two years.
On his first day in office, Mr. Biden recommitted the United States to the Paris climate agreement, the international accord designed to avert global warming; ended the ban on travel from predominantly Muslim and African countries; and stopped construction on the border wall.
The cause was heart failure, Jeff Ballard, a family spokesman, said.
My team then had me take the helmet off and then tried to make my hair look good. So that's why I didn't show up with the helmet.

BERLIN — Germany's largest political party will choose a new leader on Saturday, with the winner well positioned to succeed Angela Merkel as the next chancellor of Europe's leading economy.
Mr. Yang has a fervent online following that calls itself the Yang Gang.
Mr. Little submitted the manuscript for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to 12 publishers. He received 12 rejections in response, before selling it for £2,500, or about $3,400 (the equivalent of about $5,800 today). It was a meager amount, but his genius was in the details: He sold only the rights to publish it in Britain and the Commonwealth, and he asked for high royalties.
Right now we have three flagship numbers we're beating the American people over the head with, telling them that things are going great. No. 1, the headline unemployment rate. No. 2, gross domestic product, which is obviously putting up record highs even as our life expectancy is declining. And No. 3, corporate profits and shareholder value. Stock market prices correspond to the fortunes of the top 20 percent of Americans, many of the people, obviously, who live here in Manhattan. The bottom 80 percent of Americans own 8 percent of stock market value. The bottom 50 percent own essentially zero.
More religious and less well-educated whites see Donald Trump as one of their own despite his being so obviously a child of privilege. He defends America as a Christian nation. He defends English as our national language. He is unashamed in stating that the loyalty of any government should be to its own citizens — both in terms of how we should deal with noncitizens here and how our foreign policy should be based on the doctrine of America First. He speaks in a language that ordinary people can understand. He makes fun of the elites who look down on his supporters as a basket of deplorables and who think it is a good idea to defund the police who protect them and to prioritize snail darters over jobs. He appoints judges and justices who are true conservatives. He believes more in gun rights than in gay rights. He rejects political correctness and the language-police and woke ideology as un-American. And he promises to reclaim the jobs that previous presidents (of both parties) allowed to be shipped abroad. In sum, he offers a relatively coherent set of beliefs and policies that are attractive to many voters and which he has been better at seeing implemented than any previous Republican president. What Trump supporters who rioted in D.C. share are the beliefs that Trump is their hero, regardless of his flaws, and that defeating Democrats is a holy war to be waged by any means necessary.
I remember every slight committed against the people that I love, she wrote in her memoir, establishing herself as the family protector, if not its chief grudge holder.
I understand that the term 'marriage' has only one meaning; the uniting of one man and one woman, it reads, adding that certain moral misconduct would be disqualifying, such as heterosexual activity outside of marriage (e.g., premarital sex, cohabitation, extramarital sex), homosexual or lesbian sexual activity, polygamy, transgender identity, any other violation of the unique roles of male and female.
KK: Do you feel like you need to have a running mate who has operated in Washington before or who has previous government experience?
Many of Mr. Yang's supporters say they are drawn to his perspective as a political outsider; in The Wall Street Journal, some say they previously supported Senator Sanders but now look for a candidate who offers an even fresher non-Washington perspective.
The President of the United States has committed a serious transgression, said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader.Among other things, he took an oath to God to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, and then he failed to do so, not once, but several times. To ignore this, he said, is to undermine the rule of law. [Excerpts from the debate, pages 31-32.]
The Peruvian-born photographer Cecilia Paredes, most notably, and the Trinidadian artist Marlon Griffith, who started out as a Carnival designer, make alluring, disorienting color photos of patterns painted directly on the skin. And Keisha Scarville, who teaches at the International Center of Photography, alters copies of her father's 1955 Guyanese passport photos with more or less violent elements of collage. WILL HEINRICH
Since the rock duo Twenty One Pilots released its fourth album, Blurryface, in 2015, Josh Dun and Tyler Joseph have become one of music's most surprising success stories: The record opened at No. 1 on the Billboard charts, and it has remained comfortably in the Top 10 since. They are also nominated for several Grammys this year, including record of the year for the hit single Stressed Out. It's not hard to see why Twenty One Pilots has connected with a mainstream audience: With the current pop landscape largely devoid of cutting-edge rock 'n' roll, Twenty One Pilots draws on all sorts of sonic ideas, from pop and pop-punk to hip-hop and reggae. The duo's live show is equally enthralling: In this Friday evening performance, look for Mr. Dun's drum kit to be sent into the crowd, as fans hold him aloft. With Judah and the Lion. KEVIN O'DONNELL
archived recording (paul howard) What we discovered is that Officer Rolfe actually kicked Mr. Brooks while he laid on the ground, while he was there fighting for his life. We were able to conclude that, based on the way that these officers conducted themselves while Mr. Brooks was lying there, that the demeanor of the officers immediately after the shooting did not reflect any fear or danger of Mr. Brooks, but their actions really reflected other kinds of emotions.

In Florida's vaccine free-for-all, one state site is closing Monday for a football game. Frontline health care workers and people 65 and older waited in line outside the East County Regional Library in Lehigh Acres, Fla., last month. Credit... Octavio Jones for The New York Times The state of Florida's coronavirus testing and vaccination site at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens — the recent scene of long lines of people awaiting vaccination — will be shut down for much of Monday to make way for the College Football Playoff national championship game. No testing will be done on Monday, and vaccinations will end at noon, the Florida Division of Emergency Management announced on Sunday. The pandemic is in an alarming new upward spiral in Florida, with nearly 20,000 new cases of the virus reported there on Friday and more than 15,000 on Saturday. But the state's well-intended effort to throw open the doors of the vaccine program to everyone 65 and older has led to long lines, confusion and disappointment. The temporary closure of the Hard Rock Stadium site to accommodate a football game seemed likely to complicate things further for Miamians. Experts say Florida is an example of what happens when officials attempt to distribute a vaccine that is still in very limited supply to a broad spectrum of the population. In a state with about 4.4 million people 65 and older, more than 402,000 doses had been administered as of Friday, according to federal data, the fourth-highest total in the nation.
BA: You've expressed profound distrust of market forces. You just compared the major tech companies to drug dealers, and you want the N.S.A. to outsource national security work to them?
Months after I called it quits on a long-distance relationship that lasted years, my ex came to town and met me for dinner. We ended up spending the next two evenings and nights together. Hopeful that we might actually make it stick, I stayed in touch, even once I figured out that he had already — before his visit — entered another relationship. He wrote me heartfelt, regret-filled emails and assured me that he was working on extricating himself from this Plan B. After connecting on and off for months via email, text and phone, I learned not only that he had entered a relationship but also that it was with an old flame, and that he slipped an engagement ring on her finger well before came to see me. I feel great pain and sympathy for his fiancée, who has been as betrayed and disrespected as I have. We are both victims; he selfishly stole a year of my life and caused me emotional trauma sure to haunt me forever, and she is probably preparing to enter a marriage that will be defined by lies. She just doesn't know it. I want this woman to walk down that aisle with her eyes open; but there's a part of me that wonders whether I am just seeking revenge. How do I tell the difference, and where do I draw the ethical line between assuaging my anger and protecting her future? Name Withheld
If Sex and the Constitution succeeds, future efforts by Stone and his publisher will no doubt include Sex and Magna Carta, Sex and the Declaration of Independence and Sex and the Instructions That Came With Your New Dishwasher. Stone tells the story fairly straight, but it's clear that he regards history as moving in a generally progressive direction — in favor of more tolerance — and that he thinks that's a good thing.

MICHEL PICCOLI at Film Forum (March 16-22). It's a tad cute to ascribe symmetry to the career of the French star Michel Piccoli, but one can draw a line from his work in Contempt (on Saturday) — the 1964 Jean-Luc Godard masterpiece in which he plays a screenwriter whose marriage disintegrates during a production of The Odyssey — to I'm Going Home (on Thursday), Manoel de Oliveira's 2002 portrait of a grieving theater actor near the end of his life, vexed after being abruptly cast in a film production of James Joyce's Ulysses. Film Forum's retrospective goes heavy on marquee directors: It features Mr. Piccoli's collaborations with Luis Buñuel (Diary of a Chambermaid, showing on Tuesday), Jacques Demy (Une Chambre en Ville, on Sunday, and The Young Girls of Rochefort, on Sunday and Tuesday) and Marco Ferreri (Dillinger Is Dead, on Wednesday and March 23, and La Grande Bouffe, from Saturday to Monday and on Thursday), plus another chance to catch the recent revival of Jacques Rivette's great La Belle Noiseuse (on Monday).

After Mr. Gillis was fired, Mr. Yang tweeted that the comedian had reached out to him. Looks like we will be sitting down together soon, Mr. Yang wrote. Neither the comedian nor the candidate appears to have spoken publicly about the content of the meeting.
I mean, you could make it so it's analogous to what happened in the tobacco industry, where there's a certain level of revenue that gets set aside and then you have various public service announcements.
Aisha Harris: Back in September, you actually spoke out on behalf of the comedian Shane Gillis, who had been hired on SNL and then was quickly fired after some racist comments were stirred up that he had made in the past on one of his podcasts. And you said you didn't want to be judged for something you had done 25 years ago. But Gillis's comments were maybe a year ago. So I'm curious as to, in your mind, how long of a period of time should it be before someone faces some sort of consequences for something they've done in the past?

It went on to win accolades at smaller festivals across the globe and is still riding high. It has a 99 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and, in December, The New York Times critic A.O. Scott named it the best movie of 2019.
People who study marriage, or work with couples in therapy, as I do, talk about the need for a we story, a collaboration between partners about values and goals. But if couples are going to collaborate, they have to figure out how to have a productive conversation. A conversation — as opposed to parallel monologues — involves two people who are making an effort to understand each other. In the grip of strong emotion, productive conversation can be surprisingly hard.
It should not be supposed that intellectual converts to Catholicism were reliably more liberal in their outlook than born Catholics. The convert who is more punctilious in his new faith than the lifelong communicant is a familiar figure in Catholic lore, and the nineteenth and twentieth centuries provided plentiful examples of such characters. The most notable was Henry Manning, the Anglican archdeacon of Chichester, who converted in 1851 and rose in the next fifteen years to leadership of England's Catholic community, becoming archbishop of Westminster in 1865 (cardinal from 1875). Manning supported papal infallibility, as did Newman's former Oxford colleagues William George Ward and Frederick Faber, and the American convert Augustine Hewit. Subsequent Catholic historians, most of them opposed to the Ultramontane position, have given Manning in particular a bad press and found Newman's antiinfallibilist views much more palatable. But we should remember that to Manning Ultramontanism seemed to be the most liberating position. Like many of the converts, he hated the subordination of the Church of England to the civil state; indeed, he left it in protest over the Gorham case of 1851, in which the state overruled an Anglican bishop and installed as parish priest a man he considered a heretic. Setting up the papacy as a powerful counterweight to the state seemed to Ultramontanists the surest way of assuring themselves of religious and intellectual freedom.
Our marriage suffered, mostly because our once shared burdens of work and home now fell so much more on me. But there were also surprising upsides. Early in our relationship, Christian had resisted getting a dog, even though I wanted one, because of how it would tie us down and hamper our travel. Neither of us wanted children and he'd happily gotten a vasectomy. Now he expressed a desire for both dogs and children, and talked about reversing his vasectomy, making me second guess my decisions.

Well, one of the joys of running for president is you get to know incredible people on the trail, including some of the other contenders. I'm on the record saying I would prefer to have a female running mate. I think teams run better if you have men and women leaders at the highest possible levels. I joke, but it's mostly true, that if you get too many men alone for too long, we kind of become morons. So we need to keep that from happening at the highest levels.
Growing up near the Oaklawn Park racetrack in Hot Springs, Ark., Mr. Jolley never wanted to do anything but follow his father, Moody, into the business of training thoroughbreds. He was a hot walker at age 7 — walking horses after a workout to cool them off — and later an assistant trainer.
Pete is unusual in a business full of potty mouths in that he has a Christian background and works clean, which could be interesting. But it's an attribute that the show doesn't so much explore as merely mention from time to time. In truth, the show doesn't explore much of anything; it, like its central character, just meanders along.

Like TB and cancer before it, autism can accumulate moral weight. In Louise Erdrich's Four Souls (2004), a white settler who has despoiled the Minnesota pine forests and cheated its Ojibwe inhabitants subsequently endures the immolation of his business empire as well as the birth of a son with vacant eyes, the very picture of idiocy, who makes hideous sounds and cannot be soothed out of his gross repetition. Here is the transfiguration of a neurobiological disease into one that lays waste to the mind, taking along with it all the qualities that make us human. In Lake Success, the protagonist eventually returns home to his son, and — just as Little Eva's beautiful tubercular fade in Uncle Tom's Cabin spurs her father to promise to free his slaves — in Shteyngart's novel, autism becomes a vehicle for the father's spiritual growth.
[MUSIC PLAYING] When you walk in the room, do you have sway?
The scholars, artists and musicians I met over four days embodied that complexity. They all shared some version of the same story: of boundary crossing, first by their parents, then by themselves, in lives that unavoidably tested rigid racial assumptions and expectations. For all that, they seemed comfortable in their skins, and strikingly creative: A singer-songwriter, Kat McDowell, of New Zealand and Japan, trying to make it in Los Angeles. A pop and hip-hop trio, the Yano Brothers, who were born in Ghana, grew up in Japan, and rapped smoothly in Japanese. Tetsuro Miyazaki, a Belgian-Japanese photographer. Jeff Chiba Stearns, a Japanese-Canadian filmmaker whose documentaries include One Big Hapa Family.
There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and the tired. — F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby
Unless we begin to make use of our competitive advantage--as teachers, communicators, scholars, advocates, and strategists--we will lose our children and grandchildren to the seductive drift toward assimilation and away from Jewishness. The fundamental changes we must make will require a reordering of our priorities away from an almost exclusive focus on defending Jews against external enemies and toward new ways of defending ourselves and our children against self-destruction through assimilation. We will have to educate our children differently, allocate our charitable giving differently, select our leaders differently--even define our very Jewishness differently. Jewish life will have to become less tribal, more open, more accepting of outsiders, and less defensive.
When you're bringing news of the kind I was bringing there are physical ramifications. The body feels concentrated. The body feels important. It has power, because it brings powerful truth. Say what you like about this news, but it's the truth. It's the truth. It is the case.
Revelations about Mr. Weinstein's treatment of women in The New York Times and The New Yorker set in motion the global #MeToo movement, a public reckoning about the harassment endured by women for centuries. The prosecution's case largely hinges on the jury believing the women's accounts; there is no physical evidence to support the allegations.
Are the female figures ever you?
In the early 1950s she took acting classes and was cast in several plays but did not have much success onstage. Her first film role was in 1957 in Le Jeu de la Nuit (The Game of the Night), but her career accelerated when Mr. Chabrol began casting her. In their almost two-dozen films, she often played a bourgeois woman.
Downtown, at CID, with its three thousand sworn, there are many departments and subdepartments, sections and units, whose names are always changing: Organized Crime, Major Crimes, Crimes Against Persons, Sex Offenses, Auto Theft, Check and Fraud, Special Investigations, Asset Forfeiture, Intelligence, Narcotics, Kidnapping, Burglary, Robbery--and Homicide. There is a glass door marked Vice. There is no glass door marked Sin. The city is the offense. We are the defense. That's the general idea.
Are you asking me if I believe that's the rule, or if that —
These are both thoughtful, textured performances. And if you believe that old quip defining good acting as not bumping into the furniture, then hand them a couple of Tonys.
Ms. Ingraham, 30, and Mr. Koster, 33, were youth leaders at Oak Hill Ranch, a therapeutic program for high-risk children. The demands of the job didn't allow much time for adult interaction, let alone a flirtation. But Ms. Ingraham did her best to let Mr. Koster know she was interested. There was the time they were out walking children around the ranch and she stepped on a wasp's nest: I was getting attacked by wasps and he was sweeping them off my legs and I was like, 'Adam, you are amazing,' Ms. Ingraham said. But he didn't think anything of it.

As hospitals overflow with Covid patients, ambulance teams face tough decisions. An ambulance near downtown Atlanta. You've got to worry — is there a breaking point? said the director for emergency services in one Georgia county. Credit... Dustin Chambers for The New York Times As the coronavirus has surged through the winter, some ambulance crews have struggled to keep pace with the number of patients requiring emergency care, and staffing and bed shortages at hospitals have led to hours of waiting to unload patients. Ambulance crews have been transporting the relentless tide of Covid-19 patients as the post-holiday surge accelerated: The United States reported 300,594 new cases on Friday and more than 4,100 deaths on Thursday, both single-day records. Hospitalizations remained at near-record levels, with 130,777 patients on Saturday, according to the Covid Tracking Project, while the nation's vaccine rollout is off to a slow start. In the Augusta, Ga., area, all three major hospitals were out of beds last week, said Steven Vincent, the vice president of Gold Cross EMS in Augusta. Waiting until a bed is available can sometimes take hours, he said, so ambulance crews have often opt to continue driving to other hospitals or trauma centers many miles away. Some hospitals have erected medical tents outside so that emergency medical service crews can split up, one member waiting with the patient and while the ambulance leaves to answer another call. Right now, our hospitals are completely full, Mr. Vincent said.
But this is even more true right now — there's nothing like a crisis to show how truly vulnerable this group of young people are as they transition to adulthood.
Mixing is happening all around, and the results can be surprising, wondrous, and unstoppable: Who knew that there were so many hapas in Holland? Yet in the hapa world, anxiety about breeding and bloodlines is never far from the surface. An essay in Hapa Japan recounts the paroxysms felt by some Japanese-Americans in California in the late 1970s, when an article in a newspaper of the Japanese American Citizens League warned that interracial marriage was a threat worse than a hundred million Manzanars, Tule Lakes, or Pearl Harbors.
Mr. Brandt made a career of trying to catch whatever wave was cresting on the pop-culture scene. With the Electric Circus, which he opened in 1967 on St. Marks Place in the East Village, it was psychedelia. With the Ritz, opened in 1980 a few blocks away, it was the exploding music scene of the MTV decade, with the shows he staged there — Parliament-Funkadelic, U2, Tina Turner, Ozzy Osbourne, Frank Zappa and countless others — reflecting the exploratory energy of the time.

Although she didn't know it at the time, Mr. Hocking was thinking the same thing.
Because you are then hyper-focusing on a very small screen.
archived recording (paul howard) We have had something quite remarkable that happened in this case, and it involves the testimony of the other officer, Devin Brosnan.
Robert Conrad, a television tough guy best known for his lead role in the mid-1960s series The Wild Wild West, died on Saturday at his home in Malibu, Calif. He was 84.
I guess if you look at it that way, and you're framing it that way, I still don't know if there's enough funding. But if you're talking in relation to, if we took calls away — I don't want to say away, but calls that aren't necessary for law enforcement, and we were able to — I don't know how we would do it, teach, or whatever the word you use, the public to call another number, then maybe, yeah, that may be something that would cause the cost factor to go down.
The more you learn about Pete, the more you understand Jess's interest in extracurricular activity. He's another example of the character that TV and films find inexplicably fascinating: the man-boy, in this case one who appears to have never had a job. He went straight from his mama's knee into an early marriage with Jess, who has been supporting him while he tries to break into stand-up comedy.
A little slice? Come on. No, I'm happy for that, and I know Showtime is happy for that.

Beverly McDonald, who owns the Norfolk branch of the soul food restaurant Croaker's Spot, said she was torn. If Mr. Northam was currently advocating for black communities, the past might not be such a big deal, said Ms. McDonald, who is black.
In 2003, J.T. sued the prosecutors who had hidden the evidence in his case for failing to train their lawyers on the importance of turning over favorable evidence. The jury, considering the blatant destruction of evidence in J.T.'s case, awarded him $1 million for every year he was on death row — $14 million in total.
Ms. Vidaurri retired from the stage in the late 1950s at the insistence of her husband and former booking agent, Hillman Edward Eden. (They later divorced.) She performed rarely until 2001, when Graciela Sánchez, director of the Esperanza Peace and Justice Center in San Antonio, invited her to sing at an 85th birthday celebration for Ms. Mendoza.
This is — I mean, this is going to make me very sad to say, but I feel like I had an arc or a relationship with President Obama, where it was inspirational when he won. I was celebrating with my wife in the streets. And then over the years I began to feel like we'd missed a great opportunity. So, I'd say there was some heartbreak attached to that. And I worked with the president afterward, and I still admire him a great deal, but I think we could have done a lot more, and I don't think opportunities like that come along very often.
BA: I want to ask you about the — Oh, sorry, go ahead.
Century: Can We Survive Our Success?
Recent Miller productions on Broadway have goosed the plays with counterintuitive casting, like the Mike Nichols Death of a Salesman, with its young Willy and reedy Biff, or radical staging, like the Ivo van Hove productions of The Crucible and A View from the Bridge. Mr. Kinney's quieter, more faithful style emphasizes the fine roles for actors but doesn't make a strong case for the play itself.
Yeah, you said you don't need 80 percent of Congress, you need a majority. And I would push back and say neither of those is correct. You need 60 percent of the Senate currently. The question is, how do you plan to get things done, even if you had a Democratic majority in the Senate? Which I think is right now less than an even chance. How do you propose getting your agenda through Congress when the filibuster is in place?
If there is one thing that this latest violation of online privacy teaches us, it is that — in the words of Scott McNealy, the chief executive of Sun Microsystems, back in 1999 — You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it.
The numbers. So keep in mind, I didn't just wake up and say, Hey, technology is changing the world. I spent seven years working in Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis, Baltimore and other cities that have been blasted by the waves of automation.
KK: I think we have some questions around economics.
Of course, Gerwig isn't the first to change the way Little Women gets told. People have been adapting, and then critiquing, and then adapting, and then critiquing it for decades — each iteration a kind of Rorschach test for how the world feels about women at the time.
With this divided consciousness, I am endlessly appreciative of The Reason I Jump (2013), a book by Naoki Higashida, a Japanese man with autism who is nonverbal and beset by behaviors that would, by conventional standards, cause him to be labeled, like my son, low-functioning.
After earning a third freestyle relay medal — his second gold — at the 2008 Beijing Games, Keller walked away for good. Having finally earned his bachelor's degree, he married and started a family. Once again, at least outwardly, he appeared to be moving forward with ease.

At the same time, hostility to Trump on the left can make it easy to overlook the shortcomings, such as they are, of the center-left political coalition in this country — and I think it is important that liberals, among whom I count myself, keep this in mind.
We should have 18-year term limits, increase the number of justices, make it so it's predictable that you lose an election, the other party might get one or two justices, and then we don't need to literally be monitoring the health of our justices. Or, the most ridiculous thing is you're literally looking at the age of the person you're appointing being, Ooh, this person will be there for 30, 40 years. What kind of system do you want where you're having a society decide 30 years ago what women's rights are today? Doesn't make any sense.
What I'm suggesting is we actually make capitalism's goals align with ours, as human beings, as parents, as Americans. Instead of maximizing these capital efficiency measurements, we should be maximizing our own health and life expectancy, our children's education and success rates, our mental health and freedom from substance abuse, our environmental sustainability. Then we can line up the power of the markets with how we are doing. But the markets do not care one whit about us and our children.
After appearing on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts in 1952, the McGuire Sisters soared to national fame. They were regulars on Mr. Godfrey's morning shows for six years and remained one of the nation's most popular vocal groups into the 1960s, singing on television, in nightclubs and on records that sold millions, even as teenage rebellion, Elvis Presley and rock ′n' roll transformed the music world.
In an essay published by the Gotham Gazette, Kimberly Watkins alleged that Mr. Yang fired her from Manhattan Prep because he did not think she would continue working as hard after getting married. Mr. Yang appeared on The View shortly after and said there was zero truth to Ms. Watkins's account. After publication, Ms. Watkins reached out to the editorial board, noting the question contained an error — she testified before a New York City hearing on pay equity, but, as she wroteto us , I have on multiple occasions drawn contrast to 'pay equity,' with what I experienced, which concerns long term economic stability. The reality that my economic future was destroyed by Yang, right after my marriage, after an unblemished six-year commitment to this company, has been the focus of my story, not pay inequity…Yang's response [also] grossly overstates the investigative process and draws a false conclusion.
Here's the — you're walking down the road, and I understand the questioning. But here's the problem that I see, how I see it. A lot of people are going to have this argument about race and systemic racism in law enforcement. The statistics don't prove it. And you go and pull nationwide, and you pull in certain cities and states law enforcement records. And I just did this, because I had to do this in front of the city council in Chattanooga, Tennessee. In 2019, use of force, 59 percent were white, 39 percent were Black. If you start looking nationwide, you start seeing similar percentages. So the issue is, statistically, the argument isn't there. My opinion — my opinion only — the statistics are not the issue. What the issue is, is the perception from the Black community that that is what's going on. So where we in law enforcement fall short is we don't change and help change that perception.
There has been a continuing controversy over Hong Kong's law banning masks to target anti-government protesters. One court ruling found it unconstitutional, but a later ruling temporarily reinstated it.
A California panel asked the publisher McGraw-Hill to avoid the use of the word massacre when describing 19th-century Native American attacks on white people. A Texas panel asked Pearson to point out the number of clergy who signed the Declaration of Independence, and to state that the nation's founders were inspired by the Protestant Great Awakening.
Judgment was issued by the characters and upon them. The members of the school community, interviewed about the killing that the show was keeping from us, were a catty Greek chorus. About Madeline (Reese Witherspoon), one of them said: She grew up wanting to be Betty Grable. Ended up Betty Crocker.
You were up in my grill. I loved it, the whole thing in the dark. It was fantastic.

or the seminarians at Mount Saint Mary's, there is little question about what will ultimately happen. We already know the end of the story, Bashista says. God will triumph. The church will triumph. That doesn't mean that the present trials aren't there. Think of fourth-century Aryanism, when two-thirds of the church, including bishops, didn't believe that Jesus was God! But the threats will never succeed. The essentials will never change. How do we know that? Because Christ said so. Still, they admit, the sheer magnitude of what they're up against in their wish to transform a largely indifferent world can be crushing at times. I always think of 'Cliffhanger,' says Magat, referring to the Sylvester Stallone thriller. They have to climb up the cliff with no ropes, going backward. That is our life. There's a lot of skepticism out there, a lot of cynicism. The easiest thing is to say, Forget it, this is not my responsibility. Let someone else do it. And I think that's what a lot of guys are saying when they don't answer the call to the priesthood. Bashista keeps a folder titled Thanks Be to God, in which he places any cards or letters he receives describing the impact he has had on people's lives. When he mentioned the folder to the others at the diner that winter night, each admitted that he, too, was amassing a similar file. There may come a day when I say, Was this all worth it? Holloway explained, as dessert was cleared away.
There was much speculation of a romantic attachment. A few months later, Mr. Ormsby Gore, a former British ambassador to Washington, proposed marriage. She turned him down.
The early 20th century, he noted, had brought us large-scale factories, efficient systems of transport, huge enterprises with disciplined work forces and pseudoscientific ideologies like eugenics. These were essential elements, alongside anti-Semitism, of Hitler's mass slaughter. Mr. Bauman argued that we must not celebrate the achievements of the modern age without also paying attention to its dark side.
So when I heard that Shane Gillis had called me Jew chink — I think was the slur — my reaction was the same reaction anyone would have, which was like, who the heck is this guy, and he sounds like a total jackass. Well, my wife actually had heard about it independently and was also like, Who the heck is this guy? And so then I sat down and started to figure out who Shane Gillis was, what he did for a living, and then I sat down and watched some of his comedy to try and get some context.
Donald Trump does not speak for every non-politician or nonmilitary officer. But there is a deep need, and you've seen this, because you spent time in D.C., the D.C. establishment will not generate big solutions.

I'm for a more progressive tax structure. It's clear that the people at the top of the income chain are not paying enough. I don't think a wealth tax will work. I like the spirit of a wealth tax, but if you look at other countries' experience, Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, very sophisticated developed countries, they tried a wealth tax and they wound up repealing it because it had massive compliance problems, and it did not generate anywhere near the revenue that was projected.
In 1947, the concern was Communism, and morality clauses gave studios a way to blacklist the Hollywood 10, a group of directors and screenwriters who denounced the House Un-American Activities Committee as illegitimate and refused to say whether they'd ever been Communists. All 10 went to jail, and all but one, who decided to cooperate with the committee, became unemployable until the 1960s, though some continued to write under pseudonyms.
I don't really remember when I pulled the black Everlane pants out of the drawer and onto my body. Was it spring, after the lockdown started and we were still doing videoconference happy hours for fun? Or the summer, when the rhythms of remote work seemed to settle in? Or the fall, when I began to see my co-workers do things like put on earrings for a meeting while I was still trying to keep the camera off for as long as possible?
With rampant state violence and the absence of any semblance of justice, Egyptian society is beyond polarized — it is broken. The targeting and dehumanization has extended beyond Islamists. Now anyone who dares to challenge the status quo is demonized. Families remain strained, political differences seem existential, dinner tables still have empty seats. Many weddings, birthdays and funerals are missed because of imprisonment, exile or exclusion. The hate, anger and vengeance have somehow overrun human decency.
Right now we have three flagship numbers we're beating the American people over the head with, telling them that things are going great. No. 1, the headline unemployment rate. No. 2, gross domestic product, which is obviously putting up record highs even as our life expectancy is declining. And No. 3, corporate profits and shareholder value. Stock market prices correspond to the fortunes of the top 20 percent of Americans, many of the people, obviously, who live here in Manhattan. The bottom 80 percent of Americans own 8 percent of stock market value. The bottom 50 percent own essentially zero.
The numbers. So keep in mind, I didn't just wake up and say, Hey, technology is changing the world. I spent seven years working in Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis, Baltimore and other cities that have been blasted by the waves of automation.
Inauguration security With heightened security underway, officials try to offer assurances that the inauguration will be safe. National Guard troops deployed to the Capitol stood guard on Thursday near where the inauguration will happen next week. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times In a briefing with Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday, federal law enforcement officials sought to assure the public that the inauguration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Jan. 20 would be safe after the widely publicized security failures that allowed supporters of President Trump to violently storm the Capitol last week. Christopher Wray, the director of the F.B.I., acknowledged that the bureau was seeing an extensive amount of concerning online chatter surrounding the inauguration — including plans for armed protests both in Washington and at state capitol buildings around the country — and said agents were trying to distinguish real threats from aspirational plotting. Mr. Wray added that the F.B.I. had arrested more than 100 people and identified more than 200 suspects since the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, and said, Anyone who plots or attempts violence in the coming week should count on a visit. James Murray, the director of the Secret Service, said he had been asked how Americans could be confident in inauguration security given the violence last Wednesday, which led to several deaths.
To those who believe that an emphasis on Jewish ethics will be enough to transmit the essence of Judaism to our children, I say, Maybe you are right. Certainly many Jews, especially secular Jews, agree with you and hope you are right. But beyond broad generalities, it is difficult to distill from the highly diverse Jewish sources a few programmatic essences that are easily transmittable from generation to generation, without living the kind of Jewish lives that our grandparents lived.
No you're not wrong, Colonel Tom. But the minute you really go into someone. You and I both know that there's always enough pain.
For thousands of years, Jews have been embattled. Surrounded by enemies seeking to convert us, remove us, even exterminate us, we have developed collective defense mechanisms highly adaptive to combating persecution by anti-Semites. But we have not developed effective means of defending the Jewish future against our own actions and inactions. This is our urgent new challenge--to defend the Jewish future against voluntary self-destruction--and we must face it squarely, if we are to prevent the fulfillment of Isaiah's dire prophecy Your destroyers will come from your own ranks.
After asserting that those groups responsible for seeking American entanglement in European affairs were the British, the Jewish and the Roosevelt Administration, he went on to say: It is not difficult to understand why Jewish people desire the overthrow of Nazi Germany. The persecution they suffered in Germany would be sufficient to make bitter enemies of any race. No person with a sense of the dignity of mankind can condone the persecution the Jewish race suffered in Germany. But no person of honesty and vision can look on their prowar policy here today without seeing the dangers involved in such a policy, both for us and for them. Instead of agitating for war, the Jewish groups in this country should be opposing it in every possible way, for they will be among the first to feel its consequences. Tolerance is a virtue that depends upon peace and strength. A few far-sighted Jewish people realize this and stand opposed to intervention. But the majority still do not. Their greatest danger to their country lies in their large ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio and our government. The speech evoked a nationwide outcry. Lindbergh, it was said, had not only impugned the patriotism of American Jews, but also had used the word race, a word many Jews considered both pejorative and inaccurate. Lindbergh never withdrew his remarks, which he considered statements of obvious fact.
But the pandemic has altered his timeline — and in a surprising way.
The challenge is to move the Jewish state of mind beyond its past obsession with victimization, pain, and problems and point it in a new, more positive direction, capable of thriving in an open society. For unless we do, we may become the generation that witnesses the beginning of the end of one of the most influential civilizations in the history of our planet--a unique source of so much goodness, compassion, morality, creativity, and intelligence over the past several millennia. The demise of Jewish life as we have come to know it would be a tragedy not only for the Jewish people collectively, but also for most of us individually--and for the world at large.

The authors delineated between first wave digisexuality (online pornography, hookup apps, sexting and electronic sex toys), where the tech is simply a delivery system for sexual fulfillment, and second wave digisexuality. Those practitioners form deeper relationships through immersive technologies like virtual reality, augmented reality and A.I.-equipped sex robots, sometimes obviating the need for a human partner altogether.
His grades were poor and he left after a year and a half, but not before learning how to shoot quarters out of the outstretched fingers of his friend at 50 feet with a rifle. From Wisconsin, he motorcycled to the Nebraska Aircraft Corporation in Lincoln, which was then producing an airplane and giving flying lessons to promote the product. I can still smell the odor of dope [cellulose acetate or nitrate] that permeated each breath, he said years later in recalling his first close-up view of an aircraft. Lindbergh took his first flight April 9, 1922. In succeeding months he learned to fly, to wing- walk and to parachute. Of equal importance, he absorbed all there was to know about the planes of that day and the various styles of flying. And he made friends with fliers who passed through Lincoln and with Harlan A. (Bud) Gurney, with whom, among others, he barnstormed over the Midwest. Called Slim by his friends because of his lithe, gangling body and 6-foot-2 1/2-inch height, Lindbergh was billed to the public as Daredevil Lindbergh for his stunt feats. However, he did not solo until April, 1923, when he purchased his first plane, a Jenny, in Georgia. Shortly afterward he began to earn his living as a flier by taking up passengers in various towns at $5 a ride.
The verdict brings to an end what is surely one of Canada's most gruesome killings, made all the more interesting by the fact that it happened in the wealthy and virtually crime-free enclave of West Vancouver, Mr. Johnson said.
Ms. Audran was born Colette Suzanne Dacheville in Versailles, France, on Nov. 8, 1932. Her father, a doctor, died when she was young, and she was raised by her mother.
Alex Kingsbury: Another thing the country's invested in quite a lot is the military, and as commander in chief, you'd be in charge of that. Can you tell me how many aircraft carriers the United States Navy has?
Kings of Leon, Felix Jaehn, San Fermin and more pop and rock concerts.
Earmarking allows Congress to appropriate discretionary funds for specific projects. Mr. Yang supports them because he feels they allow representatives to generate revenue for their constituents to offset costs their area might experience from a given piece of legislation.
A working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that U.B.I. could redirect spending to more affluent and middle-income families, therefore leaving low-income families worse off; a U.B.I. large enough to direct more funds to low-income households would be extremely costly. Read the paper here.
In the same way marxism, for complex political and intellectual reasons, lost its allure; its predictions were falsified, its scientific pretensions exposed as a sham, and it too became closely linked with a brutal tyrant, Stalin, whose career in scientific politics was almost enough to give political science itself a bad name. The failure of the alternatives does not, in itself, demonstrate the correctness of the Catholic faith, to be sure, but it lends credence to the Catholic opposition to marxism and eugenics. It seems now that dogmatic Catholics enjoyed an insulation against some of the utopian currents that swept the Western nations in the first half of this century. It would be rash today to say that Catholicism was wrong when its adversaries were right. Our age, more jaded and skeptical in the face of successive disappointments, can pay it at least backhanded compliments, acknowledge its strengths as well as its weaknesses, and recognize that it provided the standpoint from which to make a telling critique of its secular rivals.
These large paintings would have been displayed in the reception rooms of Rauwaert's grand Amsterdam house. What did visitors think about all these lovingly limned male limbs? Probably nothing at all. Like the art historians who followed them centuries later, they would have remarked only on the thematic content. When the American art historian Julie L. McGee published a pioneering biography of Cornelis in 1975, she saw in The Massacre of the Innocents simply the theme of religious persecution, timely for Protestant resistors (Cornelis himself was raised Catholic) to Spanish rule. Pieter Van Thiel, in the compendious Cornelis catalogue raisonné that was his life achievement, ignores any homoerotic content in the oeuvre and writes, risibly, that a tepid late painting provided evidence that he possessed more libido than he usually showed. A more recent article by Lisa Rosenthal, an associate professor of art history at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, analyzed The Marriage of Peleus and Thetis of 1592-3 as a commentary on civic virtue. In the four centuries since Cornelis's death, only Hyman, in a 2016 essay, has addressed the randy elephant in the room.
But there is more--much more--to Jewish identity than collective self-defense. There is something important that is worth defending. After all, until anti-Semitism changed from religious bigotry to racial bigotry--roughly near the end of the nineteenth century--persecuted Jews generally had the option of conversion. Unlike Hitler, our religiously inspired persecutors--the Crusaders, the Inquisitors, Martin Luther, and the pogromists--did distinguish between Jews who converted to Christianity and Jews who did not. Indeed, it was precisely their religious mission to convert the Jews, by whatever methods it took.
Some of the policies Mr. Blinken is now reviewing are decisions that were issued in the final days of the Trump administration and were clearly designed to box in Mr. Biden, said Anne W. Patterson, a former career diplomat.
BA: But we also have record low unemployment, and when you mention labor force participation, some people think a big factor there is that the government already is giving people too much money.
I think the number of aircraft carriers is either seven or nine. I confess to not knowing precisely. In terms of our investment, we're spending $650 billion plus on our military. Certainly more than any other country, but I think more than the next four countries combined, and we have to examine, at this stage, whether that $650 billion is making us safer and more secure.
In addition to the nine we already have. I believe that — so if you look at the Constitution, there is nothing there that stipulates the number of Supreme Court justices. We've had fewer than nine, we've had more than nine. I think that appointing new justices would be helpful on several levels. It would help depoliticize the process, at least marginally, because if you have 17 justices and one steps down, then it's not as much of an earthquake. Well, right now we we're hinging our laws on the health of an octogenarian. It would literally be rational for us to all just to follow Ruth Bader Ginsburg around and just scrub any door knob she touches. You know what I mean?
McGraw-Hill, the publisher whose annotated Bill of Rights appears differently in the two states, said it had created the additional wording on the Second Amendment and gun control for the California textbook. A national version of the pages is similar to the Texas edition, which does not call attention to gun rights, the company said in a written statement.
Mr. Yang has scored internet points with some tweets paying tribute to former 2020 Democratic rivals, for example by tweeting I miss Beto.

When did Murray first realize she was black? Neumann asks, and her answer is instantaneous, her calm certainty in perfect counterpoint to his squirming self-consciousness.
So the clearest emblem of this is NASA and space travel where we all watched the Apollo 13 movies and we've seen the armies of research scientists helping launch these missions. Now where those research scientists? They're all at Space X and Blue Origin and they're there working for the tech guys who are putting billions into it. It's going to be very, very difficult to somehow reverse essentially decades of talent migration into the private sector. And if you're a talented kid out of Stanford, why would you work for the federal government? It's like if you're working in the private sector, you feel like you're going to go faster, you're certainly going to get paid more. You're going to be working with smarter people and you idolize Elon Musk, like who the heck, you know?
Texas struck that requirement in 2018, but its most recent textbooks, published in 2016, will reflect it for years to come.

WHITNEY CUMMINGS at Carolines on Broadway (April 7-8, 7:30 and 10 p.m.). Ms. Cummings became a household name in 2011, when she created and starred in the NBC sitcom Whitney and also created — with Michael Patrick King — the CBS hit 2 Broke Girls. Since then, she's branched out into directing and writing, all while continuing her successful stand-up career. A veteran of the Comedy Central roasts, she has a skill for sharp insult comedy, but her material consists mostly of observational comedy about sex and dating.
Most American laborers work in the services sector, according to Pew Research — in July 2019, 107.8 million people worked in private service-providing industries including trade, transportation and utilities.
The bill, which has been passed by the cabinet, must now be adopted by the country's conservative Parliament to become law, but women's advocates are hopeful of success.
If you look at our proposals, we have a tax on financial transactions, which would obviously end up falling most heavily on the wealthiest Americans and the wealthiest companies. We have a carbon tax, which tends to fall most heavily on the wealthiest industries, which are emitting a lot. The value-added tax would obviously be enormously generative from people who benefit from society and consume the most. I'm for trying to restore our income tax levels to previous levels to be more progressive.
With their infant daughter in tow, Babak and Neda head home from a night of friends, drinks and Mafia. But Babak's driving is impaired from the libations, so the family stops to stay overnight at a nearby hotel. There, the evening begins its descent from confusion to horror. The couple begins to encounter strange figures — a babbling drifter on the hotel steps, an ominous desk clerk, a woman who wanders in silence, a child who calls for his mother.
In case it's slipped your mind, Dear Sir, let me remind you: I am your wife, the novel begins. These are the words of Vanda, writing to Aldo, who has left after 12 years of marriage to move in with Lidia. You see us as an obstacle to your happiness, a trap that smothers your desire for pleasure, she writes. It is 1974, and politics are in the background. You came across a respectable young girl close at hand and in the name of sexual liberation and the dissolution of the family you became her lover, Vanda asserts. You'll go on like this forever, you'll never be what you want, just what happens by chance.
New York is moving from caboose to locomotive, said Blair Horner, the executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, adding, New York has been in the obstacle-creating business, as opposed to the obstacle-smashing business when it comes to voting.

Magat, who worked as a health-care consultant before entering the seminary, learned that some colleagues were wondering if he was gay after he divulged his intention to be a priest. At first I felt emasculated, he says. I had a nave view of what people thought about priests; in my home environment and my family, priests are upheld as pillars of the community. In fact, there is a concern among some within the church that the proportion of gay men entering the priesthood has risen sharply. Magat and Bashista claim that they are not aware of gay men at Mount Saint Mary's, but say that it shouldn't matter if some seminarians have homosexual inclinations, since anyone seeking to become a Catholic priest, straight or gay, is striving to live a celibate life. The conversation drifts to another, darker presumption about the sexuality of priests. Magat recalls an encounter he had recently in a supermarket. I was standing in line in my clerics, he says. The woman in front of me was checking out her groceries, and her young son in the shopping cart, probably 2 or 3, he was kind of looking at me, interested. I waved and said, 'Hi, how's it going?' and she pulled him out of the cart and away from me. I was just mortified.
Right. And I think for the people who are calling for reform, what you have just described as a problem is, to them, a problem as well. Police officers trained for one thing — public safety — being asked to respond to all manner of scenarios that are not pure questions of public safety, and then there being problems in those encounters that have now led people to question why police respond to those in the first place.
Conversion usually entailed a jolting loss of social status. George Tyrrell, a young Anglican from a poor but genteel Irish family, was intellectually convinced by Catholic arguments, but his biographer notes, he recoiled from `the dirt and tinsel, and flashy gew gaws' in the Catholic chapels, from the `essential commonness' of Romanism, and when he overcame his distaste and announced his conversion to his parents, what pained his mother was `that a son of mine should go to Mass with the cook.' Moreover, as David Newsome writes, the convert became, as it were, an exile in his own land.... In addition to the humiliation of social ostracism, the pain of severed friendships and the torment of past memories, there was the inescapable problem of beginning life again within an alien community, while recognizing that all one's past distinctions and achievements counted for nothing. It is difficult to find any example of an intellectual who derived either social or monetary gain from conversion. For many, on the contrary, the material and prestige losses were considerable. The many Anglican and Episcopalian priests who converted were especially hard hit. Being, in many cases, married, they were ineligible to join the Catholic priesthood and so faced an economically precarious future. One such married clergyman, T. W. Allies, reported extreme depression of spirits due to the utter destitution of my temporal fortunes.
Aisha Harris: Back in September, you actually spoke out on behalf of the comedian Shane Gillis, who had been hired on SNL and then was quickly fired after some racist comments were stirred up that he had made in the past on one of his podcasts. And you said you didn't want to be judged for something you had done 25 years ago. But Gillis's comments were maybe a year ago. So I'm curious as to, in your mind, how long of a period of time should it be before someone faces some sort of consequences for something they've done in the past?
I called my sister to say that I didn't know what Fuery would be, but I could tell he was going to be someone in my life, said Ms. Cheever, 31. We just clicked, I guess. I had never really felt that way about a guy before.
Still, the program was rushed and introduced without proper legislation, said Justice Pauline Nyamweya, one of the judges on the panel.
In Wuhan, residents savor ordinary pleasures that a year ago became forbidden hazards, like strolling along the historic Jianghan shopping street. Office workers jostle for seats on the subway, which was shut throughout the lockdown. Riverside restaurants, karaoke bars and music clubs are a hubbub of conversation and song that was unthinkable last year, and remains unthinkable for much of the world still in the grips of the pandemic.
Scot McCloughan, who signed on as the Redskins' general manager in January 2015, was dismissed a little more than two years into the four-year deal he signed back then, ending weeks of speculation about his future.
I want to counter what you have just described in those statistics and the idea that this is a question of perception rather than conduct in patterns. I'm sure you know some of this. Local and federal investigations have found what they describe as systemic racial bias in the Chicago Police Department, in the Baltimore Police Department, in the Ferguson Police Department. Now, in Ferguson, what they found was that Black drivers were more than twice as likely to be searched after being stopped as white drivers were. In New York City, where I live, data makes clear that police stopped and frisked Black and Latino New Yorkers at significantly higher rates than they actually represent in the city. About 83 percent of the stops during about a decade-long period involved Black and Hispanics, even though they make up about 50 percent of the city's residents. So 83 percent of stops, 50 percent of the city's residents. And in Minneapolis, just a few weeks ago, data showed that use of force against Black people in that city was seven times greater than it was against white people in the city. So the idea that it's just perception, rather than a documented, data-based conclusion about conduct, does not seem accurate. Because all of that data seems to point to a pattern of racial discrimination.
So this is not a left or a right idea, this is bipartisan. And many Republicans will see that this is going to be a huge win for their constituents, for rural areas, for red states on the interior. We don't need 80 percent of Congress to pass it, we just need a majority.
William Borders, a former foreign correspondent who rose to senior editing positions at The New York Times in a 46-year career there, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 79.
Paul McCartney came, Ms. Plimpton said, and sang, 'I Will' to me, my favorite Beatles song. She also got into an argument with Bill Murray about a comedian he didn't think was funny.
Well, thank you for saying so. Yeah, in 2019 dollars it must be at least $6,000. I've been a Democrat for years and years, and if you look at my alignment on the vast majority of issues, they're lock step with the Democratic Party. So it was very natural for me to run as a Democrat. I've ruled out completely any third-party bid because that would in my mind increase the chances of Donald Trump winning, and the mission is to defeat Donald Trump and help move the country forward.
The Shivering Soldier steps up to Mr. Dawson —
I feel that too, I said.
This contrasts with General Suleimani's public image, both at home and abroad, which, since 2013, has been propped up by a vast media campaign. I followed some of his media team during my research and saw how they produced films, documentaries and even music videos, in both Persian and Arabic, lionizing his feats against the Islamic State. Inside Iran, he consistently polled as one of the most popular figures in the regime. The fact that most of his activities took place outside Iran helped preserve his reputation in the often fractious politics of the Islamic Republic.
Labor force participation — the share of Americans either employed or actively looking for work — declined precipitously from the late 1990s, dropping to 62.7 percent in 2014 (its lowest rate since the Carter administration). Critics of President Obama liked to argue that this was because of government handouts. But there's a counterargument to be found in demographic trends — the Congressional Budget Office estimates that a sizable portion of the decline in labor-force participation is a result of the aging of the work force.
Now that the House has impeached Trump, what happens next? It is the first time in American history a president has been impeached twice. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times Minutes after the House voted to impeach President Trump a second time, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, threw cold water on the prospect of the Senate beginning an impeachment trial before Mr. Biden's inauguration next Wednesday. He endorsed a later start to the proceedings and in effect handed responsibility for the process to Democrats, who will soon control the chamber. Given the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents that govern presidential impeachment trials, there is simply no chance that a fair or serious trial could conclude before President-elect Biden is sworn in next week, Mr. McConnell said. In light of this reality, I believe it will best serve our nation if Congress and the executive branch spend the next seven days completely focused on facilitating a safe inauguration and an orderly transfer of power to the incoming Biden administration. Here's what we know about what happens next. How does the impeachment process work? After the House has impeached the president — the equivalent of an indictment in a criminal case — members of the Senate consider whether to remove him, holding a trial in which senators act as the jury. The test, as set by the Constitution, is whether the president has committed treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.
Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood is less a movie about the murderous Manson family than it is a homage to Tinseltown itself, every scene a love letter to the Los Angeles of a half century ago. With the film earning 10 nominations up and down the Oscar ballot, it is fair to ask: Does Hollywood love films about itself?
Research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology showed that when adults don't give children the whole truth, children work to fill in the gaps — and are then less likely to trust the adult. Victoria Talwar, a psychology professor at McGill University, has found that as children grow, they develop increasing confusion around truth and lies, especially when parents tell them lying is wrong, but then proceed to lie in front of them.

Mr. Trump canceled a planned news conference at a NATO gathering in December after a video circulated that showed world leaders including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Emmanuel Macron of France in what appeared to be a conversation mocking Mr. Trump.
After Merissa Gerson's knee surgery in March, her mother flew from Washington to visit and help out. But before her arrival, Ms. Gerson could hardly bear the thought of being in her mother's company for an entire week. When the visit was extended from five days to 53 because of a stay-at-home order in New Orleans, neither of them expected the hourslong stretches of time together would change their relationship for the better.
It's a progressive Protestant church. We primarily go upstate, where we have a house in a town called New Paltz. They've got a rainbow flag up front. It's a very welcoming community.
But Ms. Wolitzer, who is 58, wanted less to write some sort of State of Feminism novel than to explore ideas that have been marinating in her head for a long time.
Those two episodes, directed by the genre wizard Jeremy Saulnier (Green Room, Blue Ruin), evoked the poverty and fear of its small-town Arkansas backdrop, but they also did the unglamorous work of moving the story forward. Two kids were abducted. One is dead. The other is still missing. The urgency of that situation should be the engine that moves True Detective forward, even in the two later timelines, when the cold case has once more become hot.
The textbooks cover the same sweeping story, from the brutality of slavery to the struggle for civil rights. The self-evident truths of the founding documents to the waves of immigration that reshaped the nation.
A crisis is a terrible thing to waste is a quote attributed to the Stanford economist Paul Romer. He made the comment at a meeting in 2004, referring to the competition America faces from the rising education levels around the globe. Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's chief of staff, later echoed the statement after President Obama's election.
It would seem that the worst and most corrupt president in American history would be easy to remove. Yet tyrants around the world have come to power and stayed, because people did not take the threat seriously and consoled themselves with false assurances — He can't win, or It won't happen again — instead of doing the hard work to be sure it does not happen!
She has certainly furnished the play with all the original equipment. For starters, there's the zingy premise: Over dinner one night, Nancy, a retired librarian approaching 80, turns to Bill, her husband of 50 years, and calmly announces that she wants a divorce. All right, he answers, continuing to eat as the audience roars.
What I'm suggesting is we actually make capitalism's goals align with ours, as human beings, as parents, as Americans. Instead of maximizing these capital efficiency measurements, we should be maximizing our own health and life expectancy, our children's education and success rates, our mental health and freedom from substance abuse, our environmental sustainability. Then we can line up the power of the markets with how we are doing. But the markets do not care one whit about us and our children.
We need to modernize the court. Lifetime appointments might have made sense at one point a long time ago, but when the Constitution was drafted, people did not live as long. And also, people stepped down from the Supreme Court for any of a range of reasons. They did not wait until they were at death's door. This is not a way to run a 21st-century society.

Mr. Conrad's fearlessness and good looks served him well in Wild Wild West and many other shows, though he found the most satisfaction in some later, meatier roles, like the fur trader he played in the mini-series Centennial in the late 1970s.
Raised on Martha's Vineyard, Mr. Bryant was a seaman, a carpenter, a ditch digger, a logger, a cook and a dock builder. He was also a Dartmouth College graduate and a reporter and the managing editor of The Claremont Daily Eagle in west-central New Hampshire for more than a decade in the 1950s and '60s.
The front desk called to say I had a visitor: Colonel Rockwell. Frankly, I was surprised that he was up and around. My understanding was that the boys were down from Chicago and the phone was off the hook. The Rockwells were digging in.
Over and over during the semester, I heard you, too? as students discovered points of connection that bridged their distinct cultural experiences. We all found common cause with Sor Juana, a 17th-century nun from what is now Mexico, who avoided marriage and motherhood by taking religious vows, thus freeing her to write and study. A student from Pakistan remarked wryly that Sor Juana had the right idea because once she became a nun, people probably stopped introducing her to eligible bachelors.
His son LeRoy Jr. said the cause was lung cancer.
After watching his comedy, I felt that he wasn't a malignant racist and that his slur toward me was just very, very bad comedy run amok. Which did not strike me as a fireable offense, and I realized that if I was the individual who was actually directly slurred, and I did not feel that he should lose his job over it, then I should probably share that sentiment with other people.
It wasn't until 2013, after not hearing from her husband for 14 years, that Mr. Constantin's wife asked a court to declare him dead. With family and friends testifying that they had not heard from him since 1999, and the Turkish Interior Ministry saying they had no record of him for that period, the Romanian court concluded that he was most likely dead.
In 1998, according to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University, there were 47,582 active priests in America -- about 10,000 fewer than in 1975. The average age of a diocesan priest is now 58, and nearly a quarter of all priests are older than 70, the average age of retirement. Perhaps no institution in America faces a more severe personnel crisis than the Catholic Church. And it is likely to get worse. The total number of graduate seminarians in America last year was the lowest on record: 2,622, a drop of almost 70 percent from the 8,159 in 1967-8. This decline comes at a time when the number of Catholics in America, where they represent by far the largest religious denomination, has ballooned from 48.7 million in 1975 to 61.6 million today, largely as a result of Latin American and Asian immigration and population growth. The drop in vocations has been under way since the 1970's, when seminaries emptied precipitously, in part because of a disillusionment with celibacy. Meanwhile, families of Italian, Irish and Central European descent -- the old Catholic ghetto that, earlier in this century, was a major source of American priests -- have shrunk in size and risen to the middle class, broadening opportunities for their sons. More recently, the pedophilia scandals of the late 80's and early 90's have been a public relations catastrophe for the church.
Everyone knows my flagship proposal is this Freedom Dividend of $1,000 a month for every American adult, which is not a new idea. And it's not my idea. Thomas Paine was for it at the founding of the country. Martin Luther King fought for it and was fighting for it when he was assassinated. So after I'm the nominee and I defeat Donald Trump, everyone will know that I'm in the White House because of the Freedom Dividend.
The buyer, who was supposed to put down a large deposit that afternoon, was livid. The seller's broker tried to assure her that the problem could be easily fixed. But Mr. Fundaro spoke up. I turned around and said it's not a simple glue and patch fix, he said. He never found out what effect his findings had on the sale.

Regardless of the result, it will signal a new chapter for Germany and Europe, where the staid but steady leadership of Ms. Merkel has been a constant for the past 15 years. She earned respect for holding Europe together through repeated crises and, most recently, her deft handling of the coronavirus pandemic over the past year.
Considering the state's financial straits, Mr. Cuomo leaned heavily on proposals that would need little or no state funding, like banning gun ownership for people who have committed certain misdemeanor crimes in other states, banning foam food containers and outlawing synthetic opioids similar to fentanyl.
Almost certainly, yes. And you saw it a little bit with Barack Obama where he tapped Joe Biden in part because Joe had very deep relationships on Capitol Hill. If you had another outsider like me, we'd still be trying to figure out who to call. So, you need to have folks who have deep relationships on Capitol Hill from day one.
Court packing isn't a violation of any part of the Constitution, but it is widely debated with critics pointing out that it would trigger severe political backlash.
Growing up near the Oaklawn Park racetrack in Hot Springs, Ark., Mr. Jolley never wanted to do anything but follow his father, Moody, into the business of training thoroughbreds. He was a hot walker at age 7 — walking horses after a workout to cool them off — and later an assistant trainer.

And it's not just the leading edge N.S.A.-type stuff. If you look around congressional offices or the I.R.S., they're all using technology from the '90s or whatever it is. I had a whiz kid who said he got yelled at for writing a script in a congressional office that automated a task. They were like, No, we just wanted you to do it manually forever. So there needs to be a massive modernization effort. Not just in terms of how we recruit tech talent at the highest levels, but how we function even in the basics.
So why not have the argument? Is Woody Allen a great filmmaker? On what evidence might that conclusion rest? The accumulated body of critical opinion is helpful, partly because it shows that there has never been consensus. Mr. Allen had a great champion in Vincent Canby, The New York Times chief film critic from 1969 to 1993 — an appreciative note from the director was read at Canby's memorial service at the Museum of Modern Art in 2000 — and also his share of skeptics, among them Pauline Kael of The New Yorker, who ran hot and cold on his films.

It is rare to have consensus on the pre-eminence of any person in the arts. But few would argue that Mr. Mekas, who was often called the godfather or the guru of the New American Cinema — his name for the underground film movement of the 1950s and '60s — was the leading champion of the kind of film that doesn't show at the multiplex.
Lisa (Nina Hoss), a gifted Berlin playwright, stopped writing on the day that her beloved twin brother, Sven (Lars Eidinger), a celebrated theater actor, received his leukemia diagnosis. Since then, she's been living in artistic limbo in Switzerland, where her husband (Jens Albinus) teaches at a prestigious boarding school. But the demands of Sven's illness, and Lisa's inability to accept his decline, only tug her closer to her brother and further from her fracturing marriage.

The country boy led the Kushners to the farmhouse, where the owner recognized them from the fur store. She gave them bread, water, and onions, but ushered them on their way, afraid the Germans would kill her if she was discovered hiding Jews. Another group, coming after Rae and Lisa and Naum and the farmer boy, prevailed on the woman to let them stay. All eight of them, including the Polish woman and her husband, were killed when the Nazis discovered them.
One of the reasons why Donald Trump is our president is that millions of Americans feel like our government is unresponsive to our needs and the needs in our communities. They've been casting about for some sort of change agent for years. And it's not just Donald Trump's victory; it was Bernie Sanders outsized success. In some ways, it was even Obama's victory in 2008. If you remember that campaign, it was oh, hope, change. It was not, get the most experienced person in the seat as possible, because we are decades behind the curve in addressing the problems and challenges that are tearing us apart. Now ——
Proust's mother was pregnant with him during the Franco-Prussian War and the difficult aftermath of France's defeat, the period when Napoleon III was chased from the throne and a socialist commune was briefly declared in Paris before the Third Republic was at last established. During the months of war and the internecine street fighting, coal and wood supplies ran out and houses went unheated. In Paris the starving populace ate dogs and cats, even the animals in the zoo. As a result, Jeanne Proust was so weakened from hunger and anxiety that when Marcel was born he was sickly and fragile and at first not expected to live.

Lindbergh's youth was spent close to nature. His deep feeling for it was encouraged by his father, and these early attitudes surfaced toward the end of his life when he devoted much of his fantastic energies to the cause of conservation. Also early in life, he showed a marked aptitude for mechanical contrivances. When he was 8 or 9, he worked out an ingenious and complicated system for getting ice from the icehouse into the icebox. Charles's world was jolted when his father was elected to the House of Representatives, where he served from 1907 to 1917. He went to Washington, his first venture into a metropolis, and disliked it. About that time, his mother and father ceased living together, although for appearance's sake there was no legal separation and both parents took care to give the child a sense of security. Apart from saying that the separation was a tragic situation for his parents, Lindbergh shut his lips about the situation and shied from talking about the psychic hurts that he bore. He was equally taciturn on other personal matters. The future aviator's interest in flying was sparked in 1908 or '09, when, one day, he heard a buzzing in the sky and climbed out of a dormer window onto the roof of his home to witness a frail biplane skimming through the clouds.

I rode the subway maybe six weeks ago or so. It's become much more of a pain in the neck now that I actually get recognized. I confess that that's been the biggest adjustment in running for president. Because I was, No, I'm not going to get recognized on the street. Of course, keep in mind, when I started my run I was completely anonymous. I mean none of you had ever heard of me. And also there is, and this is not to make too much of it, but there's also this invisible Asian man thing. That you feel like all you have to do is just not want to be seen and then you disappear, and that doesn't work anymore.

FROM THE MID-NINETEENTH century to the mid-twentieth, a succession of English-speaking intellectuals converted to Catholicism. Since the Reformation almost no English-language writers of any influence had tried to advance the cause of the Catholic Church. When the church began to reassert itself in the nineteenth century, it used converts as its principal advocates. Outspoken, intellectually gifted, and impressed by their own example, Catholic converts said that they would show up the fallacies of Protestants and religious skeptics, end the long schism in Christendom, and place Catholics once more at the center of Western intellectual life.

A picture caption with an article on Saturday about the United Methodist Church's plan to split over same-sex marriage misstated the location of two churches shown in a collection of images. The church in the top-right image is in Winona, Minn., not Homer, Ark.; the church in the bottom right photo is in Highland Falls, N.Y., not High Falls, N.Y. The caption also referred incorrectly to the United Methodist Church. It is the second-largest Protestant denomination in the United States, not in the world.

They'll say, Yeah, yeah, I like you. Thousand bucks a month, something like that. And then they want to take pictures. And then as soon as someone breaks the seal, then it's safe for everyone to do it. And so, then I'll be — and then there's this uncomfortable period in this subway car after you've taken the pictures with him, you're still sitting there. And so then they're, So, where are you going? Or, how's Bernie? Or whatever the questions are. And so, I have not been riding the subway lately, but I've ridden the subway an awful lot over the years. Now my preferred mode of transportation is the bike, because if someone recognizes me, it's generally too late.

When Sharon suffers a debilitating medical setback, the tables of their relationship are turned, forcing Mel into the position of caretaker and Sharon into the spotlight. At the behest of Mel, who wants to use Sharon's recovery as the basis for their next feature, they delve deep into Sharon's past by way of the List: a secret compendium of every man with whom I have ever fallen in love, in which drawings of unseemly things appear. Using the List as their guide, the women set out on the road first to visit Sharon's family in Kentucky, and then to track down a boy she knew as a child, who holds the key to the traumatic memories that are haunting her.
PHILADELPHIA — Michael R. Bloomberg is gearing up for his second rally of the day, at the National Constitution Center, which more than 1,000 people are registered to attend. Milton and Phyllis Trachtenburg, who had heard about the event through a Facebook ad, were waiting in one of two long lines to get inside.
The juicy final episode of HBO's Big Little Lies revealed, as promised, who died and who done it. The murder mystery (if that death can be ruled a murder) was the least of the reasons to watch this mini-series — more on that later — but it did deliver on the minimal promise of the genre. At the end, we got a verdict.
So sought-after was a placement in the magazine that designers were known to send expensive gifts to win her over. In the 1990 Times Magazine profile, she admitted to accepting gifts from decorators who were her friends, but she denied that she could be so easily bought by what her critics called a rat pack of designer pals.
In the noisy House chamber, a lone Republican applauded. Five Republicans crossed party lines to vote against impeachment. Five Democrats broke with their party to support it.
I think we've watched everything on Netflix, said Arestov, who estimated they had lost about 95 percent of their income for the year. We're trying to stay positive. We can see a light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccines, but we've been juggling our finances because there hasn't been a lot of help from the government for our industry.
Now, Howard Beale is very different. I saw you in Network. I loved it. I was not sitting on the stage. My mother was sitting on the stage for one of the performances — she loved. He's a newscaster who famously said, I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore. It was a very famous movie. He threatens to kill himself on live TV. Tell me about Howard Beale's relationship to power because he's powerless at the beginning of the show, really. I mean, he's been this newscaster, in a traditional sense, and has to shift.
Now that the House has impeached Trump, what happens next? It is the first time in American history a president has been impeached twice. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times Minutes after the House voted to impeach President Trump a second time, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, threw cold water on the prospect of the Senate beginning an impeachment trial before Mr. Biden's inauguration next Wednesday. He endorsed a later start to the proceedings and in effect handed responsibility for the process to Democrats, who will soon control the chamber. Given the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents that govern presidential impeachment trials, there is simply no chance that a fair or serious trial could conclude before President-elect Biden is sworn in next week, Mr. McConnell said. In light of this reality, I believe it will best serve our nation if Congress and the executive branch spend the next seven days completely focused on facilitating a safe inauguration and an orderly transfer of power to the incoming Biden administration. Here's what we know about what happens next. How does the impeachment process work? After the House has impeached the president — the equivalent of an indictment in a criminal case — members of the Senate consider whether to remove him, holding a trial in which senators act as the jury. The test, as set by the Constitution, is whether the president has committed treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.
He vowed to elevate scientific research and thinking on topics like the coronavirus, cancer research, climate change, clean-energy jobs, artificial intelligence, 3-D printing and other fast-advancing technologies. The appointees included Eric S. Lander, whom Mr. Biden will nominate to be director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, a position that will for the first time hold cabinet rank. President Trump left the position of science adviser unfilled for 18 months and his administration routinely ignored the guidance of government scientists on issues ranging from the coronavirus pandemic to climate change. Without specifically mentioning Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris drew an implicit contrast with his administration's dismissive attitude toward expert opinion. The science behind climate change is not a hoax, Ms. Harris said during the introductions, held at the Queen Theater in Wilmington, Del. The science behind the virus is not a lie. Dr. Lander, who will also serve as presidential science adviser, was a leader of the Human Genome Project. As Dr. Lander's deputy in the science and technology office, Alondra Nelson, whom was also named by Mr. Biden, is a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study, who has studied the intersection of science with social inequality and race.
Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages — and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater.
Between network, cable and streaming, the modern television landscape is a vast one. Here are some of the shows, specials and movies coming to TV this week, Jan. 11-Jan. 17. Details and times are subject to change.
There's no question. If I felt, in my heart of hearts, that by doing the right thing, it would put my child in mortal danger and the threat is very real, I wouldn't put them in it.
So you're looking at a nation of high school graduates. And what do high school graduates do for a living? The top five occupational categories are retail and administrative, which includes call center work, retail, food service and food preparation, transportation, primarily truck driving, and attendant supportive jobs and manufacturing still. We all know that we have gutted many of these industries, and their labor bases have shrunk.
Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words
Mr. Reynolds racked up dozens more TV and film acting credits, including more than 40 in the 1950s, but by the end of that decade he had shifted his focus to directing and, soon after that, to producing.
On his first day in office, Mr. Biden recommitted the United States to the Paris climate agreement, the international accord designed to avert global warming; ended the ban on travel from predominantly Muslim and African countries; and stopped construction on the border wall.
That'd be my first question if I got in there, I'd be, All right, let me see them. Let's see what we've been hiding all of these years.
In a world where people use emojis to represent everything from weddings to poop, the announcement naturally led to much discussion, with an image of a drop of blood becoming a new way to talk about menstruation and a pinching symbol leading to jokes about a certain male body part being very, very small.
I was wearing a helmet. I have a staffer with the helmet as proof.
My students, my children, my friends' children--our next generation--understand our new status: they do not want to be regarded as victims. They do not feel persecuted, discriminated against, or powerless. They want to read the new good news, not the old bad news. A 1988 poll of Jewish students at Dartmouth College made the point compellingly: When asked whether they believed that their Jewishness would in any way hamper their future success, not a single student answered in the affirmative. That is the current reality, and it is different from the reality my parents faced--and even from the reality many of my generation perceived when we were in college or beginning our careers. The coming generation of Jewish adults will not remain Jews because of our enemies or because of our perceived status as victims. They crave a more positive, affirmative, contemporary, and relevant Jewish identity. Unless we move beyond victimization and toward a new Jewish state of mind, many of them will abandon Judaism as not relevant to their current concerns.
Yes. All of this is a prelude to say that, should some of the tech companies be asked to divest parts of their businesses? One hundred percent yes. Like Amazon should not be selling its own house brand to its advantage to other goods. These companies do have excessive power and influence. At this point you could argue they control our democracy.
The cause was respiratory failure, her son Richard Wilhelm said.
week after the museum trip, I joined the seminarians for Mass, which is at 7:00 each morning in Immaculate Conception Chapel, whose putty-colored walls are trimmed with gold and turquoise, and which smelled that morning of incense and after-shave. Many seminarians had been praying in the chapel since 6:15; prayer forms the core of the seminary experience, and the men talk about their prayer lives the way most people talk about their love lives. At times their prayer is strong, full and deep (some seminarians call this feeling the warm fuzzies); at others it is dry and without feeling, reverberating an emptiness through their lives. After morning Mass and breakfast, the seminarians attend classes, which include moral theology, philosophy, scripture and church history. During their fourth year, they practice celebrating the Mass and hearing confession, often from recent graduates, who return to campus and play the penitents, inventing sins for seminarians to hear. The Rev. Mark Moretti, one such volunteer who is now an associate pastor in Alexandria, Va., explained the purpose of such role playing: Are you able to judge what you're hearing? Are you able to give a suitable penance? If you have a little old lady coming in to confess her sins and you hammer her with a novena -- a penance lasting nine days -- you're too extreme. Bashista and the other deacons' first class this day was Marriage and Family, where seminarians were learning to prepare betrothed couples for marriage.
Alas, thrill-seeking and passion can only take a marriage so far and, now that we were living as a family, reality had set in. Gone was the Middle Eastern backdrop, the inexpensive four-bedroom house with the verdant garden. The City of Lights is as romantic as ever, but Paris, for me, represented a return to the responsibilities of adult life with its endless loads of laundry and the drudgery of putting dinner on the table every night.
A crenelated wall of books encircles my bed, its tottering towers looming ever taller, always on the verge of collapsing onto oblivious sleepers. Today it contains The Arab of the Future, by Riad Sattouf;  Russian Criminal Tattoo Encyclopaedia, by Danzig Baldaev and Sergei Vasiliev; Americanah, by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; Grant, by Ron Chernow; Home Fire, by Kamila Shamsie; The President's Gardens, by Muhsin al-Ramli; and right now I am reading a scholarly but gripping history of the Wars of Succession after the death of Alexander the Great — Dividing the Spoils, by Robin Waterfield.
GRIST MILL ROAD, by Christopher J. Yates. (Picador, $18.) A gruesome act of violence connects three teenagers, who stay linked to one another for the rest of their lives. As more is revealed about the crime, this thriller raises questions of guilt, culpability and forgiveness. As our reviewer, Sarah Lyall, put it, You have to work hard to follow the winding road Yates sends us down, and the drive is full of pleasantly unpleasant surprises.
One night, after one of these songs ended, I found myself writing a story about our story's end. I wrote it on an empty envelope that had been addressed to us as I sat by our records and the map on the wall. As I was cutting a pizza, I wondered idly who would get the pizza slicer. I thought about how I would make eggs only for one. As I wrote, I felt as if I were on the outside looking in, making a decision without being a part of it. Being on the inside would have hurt too much.
'The Bong Show' opens at Film at Lincoln Center. Bong Joon Ho's Parasite was one of the best films of 2019, but it's just the latest in the South Korean filmmaker's strong body of works, most of which comment on humanity (or the lack of it) in some manner. He combines showmanship with social awareness in a way that re-energizes the faded but nonetheless durable democratic promise of movies, A.O. Scott wrote about the filmmaker. Most of his films are available on streaming platforms, but all of his films will be screened as part of this retrospective. From Jan. 7-14; filmlinc.org.
But remember, the sympathetic part is that he has this tremendous ambition to do good, to be a righteous man, and remember what you talked about, his deep insecurities. Well, doesn't bullying come from insecurity, really? So that's where that stems from, his fear of failing and oh my god, I'm going to be known as the worst president. It drives him to force his will upon people and give him what was called the Johnson treatment.
The books not only covered blissful sex but also described a whole range of intimate moments, from the awkward to the funny to the very bad, including rape of both the stranger and intimate-partner variety. Beyond the dirty bits, the books I read described the moments before and after the main event, the stuff you don't see in mainstream movies, where zippers don't get stuck and teeth don't bump when you're kissing; the stuff you don't see in porn, where almost no time elapses between the repair guy's arrival and the start of activities that do not involve the clogged kitchen sink.
Let's say I'm on food stamps, and I've got a 15-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. I'm concerned about their future, very, very deeply. And then Andrew Yang becomes president, and I find out that my 15-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month starting at age 18 for the rest of his life, and my 12-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month for the rest of her life. I'm going to say, wow. That's actually the biggest value gain I've ever even heard of in history. My kid will have a financial literacy class in high school, the first semester of their senior year. It is impossible to teach financial literacy to someone who does not have money. So the kids will actually learn about what to do with the money before they start getting the money.
Hi, Mr. Champion. Nice to meet you.
CW: More than they already are. Right.
Christopher Little, who as a struggling literary agent took a chance on a scrappy submission about tween-age wizards — even though he once disdained children's fiction as a money-loser — and built it into the most successful literary empire in history on the strength of its lead character, Harry Potter, died on Jan. 7 at his home in London. He was 79.
It's been going on far too long, the narrator declares. We can't laugh it off.
You say we must draw this to a close, Watts continued, I say we must draw a line between right and wrong, not with a tiny fine line of an executive fountain pen, but with the big fat lead of a No. 2 pencil. And we must do it so every kid in America can see it. The point is not whether the President can prevail, but whether truth can prevail.
However, I believe that the priorities favored by the more progressive candidates make them more electable: accessible and affordable health care, a Manhattan Project to combat climate change, regulations targeting corporate and government corruption, affordable college education and a more progressive tax system designed to decrease income inequality.
Fresh from Yale, Mr. Borders joined The Times as a copy boy in 1960. Promoted to reporter, he was assigned over the years to cover Nigeria, Canada, India and Britain before being appointed deputy foreign editor in 1982.
At the same time, hostility to Trump on the left can make it easy to overlook the shortcomings, such as they are, of the center-left political coalition in this country — and I think it is important that liberals, among whom I count myself, keep this in mind.
Mr. Yang's campaign estimates that federally regulating the U.S. online poker market could raise $2.2 billion just in its first year. The campaign also argues that federal regulation would make it easier to combat money laundering.
Admit it: Wouldn't you love to have Neil Gaiman come to your home and read stories to you? Yeah, you would. Or I would anyway. Ideally in one of those glass-ceilinged igloos in some Scandinavian country. Specifically, I'd like him to read from the material that has so deeply informed the otherworlds of his phenomenal fiction: the Norse myths, those ancient and weird tales.
Here, courtesy of an obscure New York City agency, is a window into the unseen, a forum for matters of fallibility and trivia and also for outrages that have managed to become the business of the government.
It feels like the opposite of Instagram, said Emma Doany, 29, a nursing student who lives in Austin, Texas, and regularly watches the videos, favoring channels like The Secret Slob and Jamie's Journey, which to her seem authentic because the mess looks real and not staged. She often feels anxious that the three-bedroom house she shares with her husband doesn't look perfect. Seeing someone else battle a sink full of dishes somehow takes the pressure off. I watch 'Clean with Me' videos to make myself feel better, like, 'I'm not a hoarder,' she said.
Since 1982, Alaska has been giving every resident an annual check from its $66.3 billion permanent fund, which gets at least 25 percent of the state's mineral royalties every year. The results of the experiment have been mixed — crippling poverty is low, but unemployment rates are among the highest in the country, and the fund's value fluctuates with oil prices.
I only watched it because I deal with billionaires all the time covering tech, and I know that billionaire, those wacky billionaires.
I haven't sat down with a lot of sitting senators and congressmen and women, but I've talked to literally thousands of people who supported Donald Trump in the last election who say they are now supporting me. I've talked to many folks who are Republicans who say they are, at least, sympathetic to my message, in large part because they understand the numbers. When I talked to 70 C.E.O.s here in New York City, not that far from here, it was a fancy bank office, most of them were Republicans. I said, How many of you are looking at replacing your back-office clerical workers with artificial intelligence and software? Guess how many hands went up out of 70. All of them. The truth is, you should fire any C.E.O. who was not looking to make that happen, because their incentives are all tied to the bottom-line profitability of their firm. And most of them were Republicans. So they understand the need for what I am proposing.
Jesse Wegman: Is the inside of the helmet warm?
Mr. Yang has prided himself on injecting the race with new thinking through proposals like yearlong daylight saving time. Daylight saving time was instituted during World War I for energy-efficiency purposes. Mr. Yang argues that extending it year-round would decrease traffic accidents, increase economic activity and lower crime.
After a decade of deliberation, Iran's government approved a bill on Sunday that criminalizes violence and sexual misconduct against women and specifies punishments for perpetrators.
It paves the way for L.G.B.T.Q. Bermudians to become society's scapegoat, to be blamed for any slide in foreign tourism and negative impact on the country's economy. It risks increasing discrimination against a minority group whose rights have already been breached by the revocation of marriage equality.
When she was older, teaching part-time at the University of Maryland, she was told that she wasn't being hired for a full-time job because you come on too strong for a woman. Another interviewer complained that women stayed home when their children were sick. Another rejected her by saying that she was just a housewife who went back to school.
You're talking about the need for change. And I wonder, just to start, what your views are on what needs to change in policing.
One of the reasons why Donald Trump is our president is that millions of Americans feel like our government is unresponsive to our needs and the needs in our communities. They've been casting about for some sort of change agent for years. And it's not just Donald Trump's victory; it was Bernie Sanders outsized success. In some ways, it was even Obama's victory in 2008. If you remember that campaign, it was oh, hope, change. It was not, get the most experienced person in the seat as possible, because we are decades behind the curve in addressing the problems and challenges that are tearing us apart. Now ——
Once, a senior associate for whom I was working berated me for such a mistake and said, Getting these things right is the easy part, and if you can't get that right, what does it say about your ability to analyze the law properly? I learned my lesson. To restore the focus-training function of the classroom, I stopped allowing laptops in class early in my teaching career. Since then research has confirmed the wisdom of my choice.
In 1959, he started driving Grand Prix cars for the Ferrari factory of Italy for $130 a week plus half of his prize and starting money. He earned $7,500 that year. By 1970, when he retired after 15 years of racing, he had won Grand Prix races in France, Mexico and Belgium.
If The Animators suffers from the debut novelist's curse of trying to do too much, Whitaker's obvious talent with dialogue and establishing a sense of place prevents it from feeling weighed down. Also, the intensity of the working relationship between these two flawed women keeps the momentum of the novel alive.
Over the weekend, infections soared across the West and South, with 42,000 new cases identified on Saturday alone. Texas and Arizona reported a record number of hospitalizations, and testing sites in Florida turned people away because lines became so long.
BLACK EDGE: Inside Information, Dirty Money, and the Quest to Bring Down the Most Wanted Man on Wall Street, by Sheelah Kolhatkar. (Random House, $28.) Sheelah Kolhatkar, a staff writer for The New Yorker and a former hedge fund analyst, tells the story of SAC Capital Advisors — ordered by the government to shut down in 2013 — and its founder, Steven A. Cohen. Our critic Jennifer Senior called the book many things: a Wall Street primer; a procedural drama; a modern version of 'Moby-Dick,' with wiretaps rather than harpoons.
I was left to fend for myself, she told The Times of London. The loan has caused so much anxiety.
So the Shane Gillis opinion was not based upon the timeline, it was just based upon my reaction as a person, and the person that was directly named. I certainly think there should be consequences for one's statements and actions, and I certainly think that obviously he made the statements within the year, and that if you did have some sort of time frame when you would want to overlook something, it would be much longer than a year.
Yes. I have three major pro-journalism proposals on my website, including federally funding journalists for every congressional district, billions of dollars in grants to help transition local journalism. Matching grants, so you're not like saying, Hey, we're going to do this. But matching grants to help transition them to cooperative models of ownership to nonprofit and philanthropic models.
No, and sometimes they have other motivations Amazon is to get Prime bigger. Google is not yet into this, but Apple wants to sell more phones.
Yours Unfaithfully is both a daring play and a highly conventional one. Under the polished direction of Jonathan Bank, and in the hands of a fine team of designers, its arguments remain provocative, while its structure feels familiar, its tone decorous. Maybe that only makes it more unusual. It's a bit like a sex farce with real sorrow instead of slammed doors, and something like a drawing room comedy with moral conundrums peeking out beneath the cushions. It is often very funny; it is also very nearly a tragedy.
Although she had begun pitching her first short stories to confession magazines when she was 16, Ms. Higgins Clark endured a rain of rejection slips for the next several years before she sold her first story, Stowaway, to Extension magazine in 1956. By then she had three children: Marilyn, Warren Jr. and David. The fourth, born in 1956, was named Carol for a character in that story. The youngest, Patricia, was born in 1958.
But at the same time, in order to have someone at that level of relationship, you need to have as much trust as possible and I'm still developing that kind of relationship with some of the other, not just candidates, but also people who could be running mates that are not currently running.
Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages — and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater.
Just look at BAFTA, the British awards group that issued a list of nominations on Tuesday that failed to include even a single actor of color. The British-Nigerian actress Cynthia Erivo picked up a Screen Actors Guild nomination for Harriet, but BAFTA snubbed her; ditto Lupita Nyong'o, so tremendous in Us, as well as Awkwafina, who had just won a Golden Globe for her performance in The Farewell.
'THE CONVENT' at A.R.T./New York Theaters (in previews; opens on Jan. 24). A girls' trip with monastic overtones, Jessica Dickey's new play goes on retreat with a group of women trying to live like medieval nuns (though likely practicing better personal hygiene). Daniel Talbott directs the all-female cast, which includes Lisa Ramirez and Samantha Soule, as they recede from modernity.
Here's one example: On this annotated Bill of Rights, a California textbook explains that rulings on the Second Amendment have allowed for some gun regulations.
In the partially autobiographical novel Jean Santeuil, written while his parents were still alive, Marcel portrays his father as a brute (What a vulgar man, thinks Jean Santeuil), someone whose peasant ways had not been amended by a lifetime of honors. In his correspondence Marcel later told his editor that his father had tried to cure him of his effeminacy and neuroses by sending him to a whorehouse. But by the time he came to write Remembrance of Things Past, after his parents' death, he idealized both of them and disguised his father as a wise, indulgent minister of state.
Start your meal with something fun — a craft cocktail Jell-O shot, perhaps. The potent, jiggly cubes offer reassurance that, despite the restaurant's cool interior, it's O.K. to relax. They come are offered in flavors like Fernet and Coke, are served skewered, and, like liquid cocktails, come with a garnish.
I commented to one of my team members, I feel like running for president is at least a glimpse into what it's like to be a professional woman because I feel like I care about my appearance more now than I ever did. And there are people that are always like looking after ——
NO TIME TO SPARE: Thinking About What Matters, by Ursula K. Le Guin. (Mariner, $14.99.) Long revered as a master of fantasy writing, Le Guin turned to blogging late in life, writing about everything from feminism to aging to breakfast. This collection brings together some of her best blog posts. There's a lot that will delight fans of Le Guin, who died last year: The pages sparkle with lines that make a reader glance up, searching for an available ear with which to share them, our reviewer, Melissa Febos, wrote.

However, he said, some of the incentives that were offered to the four states to improve ties with Israel merited a hard look. Among them are benefits that defy international norms, such as recognizing Morocco's sovereignty over the Western Sahara.
Hannah and Her Sisters, Crimes and Misdemeanors and Husbands and Wives in particular draw on the nearness of that life to create a sense of intimacy and warmth even amid the harsh, cynical elements of some of their plots. In those films, Mr. Allen and Ms. Farrow enact scenarios of romantic failure, either splitting up or missing the chance to connect. They are often playing the smartest characters on screen, but also the saddest and least sympathetic, occupying a reality that is drabber and less dramatic than that of the more reckless souls with whom their fates are entwined.
The vaccination rate picked up considerably last week, after the holiday period ended, and a number of governors announced plans to allow a broader swath of citizens to get shots. But states that expand the availability of the inoculations — announcing that people over 70, for example, can now get the vaccine — are finding demand so intense that online registration portals quickly overload and crash, call lines get flooded and available supply is exhausted in a matter of hours. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced Friday that he would release almost all available vaccine immediately after taking office on Jan. 20, rather than conserving half of it to ensure everyone who gets a first dose will also get a second a few weeks later. Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican, said on Sunday that whether doses should be conserved was a really interesting debate, because of concerns over whether production can be stepped up to get second shots to people in time. I just want to make sure we get as many out as fast as possible, without endangering people with regard to the second dose, he said on CNN's State of the Union. The Biden team is to announce this week a plan for ramping up the vaccination rate, including setting up vaccination sites run by the federal government in places like sports stadiums and high school gymnasiums. But Dr. Gottlieb said pharmacies, too, needed to quickly start offering the vaccine to their customers.
Particularly because I think we've become unduly vindictive and punitive toward statements that people find objectionable. A friend of mine said something, he said, If the online universe descends on someone, and they lose their job, the online universe moves on a week later, but that person still does not have a job a week later. That the impact on the individual lasts much, much longer than the rancor. So I shared this.
One person who is not laughing is Brown's protagonist, Alice Hale, the 21st-century newlywed who has recently left a once-promising career in public relations and moved from Manhattan to a sleepy New York suburb. In the basement of her new house is a box left by the previous owner that's filled with magazines from the 1950s plus a dusty, circa-1930s copy of Cookbook for the Modern Housewife. The collection offers a trove of anachronistic recipes and rules, but mostly, the box is a portal to another world, one that makes Alice feel a little less lonely in her new directionless life. At the other end of the portal is Nellie Murdoch, a Betty Draper type whose life is spent tending to her spectacular garden, baking cakes for Tupperware parties and keeping up appearances while living with her philandering, physically abusive husband.
'THE ARTIFICIAL JUNGLE' at the Clurman Theater at Theater Row (previews start on May 27; opens on June 8). Polly wanna thriller? Theater Breaking Through Barriers revives this Charles Ludlam comedy, a film noir homage to the likes of Raymond Chandler and James M. Cain. The show centers on a pet store owner, his discontented wife and the sultry drifter she falls for (a role once played by the revival's director, Everett Quinton). A parrot also figures.

Max Wilcox, a classical record producer and engineer who won five Grammy Awards, and whom the pianist Arthur Rubinstein called his musical collaborator, died on Jan. 20 in Seattle. He was 88.
A few words about my appearance. The physique I inherited from my mother. Way ahead of her time, she had the look now associated with highly politicized feminists. Ma could have played the male villain in a postnuclear road movie. I copped her voice, too: It has been further deepened by three decades of nicotine abuse. My features I inherited from my father. They are rural rather than urban--flat, undecided. The hair is dyed blonde. I was born and raised in this city, out in Moon Park. But all that went to pieces, when I was ten, and thereafter I was raised by the state. I don't know where my parents are. I'm five-ten and I go 180.
espouse positive manhood to include living in cooperation, respect, appreciation, courage, and fearlessness about being fully human. We do not see negativity, shame, unwarranted violence and aggression, gender domination, or hate and prejudice as ways to promote a better quality of life for any one of us.
Slowly but surely, Germany has played catch-up with Weill's music — in particular through the Kurt Weill Festival in Dessau, currently celebrating its 25th anniversary. The festival, which ends this year on Sunday, March 12, began as a fantasy and has since grown into a microcosm of the work Germany has done to restore the legacy of a musical hero.
While Alice's and David's fixations on Sophie begin to expose the cracks in their marriage, Alice investigates whether the movie they're making replays violent and possibly criminal events in Sophie's life. The action of Losing Alice, including extensive and authentic depictions of the filmmaking process, flows into and out of scenes from the finished film-within-the-film and Alice's increasingly fevered imaginings. The symbolism can be ripe (rats figure prominently), and some of the plot twists feel mechanical, but Avin pulls off long, complicated scenes few TV dramas would attempt, and Zurer keeps you focused on the smart, sensual and shrewdly manipulative Alice, who is Sophie's equal in every way. (Apple TV+, Friday.)
And yet Proust was not always so appreciated, and even his chief defenders were capable of making snide remarks about him. Robert de Montesquiou (whose arch manners and swooping intonations Proust loved to imitate and whose life provided Proust with the main model for his most memorable character, the baron de Charlus) said that Proust's work was a mixture of litanies and sperm (a formula that he considered to be a compliment). Gide accused him of having committed an offense against the truth (Gide was irritated that Proust never acknowledged his own homosexuality in print nor ever presented homosexual inclinations in an attractive light). Lucien Daudet, a young writer with whom Proust had an affair (Proust liked artistic young men with mustaches and dark eyes: that is, those who resembled himself), at one point told Cocteau that Proust was an atrocious insect. Lucien's father, Alphonse Daudet, one of the most celebrated writers of the generation before Proust's, though now largely forgotten, announced, Marcel Proust is the devil! He might well have taken such a position, since it was Proust's seven-volume novel, Remembrance of Things Past (in recent editions, translated more literally as In Search of Lost Time), that surpassed--indeed, wiped out--the fiction written in the two decades before him. Who today reads Anatole France, Paul Bourget, Maurice Barres, or even Alphonse Daudet? Paul Claudel, the arch-Catholic poet and playwright, described Marcel as a painted old Jewess.
Far from stirring up controversy, his paintings were coveted by the establishment. The second version of The Massacre of the Innocents was made for a grand official residence, the Prinsenhof. Another Prinsenhof commission resulted in The Marriage of Peleus and Thetis (1592-3), a mythological scene that covered an entire wall. These were the most prestigious assignments in the city, garnered by an artist not yet 30.
In Han Kang's propulsive, lacerating novel The Vegetarian, translated from the Korean by Deborah Smith, the bloodless union between Yeong-hye, a hushed bookworm, and her largely indifferent husband ruptures when she ceases to be a carnivore. Stop eating meat, and the world will devour you whole, Yeong-hye's mother chides. And she's right: When Yeong-hye asserts her dietary will, characters around her react with violent rage.
If you thought the men in Sideways were too schlubby, too pathetic, and the women too inexplicably accommodating, Under the Eiffel Tower is here to say, Hold my Bordeaux.
AK: The president at the moment is at a NATO summit, or he might've left ——
His other favorites included recordings of Beethoven by the pianist Richard Goode and the Emerson String Quartet.
Yes, that's exactly how I felt that week when I read When Death Comes, one of Ms. Oliver's best-known works. I recall distinctly how at the end of the silent retreat I was so excited not only to be able to speak again — but to talk about the final stanzas of that poem and what they meant to me:
Yeah, it does. It's one reason why I think we need to de-emphasize — excuse me.
A researcher specializing in inherited bone diseases who was drawn into the burgeoning field of ancient DNA in the late 1980s, Dr. Sykes had a hunch that mitochondrial DNA, which passes largely intact from mother to child, could be used to trace the deep origins of human populations. But he needed a way to test his hypothesis.
Lauren Kelley: Mr. Yang, can you say who is on your short list for running mate?
She dislikes credit. I'm a firm believer in what you need, you get, she said. She saved for two and a half years to pay cash for a five-burner gas range. We don't really eat out, she said. I do all the cooking.
MG: So, if you become president, what government secret are you most excited to learn about?
He shrugged. He exhaled slowly. He looked up. And I saw what you seldom see in the grief-struck. Panic. A primitive panic, a low-IQ panic, in the eyes--it makes you consider the meaning of the word hare-brained. And it made me panic. I thought: He's in a nightmare and now I am too. What do I do if he starts screaming? Start screaming? Should everybody start screaming?
Mr. Yang confirmed this summer that he would like his running mate to be a woman.
Exhibition efforts have been plagued by problems. The debut was initially planned for Berlin in September — intended as the first stop of a three-city tour that would then travel to Paris and London. It was canceled weeks before it was supposed to open, when city administrators rejected a proposal to build a concrete wall around the interactive spectacle. The wall was intended to be 1.5 miles long and painted by the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, encircling the event until its final night, the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, when it would be torn down.
Her answer seems to confirm what he already knows: You're not the same Martin I first met.
It's an interesting dichotomy because I want to talk about Lyndon Johnson, then, in All The Way because he was blocked everywhere he went. It was different groups pulling at him at all sides. So what was your approach to figuring out his power?
In a vacuum, you're 100 percent correct. But it's failing to account for the fact that we're taking that money, and then some, and putting it directly into the hands of the American consumer.
On your Android phone or tablet:
I think, to many ears, there's going to be some skepticism to the idea there's not a lot of money spent on policing. And the question becomes, how is that money spent on policing? For example, let's go back to the therapist or the social worker who might go out and deal with a police call. Are you suggesting that a police officer needs to be with that social worker. Does there need to be two people at that scene? What if there's one? And if there's one, do we need that police officer? I guess one of the interesting questions of this moment is, are you all called too much? Is the system built too heavily around the idea that you dial those three digits, 911, and a police officer with a gun shows up? Is that not what we need? What do you think?
The Texas book also states that American action on global warming may not make a difference if China, India, Russia and Brazil do not also act.
So this is the carrot and the stick. So imagine if you had data standards that were endorsed by the U.S., the E.U., and Japan, and it had certain technology protocols associated with it. Then China said, Hey, I don't want to adhere to that. Because like you said, they like to hoard data, and one of the reasons why they're in position to leapfrog us is they have more data than we do and they have essentially nonexistent privacy rights or regulations. They have complete surveillance. That's one reason why they've banned masks in Hong Kong, so that their surveillance technology can pick up who the protesters are. So China has its own vast hoard of data.
There's a reason it did, and perhaps what the playwright Bess Wohl is attempting in Grand Horizons, which opened on Thursday at the Helen Hayes Theater, is a last-ditch act of reclamation: a boulevard comedy for a cul-de-sac age.
Mr. Yang was asked on CNN's The Van Jones Show about cancel culture and whether Americans have gone too far in the direction of a lack of grace or a lack of forgiveness. He responded: I'm new to politics, but I certainly would hate to be judged by something I did 25 years ago.
LEONARD You could have a year when literally every nominee is of color and that would still not mean that the systemic problems that exist in the industry have somehow evaporated overnight — any more than Obama being elected president means that we've solved the problem of racism.
When William Blake Hoffman, an architect and designer at Architecture, Incorporated in Reston, Va., matched with Mr. Hanson on Tinder in September 2018, he didn't have grand visions of romance. Mr. Hoffman had moved to Washington a couple of years earlier, for what he intended to be only a few years. He didn't plan to plant roots. So he suggested to Mr. Hanson that they meet for a drink at a beer garden located right on Mr. Hoffman's way home from work. It was a Wednesday night.
Porn, necessarily, cuts to the chase: a little less conversation, a little more action.
Then is there any other public figure you'd like to play?
The show's creators — the accomplished and ambitious playwright and screenwriter Moira Buffini and the actress Alison Newman — set an unflagging pace in the two episodes available for review, with dialogue that's sufficiently crisp and performances that are entertaining enough to keep you interested, even if the story feels a little hollow at the core.
California Texas Takeaway Texas says that white Southerners opposed Reconstruction because of tax increases as well as racial resentment. California instead includes primary-source quotations from black historical figures about white resistance to civil rights. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Growth & Conflict, California, P. 586; McGraw-Hill, United States History to 1877, Texas, P. 555 Both states say that breaches of racial etiquette led to lynchings after Reconstruction. But only California, whose edition was written more recently, makes clear that the perpetrators of lynchings also hoped to discourage black political and economic power. HMH, American History: Reconstruction to the Present, California, P. 245; HMH, The Americans: United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 288
Creating categories can be comforting, even when they are utter nonsense: the four humors of the ancient Greeks, for instance, or the blood-type diet. Your husband is not upset with you because of your incompatible temperaments. No, he's distraught because you are not (and I suspect, never were) sorry for your behavior. Any apology you made would be unsatisfying. You feel no actual remorse.
WASHINGTON — In a week of White House tantrums and fast-food dinners, of canceled speeches and aborted congressional trips, it seemed fitting that Karen Pence, the wife of Vice President Mike Pence, announced that she was going back to her job as an elementary schoolteacher.
About the same time, the trio had an unlikely hit with the kind of material it had avoided: Mr. Seeger's antiwar song Where Have All the Flowers Gone?
The comment about I wouldn't want to be judged for something 25 years ago was about something completely independent. I think I'd seen something where Joe Biden was being called out for something he'd said 25 years ago, when I said I wouldn't want to be called out for some misstatement I'd made 25 years ago. And then I joked, good thing no one cared about what I was doing 25 years ago, because I was at that point a 20-year-old man, and the internet didn't really have full documentation of how I spent those years.
For years, a college friend (in her 50s) has forbidden me from telling anyone we went to school together. Since moving to Hollywood, she deducted 10 years from her age (some of it with cosmetic surgery) to preserve her writing career, she claims. She is afraid that my salt-and-pepper hair will bust her. Lately, she has been mostly out of touch. But the implication that I look so much older than her has rankled for years. When I confided my hurt feelings to her, she was unapologetic. Blame the industry and ageism, she said, not her. Do I have a right to feel hurt?
So in your mind, there's not sufficient evidence to discount the possibility that Officer Rolfe felt his life was in danger, despite the distance, despite this state of the taser?
Lindbergh, then 39, joined the Ford Motor Company as a consultant, working at the Willow Run plant in Michigan, which was producing bombers. Later he was a consultant to the United Aircraft Corporation, attached chiefly to its Vought-Sikorsky Division in Stratford, Conn. Vought was producing the Navy Corsair F4U. As part of his job, he traveled to the Pacific war area in 1944 to study the Corsair under service conditions, and, as a civilian, flew 50 missions against the Japanese. The flier had at least one very close brush with death in a dogfight near Biak Island. He described this and other episodes in The Wartime Journals, and they constitute the best writing in the book. After the war, Lindbergh went to Germany for the Naval Technical Mission in Europe to study developments in Nazi aircraft and missiles. He had been interested in rocketry since 1929, when he sought out Dr. Robert Goddard, then an obscure physics professor at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. (Goddard, who had been ridiculed for his ideas, has since been recognized as a space flight pioneer.) Lindbergh was always proud of his association with Goddard and of having raised money to fund his experiments. For 16 years until his death in 1945, Goddard, also a loner, received Lindbergh's help and encouragement; and Goddard's basic rocketry patents were used in the development of United States missiles after the war.
Above all, Ms. Dick shows up in female characters. She inspired Juliana, the heroine of High Castle, who has no trouble slashing a Nazi operative's throat, as well as a number of shrill, carping, unhappy wives in other books.
His son LeRoy Jr. said the cause was lung cancer.
But Ms. Wolitzer, who is 58, wanted less to write some sort of State of Feminism novel than to explore ideas that have been marinating in her head for a long time.
Ms. Holzer was offering shares not in theater productions but in a Toyota dealership in Indonesia and real estate in Spain. At the time, she insisted that she could have cleared things up if she had been allowed to travel to Indonesia. (Her passport had been taken away.)
So I hope my perspective on being a progressive who is also a pragmatist will help get things done.
You through? Wait, don't tell me. I'm going in.
FRANK CONNIFF'S OPEN RIFF NIGHT at Q.E.D. (April 11, 7:30 p.m.). The host of this event hails from one of the O.G. riff-track shows, Mystery Science Theater 3000, so you know his ability to provide colorful commentary to terrible television and film alike is top-notch. Is yours? Here's an opportunity to find out: Audience members sign up as they would at an open mike to offer riffs of their own as they watch clips from bad movies. Mr. Conniff and his guest judges will chose the best riffer, who will try to hold his or her own against Mr. Conniff at the end of the night.
There is a difference between reading a book and listening to stories, a difference amplified to epic proportions in the case of Norse Mythology. I knew it immediately when all of the hairs on my arm shot up during the retelling of how Odin lost his eye when he traded it for a sip from the well of wisdom. My theory was confirmed when my 16-year-old son passed by my bedroom door one night and could not stop himself from coming in to listen — for an entire hour. Hearing a story aloud, you are seduced by the wonder of an ancient oral tradition.
But here she must have been underplaying her ambition, so spectacular was the second act that followed (achieved at fourth-act age). Athill was under no illusion that she would be celebrated for her work as an editor: We must always remember that we are only midwives — if we want praise for progeny we must give birth to our own. And so she did, writing novels, essays and nonfiction with the kind of 9-to-5 work ethic she'd once shown in the office of the publisher André Deutsch. She quickly found her subject: romance in its many forms. In Stet, it was a romance with words. In Yesterday Morning, with memories of childhood. In After a Funeral, it was a love lost to depression, her partner ending his life violently in Athill's home, an act she treated with her signature lack of fanfare. She used A Florence Diary to describe every inch of the Italian city as happily as a tween with a thesaurus. She made peace with love's dark demise in Instead of a Letter, in which she admits frankly that an early broken engagement has left her with a fear of lasting intimacy. She had love affair after love affair, including a brief but soul-expanding dalliance with the Black Panther Hakim Jamal (a man who'd also had a high-profile relationship with the actress Jean Seberg before the murder of his next girlfriend by his fellow Panthers, and who later was murdered himself).
When Mr. Bentley ran for governor in 2010, Christian voters saw extraordinary promise in the obscure lawmaker from Tuscaloosa who liked to tell people about how Bear Bryant, the revered University of Alabama football coach, had been one of his patients. He seemed oddly ordinary, the politician who was thought to be tailor-made for a state increasingly frustrated by decades of corruption in Montgomery.
It would be a highly cumbersome tax return to prepare on an annual basis, said Jeff Moes, executive vice president and chief fiduciary officer at FineMark National Bank & Trust, which serves high-net-worth clients. Every federal estate tax goes through an audit, and presumably this would go through an audit as well. They'd have to figure out if the valuation methodology is correct.
Yeah, very prescient. The story was very good. Scott Burns wrote a really terrific script, so that got high marks. The character itself wasn't as high a mark for me. But then the fourth category, the director, was very high, Steven Soderbergh. So all of a sudden, the collective, cumulative score was very high.
They eked out a precarious living for a while, partially from her mother's employment as a housemaid. But when the depression struck, her mother was unable to find work. Miss Holiday tried to make money scrubbing floors, and when this failed she started along Seventh Avenue in Harlem one night looking for any kind of work. At Jerry Preston's Log Cabin, a night club, she asked for work as a dancer. She danced the only step she knew for fifteen choruses and was turned down. The pianist, taking pity on her, asked if she could sing. She brashly assured him that she could. She sang Trav'lin' All Alone and then Body and Soul and got a job--$2 a night for six nights a week working from midnight until about 3 o'clock the next afternoon. Recommended to Goodman Miss Holiday had been singing in Harlem in this fashion for a year or two when she was heard by John Hammond, a jazz enthusiast, who recommended her to Benny Goodman, at that time a relatively unknown clarinet player who was the leader on occasional recording sessions. She made her first recording, Your Mother's Son-in-Law in November, 1933, singing one nervous chorus with a band that included in addition to Mr. Goodman, Jack Teagarden, Gene Krupa and Joe Sullivan. Two years later Miss Holiday started a series of recordings with groups led by Teddy Wilson, the pianist, which established her reputation in the jazz world.
The reason I am drawing, in some polls, 10 percent or more of Donald Trump voters to my campaign is that Republicans and conservatives do not hate economic buying power in citizens' hands. What they hate is a giant bureaucracy making everyone's decisions. So you ask what my main priority will be as president, it will be to get the Freedom Dividend across the finish line and get buying power into Americans' hands, which will then lead us to be able to solve many other problems much more quickly.
In England not long ago a survey of writers and critics revealed that the twentieth-century novelist they most admired--and who they thought would have the most enduring influence on the next century--was Marcel Proust. Certainly the madeleine moistened by herbal tea has become the most famous symbol in French literature; everyone refers to sudden gusts of memory as Proustian experiences. Snobs like to point out that if the Prousts had been better-mannered and not given to dunking, world literature would have been the poorer for it. Even those who haven't read Proust speak of him freely and often.
I really appreciate your time, Mr. Champion. It's been good talking to you.

KK: Have you spoken to Republican lawmakers about the Freedom Dividend?
A recent poll found that roughly 50 percent of the Ukrainian population favors joining NATO, though Hungary's foreign minister recently said his country would block Ukrainian membership unless Ukraine changed a policy restricting its citizens' use of minority languages.
Several of the stones placed around the house — one as a decorative end piece to a hallway, another as a step to the tearoom — are from centuries-old Japanese gardens, now vanished. Sugimoto has long admired the patina of unfinished cedar in Nara's temples, where the wood's color has transformed over time from tawny yellow to a mossy gray. After 1,200 years, beautiful, he remarked. It gets darkened. The surface is still beautiful. He pauses. But whether this building survives 100 years ... He didn't need to finish that thought. We both knew none of us would be here to find out.
My husband and I fought (again) today about something that happened eight years ago, when we were newly married. He was devastated that I tried to have a cordial relationship with his ex-wife (who wronged him). He felt betrayed that I didn't mirror his feelings toward her, and abandoned by my attempts to create a workable relationship for their children. Frankly, I can no more apologize and have a hand-holding cry with him than fly to the moon. I am emotionally detached, and he is wildly demonstrative. How to bridge this gap?
What's the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently?
I'm curious if producers be less willing to take chances on risky plays. That's where I see the thing. And a friend of mine just told me they thought that there'd be more frivolity and sort of vapid fluff because playing it safe and fun. After this era of both Trump and the pandemic and all this partisanship, they might play it safe with revivals and shows based on pop music and lighter fare.
CW: I'm curious, then, focusing on the U.S., a couple of months ago the general counsel for the N.S.A. wrote an Op-Ed for us and was worried about this big challenge of the government not being able to acquire the tech talent. That Silicon Valley is actually so much more attractive, so much more interesting there. And that when you're looking at 5G technology, quantum computing, technology, A.I., not having engineers in that space and sort of outsourcing that to the private sector is potentially incredibly dangerous. Like how do you actually make people want to come and bring that engineering talent to the federal government, rather than ——
Because of the sex scandal, Cardinal O'Brien recused himself from the 2013 Vatican conclave to elect a successor to Pope Benedict XVI. The cardinal's decision was considered unprecedented and had, by some accounts, been ordered by the retiring pope himself. Cardinal O'Brien was later ordered to leave Scotland for spiritual renewal and penance.
The subversions of Killing Eve (through seven episodes) mostly consist of gender switching rather than fundamental rethinking, though. Watching the series, you're just as conscious of its congruences with standard examples of the genre (like Berlin Station on Epix) as you are of the differences. And while Ms. Waller-Bridge's comic style is distinctive, her characters are not entirely new — we've seen aspects of them in La Femme Nikita, Covert Affairs, Homeland and any number of stories about female mutual obsession.
His first grid contained theme answers I wasn't wild about (ARMY BRAT, ALL BETTER) so I had the nerve to ask him to redo it, as I had my heart set on more sparkly fill like AURORA BOREALIS and AWESOME BLOSSOM. Joon generously obliged and then showed me where he had hidden our names, which leads me to how the published puzzle is a little different than the one we had at the wedding.
True Detective has fallen off the wagon.
The court, however, found that the government took the right steps to introduce the sweeping program, provided the public enough information, and did not coerce people to register.
You need a vig, just so you know. You need a vig. I will give you a word, rundle. Do you know that?
With their identical dresses and hairdos, synchronized movements and sweetly innocent voices, the McGuire Sisters — Christine, Dorothy and Phyllis — were the musical embodiment of popular culture in their day, singing for audiences who watched Your Hit Parade on television and listened to Perry Como, Patti Page and the lingering postwar strains of the big band era.
Mentioning the attack in Baghdad only briefly, the president spent his hourlong speech at Ministerio Internacional El Rey Jesús, a church with a predominantly Hispanic congregation, alternating between his familiar mocking jabs at Democrats, who he repeatedly called anti-religious, and boasting about his own faith-based policies. Saying he would renew the importance of religion and family, Mr. Trump vowed that he would toughen restrictions on abortion and would take action to safeguard students and teachers' First Amendment rights to pray in our schools.
The fact that our fates are intertwined — something even Malcolm eventually realized — makes me not hopeful, as it once did, but angrier. I feel stuck in a terrible, lopsided marriage. The least I should be able to do in this dysfunctional relationship is to vent my anger, not on paper or newsprint, but in the real world, in real time. That's what a big chunk of Republican America is doing, with zero regrets. I have become envious of that. I want true equality, 2020 style — the right to claim and fully express my own well-earned piece of the American id.
Yeah, and I even feel more so. We've said from day one, we the union, that looking at the videos and everything, we're not saying whether it was a good shoot or a bad shoot. We don't have enough evidence to say that. Normally how this situation goes in officer-involved shootings, the G.B.I., Georgia Bureau of Investigation, does the investigation. The officer is either put on administrative leave with or without pay, and then the results are turned to the D.A. or to the city. But the district attorney here decided to do his own investigation that he normally doesn't do. And then, after he did his press conference, we found — I guess, to be politically correct, misspoken — misspokens, if you will, or lies that he did. And we haven't even been entitled to all of the investigative material. So yeah, we still believe that it was a rushed investigation, and it was politically motivated.
So this is the carrot and the stick. So imagine if you had data standards that were endorsed by the U.S., the E.U., and Japan, and it had certain technology protocols associated with it. Then China said, Hey, I don't want to adhere to that.

So China has its own vast hoard of data.
He had such apt observations of the strange beauty of our shared hometown, and also a similarly oblique connection to Hollywood that I do, growing up within it and seeing both its magic and its flaws, she said. It was exciting to discover a new writer whose work I really loved.
In the bathroom I applied makeup. Like someone doing a chore. Wiping down a counter. With my mouth meanly clenched. I used to be something, I guess, but now I'm just another big blonde old broad.
His longtime partner, Ruth Kirchmeier, confirmed the death, at Martha's Vineyard Hospital. He lived on the Vineyard, in West Tisbury.

In Leigh Silverman's lopsided world-premiere production, the friends make a cracking ensemble, each fully human and with her own comic charge: the aggressively chipper Sandy (Mia Barron); timid Beth (Kate Wetherhead), with her failed marriage and disheveled lawn; tough-talking Pam (Danielle Skraastad), as fierce as the stilettos she wears to coffee (costumes are by Kaye Voyce); and Renee (Nikiya Mathis), an editor at a gardening magazine. She thrills to Diane's radical landscaping plans — and the possibility of a fling with her.
KK: So I assume you're referring to [your] universal basic income plan. Your campaign platform, you have tons and tons of proposals, everything from U.B.I. to universal daylight saving time. Plans don't really mean anything unless you have priorities. What would you do immediately when you enter office? What would be first on your agenda? What would you want to accomplish in the first 100 days?
Ultimately, the play's insistence on the sanctity of open marriage, a stance that apparently reflected Mr. Malleson's own beliefs and practices, isn't all that persuasive. If the central claim, that to live effectively you must walk the line between a great slope of complacence on one side and rather a mess-up of promiscuity on the other, sounds reasonably plausible in the moment, that is a credit to the dapper Mr. von Essen. Does the road to moral enlightenment and matrimonial contentment absolutely lead into the beds of selected others? Is there really no other way? Separate vacations, maybe?
archived recording Robert on email says, if Harry and Meghan want to relinquish their royal status, then get on with it. At the moment, they're behaving like self-indulgent rich kids being supported by the taxpayer. They want to have their cake and eat it.
Ultramontanists placed their faith in Thomism. In an effort to assure intellectual coherence between disciplines and a foundation for all studies in theology, the popes who reigned in the second half of the nineteenth century placed a renewed emphasis on the work of Thomas Aquinas and his scholastic successors. Scholasticism and natural law theory have many strengths, among them an orderly rationalism and a conceptual framework into which every discrete item of information can be fitted, showing its connection to the whole and to the divine will from which it springs. But scholastic philosophy and natural law encountered a succession of powerful challengers in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, including pragmatism, vitalism, existentialism, and logical positivism, each of which debunked scholasticism's claims to intellectual respectability. Similarly, in the physical sciences and in the study of history, the developing academic orthodoxy in Britain and America, strongly empirical and increasingly based on evolutionary, probabilist, and materialist assumptions, was at variance with the scholastic framework, which, while granting science some autonomy, linked worldly phenomena to their supernatural origins. The scholastic criticism of materialism and positivism was not so much refuted as blithely ignored by most of the scientists. Protestant conservatives were also polemicizing against the new secular sciences, but for religious and traditional reasons, Catholic and Protestant objectors to secular scholarship were unable to make common cause.
The police looked around the body in the bathroom stall, hoping to find telltale details that might lead to the supplier of the drugs that killed him. They examined the little plastic envelope on the floor, emptied in the man's final actions, for any identifying markings.
Her family is ready for the moment. Ms. Harris's niece, Meena Harris, has been sporting a Vice President Aunty T-shirt in the lead-up. Her stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, an art student in New York, planned to knit a suit for the occasion (she opted for a dress). Kerstin Emhoff, the mother of Ms. Harris's stepchildren — yes, Ms. Harris and her husband's ex are friends — may tuck a sprig of sage in her purse; she is quite sure the Capitol could use a smudging.
Mr. Yang's candidacy has centered on the idea of his Freedom Dividend, essentially universal basic income — which has a long history, drawing support from Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King Jr. and Friedrich von Hayek, but also a controversial one. (Later annotations will look at why.)
This was an interesting one. It didn't make the cut. It didn't make it. I turned it down twice.
What are the true threats of the 21st century? Climate change is number one, and then cybersecurity and A.I., loose nuclear material, military drones in the hands of nonstate actors. It's very hard to secure a location from something the size of a flying vacuum cleaner. That's very, very difficult. So we're entering an era where it's going to be much easier to be offensive than defensive, and you don't need massive levels of resources to cause significant levels of damage. To me, a new aircraft carrier does not make our elections any more secure from Russian hacking, which is the most direct threat to our democracy upcoming in this cycle. We're spending money on the threats of the 20th century, and we need to try and modernize our approach as quickly as possible.
George Nicolau, a prominent arbitrator who determined that Major League Baseball teams colluded in the 1980s to restrict bidding for free agents, leading club owners to pay players $280 million in damages, died on Jan. 2 in Manhattan. He was 94.
On Jan. 10, 2011, Emily Rapp Black, a writer and creative writing instructor living in Santa Fe, took her infant son, Ronan, to the eye doctor. At 9 months old, the baby wasn't hitting his developmental milestones and his pediatrician wanted to rule out vision problems. In Albuquerque, the ophthalmologist found cherry red spots on the backs of the baby's retinas, and immediately diagnosed him with Tay-Sachs disease, a very rare, but inevitably fatal, genetic disorder. And the world tilted on its axis.
She has entered into two significant unions since my father's death 35 years ago. The first occurred in assisted living, when at mealtimes she had to sit with Violet, full of complaint, and Bud, who grumbled nonstop when he wasn't singing Gilbert and Sullivan, and Bob, who didn't speak at all. After some time Bob departed and a man I'll call Pete Gilbert appeared. Oh, Pete Gilbert, as if floated down from the heavens, a cheerful, insightful man in a soft plaid shirt. He was interested in the world, he loved to read, and he had narrative skills. My mother, for her part, made him laugh. He had immediate affection for her, and soon an abiding tenderness. They did not spend time together away from the dining room table; it wasn't that kind of thing. The essentials of true marriage had once more changed in my thinking, so that now I knew it actually involved only the enormity that is Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner, day after day. That, it still seems to me, is the crux of real companionship, time spent over the grapefruit, the grilled cheese, the tilapia. I take you to be my beloved Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. Until Assigned Seating says otherwise.
Underneath, he said, there was a real spiritual poverty. I felt a sense of loneliness and emptiness. Bashista's disquiet culminated one night five years after he'd graduated from college: I was in my apartment, and I was so confused and unhappy. I just felt broken. I was in tears. That night, he said, he turned to God: I said: Lord, I have no other roads to exhaust. I'm going to make a sincere effort to live as You've called me to live. After that night, thoughts of the priesthood began once again to visit Bashista, and finally he made a furtive visit to a chancery office in Charlotte, N.C., where he lived at the time. I thought, I'll just get a book on priesthood, find out what it's all about, he recalled. So the receptionist said, 'Well, let's go up to the library.' Then a priest walked by, and the receptionist goes, 'Wait a minute, that's the vocation director!' I just got a chill. I said, 'Father, I have this friend, ...' and I bombarded him with an hour and a half of questions. At the end he goes, 'You have an awfully inquisitive friend.' Still, Bashista resisted: My response was not yes; it was, I'll consider it. I call it my one-sided argument with Our Lord; it was about four months long. I said, 'I don't have to be a priest to be holy.' Finally the response came: 'You're right, but this is what I call you to.'
And I said, Well, let's hear it.

Well, the Department of the Attention Economy would likely be based in Silicon Valley, and it'd be run by a guy named Tristan Harris, who's a design ethicist. He started Time Well Spent. So I don't think it's necessarily the case that you need to try and bring everyone into the cubicles in D.C. to get the rules ——
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel paid tribute to Rabbi Eckstein after his death, saying he had worked tirelessly to benefit the citizens of Israel and to strengthen the bond between Christian communities and the State of Israel.
Yet I think the intensity gap might also have to do with the way internal dangers allow for richer narrative tension than external ones: A marriage collapses from the inside, while the weather is external. It's a deeper gut-punch when the call is coming from inside the house. The same is true for climate change. We've made the call. We are the threat. But the antagonism feels faceless and less psychologically complex than the domestic torment of intimate betrayal, and the vexed hope of rebuilding.
I was introduced to Athill through her memoir Somewhere Towards the End. Published when she was 91, it was a meditation on the mixed bag that is aging. While Athill was quick to point out the injustices of growing older, chief among them giving up sex (Athill loved sex in her very British way, decreeing that every woman should have a few good love affairs), her tone was almost defiantly peppy — never saccharine, but refusing to give in to the weighty fear with which we tend to face the great unknown. I had my first existential crisis (that's putting it generously) at age 13, and sat with the pain for years afterward. My primary literary bedfellows in the ensuing years were death obsessives like Philip Roth and Robert Lowell, or poets who were far too successful in its pursuit (Sylvia Plath, who was less enthusiastic about her life in the London literary scene than Athill, her counterpart who was born more than a decade before her and survived her by more than 50 years). I figured if I couldn't solve the mystery around mortality then I could at least wallow with some of the greats. I was on year 15 of this strategy when I found myself in possession of Athill's slim book in consideration of the topic.
What's interesting to me about the differences is that in Breaking Bad, Walter White methodically planned his next move in life, even though he was given only two years to live. But he designed his future, as short as it may have been. In this story, Michael Desiato has no time. He needs to make a decision impulsively that will alter the course of his life for who knows how long. So he doesn't have the luxury of time to look back and think, well, wait a minute. If I make this decision now, what's it going to do? What are the repercussions down the road?
St. Brendan was a sailor who had spread the Gospel in his trips around Ireland, Scotland and Wales. If the tale of his trip to the Americas is true, he would have beaten Leif Ericson and Christopher Columbus by centuries.
He began by doing voice-overs on radio when he was 6 and struck up an enduring cross-country friendship by telephone with Stan Laurel when he was 12 — leading to roles impersonating Laurel's huskier other half, Oliver Hardy. (He was a founder of the Laurel and Hardy fan club Sons of the Desert.)
Southern whites resisted Reconstruction, according to a McGraw-Hill textbook, because they did not want African-Americans to have more rights. But the Texas edition offers an additional reason: Reforms cost money, and that meant higher taxes.

I suppose you do it, only if you're really troubled, if you're having difficulty getting a character to move into you and your soul and your being. That's a hard way to describe it. But basically, for an actor, when you start developing a character, it's outside of yourself. And the more research, the more thought, the more attention you put on that, the more you start to understand how he thinks and feels. And then you're inviting that character into yourself. And then almost like through osmosis, it comes in. And from that point on, you think and feel and act based on the filter of that character. Well, if it's frustrating for you and it's not coming, it's not coming, which happens at times, yeah, I could see you going home and living with it and barking at the dog or whatever.

So why not have the argument? Is Woody Allen a great filmmaker? On what evidence might that conclusion rest? The accumulated body of critical opinion is helpful, partly because it shows that there has never been consensus. Mr. Allen had a great champion in Vincent Canby, The New York Times chief film critic from 1969 to 1993 — an appreciative note from the director was read at Canby's memorial service at the Museum of Modern Art in 2000 — and also his share of skeptics, among them Pauline Kael of The New Yorker, who ran hot and cold on his films.

Mr. Yang started Venture for America in 2011, shortly after selling his test prep company to Kaplan. He said that he saw, in the wake of the financial crisis, how certain communities were rapidly losing jobs and wanted to create new work opportunities in those underserved areas.
I think the number of aircraft carriers is either seven or nine. I confess to not knowing precisely. In terms of our investment, we're spending $650 billion plus on our military. Certainly more than any other country, but I think more than the next four countries combined, and we have to examine, at this stage, whether that $650 billion is making us safer and more secure.
On the island of Tasmania, more than 50 wildfires were burning, and farmers were bracing for more. And in Elizabeth North, a town north of Adelaide, the Red Lion Hotel promised free beer if the temperature reached 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) — and then had to deliver.
Mr. Yang and his family began attending Sunday services at the Reformed Church of New Paltz after they purchased a home nearby in 2015.
'THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS' at Village East Cinema (May 31, 7 p.m.). The Magnificent Ambersons, Orson Welles's 1942 feature — his second, after Citizen Kane — is one of the most crushing stories in cinema: not because of the movie itself, though it's extraordinarily moving, but because the studio lopped off Welles's original ending and shot a rushed, unconvincing coda. Even an untrained eye can spot the moment when the visual pizazz (courtesy of the cinematographer Stanley Cortez) suddenly stops. The missing footage, if ever located, would be an archivist's holy grail. And despite being compromised, Welles's adaptation of the Booth Tarkington novel routinely ranks among the greatest movies ever made. The moment when Tim Holt's character gets his just deserts (George Amberson Minafer had got his comeuppance. He'd got it three times filled and running over) features some of Welles's best voice-over work.

GRIST MILL ROAD, by Christopher J. Yates. (Picador, $18.) A gruesome act of violence connects three teenagers, who stay linked to one another for the rest of their lives. As more is revealed about the crime, this thriller raises questions of guilt, culpability and forgiveness. As our reviewer, Sarah Lyall, put it, You have to work hard to follow the winding road Yates sends us down, and the drive is full of pleasantly unpleasant surprises.
And so our patterns formed. I took care of the baby. I took care of the house. As my son grew older, I managed everything: food, medical appointments, preschool reconnaissance, after-school activities, birthdays and wardrobe and transportation. We had a second child and we constantly renegotiated the terms of our labor division because neither of us wanted to be stuck in those stereotypical roles. But though my husband had emerged from his depression and I from my tough broad mode, we never got our gender equality groove back despite our efforts.
One could argue that what today's men need is more encouragement to enhance one side of the masculine virtues — the dignity, responsibility, self-control, and self-reliance — while inhibiting others, such as machismo, violence, and drive for dominance.
A Lithuanian immigrant who, with a younger brother, Adolfas, arrived in New York City in 1949 speaking little English, he became within a handful of years an effective spokesman for avant-garde film. (Adolfas, who died in 2011, became an influential filmmaker, writer and educator in his own right.)
Ms. Bosworth became a regular presence on Broadway. She was in Phoebe Ephron's comedy Howie (1959), playing a gamin character based on the young Nora Ephron, Phoebe's daughter. She toured alongside Helen Hayes in a production of The Glass Menagerie. Her best-known movie role was in the box-office success The Nun's Story (1959), alongside Audrey Hepburn.
Elizabeth M. Schneider always had a soft spot for Yalies — her father and son went there — and she could belt out Bulldog football team fight songs and the Bright College Years unofficial alma mater with the best of them.
At the time, Watkins was accused of, among other things, a distinctly heteronormative frame of reference, of presuming that only straight women writers were capable of being ensnared in the blithely wielded cross hairs of men. But the truth is, all women writers find themselves turning the crystal tumbler of their experience against men's light. (Men, on the other hand, just get to write about the light, and are applauded for it.) And so the question remains, grows ever larger: How do writers divest themselves from the pressures of the dominant culture while also addressing the burdensome weight of that dominant culture?
You've got to be able to pick yourself up, brush yourself off and do it all over again, he said in a 2007 interview with the American Comedy Archives. Persistence alone is omnipotent; you have to keep hanging in there.
According to Sky Blue, the 39-year-old executive director of the Foundation for Intentional Community and a former member of the Virginia-based commune Twin Oaks, which was founded in 1967, the number of intentional communities listed in the FIC's directory nearly doubled between 2010 and 2016 (the last year the directory was published), to roughly 1,200. Although the number of people living in these communities is hard to pin down — the demographic is often deliberately off the grid — Blue estimates that there are currently around 100,000 individuals residing in them. There's an obvious growth trend that you can chart, he said; millennials get this intentional community thing more than people in the past.
Still, it was Livingston today who called for Clinton's resignation from the House floor. Charging that Clinton had undermined the rule of law and damaged the nation, Livingston said, I say that you have the power to terminate that damage and heal the wounds that you have created. You, sir, may resign your post.

Generally speaking, I think we have become overly aggressive and optimistic about what we can accomplish in various foreign theaters. I've signed a pledge to end the forever wars because I don't believe it's the will of the American people for us to be in a constant state of armed conflict in foreign theaters for years and even decades at a time. Our Constitution says that it's in Congress's hands to declare war, but Congress has completely ceded this authority through the A.U.M.F. [Authorization for Use of Military Force] and then just said, Hey, executive branch, you can do what you want. And now they want nothing to do with it, and that is not the will of the American people, and it's not the will of the Constitution. So we should repeal the A.U.M.F. and say, Look, Congress, if we want to authorize armed conflict, it should be on you and it should be the will of the people.
KK: Actually, I also want to ask you about your time at Manhattan Prep. Your colleague Kimberly Watkins told City Council in September that she had faced both gender harassment and pay inequity under your leadership there. Could you respond to those allegations?
In Distances Smaller Than This Are Not Confirmed, David Neumann and Marcella Murray's quiet, experimental dialogue about race, the question comes up again and again — she, a young black woman, posing it to him, a middle-aged white man who cannot answer it. Not that he doesn't try, grasping for childhood anecdotes like the time in second grade that he mispronounced Niger and spurred a classroom lecture on civil rights.
Softball is that thing when you sit in a field, talking to a leaf, before a ball eventually rolls by you and then everyone is yelling for some reason.
He was the adolescent version of Don Ameche's character in Sins of Man (1936), and of Ricardo Cortez's character in The Californian (1937), and of Tyrone Powers's character in In Old Chicago (1938), among others. A breakthrough was when he played the young version of James Stewart's character in Of Human Hearts (1938), an MGM movie that earned him a contract with that studio.
To your earlier concern, I think we should examine the filibuster. I think that gridlock is bad for anyone trying to get anything done and solve problems. This might be controversial in this room, but I am for the restoration of earmarks, because it helped make legislation possible. That if I was a congressperson in a district, and there was a bill being passed, it's, Hey, at least I can get some pork for my local museum. And that's a very small price to pay for a functional legislature. So, getting past the filibuster to me is one possible necessity, and the restoration of earmarks could be another.
So that's what we mean when we say America is exceptional. Not that our nation has been flawless from the start, but that we have shown the capacity to change, and make life better for those who follow.
It's a progressive Protestant church. We primarily go upstate, where we have a house in a town called New Paltz. They've got a rainbow flag up front. It's a very welcoming community.
Ada's voices don't just talk to her; they fight with her during the novel's narration in a moving portrayal of a struggle against something that exists within, a mental anguish that no amount of reasoning can conquer. More powerful than Emezi's prose, though, is what it brings to the real world. Eating disorders, cutting, depression, suicide, manic depression — in the popular imagination, all these things are most often seen as the struggles of young, wealthy, white American women. This novel expands the universe of mental illness to include women of color and other ethnicities. Rooting Ada's story in Igbo cosmology forces us to further question our paradigm for what causes mental illness and how it manifests. It causes us to question science and reason.

Over the last 10 years, the Globes and the Oscars have agreed on best picture winners only 50 percent of the time — although they did match last year, when Green Book was the big winner at both ceremonies.
Well, he had tremendous goals and ambition to do right, to do good, to leave a legacy. Conversely, he also suffered from deep depression and tremendous insecurities, and so he would swing widely — all the way up, We're going to do this, nothing can be stopped to I can't do this, I'm going to go home. And his Lady Bird was absolutely essential to his success. Without her, I do not believe he would have been as prolific in his work and accomplishments as he was.
A working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that U.B.I. could redirect spending to more affluent and middle-income families, therefore leaving low-income families worse off; a U.B.I. large enough to direct more funds to low-income households would be extremely costly. Read the paper here.
President Is Impeached and Faces Senate Trial
Mr. Lari, a leading force for historic preservation in Pakistan, died in Karachi, Sindh's capital, on Dec. 5. He was 84. The cause was complications of Covid-19, his family said. His wife, Yasmeen Lari, a prominent architect, contracted Covid-19 in December but recovered.
The 21st-century framework. First, you don't use price as your primary determinant of whether or not there are antitrust problems, because the tech companies would say, What? We would never gouge anyone. It's free. We're underselling everyone. So that you have to get rid of, and that's not something she's advocating, but what she is advocating, which I find to be a bit backward looking, is thinking that competition is the answer in these spaces. And competition misses the point in one way and another way.
But do you think it's going to affect Hollywood itself? Because these streamers are where things are going.
CW: Sort of pivoting off of that, you said that Senator Warren's taking sort of a 20th-century antitrust framework to big tech. What does a 21st-century framework look like in that?
For a 1955 New York Philharmonic appearance under the conductor Walter Hendl, he gave the premiere of Heitor Villa-Lobos's Cello Concerto No. 2, one of many works Mr. Parisot would commission during his career to expand the cello repertory.
In the '70s or '80s, your labor and overall productivity were more or less in lock step. And we still pretend that if someone wakes up in the morning and says, Hey, I need to put food on the table, he can go out to his main street, he can sell his time for money at some hourly rate, and then he'll be able to make a good enough living so he can feed his family, raise kids and the rest of it. That has become progressively less true over the last 40 years, unfortunately, where wages have stagnated while productivity has gone up and up, and that's going to accelerate because of the convergence of capital and technology now, in unprecedented ways.
In confronting ourselves, we must face the reality that the generation of Jews I wrote about in Chutzpah--those of us who remember the Holocaust, the creation of Israel and the mortal threats to its survival, the movements to save Soviet, Syrian, and Ethiopian Jewry, the struggle against institutional anti-Semitism--is aging. Our children, who have no actual memory of embattled Judaism fighting for the life, liberty, and equality of endangered Jews, are now the crossroads generation that will determine what Jewish life in America and around the world will be in the coming century. It is to that younger generation of Jews, as well as to their parents, that I address this volume.
Ms. Tennant was presented at court in 1956, and a year later she married Sebastian Yorke, the son of the novelist Henry Green. The marriage ended in divorce, as did her marriages to Christopher Booker, a founder of the satirical weekly Private Eye, and the journalist Alexander Cockburn.
In the new Netflix series Russian Doll, Nadia (Natasha Lyonne), a cynical video game programmer with commitment issues, finds herself caught in a never-ending cycle of death and resurrection on the night of her 36th birthday party. No matter what Nadia does, she eventually dies and awakens in the same bathroom on that same night at that same party. And with almost every reset, the staccato piano chords of a nearly 50-year-old pop tune kick in.

Ms. Audran was born Colette Suzanne Dacheville in Versailles, France, on Nov. 8, 1932. Her father, a doctor, died when she was young, and she was raised by her mother.
So, that to me was the biggest missed opportunity in the Obama administration, and it happened very, very early on. I wish that they owned and reflected a little bit on the fact that maybe they could have done some things differently at that stage, because we're still angry. This country is still angry. I was so shocked by what happened in the financial crisis, I quit my job and started a national nonprofit and ran it for seven years. I had — my wife was pregnant. I mean, what happened to this country then is still tearing us apart.
Karadzic was found guilty of orchestrating the massacre at Srebrenica, a Bosnian Muslim town and United Nations-designated safe zone where Serbian forces murdered 8,000 men and boys in 1995, burying them in mass graves. Four years before, he had given a speech to the Bosnian Assembly threatening Muslims with annihilation if they voted to secede from the disintegrating Yugoslavia. White supremacists across the world, including mass shooters in Norway and New Zealand, have looked to Karadzic for inspiration.

Investigators are eyeing any military members or police officers who were part of last week's siege. Supporters of President Trump outside the door to the House chamber after breaching Capitol security during a riot last week. Credit... Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA, via Shutterstock Federal investigators working to apprehend and charge the hundreds of people connected to last week's assault on the Capitol are focusing on any military and law enforcement personnel who may have been involved in the attack, according to a law enforcement official. Investigators also have yet to find any evidence that any member of Congress helped coordinate the siege, as one prominent leader of a pro-Trump group has claimed, but are scrutinizing those leads. The official cautioned that the investigation is sprawling and that all leads need to be carefully vetted. The F.B.I. and Justice Department have already arrested several suspects who were captured in photographs inside the Capitol, including Kevin Seefried, a man who was photographed holding a Confederate battle flag; Jake Angeli, a well-known QAnon conspiracy theorist who was seen carrying a spear and wearing a fur headdress with horns; and Robert Keith Packer, who was photographed wearing a Camp Auschwitz sweatshirt. Other insurrectionists moved through the chaos inside the building in tight military formation, using hand signals and wearing tactical gear, and investigators are seeking to determine whether they were working together or whether any had ties to law enforcement or the military.
Henrietta Red, a restaurant in the Germantown neighborhood of Nashville that opened last February , has many of the telltale trappings of Instagram clickbait. While there's no millennial pink, the black sandwich board and expanse of marble at the bar, coupled with the wishbone chairs and tile-framed wood-burning oven in the dining room, fit a certain envy-inducing aesthetic. But unlike other places that hit those idealized notes, Henrietta Red lives up to its image as a place you actually want to be.
Most American laborers work in the services sector, according to Pew Research — in July 2019, 107.8 million people worked in private service-providing industries including trade, transportation and utilities.

Biden will keep a Trump appointee at the Pentagon until Austin is confirmed, and will name a new spokesman. John F. Kirby, a retired Navy rear admiral, will be the Biden administration's Pentagon spokesman. Credit... Win Mcnamee/Getty Images A low-profile deputy defense secretary will be the lone Trump holdover running the Pentagon until President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s defense secretary pick is confirmed, according to transition officials. Mr. Biden is also planning to install John F. Kirby — the former spokesman for John Kerry when he was secretary of state, Chuck Hagel when he was defense secretary and Mike Mullen when he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — as the next Pentagon press secretary. David L. Norquist, who is now the No. 2 civilian at the Pentagon, will be Mr. Biden's first acting defense secretary — if only for a few days — transition officials said Wednesday. The transition team has been pushing to get Mr. Biden's choice for the top post, a retired Army four-star general, Lloyd J. Austin III, confirmed as soon as possible. But unlike the other top national security nominees on the Biden team, Mr. Austin will have to jump through three Congressional hoops before he is confirmed. The Senate and House must approve a waiver for him to serve at the helm of the Pentagon since he has not been retired from military service at least seven years, and then he must be confirmed by the Senate.
Ms. Court is scheduled to be awarded the Companion of the Order of Australia on Tuesday, Australia Day, for her service as a tennis player and as a mentor to young athletes. The honor falls under the Order of Australia, which confers public recognition for outstanding achievement and service.
Those who could not get help from relatives or friends had to sign emergency loan agreements before the British government would send them back home. They also had to forfeit their passports until the repayments were complete, and faced a 10 percent surcharge on anything they owed after six months.
That's the question that preoccupies Jules Jacobson, the ambitious protagonist of Meg Wolitzer's remarkable novel, The Interestings, whose inclusive vision and generous sweep place it among the ranks of books like Jonathan Franzen's Freedom and Jeffrey Eugenides's Marriage Plot. The Interestings is warm, all-American and acutely perceptive about the feelings and motivations of its characters, male and female, young and old, gay and straight; but it's also stealthily and undeniably a novel of ideas. Wolitzer has been writing excellent fiction for 30 years, and it has always been this astute. From the start, her subject has been the practical, emotional and sexual fallout of women's liberation, particularly as it affects mothers and children. But here she has written a novel that speaks as directly to men as to women.

Still, life is what we have. To give less than everything to it is dereliction. In the end its wonder is unimaginable without the presence of death. As the dew dispels, the mist dissolves, and the sap rises on a morning such as the one that did not quite win over Beckett, the force of life is unmistakable. That is what put us here in the first place.
When will they ever learn? The aliens, I mean, who can't seem to resist the impulse to invade Earth and wipe out humanity. Before We Vanish, Kiyoshi Kurosawa's witty science-fiction chin-scratcher — less a horror movie than a series of musings on potentially horrifying ideas — addresses the question literally. It concerns a reconnaissance squad of space travelers sent to do fieldwork in our ways and habits, with particular emphasis on our mental concepts.
Because it's up to all of us to make sure our government can help us meet the many challenges we still face. We have what we need to do so. We have everything we need to meet those challenges. After all, we remain the wealthiest, most powerful, and most respected nation on earth.
After studying an account of the trip — in a medieval Latin text written many years later titled Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis or The Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot — Mr. Severin assembled a team of designers and craftsmen and set about building a vessel — a 36-foot-long, two-masted boat of oak and ash covered in oxhide a quarter-inch thick.

Few qualify as great in the sense of Tolstoy or Balzac but I just finished one that did: I was dazzled by the brilliance of The Goldfinch, by Donna Tartt, a masterpiece of characterization, plot, technical artistry combined with exquisite heartbreaking understanding of loss, love and art. Now that I have finished I regret its pleasures are gone, like a delicious feast — or a vanished love one will never know again.
In defending Dreyfus, Proust not only angered conservative, Catholic, pro-army aristocrats, but he also alienated his own father. In writing about the 1890s in Remembrance of Things Past, Proust remarks that the Dreyfus case was shortly to relegate the Jews to the lowest rung of the social ladder. Typically, the ultraconservative Gustave Schlumberger, a great Byzantine scholar, could give in his posthumous memoirs as offensive a description of his old friend Charles Haas (a model for Proust's character Swann) as this: The delightful Charles Haas, the most likeable and glittering socialite, the best of friends, had nothing Jewish about him except his origins and was not afflicted, as far as I know, with any of the faults of his race, which makes him an exception virtually unique. It would be misleading to suggest that Proust took his controversial, pro-Dreyfus stand simply because he was half-Jewish. No, he was only obeying the dictates of his conscience, even though he lost many highborn Catholic friends by doing so and exposed himself to the snide anti-Semitic accusation of merely automatically siding with his co-religionists.
The long months of harsh lockdown have faded from view in Wuhan, the first city in the world devastated by the new coronavirus. As residents look to move on, they cite a Chinese saying that warns against forgetting the pain after a scar heals.
And it all started with a visit to the National Hamster Council.
As far as the judge was concerned, that response sealed her fate. Anyone who knows the language, he told her, is obviously a professional.

New TV shows, museum openings, film releases and concerts — it's a lot to keep track of. Let us help you. For the week of April 8, seven events in New York and elsewhere not to be missed:
He articulated a vision for the future of work, education and technology for the nation. The board also delved into Mr. Yang's approach to foreign policy and military intervention, and learned of his fascination with aliens and fear of flying vacuum cleaners.
There have been carnal people before and they were the ancestors of most of us.
She doesn't think that four years from now, when she is 80, economic conditions for people in her situation will be great. But I'll be O.K., she said, because I know how to do without.
Re What Sleeping With Married Men Taught Me, by Karin Jones (Modern Love column, Sunday Styles, April 8): It is challenging for couples of all ages and stages in life (married or not) to keep the sizzle in their sex lives.
Michael Teague, a Border Patrol agent, is featured in the Texas edition of McGraw-Hill's 11th grade textbook. He discusses his concerns about drug trafficking and says, if you open the border wide up, you're going to invite political and social upheaval.
So, that to me was the biggest missed opportunity in the Obama administration, and it happened very, very early on. I wish that they owned and reflected a little bit on the fact that maybe they could have done some things differently at that stage, because we're still angry. This country is still angry. I was so shocked by what happened in the financial crisis, I quit my job and started a national nonprofit and ran it for seven years. I had — my wife was pregnant. I mean, what happened to this country then is still tearing us apart.
This eight-episode series written and directed by Sigal Avin (#ThatsHarassment), shown last summer on the Israeli cable channel HOT, is an ambitious and sometimes absorbing attempt to do something a little different. Avin plays with the conventions of the psychosexual thriller and the backstage drama: Alice (Ayelet Zurer of Munich), a filmmaker who could use a hit, and her actor husband, David (Gal Toren), find themselves collaborating on a darkly erotic script by a young, seductive and possibly sinister writer, Sophie (Lihi Kornowski of False Flag). (A significant character is named Nomy, in what feels as if it must be a shout out to Showgirls.)
And, not incidentally, to the locals, from whom she intends to pluck a new crop of devotees, like the frenzied Bacchae of ancient days. She sets her sights on a group of female pals, neighbors on a comfortable cul-de-sac who weathered the last lethal storm together.
Detroit is a city of 680,000 people. Its peak population was 1.7 million. If you look this direction, you can see a thriving neighborhood, and then you turn 90 degrees and you see abandoned buildings as far as the eye can see. If we were adapting, you would see not multidecade low rates of interstate migration, which we have right now. You would not be seeing 80 percent of the country have multidecade low levels of business formation, which we have right now. You would not be seeing historic lows of business formation among young people, which we have right now. You would not see labor force participation at 62.9 percent, a multidecade low which we have right now. You would not see record-high levels of drug overdoses and suicides to the point that America's life expectancy has declined for three years in a row, which we have right now.

The meanings that flow from ballet are not only about gender. Yet the use of pointwork places the woman on a different level of being.
For dancers, this entrance is famously challenging: Aurora's opening rush of vivacity must change pace and scale as she meets the suitors and dances with them the famous, ceremonious Rose Adagio. (Since the 1940s, this has featured a series of exposed balances on point that add to the adagio's high-wire nature, but the whole number is, above all, a multifaceted courtship drama — which Aurora, having not yet met Prince Right, leaves unresolved.)
On gender and sexuality, California textbooks include history that is not in Texas editions. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Growth & Conflict, California, P. 624 California states that the federal government failed to recognize nonbinary gender identities and female leaders in its early relations with Native Americans. McGraw-Hill, United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 111 Texas does not mention gender roles or gender identity in its discussion of efforts to Americanize Native Americans.
On the other hand, another group of converts, the Ultramontanes, became such fervent Romanizers that they dismayed the pragmatic Old Catholics of England. Henry Manning and William George Ward, for example, two Oxford converts, were among the leaders of the movement to declare the pope infallible on questions of faith and morals at the First Vatican Council (1869-1870) and some of the most passionate defenders of the pope's temporal power, which was threatened by the unification of Italy. These converts' views dismayed English Old Catholics who, over three centuries or more, had gradually adapted their faith to indigenous conditions. The converts were, then, anything but unanimous among themselves but tended toward radical or extreme positions in one direction or another, arousing resentment from their new coreligionists in either instance.

When did Murray first realize she was black? Neumann asks, and her answer is instantaneous, her calm certainty in perfect counterpoint to his squirming self-consciousness.
Oh, you could be on that.
This is a game changer for Americans in any circumstance. And I am not for reducing or curtailing any of these social programs. For me, we're trying to lay a foundation that works for all Americans, and then we need to keep building on top of it. So if there are people that post-Freedom Dividend need additional programs and assistance, I'm all for it.
Mr. Yang has argued that his Freedom Dividend is one answer to the needs of the millions who will lose their jobs to automation.
Over the past five years, 90 percent of A.I. start-ups in Silicon Valley were acquired by major companies, according to TechCrunch.
While I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country, turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate, he said. Wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldn't have happened two elections ago lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day, even if they are nothing like me in their experience.
The margin was enough to forestall charges that the President's fate might have been different if the vote were delayed to the 106th Congress, which will have five more Democrats.
Her death was confirmed by Shelley Ross, a former network news colleague, who said Ms. Chase had undergone surgery for brain cancer several weeks ago.

Lindbergh, then 39, joined the Ford Motor Company as a consultant, working at the Willow Run plant in Michigan, which was producing bombers. Later he was a consultant to the United Aircraft Corporation, attached chiefly to its Vought-Sikorsky Division in Stratford, Conn. Vought was producing the Navy Corsair F4U. As part of his job, he traveled to the Pacific war area in 1944 to study the Corsair under service conditions, and, as a civilian, flew 50 missions against the Japanese. The flier had at least one very close brush with death in a dogfight near Biak Island. He described this and other episodes in The Wartime Journals, and they constitute the best writing in the book. After the war, Lindbergh went to Germany for the Naval Technical Mission in Europe to study developments in Nazi aircraft and missiles. He had been interested in rocketry since 1929, when he sought out Dr. Robert Goddard, then an obscure physics professor at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. (Goddard, who had been ridiculed for his ideas, has since been recognized as a space flight pioneer.) Lindbergh was always proud of his association with Goddard and of having raised money to fund his experiments. For 16 years until his death in 1945, Goddard, also a loner, received Lindbergh's help and encouragement; and Goddard's basic rocketry patents were used in the development of United States missiles after the war.
KK: I meant more make people want to work for government? And I think that's your question, right?
Now, the building's storied history also includes La Sirena, chef Mario Batali's first New York restaurant in a decade. Since it's in a hotel, and because we have this magnificent location, it will function as the piazza at the center of a small town, says Batali, who hopes the restaurant and bar becomes a bustling hive of activity. You can have breakfast here, lunch here, late-night snack here. It's kind of a cross between Lupa and Babbo — and yet available in a much wider and more recognizable way, he says, citing two of his high-end Manhattan establishments. Food-style wise, it's kind of like a trattoria.
The Trachtenburgs had not seen the partial results from Iowa, having left home for the rally before the early numbers were released. I really feel there's going to be an upset, Ms. Trachtenburg said. I think Bloomberg has more than a fighting chance, and judging by tonight, she added, motioning to the crowd behind her, we're not the only ones who feel that way.
Gilbert Baker, a self-described gay Betsy Ross who in 1978 hand-dyed and stitched together eight strips of vibrantly colored fabric into a rainbow flag, instantly creating an enduring international symbol of gay pride, was found dead on Friday at his home in New York City. He was 65.
In an essay published by the Gotham Gazette, Kimberly Watkins alleged that Mr. Yang fired her from Manhattan Prep because he did not think she would continue working as hard after getting married. Mr. Yang appeared on The View shortly after and said there was zero truth to Ms. Watkins's account. After publication, Ms. Watkins reached out to the editorial board, noting the question contained an error — she testified before a New York City hearing on pay equity, but, as she wroteto us , I have on multiple occasions drawn contrast to 'pay equity,' with what I experienced, which concerns long term economic stability. The reality that my economic future was destroyed by Yang, right after my marriage, after an unblemished six-year commitment to this company, has been the focus of my story, not pay inequity…Yang's response [also] grossly overstates the investigative process and draws a false conclusion.
We should definitely do that, in a very big and dramatic way. And I have proposals to help move us toward a better model of high school education. Only 6 percent of American high school students are in technical, trade or apprenticeship tracks. In Germany, that's 59 percent. Think about that gulf. Meanwhile, there are millions of those trade and middle-scale jobs that are left unfilled. Why is this?
It very much is. But if you were to apply resources, you would want to apply resources in ways that don't necessarily advantage the top third of your population by educational attainment exclusively. You would be trying to build more paths with the other two-thirds, which investing in trades and apprenticeships would do, and you would try and provide for the people who are the weakest and most vulnerable in the job market, which are not going to be the people that are attending college.
Ms. Culp was a producer for the Netflix crime documentary series Exhibit A in 2019 and for The Confession Tapes in 2017. Now in its second season, The Confession Tapes, which tells of wrongful convictions, was nominated for best episodic series by the International Documentary Association. She is also a fellow for the Power of Diversity Master Workshop run by the Producers Guild of America.
After watching back-to-back programs by the Joffrey Ballet, I have many questions, but first things first: Why would a company that relocated to Chicago from New York in 1995 because of financial difficulties open its first New York season in more than 20 years with a subpar version of Romeo & Juliet?
The N.S.A. is installing a Trump loyalist as its general counsel days before Biden's inauguration. Allies of Michael Ellis, a Trump loyalist, had pushed for him to be installed as the National Security Agency's top lawyer before President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is inaugurated. Credit... Saul Loeb/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The National Security Agency is moving forward with hiring a Trump administration loyalist, the agency said Sunday, after the acting defense secretary ordered he be made the spy agency's top lawyer. Acting Defense Secretary Christopher C. Miller had ordered the agency's director, Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, to install Michael Ellis as its general counsel, giving him a 6 p.m. Saturday deadline. The deadline came and went with the National Security Agency remaining silent. But the agency said in a statement on Sunday that Mr. Ellis accepted his final job offer yesterday afternoon. N.S.A. is moving forward with his employment. Mr. Ellis has not been formally sworn in, and it is not clear when that would happen. Mr. Ellis has been accused of having a hand in one of the more contentious legal decisions the Trump administration made: the attempt to stop John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, from publishing a damning book about the president. Mr. Ellis's allies had pushed for him to be installed before President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is inaugurated. While it will be difficult to fire Mr. Ellis under Civil Service rules, the Biden administration could easily reassign him to another, less important post.
Huh. I think that pattern should be checked. I don't know why anyone, union or other, in the police would want to have somebody on there that's going to cause this issue. I hope not.
Caroline Howard, the executor of Mr. Wright's estate, confirmed his death, at an assisted living facility.

And The Washington Post reported that the president had taken extensive steps to conceal his conversations with Russia's President Vladimir Putin over the past two years.
Ms. Lansky's path to publishing was serendipitous, but she churned out more than 30 books, wrote newspaper and magazine columns and produced a newsletter. She championed natural, do-it-yourself versions of store-bought baby food and more healthful alternatives to sugary snacks, and offered homespun counseling drawn from her experience.
Mr. Bezos, who spent summers working at his grandfather's cattle ranch in Texas, also went to Princeton, where he studied computer science. He described his younger self in the Wired profile as a professional dater who had set up a systemic approach to dating modeled after the criteria investment bankers used to analyze deals. (He added then it did not work.)
So if Caldwell's book supplements and corrects Klein's, by giving a clearer sense of the ideological stakes involved in post-1960s polarization, his account needs to be corrected and supplemented in its turn. And a third new book, Michael Lind's The New Class War: Saving Democracy From the Managerial Elite, does an important part of that work, by explaining an aspect of our present polarization that can't be traced to specifically American racial fears or constitutional debates: Namely, the way that our populist-era divisions increasingly mirror Europe's, with the same exodus of downscale voters from left-of-center parties, the same polarization by education and class.
The Brooklyn-born son of the music arranger at New York's famous Roxy Theater, Mr. McCann was precocious, irrepressible and persistent.
A few months after my release, my uncle was severely injured in a suspected terrorist attack in Sinai, where he was stationed. My mother implored me to offer sympathy. I refused to call. I almost felt a sense of justice.
His death was announced by his son, Dean Parisot, a film director and producer in Los Angeles. The cellist had retired from Yale only last June.

Ms. Lee trains at least three days a week. Wednesdays are reserved for interval training with her coach, Liz de Vries. I never know what horrors she has in store for me, Ms. Lee said. But I'm turning back the clock as far as speed's concerned.
The Times of London reported on four British women who were each charged roughly $900 for the government's efforts to free them from a religious institution in Somalia where they said they had been chained, whipped and told they would be held until they married. The women's families sent them there because they thought the women were too independent.

Democrats argued back that the President's actions were wrong and deserved censure but did not rise to the level of impeachment. Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the House minority whip, said Republicans were trying to hijack an election and hound the President out of office.

I started out as a beat cop in the Southern. I was part of the Neighborhood Stabilization Unit in the Forty-Four. We walked foot patrol and did radio runs. Then for five years I was in the Senior Citizens Robbery Unit. Going proactive--decoy and entrapment--was my ticket to plainclothes. Later, another test, and downtown, with my shield. I'm now in Asset Forfeiture, but for eight years I was in Homicide. I worked murders. I was a murder police.
More than 28 million viewers watched the first episode, and by the time the finale arrived more than 100 million people had tuned in, breaking ratings records. That year, The New York Times reported, people everywhere, even those who had not seen it, were talking about 'Roots.'
All the members of the California panel were educators selected by the State Board of Education, whose members were appointed by former Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat. The Texas panel, appointed by the Republican-dominated State Board of Education, was made up of educators, parents, business representatives and a Christian pastor and politician.
After Merissa Gerson's knee surgery in March, her mother flew from Washington to visit and help out. But before her arrival, Ms. Gerson could hardly bear the thought of being in her mother's company for an entire week. When the visit was extended from five days to 53 because of a stay-at-home order in New Orleans, neither of them expected the hourslong stretches of time together would change their relationship for the better.
Larry King, who shot the breeze with presidents and psychics, movie stars and malefactors — anyone with a story to tell or a pitch to make — in a half-century on radio and television, including 25 years as the host of CNN's globally popular Larry King Live, died on Saturday in Los Angeles. He was 87.
Ms. Sabbag, who died in 2008, was equally provocative. Her early films include Sand Screens (1991), a drama centering on a woman determined to lead an uninhibited life in a deeply conservative society, and the sarcastically titled A Civilized People (1999), which touches on such discomfiting topics as homosexuality, the ill treatment of immigrant house servants and religious acrimony in Lebanese society. (The Lebanese government banned the film.)
A look at the archive of reviews, and a sampling of his prolific body of work, reveals that his reputation as a major artist — as something more than a comedian or an observer of the social mores of New Yorkers, a prisoner of his own mannerism and preoccupations — rests on the movies he made in the mid-1980s and early 1990s, the years of his involvement with Mia Farrow.
Particularly because I think we've become unduly vindictive and punitive toward statements that people find objectionable. A friend of mine said something, he said, If the online universe descends on someone, and they lose their job, the online universe moves on a week later, but that person still does not have a job a week later. That the impact on the individual lasts much, much longer than the rancor. So I shared this.
So you had this ceremony that really was both a throwback to the grandest old ceremonies of the British royal family and then something genuinely new. And at the center of all of it was this beguiling person, this figure of Meghan Markle.
Can ballet express a modern view of the sexes? In the Western contemporary world, women and men often hold equal status at work, as leaders, as voters, as breadwinners. This kind of equality, however, is precisely what ballet cannot show.
Well, among young people, there was just a jolt of excitement. You had this vision of a young person coming into the royal family, which just by itself was exciting. The queen, after all, is in her 90s. Prince Charles, the next king, is in his 70s. And then there was the nature of this person coming into the family.
It feels like the opposite of Instagram, said Emma Doany, 29, a nursing student who lives in Austin, Texas, and regularly watches the videos, favoring channels like The Secret Slob and Jamie's Journey, which to her seem authentic because the mess looks real and not staged. She often feels anxious that the three-bedroom house she shares with her husband doesn't look perfect. Seeing someone else battle a sink full of dishes somehow takes the pressure off. I watch 'Clean with Me' videos to make myself feel better, like, 'I'm not a hoarder,' she said.
Reflexionando sobre las lecciones del año pasado, podemos apilar y construir con base en los buenos hábitos que empezamos en 2020.

And how did Mr. Patinkin react? He loved it.
Births in China have now fallen for three years in a row. They had risen slightly in 2016, a year after the government ended its one-child policy and allowed couples to have two children, a shift that officials hoped would drive a sustained increase in the number of newborns. But that has not materialized.

For example, during one summer, they took two flights on vacation on private jets. And this raised a reasonable question. Prince Harry's a major campaigner for climate change.
Fresh from Yale, Mr. Borders joined The Times as a copy boy in 1960. Promoted to reporter, he was assigned over the years to cover Nigeria, Canada, India and Britain before being appointed deputy foreign editor in 1982.
I'm for a more progressive tax structure. It's clear that the people at the top of the income chain are not paying enough. I don't think a wealth tax will work. I like the spirit of a wealth tax, but if you look at other countries' experience, Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, very sophisticated developed countries, they tried a wealth tax and they wound up repealing it because it had massive compliance problems, and it did not generate anywhere near the revenue that was projected.
I mean, the question is what trade-offs you're willing to make, really. The N.S.A. is going to be able to recruit the tech talent that he can recruit and you want to try and ramp that up. So one thing ——
BLACK EDGE: Inside Information, Dirty Money, and the Quest to Bring Down the Most Wanted Man on Wall Street, by Sheelah Kolhatkar. (Random House, $28.) Sheelah Kolhatkar, a staff writer for The New Yorker and a former hedge fund analyst, tells the story of SAC Capital Advisors — ordered by the government to shut down in 2013 — and its founder, Steven A. Cohen. Our critic Jennifer Senior called the book many things: a Wall Street primer; a procedural drama; a modern version of 'Moby-Dick,' with wiretaps rather than harpoons.
In Bryan Cranston's case, you go on to play even more powerful men. He was Lyndon Baines Johnson in Broadway's All The Way, and he was Howard Beale in Network. He won the Tony for both roles. And these days, he's New Orleans judge Michael Desiato in the Showtime series Your Honor. His character's son has just accidentally killed a kid on a motorcycle — but not just any kid on a motorcycle.
I liked that our May-September romance was unconventional. Bucking the norms I had hewed to out of a sense of duty felt as validating as it did challenging.
One criticism of government subsidized journalism is that it could stifle the media's capacity to serve as a watchdog.
Asked whether the hotel's nautical flourishes have inspired the menu, Batali says he preferred to keep the two sensibilities separate. We wanted to honor the marine tradition, and 'La Sirena' is a little doff of the hat to that, but the food is more like what I want to do now, within the confines of classic Italian food. Still, Batali, a fan of Homer's Odyssey, felt a name with aquatic flair was only appropriate. My tie to the marine culture is something a little more macabre, he says. I love the idea that the sirens would sing the songs and the passing ships could not avoid them, like all the traffic on Ninth Avenue.
When I'm on the subway, people will look at me and then look at me. And then eventually someone will inch over and say, Hey, you running for president? And then I'll say, Yes, I am. They'll say, Yeah, yeah, I like you. Thousand bucks a month, something like that. And then they want to take pictures. And then as soon as someone breaks the seal, then it's safe for everyone to do it. And so, then I'll be — and then there's this uncomfortable period in this subway car after you've taken the pictures with him, you're still sitting there. And so then they're, So, where are you going? Or, how's Bernie? Or whatever the questions are. And so, I have not been riding the subway lately, but I've ridden the subway an awful lot over the years. Now my preferred mode of transportation is the bike, because if someone recognizes me, it's generally too late.
Yeah, it was too thin. And I thought, well, this is not right. But I knew that I needed to do and wanted to do a comedy. I was doing drama after drama after drama. And my whole structure of my approach to the career, long term, is to keep twisting and turning — do comedy, do drama, do stage, do film, do adult theme, do a children's show, whatever. So I knew I needed to do comedy, and it was time to do a big studio comedy, where I'm one of the two stars. But this was just so thin. I thought, I don't know. So I actually called Paul Rudd, and I said, Paul, the premise is so thin. He goes, This is the way those comedies are. When you get on the set, they rely heavily on improvisation. You get these people together, and you start improving and improving and improving. And they cull the story out of that. And he said, I think you'll have a great time. And I can honestly say, I don't think I've had a better time on any film set than Why Him? in my career. It was hilarious.
In case it's slipped your mind, Dear Sir, let me remind you: I am your wife, the novel begins. These are the words of Vanda, writing to Aldo, who has left after 12 years of marriage to move in with Lidia. You see us as an obstacle to your happiness, a trap that smothers your desire for pleasure, she writes. It is 1974, and politics are in the background. You came across a respectable young girl close at hand and in the name of sexual liberation and the dissolution of the family you became her lover, Vanda asserts. You'll go on like this forever, you'll never be what you want, just what happens by chance.
The cause was complications of a stroke and Alzheimer's disease, his son, Scot Robinson, said.
When Anne sees Stephen mired in marital and intellectual doldrums, she encourages him to have an affair with their beautiful friend Diana (Mikaela Izquierdo). Stephen is persuaded, Diana is willing, and everything's just dandy until it isn't.
But others said it had become clear that for conservative Christians, the cultural and political issues that define modern conservative politics mattered at least as much as moral piety. That was why, they suggested, Mr. Bentley was able to cling to his job for nearly 13 months after his reputation as a paragon of probity came under fire.
Bob Kuechenberg, a six-time Pro Bowl guard in the National Football League, two-time Super Bowl champion and member of the only N.F.L. team to achieve a perfect season, the 1972 Miami Dolphins, died on Saturday at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 71.

Their cat-and-cat game, which jumps among Eve's London base and the various other European capitals where Villanelle operates, unspools with the fluidity, narrative finesse and sardonic, dirty humor Ms. Waller-Bridge displayed in Fleabag. Villanelle, who's like an overgrown child — exuberant and sentimental but with no discernible conscience — looks at a photo of her next target and coos, Aw, nice face. She's so open and unaffected about her intentions that several of the men she kills mutter Sorry when they try to escape.
Eileen Gadsden, who runs a tech start-up and heard about the rally from a local City Council member, said she was undecided and had come to learn more about Mr. Bloomberg. I'm from Philly, Biden is native to us, she said, but I need somebody who's going to win.
It is likewise hard to overstate the symbolic power of General Suleimani in the region, particularly among Arab Shiite groups in Iraq and Lebanon. He was the face of Iranian power from Lebanon to Yemen, a face that brought money, weapons and advisers. Yet he wasn't the only person in the Revolutionary Guards who built such personal relationships, as the Western news media tends to depict. Far from it.
Look around the Big House in the early morn, Keith Jackson said. Feel its emptiness. Then hunker down a while, watch the crowd fill Michigan Stadium, a sea of maize and blue washing over 92 rows of backless benches. Watch the players burst ebulliently from the tunnel. Watch the Michigan Marching Band warm up. They've got mommas and daddies as proud as if they were Big Uglies opening holes for scatbacks. Listen to them belt out Hail! to the conq'ring heroes! and get chills like those that made Jackson shiver 40 years ago on his first trip here as the University of Washington's football announcer, a half-dozen years before he went big-time at ABC Sports.
You millennials, I tell you, you are so —
Sounds like you've been having pretty long days, so we appreciate you.
In the first chapter of this book, I focus on what is probably the most whispered-about subject among American Jews today: intermarriage and how to cope with this growing reality. I try to bring this controversial subject out of the closet in all its dimensions. I do not moan and groan and wring my hands. I do not present a religious agenda. I explore the issue from both a demographic and a personal perspective, in an effort to understand it and deal with it instructively and realistically. My analysis and conclusions will be controversial and will, I hope, stimulate a debate within the Jewish community and beyond. My goal is to ask all the hard questions, and to provide a wide variety of responses in addition to my own. I know that many readers will disagree with me, but I hope they will not be able to ignore the challenges I pose.
This, to me, is an emblem of what's gone wrong in American life. Where the market is all knowing and all powerful, and if the market decides that local journalism has zero value, then it has zero value. And that is not the way forward for us. We need to make our own independent determination of our own value as people, of the value of local journalism, of the value of arts, of the value of volunteering, of caregiving, of — like all the most important things in American life. And so you, in many ways, you're like the guardians of this incredible journalistic tradition, and it's like a unique privilege because the people who've pursued the same vocation in other parts of the country are just seeing it disappear.
Proust's father, Adrien, thirty-five years old when Marcel was born, came from a far more humble background, though he rose to great heights in the medical profession. His father had been a grocer in Illiers (the name is derived from that of Saint Hilaire), a village near the cathedral town of Chartres, south of Paris; Marcel gave the village the name of Combray, and today it is known officially as Illiers-Combray and has become a major goal for Proust pilgrims from all over the world. (The local bakeries are all grinding out madeleines in Proust's honor, and the house where he and his family summered has become a museum. Perhaps in another century the name Illiers will be dropped altogether as life completely surrenders to the tyranny of art.)
Mr. Bauman wrote scores of books and taught for many years at the University of Leeds, in England. He became a scholar to be reckoned with relatively late in his career. A major success came in 1989, at age 64, when he published a landmark study, Modernity and the Holocaust. Against the widespread view that the Holocaust reflected an anti-Semitic madness that had seized civilized Germany and thrown it back into an atavistic state, Mr. Bauman described the genocide as an all-too-characteristic creature of the modern era.
The real work is shifting the employees' perspective and the users' experience. In the case of the claims project, the form used to look like this:
What are the true threats of the 21st century? Climate change is number one, and then cybersecurity and A.I., loose nuclear material, military drones in the hands of nonstate actors. It's very hard to secure a location from something the size of a flying vacuum cleaner. That's very, very difficult. So we're entering an era where it's going to be much easier to be offensive than defensive, and you don't need massive levels of resources to cause significant levels of damage. To me, a new aircraft carrier does not make our elections any more secure from Russian hacking, which is the most direct threat to our democracy upcoming in this cycle. We're spending money on the threats of the 20th century, and we need to try and modernize our approach as quickly as possible.
Our marriage suffered, mostly because our once shared burdens of work and home now fell so much more on me. But there were also surprising upsides. Early in our relationship, Christian had resisted getting a dog, even though I wanted one, because of how it would tie us down and hamper our travel. Neither of us wanted children and he'd happily gotten a vasectomy. Now he expressed a desire for both dogs and children, and talked about reversing his vasectomy, making me second guess my decisions.
I grew up in a house without a stereo, and my parents' car radio was always tuned to big-band music, so my formative years were in no way informed by Elvis Presley, who would have turned 83 on Monday. But you hear a cheerful song just as you're thinking you might truly die, and you form a kind of bond with it. Driving over Monteagle Mountain with the cat latched to my head, I vowed to see his Graceland estate someday. How lucky to be moving to the very state where Graceland could be found!
An article on Sunday about the impact that the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran might have on the fight against ISIS referred incorrectly to the American whose death helped precipitate the Trump administration's strike on General Suleimani. The American was a civilian contractor, not a soldier.
I always know, she says. And of course I always knew.

Both states emphasize the role of big business from the Gilded Age to the present. HMH, American History: Reconstruction to the Present, California, P. 160 California is critical of wealth inequality and the impact of companies like Standard Oil on the environment. HMH, The Americans: United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 235 Texas is more likely to celebrate free enterprise and entrepreneurs like Andrew Carnegie.
It was a blustery March day and the Upper West Side streets were teeming and heaving in that way peculiar to New York City. But Ms. Wolitzer's apartment, on West End Avenue, was a bookshelf-centric oasis of serenity. A late-middle-aged Havanese dog named Jet sniffed around, then repaired to his position on the bed in the master bedroom. Ms. Wolitzer's husband, the science writer Richard Panek, wandered companionably in and out of the kitchen.
The muddled ballet, choreographed by Krzysztof Pastor, opened at the David H. Koch Theater on Wednesday, presented by the Joyce Theater Foundation; it comes to dancing life through the lens of 20th-century Italian politics. On Thursday, a mixed bill, featuring works by Yuri Possokhov, Myles Thatcher and Christopher Wheeldon — an all-too typical array of male ballet choreographers — didn't wash away the sense that this is a company in need of an identity.
Well, one of the joys of running for president is you get to know incredible people on the trail, including some of the other contenders. I'm on the record saying I would prefer to have a female running mate. I think teams run better if you have men and women leaders at the highest possible levels. I joke, but it's mostly true, that if you get too many men alone for too long, we kind of become morons. So we need to keep that from happening at the highest levels.

One recent morning, Mr. Prager was recording an Ultimate Issues Hour radio segment. He's written eight books (one is The Ten Commandments: Still the Best Moral Code), and since 1999 has hosted The Dennis Prager Show on the conservative Christian radio syndicate Salem.
I say we may be entering this golden age; there are no guarantees. Many Jews believe that the end is near, because increasing rates of assimilation and intermarriage are propelling us toward a demographic Armageddon. A recent apocalyptic article in a Jewish journal concluded that Kaddish time is fast approaching for the American Jewish community. (Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.) But reports of the death of Judaism may be premature--if we can change the way we think, and act, about Jewish survival. If we refuse to change, if we accept the current demographic trends as intractable, then Jewish life in America may indeed be doomed.
Oh, man. Well, thank you for making the trip. Then you know. First, any person who says they're going to run government like a business does not know what they're talking about, because they are two completely different things.
On the surface, it seems like one of the most joyfully innocent moments in Oscar history: Tatum O'Neal became the youngest competitive winner in history, taking home the 1974 Academy Award for best supporting actress at the age of 10 for the Depression-era comedy Paper Moon. But the story behind her victory is darker, involving a fractured family and bitter controversy surrounding a competitor.
The question of whether to prioritize free public college has divided the Democratic candidates. Senators Warren and Sanders say that four-year public colleges should be free, and Senator Cory Booker signed on to legislation that could make it debt-free. Senator Amy Klobuchar previously criticized the idea of free college for all, but then signed on to a version of a free-college proposal. Mr. Yang, though, has said he supports forgiving more student loan debt but thinks the Freedom Dividend is a better solution to inequality than free college.
So when Ms. Monk told a co-worker about her attraction to Mr. Gerdes, 42, he promptly invited them both to a local bar. Then he sat them down together and left. Sparks flew. Within a year, they were living together in a new Chicago apartment, where they let a dozen years pass without much talk of marriage. I'm a little shy, and essentially it felt like we were married anyway, Ms. Monk said.
Clinton, in a finger-wagging performance last January at the White House, told the nation he did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky. He denied sexual relations with her in a deposition in the sexual harassement case brought against him by Paula Corbin Jones.
Morality clauses may be relatively new to mainstream publishing, but they have a long history. The entertainment industry started drafting them in 1921, when the silent-movie star Fatty Arbuckle, who had just signed a then-astonishing $1 million contract with Paramount Pictures, was accused of the rape and manslaughter of a girl at a party. Mr. Arbuckle was acquitted after two mistrials, but by then the public had soured on him, and the studios wanted out.
The academy said that 62 women were nominated across all categories, a record. The documentary branch nominated four feature-length films that were directed or co-directed by women: American Factory, about a Chinese billionaire who reopened an Ohio automotive plant; The Edge of Democracy, which focused on Brazilian politics; For Sama, about a woman's life in war-torn Syria; and Honeyland, which looks at a female beekeeper in the Republic of North Macedonia. The fifth documentary nominee was The Cave, the story of female physicians in Syria who treat patients in an underground hospital.
Despite Lott's recent assurances that he will move ahead, some wonder whether the Senate may yet flinch from a trial because of the popular will. But Republicans have steadfastly ignored the polls all year.
The other way is that many of these competitive markets end up very quickly accelerating toward one or two winners and saying, I'm going to break you up. Does not solve that problem. I joke that it would be cruel and unusual punishment to say you have to use the fourth-best navigation app. Like what is that? Apple Maps. We all hate Apple Maps, right? If you use that thing, you're like, Oh. You curse the gods until you figure out how to get Google Maps going. So going up and saying, Look, you're the winner in the space. We're going to break you up, it doesn't revive Main Street businesses, and it doesn't actually end up solving the competition problem.
archived recording (alex azar) We need to social distance. We need to wear our face coverings if we're in settings where we can't social distance, particularly in these hot zones.
Think of Michael Caine in Hannah (1986), a sympathetic sinner animated by lust, envy and pride, and one of a gallery of semi-suitable suitors — along with Max von Sydow's imperious artist and Mr. Allen's spiritually anguished television writer — who surround the title characters. (It is worth noting that Mr. Allen's character undergoes an epiphany while seeing Duck Soup, perhaps a signal of resurgent Marxism.) And those women, played by Barbara Hershey and Dianne Wiest as well as Ms. Farrow, are examples of the kind of complex, serious women who would eventually disappear from Mr. Allen's films, replaced by romantic foils and melodramatic fantasies.
Right. And I think for the people who are calling for reform, what you have just described as a problem is, to them, a problem as well. Police officers trained for one thing — public safety — being asked to respond to all manner of scenarios that are not pure questions of public safety, and then there being problems in those encounters that have now led people to question why police respond to those in the first place.
In 1990, 12 European countries had some form of a wealth tax, while today only three have kept the policy — Norway, Spain and Switzerland. Reports by the O.E.C.D. and others have found that the tax led to an exodus of the wealthy and didn't raise as much revenue as anticipated.
Both the California and Texas 11th-grade textbooks from Pearson state, The main argument against environmental legislation is that it hurts the economy and the nation's industries.
Seeing him as needing help, though, suggests that you think he's mentally ill. Of course, it's possible that he is. But his views may have just been heightened by the extreme rhetoric that circulates in social media nowadays. If that's the case, it's not him individually but our civic culture that's in need of help. Casting a social phenomenon as an individual pathology is a perilous temptation. (You can see it in the movement now afoot to medicalize racism as a mental disorder.) In crazy times, you can have crazy views without being insane.
After the owners were ordered to reinstate Mr. Roberts so that he could finish hearing the case — which the news media came to call Collusion I — he ruled that owners had conspired to curtail the free market for players' services after the 1985 season.
For years, population experts have warned that demographic trends in South Korea, like those in Japan, show declining growth — a bad signal for replenishing the labor force and caring for retirees and other older people as they become a larger share of society. The new data from South Korea, while not a surprise, were nonetheless concerning for a country that in recent decades has become one of Asia's economic and cultural dynamos.
LEE After last year's ceremony, I said, It ain't gonna be like this next year! It's always feast or famine with us.
Several banks said that they had a lot of old frozen sperm in storage, but that it could last only so long. The reason I know this at all is simple enough: I am 32 years old, partnered to a woman, stuck at home and in the market for the finest sperm I can get.
Her goal, Ms. Kugler said, was to make it really authentic to talk about diversity in the context of each historical period.
I think the number of aircraft carriers is either seven or nine. I confess to not knowing precisely. In terms of our investment, we're spending $650 billion plus on our military. Certainly more than any other country, but I think more than the next four countries combined, and we have to examine, at this stage, whether that $650 billion is making us safer and more secure.
We have a lot of jobs, but they don't really pay enough for people to feel comfortable that they can set aside enough for their kids' education and for their retirement, or for any health emergency.
Mr. Holdsworth forged a relentlessly exploratory approach to harmony, which he brought to bear on both the guitar and the SynthAxe, a guitarlike synthesizer that allowed him added control over his tone and flow. He had his own vocabulary of unorthodox chords, often involving far reaches across the fretboard. As a soloist, he executed lightning-fast melodies with remarkable fluidity.
Larger than each work is the engaging impression created by Ms. Kent's dancers. They carry the evening. They aren't, however enriched or extended by it.
Tuesdays I'm working the midnights. So Tuesdays I generally put in an afternoon at the Leadbetter. Attired in a taupe pants suit, I sit in my own office eighteen floors above where Wilmot deadends into Grainge. I am part-time security consultant here and I will go half-time or better when my EoD finally gets to be the mandatory twenty-five behind me. That date--my Entrance on Duty--is September 7, 1974. Retirement is already sniffing me up to see if I'm ripe.
Diocesan priests, as liaisons between the church hierarchy and the laity, are caught in a morality gap between the two -- asked to promote unpopular views that in many cases they themselves do not share. According to a 1994 Los Angeles Times survey, nearly half of American priests believe that birth control is seldom or never wrong; even more say the same of masturbation. As a result, few Catholics hear preaching on touchy sexual issues on any given Sunday. This is about to change, say the seminarians at Mount Saint Mary's -- they have every intention of preaching on these topics, and some deacons already have done so in the parishes they were assigned to last summer. If people had the great opportunity we have to learn and to pray and to study, Bashista said, maybe they would come to a consensus with what the church is teaching and think of the beauty of it rather than the Thou Shalt Not. And that is our obligation: to preach and to teach the truth in charity and in love, and to be patient. After asking permission from his pastor, Cook preached against contraception in the parish he was assigned in Omaha, Neb., last summer. I was nervous, he recalled. If I hadn't really prayed on it and done it in a way that I think was not overbearing. ... I said: 'What is the nature of marriage? To give of oneself.' I didn't use the word 'contraception' until the end.
I don't see it. And that's the only way I can explain it. And for anybody to say that that makes me a racist, shame on you. You want to change what words mean. That's all there is to it.
Those who have known and watched Mr. Trump across the years cannot shake the irony of a president felled by the very formula that powered his rise: inflammatory speech and a self-regard that has congealed at times into functional self-delusion.
I do not want the N.S.A. to outsource national security work to them. I want them to try and fight fire with fire and actually recruit using some of the same methods, and I want the N.S.A. to try and work with them to the extent that they're realistic, and they know that Google is going to be innovating in ways that the N.S.A. will not be able to do.
In defending Dreyfus, Proust not only angered conservative, Catholic, pro-army aristocrats, but he also alienated his own father. In writing about the 1890s in Remembrance of Things Past, Proust remarks that the Dreyfus case was shortly to relegate the Jews to the lowest rung of the social ladder. Typically, the ultraconservative Gustave Schlumberger, a great Byzantine scholar, could give in his posthumous memoirs as offensive a description of his old friend Charles Haas (a model for Proust's character Swann) as this: The delightful Charles Haas, the most likeable and glittering socialite, the best of friends, had nothing Jewish about him except his origins and was not afflicted, as far as I know, with any of the faults of his race, which makes him an exception virtually unique. It would be misleading to suggest that Proust took his controversial, pro-Dreyfus stand simply because he was half-Jewish. No, he was only obeying the dictates of his conscience, even though he lost many highborn Catholic friends by doing so and exposed himself to the snide anti-Semitic accusation of merely automatically siding with his co-religionists.
El problema con muchos propósitos es que tienden a ser inherentemente autocríticos y provienen de una especie de pensamiento mágico que gira en torno a la idea de que con un gran cambio —algo de pérdida de peso, ejercicio regular, más dinero— la vida se transformará. Es demasiado fácil buscar un comportamiento por el que te criticas regularmente o por el que te sientes culpable, dijo McGonigal. Es esa falsa promesa del tipo: 'Si cambias esto, cambiarás todo'.
Really? So, we have to get done what we can get done. And if we have to focus on things that are traditionally bipartisan, I'd be excited to lead with that. I mean, I'd be much more excited to lead with a much bigger agenda to balance out this economy, to work for people. And I will say that's bipartisan, too. When I go around to Americans around the country, if you were to go to a room of Republicans and say, Hey, how do you feel about Amazon paying zero in taxes? They're not excited about that. They feel like this economy is rigged against them and their families, and they're generally correct, and that is bipartisan.
For nearly 40 years, they had almost no contact with their father and blame Ms. Cunningham Agee's controlling nature for the estrangement. Suzanne Agee said she believed that her father had a lot of remorse over not keeping in close contact with his first family but that he couldn't do so without breaking ties with Mary.
Many people also want smart sperm. That's why some big banks are near elite colleges. They have sperm collection centers in Palo Alto, Calif., near Stanford University, and Cambridge, Mass., near Harvard. College men are one of the most reliable groups to see the potential chaos of creating maybe 50 biological children around the world in exchange for about $4,000 over several months — and decide it is a good deal.
In the warrants, the police suggested that Mr. Mawhinney helped provide what they say was a false alibi to Mr. Dulos, who has been charged with murder and kidnapping. They also linked Mr. Mawhinney to that potential grave site.
leaned into the underlying White nationalist sentiments that had been on the fringe in his campaign for the presidency and made his campaign about re-centering Whiteness as what it actually means to be American and, by implication, delegitimizing claims for greater racial equity, be it in policing or any other important domain of American life.
Thanks to their compatibility and common frame of reference, Ms. Chau and Mr. Lau were able to transition easily into dating during the pandemic shutdown even though they had only known each other for a short time. They visited each other's homes, watched TV shows in English and Cantonese, cooked together and attended online church services and Bible study groups conducted by the San Francisco Chinese Alliance Church. Almost all of our dates have been very domestic, Ms. Chau, 30, said. We've had a lot of time to talk and get to know each other very well.
This is a game changer for Americans in any circumstance. And I am not for reducing or curtailing any of these social programs. For me, we're trying to lay a foundation that works for all Americans, and then we need to keep building on top of it. So if there are people that post-Freedom Dividend need additional programs and assistance, I'm all for it.
NASHVILLE — In 1986, Paul Simon released his seventh solo album, Graceland. One year later, my fiancé Haywood and I moved to Nashville. Haywood was driving my father's secondhand panel van with the fake wood-grain wraparound made of shelf liner that masked the previous owner's business logo. Attached to the van was a trailer too heavy for the hitch. I was driving the Exploding Pinto, the nickname derived from that car's fuel-tank fires, and on top of the Pinto were several hundred pounds of books in a homemade roof rack built of two-by-fours.
But what is extraordinary about Mr. Malleson is his ability to create characters who are capable of feeling several things at once, or who don't really know what they're feeling at all. Both Stephen and Anne seem genuinely surprised that their hearts and minds aren't as orderly as they had believed. (Ms. Gray is especially adroit at rendering these intricate emotional shadings.)
Henrietta Red, a restaurant in the Germantown neighborhood of Nashville that opened last February , has many of the telltale trappings of Instagram clickbait. While there's no millennial pink, the black sandwich board and expanse of marble at the bar, coupled with the wishbone chairs and tile-framed wood-burning oven in the dining room, fit a certain envy-inducing aesthetic. But unlike other places that hit those idealized notes, Henrietta Red lives up to its image as a place you actually want to be.
Conquering El Capitan, a 2,900-foot-tall sheer granite wall that looms over Yosemite National Park in California, seemed practically impossible given the limited tools and techniques available to alpinists of the day. The effort took the climbers 45 days, spread out over about a year and a half.

Labor force participation — the share of Americans either employed or actively looking for work — declined precipitously from the late 1990s, dropping to 62.7 percent in 2014 (its lowest rate since the Carter administration). Critics of President Obama liked to argue that this was because of government handouts. But there's a counterargument to be found in demographic trends — the Congressional Budget Office estimates that a sizable portion of the decline in labor-force participation is a result of the aging of the work force.

Two multimillionaires asking the British public, the taxpayer, to contribute 2.5 million pounds to renovate an entirely different property to the one that they'd been offered, I think is a bit awful and the crucial point as well.
Jamie Dimon, who is a Democrat but is a numbers person, has looked at the numbers and said, we should declare a national emergency around the fact that the economy is not working for most Americans. And he's proposing a negative income tax, which is a close cousin to the Freedom Dividend that I'm championing.
OK, so those issues aside — and I understand why you have raised them — I wonder what you make of the evidence that has been presented, knowing that it may not be entirely complete? To summarize what the district attorney has said in his public presentation, he said that that Officer Rolfe's life was never in danger, that he shot Rashard Brooks in the back when Brooks was running away, and that after Brooks was shot, Officer Rolfe kicked him as he lay dying. Do you dispute any of that?

The shift of power in Congress and news reports are combining to confront President Trump with the prospect of a protracted and intense political war for survival that may make the still-unresolved partial government shutdown pale by comparison, writes our chief White House correspondent.
One of the strangest and most haunting objects in 21st-century Istanbul is the twisted bronze monument called the Serpent Column, a fifth-century B.C. monument to the Greeks' victory over the Persians. Still standing inside the shattered remains of the hippodrome, broken and yet superbly elegant, it was commissioned by the Spartan general Pausanius and moved to its present location by Constantine himself in A.D. 324. One cannot help but feel, Hughes writes, that Pausanius would be secretly pleased to know that this monument — a rather etiolated creature now — is one of the few remaining classical antiquities to survive back in modern Istanbul in the public space next to the Blue Mosque, today a favorite lunch-break stop for tourists and young Istanbullus. It's like a root from a vanished forest that has accidentally survived.
He might have continued that run of success but for an ugly incident in December 1967, when he was pulled over by a man who, he later said, was an off-duty Los Angeles police officer and beat him severely.
As they tried to make a place for themselves in the Catholic Church and a case for this church in the wider intellectual world, the first generation of converts found little Catholic literature in English on which to build. They had to start almost from scratch in trying to show what Catholic science or Catholic history as serious intellectual enterprises would be like. We Catholics have no philosophy, wrote John Acton, an English cradle Catholic, in a letter of 1854 to the American convert writer Orestes Brownson. You alone can prepare us for the great controversies by founding among us a school and arming it with the principles of a sound philosophy. For Brownson and his fellow converts Catholicism was something quite new, but at the same time they were aware that it was far more ancient than its Christian rivals and that they had inherited a vast intellectual patrimony. They set to work, exploring and reinterpreting the Catholic past, trying to recover it from the obloquy of Protestant historiography as well as from the syrup of Catholic hagiography.
My students, my children, my friends' children--our next generation--understand our new status: they do not want to be regarded as victims. They do not feel persecuted, discriminated against, or powerless. They want to read the new good news, not the old bad news. A 1988 poll of Jewish students at Dartmouth College made the point compellingly: When asked whether they believed that their Jewishness would in any way hamper their future success, not a single student answered in the affirmative. That is the current reality, and it is different from the reality my parents faced--and even from the reality many of my generation perceived when we were in college or beginning our careers. The coming generation of Jewish adults will not remain Jews because of our enemies or because of our perceived status as victims. They crave a more positive, affirmative, contemporary, and relevant Jewish identity. Unless we move beyond victimization and toward a new Jewish state of mind, many of them will abandon Judaism as not relevant to their current concerns.
Historically, we've endorsed a two-state solution, which has always struck me as the best way forward, and I think it's really unfortunate that Donald Trump has moved us away from that to the extent that he has. I would try to move us back in that direction.

The SAT was first administered in 1926 and evolved out of a test used for admission to Princeton University and Cooper Union. It was inspired by military experiments with I.Q. testing.
Graham Greene once wrote: Proust was the greatest novelist of the twentieth century, just as Tolstoy was in the nineteenth.... For those who began to write at the end of the twenties or the beginning of the thirties, there were two great inescapable influences: Proust and Freud, who are mutually complementary. Certainly Proust's fame and prestige have eclipsed those of Joyce, Beckett, Virginia Woolf and Faulkner, of Hemingway and Fitzgerald, of Gide and Valery and Genet, of Thomas Mann and Bertolt Brecht, for if some of these writers are more celebrated than Proust in their own country, Proust is the only one to have a uniformly international reputation. The young Andrew Holleran, who would go on to publish the most important American gay novel of the seventies, Dancer from the Dance, wrote a friend eight years earlier: Robert, much has happened: That is, I finally finished Remembrance of Things Past and I don't know what to say--the idea that Joyce ended the novel is so absurd; it's Proust who ended the novel, simply by doing something so complete, monumental, perfect, that what the fuck can you do afterwards?
The cause was complications of a stroke and Alzheimer's disease, his son, Scot Robinson, said.
Because of her lyrical style in ballets like Les Sylphides, Ms. Koesun was often cast as a Romantic ballerina. But she could also show dramatic ferocity, as the evil antiheroine Ate in Antony Tudor's Undertow, which depicts a young murderer's development.
Oh, you might not want to push the money to the states and then have them determine how to use it in their budgets. You could empower a national program or an agency to help administer it at the federal level, if you didn't trust the states to actually use it in the right way.
Mr. Yang has frequently reiterated his commitment to a two-state solution but has not released any detailed plans about how he would advance an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan or address Mr. Trump's policies in the region. He told the Council on Foreign Relations, I don't want to prescribe the specifics of a two-state solution, as the Israeli and Palestinian people both need to be leading any conversation, and I look forward to engaging with all stakeholders.
As the general counsel of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the 1970s, Mr. Jones revealed unwelcome truths by challenging school segregation in the North and racial bias in the military justice system, in which, among other things, black defendants had complained of being unable to trust white lawyers. He was also a strong defender of affirmative action programs and other measures to address historic discrimination.

Yeah. And I think in some ways, there's some positive lessons to be drawn from that time, because there were some significant accomplishments during that era.
We love to see people who are new people, new immigrants, because they don't know anything — they need guidance, Ms. Gendy, 58, said. Those are the people we really focus on.

(In contemporary Catholicism, the sabbath begins on Saturday night.) Then he stopped at the chapel to pick up our Lord -- that is, the consecrated Hosts, which he carries to Inova Alexandria Hospital in a gold-plated cylinder called a pyx. At the hospital reception desk, Bashista was given a printed list of Catholic patients to whom he would offer Communion. First we headed for intensive care; he had been told there was a parishioner from Blessed Sacrament there. As usual, Bashista wore his clerics and Roman collar; when people he passed in the hospital halls met his eye, he smiled and said hello, and when they avoided his gaze, he let it pass. The woman in intensive care, who appeared to be in her 50's, was attached to a respirator. It hiked up her chest every few seconds and injected air into her lungs with a gasping noise. Her skin was deeply jaundiced everywhere but her hands, which were bright purple. Bashista stood close to the woman and leaned over her. When he spoke her name, her eyelids parted and she looked up at him. Bashista introduced himself and asked how she was feeling, but she couldn't speak; the respirator attachment filled her mouth. He leaned close and took one of her plum-colored hands in his. You've got a good strong grip, he said. A priest had told Bashista that the woman felt close to a guardian angel, whom she had named. Father told me about Emily, Bashista said now. She's a sweet little angel.

Dog says he has 12 children, 11 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He also says he has had four wives, been convicted of robbery 18 times and captured 10,000 fugitives. And he claims God promised to make him famous.
In Breaking Bad, you play a law-abiding chemistry teacher who decides to cook meth to provide for his family. In Your Honor, you play an incredibly upstanding judge, and you subvert the law to save your son. The shift to subversion was rather quick for this judge.
KK: I think we have some questions around economics.
I grew up in an entirely secular household. My parents did not talk about God in the house, but I had this instinctive belief in a higher power. I had many Christian relatives. I went to church over holidays growing up quite often. And then I married my wife, Evelyn, who's Christian. And so, we're raising our kids in a Christian church. I go to church when I'm home, which is not very often unfortunately nowadays. I enjoy it. My faith is still very much a journey, but I'm unreservedly thrilled about the impact it has on my wife, my boys, my family, my community.
Once they move in, this dynamic infuses every part of their marriage, right down to the night she makes a mess of the kitchen and Nate doesn't lift a finger to help, something that never would've happened in their old life when they were both working, i.e. equal partners. Before she knows it, the resentment begins to fester and Alice starts taking her lead from 1950s Nellie — whose first lie to her husband coincided with the first time she discovered another woman's lipstick stain on his shirt collar — misleading Nate about everything from birth control to the humiliating career scandal that drove Alice to leave her job.
If you run an organization, imagine having an organization that has the wrong measurements. How is that organization going to fare over time? That is where we are in the United States of America right now. We're riding a century-old measurement off a cliff, while our way of life deteriorates underneath our feet. If you looked at levels of anxiety, stress, mental health, depression, suicides, drug overdoses, you would see that we're in a mental health recession or depression, we're in a wellness or life expectancy recession or depression, and the corporate profits are going to keep on going up, because in the 21st-century economy, companies can do very, very well while not hiring a lot of people, not treating them as full-time employees, and they don't need to care what happens in their own backyard because they sell everywhere.

In 2002, 40 agents from the Bureau of Land Management descended on the Danns' ranch, backed up by helicopters. They confiscated and then sold 232 cattle. It was one of a series of punitive measures by the U.S. government stretching over decades.
THE AMERICANS 10 p.m. on FX. Talk to any television critic long enough and you'll probably hear griping about how The Americans doesn't get its due. The show never acquired the cultural capital or ratings of Breaking Bad or The Sopranos, but it has received rave reviews and taken on shocking relevance as headlines involving the phrases Russian tampering and undercover operatives blare. Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys are back for a final season as Elizabeth and Philip Jennings, K.G.B. spies and assassins at the dusk of the Cold War. But their marriage crumbles as their roles shift and their daughter, Paige (Holly Taylor), learns the skills of the family business. It's that melancholy intimacy that makes 'The Americans' more than the sum of its wigs, stabbings and spot-on period-music choices, James Poniewozik wrote in his review in The New York Times.

No creo que nos hayamos dado suficiente crédito, dijo Kelly McGonigal, psicóloga de la salud y profesora de la Universidad de Stanford y autora de The Willpower Instinct. No creo que hayamos tenido el aprecio emocional que necesitamos y merecemos por el tipo de año que mucha gente ha tenido, dijo McGonigal. La reflexión que se necesita es una mirada real, honesta y autocompasiva sobre lo que se ha perdido, quién se ha perdido y qué es lo que se quiere elegir para recordar el año 2020. La reflexión es una manera de estar listo para avanzar hacia el nuevo año. Digo eso todos los años, pero creo que es especialmente cierto para este 2021.

The Baron de Pontalba, enraged when he learned that his daughter-in-law's dowry was to be paid in installments and foiled in his 20-year attempt to seize her property, burst into her bedroom at the family's country estate in France in 1834, took out a pistol and shot her three times in the chest. Wounded but still alive, Micael, as she was known, led him in a chase around the house that ended when the baron, admitting defeat, turned his gun on himself.

It's almost enough to make you wonder if they've been hasty in calling the whole thing off. Alas, it's not over until it's officially over. There's still no word on whether Divorce — whose flagging ratings got a midseason bump after Frances and Robert ended up, briefly, back in each other's arms — has been renewed for a third installment. But whatever the show's fate, the Season 2 finale, airing Sunday, March 4, offers a bittersweet denouement. Just don't start dressing that carriage just yet, Mr. Church said in a Times interview. We never know what can happen in the post-mortem of that divorce. KATHRYN SHATTUCK
Mr. Lari, a leading force for historic preservation in Pakistan, died in Karachi, Sindh's capital, on Dec. 5. He was 84. The cause was complications of Covid-19, his family said. His wife, Yasmeen Lari, a prominent architect, contracted Covid-19 in December but recovered.

In response to announcements about Mr. Trump's planned cuts to State Department funding, retired generals wrote a letter to lawmakers citing Secretary of Defense James Mattis's 2013 comment, If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately.
AH: But do you think, I mean, he never truly apologized. He just said, I'm sorry you're offended. And while you may not have felt that way, there were other jokes he made about just Asian-Americans and Asian people in general, and there were other people who were obviously affected by this. So I mean, what kind of consequences do you think someone who makes those kinds of statements and who doesn't show any sort of remorse for it, should they face? If not firing, what should happen? What would the steps be?
A crisis is a terrible thing to waste is a quote attributed to the Stanford economist Paul Romer. He made the comment at a meeting in 2004, referring to the competition America faces from the rising education levels around the globe. Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's chief of staff, later echoed the statement after President Obama's election.
Inauguration security With heightened security underway, officials try to offer assurances that the inauguration will be safe. National Guard troops deployed to the Capitol stood guard on Thursday near where the inauguration will happen next week. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times In a briefing with Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday, federal law enforcement officials sought to assure the public that the inauguration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Jan. 20 would be safe after the widely publicized security failures that allowed supporters of President Trump to violently storm the Capitol last week. Christopher Wray, the director of the F.B.I., acknowledged that the bureau was seeing an extensive amount of concerning online chatter surrounding the inauguration — including plans for armed protests both in Washington and at state capitol buildings around the country — and said agents were trying to distinguish real threats from aspirational plotting. Mr. Wray added that the F.B.I. had arrested more than 100 people and identified more than 200 suspects since the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, and said, Anyone who plots or attempts violence in the coming week should count on a visit. James Murray, the director of the Secret Service, said he had been asked how Americans could be confident in inauguration security given the violence last Wednesday, which led to several deaths.
The president's allies have collected tens of thousands of dollars from people seeking pardons. The brisk market for pardons reflects the access peddling that has defined the Trump presidency as well as President Trump's unorthodox approach to exercising unchecked presidential clemency powers. Credit... Samuel Corum for The New York Times As President Trump prepares to leave office in days, a lucrative market for pardons is coming to a head, with some of his allies collecting fees from wealthy felons or their associates to push the White House for clemency, according to documents and interviews with more than three dozen lobbyists and lawyers. One lobbyist, Brett Tolman, a former federal prosecutor who has been advising the White House on pardons and commutations, has monetized his clemency work, collecting tens of thousands of dollars, and possibly more, in recent weeks to lobby the White House for clemency for the son of a former Arkansas senator; the founder of the notorious online drug marketplace Silk Road; and a Manhattan socialite who pleaded guilty in a fraud scheme. Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer John M. Dowd has marketed himself to convicted felons as someone who could secure pardons because of his close relationship with the president, accepting tens of thousands of dollars from a wealthy felon and advising him and other potential clients to leverage Mr. Trump's grievances about the justice system. A onetime top adviser to the Trump campaign was paid $50,000 to help seek a pardon for John Kiriakou, a former C.I.A.
For couples seeking a quickie wedding, or a whimsical one, Las Vegas is ready.
Texas policymakers feel strongly about giving students a positive view of the American economy; since 1995, state law has required that high school economics courses offer an emphasis on the free enterprise system and its benefits. That emphasis seems to have made its way into the history curriculum as well.
Let's say I'm on food stamps, and I've got a 15-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. I'm concerned about their future, very, very deeply. And then Andrew Yang becomes president, and I find out that my 15-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month starting at age 18 for the rest of his life, and my 12-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month for the rest of her life. I'm going to say, wow. That's actually the biggest value gain I've ever even heard of in history. My kid will have a financial literacy class in high school, the first semester of their senior year. It is impossible to teach financial literacy to someone who does not have money. So the kids will actually learn about what to do with the money before they start getting the money.

AK: But one of his priorities has been to get our European allies to spend more money on their own defense. And I wonder if you think that that's a worthwhile goal and how you might go about it, if you agree that that's something that should be a priority for the United States.
A VAT (value-added tax) is a tax on consumption, so the burden disproportionately falls on low-income households, who spend a larger portion of their income.

Kuechenberg (pronounced KOOCH-en-berg) started every game for the 1972 Dolphins, who went 17-0, beating the Washington Redskins, 14-7, in Super Bowl VII at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. He started 16 games during the 1973 season and playoffs when the Dolphins repeated as champions, blowing out the Minnesota Vikings, 24-7, in the Super Bowl at Rice Stadium in Houston.
A project of this kind, covering more than a century and two nations (with frequent glances at Ireland, Germany, France, Spain, Canada, and Italy), is obliged to move rapidly or become impossibly long. My approach is to single out the most influential figures from each generation and explain their work, rather than attempt to give a comprehensive account of all convert writers, though at times I have tried to rescue from obscurity characters who seem to me to deserve more fame than history has granted them, including Richard Simpson (Chapter 4), Elizabeth Kite (Chapter 7), and Bertram Windle (Chapter 8). Influence is, of course, an elusive phenomenon, not really amenable to accurate measurement. Such figures as Newman, Brownson, Hecker, Dawson, and Chesterton get comparatively thorough treatment not because they are typical of anything but because of their exceptional qualities; few of their fellow converts could rival them for insight or write so much and so well. In general I aim to demonstrate qualitative rather than quantitative changes throughout, arguing that the converts, who were never more than 2 or 3 percent of the Catholic population in either nation, were disproportionately represented in the ranks of Catholic writers, lecturers, editors, and professors, that their ideas often set the agenda for other Catholic intellectuals working within the tradition, and that non-Catholics looked to the more persuasive convert writers when they wanted to find the Catholic position on a controversial issue.
There are still those would insist on the last answer, which has been a critical shibboleth for a very long time. And so it may remain. The argument about Woody Allen is far from finished. Critical neurosis may not be curable. But it is useful to remind ourselves, via Freud, of what clinging to it can cost. Neurosis, he wrote, involves the flight from an unsatisfying reality into a more pleasurable world of fantasy. The real world, he went on, is under the sway of human society and of the institutions collectively created by it. To turn away from reality is at the same time to withdraw from the community of man.

So if that's your problem and you break Facebook into Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, does that somehow make the kids stronger or healthier? No. If anything, it actually ratchets up the incentives to try and further their engagement.
Still, a fundamental question remained: How did a former public relations executive known primarily for working with blue-chip financial companies become such a well-connected art-world player? And if Mr. Kratz, the academy's president since 2009, has given the place a new currency, as Mr. Fischl asserted, may something bigger be in store for him and the board chairwoman, Ms. Guggenheim?
Not at all. We originated the SAT during World War II as a way to determine which kids we did not want to send to the front lines. Now we treat our kids like every year is wartime. I've talked to parents and teachers around the country, and I've said, we need to de-emphasize these standardized tests. They are a terrible measurement of human value, certainly have nothing to do with character. At this point, as you said, they are more likely to test your parents' socioeconomic status than anything else.

To me, the economic imbalances are causing many of our other problems. If you look up and down the line, health problems, poor educational attainment and results, even political polarization, they stem from the fact that we have this pervasive financial insecurity where 78 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Almost half can't afford an unexpected $400 or $500 bill. If you can't pay next month's rent, it's very hard to worry about climate change. I come and talk to you and say, Hey, we need to fight climate change. And you look up and say like, I'm worried about next month. Next year, next decade has to wait in line.
Ms. Srour, Ms. Saab and Ms. Sabbag are among the women featured in Rebecca Hillauer's Encyclopedia of Arab Women Filmmakers. Ms. Hillauer notes in the preface that the book started with an investigation into the question Arab women filmmakers — do they exist? By the time she completed her research, she had enough material to expand what she had conceived as a small reference work into a tome of some 400 pages, covering women from Iraq to Egypt to Tunisia.
When they'd all gone, Bashista unvested, returning the white alb and patterned green dalmatic to their hangers in the vestry. Clearly, the Mass and the meeting with parishioners afterward elated him. I'm in the honeymoon phase, he said. But what you're seeing is the future -- I wouldn't be here if I didn't believe that. Others in the church anticipate more conflict. The Rev. Richard McBrien, a professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame, told me that the shortage of American priests would deepen the division between clergy and laity. What happens now is that people shop, he said. They go where they can get the best Mass, the best music, the best sermons. But when the day comes that there aren't enough good priests left, I think the people are absolutely going to demand from the government of the church that they have married priests. Progressive Catholic organizations hope that the successor to John Paul II will be less authoritarian and more collegial -- the true spirit of Vatican II, they believe. There is talk of the resentment many bishops are said to feel toward John Paul II, who has centralized authority at their expense. (He treats bishops like altar boys is a phrase I heard more than once from liberal priests and nuns.)
My question is this: Do I tell him that his behavior offends me and I wish to cut off contact, or do I simply decline invitations and cease sending gifts? Is one behavior more ethical than the other? Name Withheld
My opposition to World War II resulted from the growing conviction that such a war would probably devastate Europe, kill millions of men and possibly result in the end of Western civilization, he told this writer a few years ago, adding: Under the circumstances of prewar Europe, I concluded that Germany could not be defeated without the active intervention of the United States. I doubted that Germany could be defeated even with American intervention. Obviously this depended a great deal on the relationship between Germany and Russia. But if Germany were defeated, it seemed to me almost certain that Russia would be the real victor and that a Stalin-dominated Europe would be even worse than a Hitler-dominated Europe. I felt that the wisest policy for Western powers would be to arm, stay neutral and let Germany and Russia clash--and thereafter to feel their way according to changing circumstances. I still think this would have been the wisest policy. Lindbergh made his first antiwar speech--a radio talk--on Sept. 17, 1939. It was arranged by Fulton Lewis, a well-known conservative commentator.
The question is, what is the means to creating those jobs? What I'm suggesting is that if you were to put $12,000 a year into the hands of every American adult … Let's say there's a town in Missouri of 10,000 people. Let's say after I'm president, their disposable income goes up by $10 million a month. Where is that money going to go? It's going to go into car repairs, day care expenses, Little League sign-ups, the occasional night out.
At the reception, guests were all given a copy of the puzzle at their seats, but Will Shortz also let me borrow one of the big whiteboards he uses at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament for the event. As guests completed their grids, I invited them to come up and fill something in, because doesn't every recreational solver want to feel like a finalist at a crossword tournament, even if just for a moment?
I think it's actually unfortunate that I get asked about those sorts of questions, in the sense that I feel like men should leave the room and let women decide what to do with your bodies. I have a feeling I know what you would decide, and then we could come back and say, Hey, what did you decide? I also think that if men got pregnant, this would be a very, very different conversation. And we'd have a completely different approach to these issues. So, I don't have a short list of Supreme Court justice appointees, but safeguarding women's reproductive rights and having an evolving sense of the law would be very important.
Zoe Zaharakis, a freshman at Temple University, had heard about the event from a friend in Bethlehem, Pa., and brought along two of her roommates as she said she was weighing a choice between Mr. Bloomberg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
This paradoxical antiquity and novelty of Catholicism was complemented by another paradox: the converts' sense that Catholicism was both different from their former faiths and yet also very similar. They accepted their new faith as adults, having spent their youth and years of education outside the Catholic fold. In many cases a long intellectual preparation for conversion took place within other churches. The best-known British convert, John Henry Newman, for example, converted from Anglicanism at the age of forty-four after more than two decades of study and writing in Patristics. For many years he believed that the church Fathers were the precursors of Anglicanism, but at last in 1845, he admitted to himself that if they pointed in any direction, it was to Rome. Conversion changed his explicit allegiance and had immense consequences for the course of his life, but it did not overturn his pattern of thinking. The continuities in his thought before and after conversion are in many ways more striking than the discontinuities. The same was true a generation later of G. K. Chesterton, who converted at the age of forty-six. His book Orthodoxy (1908), written while he was still an Anglican, became a favorite among his Catholic admirers, who in this way acknowledged the continuity. Intellectually, then, conversion was often incremental, but institutionally (as well as perceptually, to outside observers), the jump was immense, from the establishment into the wilderness.
We grew up happy, she added. We didn't have a choice.
KK: And, who has broken your heart?
Vince, I want to talk about the protests that have been happening all over the country. And I'm curious what you think, as a union leader, when you have seen these vast crowds in 2,000 U.S. cities and towns, protesting the death of Rashard Brooks, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, among many others. What did you see when you watched those?
The plot of Bruning's epic is straightforward. In 1942, Gen. George Kenney, the newly minted commander of the Fifth Air Force in New Guinea, found himself stuck with possibly the worst command position of the war. At the end of a long supply chain, plagued by weird tropical bugs and diseases, his fighter pilots were taking a beating from the airborne Japanese. A visit from the famous World War I ace Eddie Rickenbacker gave Kenney the inspiration he needed to raise morale: He challenged his young aviators to beat Rickenbacker's record of shooting down 26 enemy aircraft. Rickenbacker and Kenney each agreed to stand the winning pilot a case of Scotch, and the race was on.

There were 275,815 births, down 10.65 percent from 2019, and 307,764 deaths, up 3.1 percent from 2019. The ministry expressed alarm about the implications, saying that amid the rapidly declining birthrate, the government needs to undertake fundamental changes to its relevant policies.

BA: Your proposal is oddly regressive. On the benefits side you're proposing that people will have to choose between this benefit and their existing federal benefits while someone like me just all the sudden gets a new check in their mailbox every month. On the funding side you're relying on a VAT, which is an inherently regressive funding mechanism. You've proposed some offsets, but I still don't understand why you don't just embrace a progressive approach to taxation. Either raise top rates or a wealth tax. If there are people who need help, why aren't you trying to help them as much as possible?
This is no doubt my favorite place, to see four generations rise up and appreciate it, for the pageantry, the ambience, said Jackson, standing inside the stadium's broadcast booth before last Saturday's game against Penn State.

The lead-up to the French presidential election has been rife with debates over immigration, terrorism and the European Union, but one nonpolitical factor has fascinated the public in France and abroad: the 24-year age gap between Emmanuel Macron, 39, the candidate who will face off against Marine Le Pen on Sunday, and his wife Brigitte, 64.
I am reminded of the story of the two Jews reading their newspapers over a cup of coffee in a late-nineteenth-century Viennese cafe. Kurt is reading the liberal Yiddish-language newspaper and shaking his head from side to side, uttering soft moans of Oy vey and Vey is meir. Shmulie is reading the right-wing, anti-Semitic German-language tabloid and smiling. Kurt, noticing what Shmulie is reading, shouts at his friend, Why are you reading that garbage? Shmulie responds, When I used to take your newspaper, all I would ever read about was Dreyfus being falsely accused, the Jews of Russia being subjected to pogroms, anti-Semitic laws being enacted all over Europe, and the grinding poverty of the Jews in the Holy Land. Now, ever since I take this paper, I read about how the Jews control the banks, the press, the arts; how Jews hold all political power behind the scenes; and how we will soon take over the world. Wouldn't you rather read such good news than such bad news?
Again, a bad cop, whether we like it or not, we get painted with a broad brush. So why would we want to continue having those individuals around causing those problems for us?
But after hours, alone in his little Parisian bolt-hole, Lequeu (1757—1826) birthed on paper an architecture of wild grandiosity. Styles collided. Historical epochs blended together. European forms mingled with those of Asia and the Middle East. Classical restraint gave way to sensuous, sometimes racy ornament. Buildings became enmeshed with bodies: sometimes human ones, sometimes those of giant farm animals.
It's every married couple's fantasy, at least in theory: You get to have sex with anyone you want, no questions asked. I'm saying let's both do it, and let's swear to keep our mouths shut about it for the rest of our lives, says the wife in Sarah Dunn's new novel, The Arrangement, as she and her husband devise a little six-month-long adultery program.
Season 2, Episode 8: 'The Kingmaker'
In 2007 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that states direct 14 percent of funds from tobacco taxes and the national settlement toward antismoking campaigns, but most states have funneled it toward other areas, from agriculture to literacy.
East Asian communities around the state are celebrating, with parades, festivals and family gatherings at home. (Here's a list of events in Southern California, and one for the Bay Area.)
There's a perfect foreboding moment near the beginning of The Lucky Ones that gets at what I take to be the heart of the matter.
If you don't get married, asked a student from the Philippines, won't you have to move home and take care of your parents? That comment elicited murmurs of recognition and a discussion about the difficulties of resisting something we're told is natural, such as the assumption that women are always caregivers. None of these students come from a country known for progressive gender politics, which may be precisely why they see the value in a feminist perspective: It helps them think about what needs to be changed — and how. Without ignoring the specifics of their experiences, they found the commonalities in being told to be the neck, or to find a boyfriend, or to forgo graduate school.
That evening I was alone. My guy Tobe was out of town, attending some kind of computer convention. I hadn't even started on dinner: I was sitting there with my Discuss Group biography open on the couch, next to the ashtray. It was 20:15. I remember the time because I had just been startled out of a nod by the night train, which came through early, as it always does on Sundays. The night train, which shakes the floor I walk on. And keeps my rent way down.
Saturday's votes were the penultimate step in the most serious conflict between Congress and a President since Richard M. Nixon resigned in the face of impeachment and certain conviction on Aug. 9, 1974.
Floating over the narrative of Red Clocks, too, is the figure of Eivor Minervudottir, the subject of Ro's biography. This Arctic explorer's fierce yet cool interest in the natural world provides Zumas's suggested answer to the question: What is a woman when she is by herself? If, as Virginia Woolf posited, a woman must have … a room of her own — and, one is tempted to add, a womb of her own — to be able to create, then why are we so fearful of what nonsexual, nonreproductive passions could emerge from female solitude? And, if Minervudottir's tale never quite coheres, never quite touches the rest of the book, then her very ice-floe remoteness becomes a stark reminder of our society's detachment from a world in which a woman could simply and happily be left alone.
We used to carry on and drink and do the rock 'n' roll, he sings. We never thought we'd get older/We never thought it'd grow cold.
Considering the state's financial straits, Mr. Cuomo leaned heavily on proposals that would need little or no state funding, like banning gun ownership for people who have committed certain misdemeanor crimes in other states, banning foam food containers and outlawing synthetic opioids similar to fentanyl.
KK: Yeah, that's literally our question.
Putting aside medical exemptions, many students are just resistant. They are used to typing and prefer it to writing. They may feel they take better notes by keyboard. They may feel they know how to take notes by hand but do not want to have to do so. They can look up material, and there's no need to print assignments. Some may have terrible handwriting, or find it uncomfortable or even painful to write.
Indeed. As understood by someone who thinks of British history in the most traditional way.
Enter Kyle Duncan, the man we are to believe has the fairness and temperament to be a federal judge.
Mr. Yang's candidacy has centered on the idea of his Freedom Dividend, essentially universal basic income — which has a long history, drawing support from Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King Jr. and Friedrich von Hayek, but also a controversial one. (Later annotations will look at why.)
Thousands of people have been evacuated in what was most likely the largest peacetime maritime rescue operation in Australia's history, the authorities said. About 3,000 army reservists, along with aircraft and naval ships, are also being made available to help with the evacuation and firefighting efforts.
Some sleepers--maybe just two or three--the dead will never leave.
We are later introduced to Saint Vincent, a gentler personality who prefers to move in Ada's dreams. But it is Asughara who forces Ada's rational self ever further into the background and takes over her body more than any other personality.
What does it mean to grieve someone who is alive, but who walks, talks, thinks, acts and looks different from before? The experts call this kind of loss ambiguous grief or unconventional grief. People with loved ones who fall prey to Alzheimer's may experience this, as may parents whose children become alcoholics or drug addicts.
Mr. Yang argues that the automation of manufacturing jobs — especially in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri and Iowa — helped breed the discontent and economic desperation that led to Mr. Trump's election.
KK: For millions of Americans, church and religion are the centers of their communities. Do you believe in God? Do you go to church regularly? Who are your spiritual advisers?
So well-developed were Mr. Trump's survival instincts, in theory, that he had all but perfected the art of semi-plausible deniability — an upside of being on seemingly every side of every major political issue at various points in his adult life.
Well, what you're describing is similar, in some ways, to what protesters and activists and reformers are asking for — a social worker at a scene instead of a police officer, a therapist at a scene instead of a police officer. I hear you saying that that is at odds with defunding and dismantling police. But help me understand why. If a social worker takes the place of a police officer, if a group of therapists is on call instead of a traditional police officer, then why do you need more money for policing? Don't you need less money for policing?
I waited. Take your time, Colonel, I said. I thought it might be a good idea to do something null and soothing, like maybe get to some bills. Say as much as you want or as little as you want.
On the 60th anniversary of the Cuban revolution, which the ruling Communist Party celebrated on Tuesday, the island nation is stable, having overcome such existential threats as the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 and a half-century of diplomatic isolation and withering economic sanctions imposed by the United States.
CW: Well, what about when it comes to like the N.S.A. and the technology they have and the surveillance? You don't want Google doing surveillance of people here and abroad?
Here, too, a dark side emerges. One former lover is killed in a bar fight. Ms. Bosworth becomes pregnant just before filming The Nun's Story in Rome, and nearly dies from the complications of an illegal and poorly performed abortion.
KK: Yeah, that's literally our question.
William Borders, a former foreign correspondent who rose to senior editing positions at The New York Times in a 46-year career there, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 79.
The problem with letting publishers back out of contracts with noncelebrity, nonreligious, non-children's book authors on the grounds of immorality is that immorality is a slippery concept. Publishers have little incentive to clarify what they mean by it, and the public is fickle in what it takes umbrage at.
Episode one details the threats and harassment rained down upon the women who spoke out in the original documentary. The parents of one young woman, Faith Rodgers, said they had to move out of fear for their safety. A Kelly associate threatened to release a compromising video of Ms. Rodgers with Mr. Kelly, and she had a seizure from the stress. Another woman, Jerhonda Pace, said strangers, presumably Mr. Kelly's fans, threatened to beat her up in a parking lot when she was out with her children. She has since moved out of Illinois.
Mr. Yang and his family began attending Sunday services at the Reformed Church of New Paltz after they purchased a home nearby in 2015.
KK: Do you think — speaking of allies, do you think Turkey is still an ally to the United States, and do you think the U.S. should have nuclear weapons there?
I started and ran a national nonprofit called Venture for America that recruited enterprising college graduates to help grow businesses in Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, New Orleans, Birmingham, Baltimore, and nine other American cities. We helped create several thousand jobs. I'm very, very proud of that. But I realize that the jobs we were creating were only going to apply for a small slice of the population. And these jobs were pouring water into a bathtub that has a giant hole ripped in the bottom. I'm running for president to let America know that it is not our imagination, the water is rushing out of the bathtub. Immigrants have nothing to do with it. It's the fact that we're going through the greatest economic transformation.
The needle was so small beside the big man.
very consistent and compelling evidence to suggest the some of what we have witnessed this past week is a reflection of the angst, anger, and refusal to accept an America' in which White (Christian) Americans are losing dominance, be it political, material, and/or cultural. And, I use the term dominance here, because it is not simply a loss of status. It is a loss of power. A more racially, ethnically, religiously diverse US that is also a democracy requires White Americans to acquiesce to the interests and concerns of racial/ethnic and religious minorities.

Mr. Biden proposed a wide range of efforts to help those who have suffered the most under the economic shutdowns, including emergency paid leave to 106 million Americans, regardless of the size of their employer, and extending tax credits to many families to offset up to $8,000 in annual child care costs.
In 1977, Ms. Cole won a supporting-actress Emmy for her portrayal of Matilda, the wife of Chicken George (Ben Vereen), in Roots, the eight-episode ABC mini-series based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1976 book by Alex Haley. The series followed his ancestors' journey from West Africa to the United States as slaves, and many generations beyond.
She has her indulgences: She tends the community garden next door and drinks the occasional glass of white wine.
In the 1990s, a series of private reports and studies found that Roman Catholic nuns were being sexually abused by priests or bishops. But only now is the issue seeing the light of day, after Pope Francis acknowledged the problem this week.
Ditlevsen's faceted truths tend to cut in more than one way — a jab in the heart, a slash to the throat. The confirmation party her mother throws to usher her, at 14, into the working ranks is another set piece of tenderly wrapped horror. The trap of filial piety isn't lost on Ditlevsen, but escaping a fate of low expectations and lower-paying jobs is never as simple as recognizing their cruel, gray facts. At first, she plays this for bruising comedy, recounting a stint as a nanny to a small boy who tells her, You have to do everything I say or else I'll shoot you. When she finally earns enough money to rent that essential room of her own in which to write, it is in a flophouse run by a blowsy Nazi who blasts Hitler's speeches on the radio but complains about the clatter of Ditlevsen's typewriter.
Her seven days in the blue chair were occasioned by her stepmother telling her that her father hadn't died of brain cancer, as Owusu had believed, but of AIDS. Owusu had idolized her father; she calls him her Baba-Mama, the parent who believed in her, who loved her. He died just before she turned 14; she remembers him slipping in and out of delirium, crying out for his own mother in his sleep. They were living in Rome at the time, because her father happened to be stationed there. But Ghana, which she visited, didn't feel like home to her either. The ancestral mourning rituals that his family forced her to endure made her feel even more alienated.
We decided we had to do something, she told me. I had this idea of talking to veterans and learning what their issues were. I began to learn about things like human-centered design and started with this smushy idea that we didn't know enough, so let's just start talking to people and build some qualitative data to better understand what's going on here.
Ms. Heimel's informal, confessional writing about sex and relationships preceded by more than a decade that of Candace Bushnell, whose column about dating for The New York Observer led to the HBO series Sex and the City.
In the final chapter, I propose a series of steps that I believe we must take in order to safeguard the Jewish future. We must change the nature of American Jewish life in fundamental ways if we are to survive the new threats to our continuity as a people. These changes must make us more adaptive to the reality that we can no longer define ourselves--and our children--by reference to our past victimization and persecution. We must adopt a new, more positive, Jewish identity based on a 3,500-year-old tradition of education, scholarship, learning, creativity, justice, and compassion. But first we must figure out a way to make this diverse library of Jewish knowledge accessible and useful to generations of Jews who are abysmally ignorant of their remarkable tradition. The famed Yiddisher cup (khop)---Jewish head--is only half full: the typical Jewish college graduate is extraordinarily well educated about general subjects, but goes through life with a kindergarten understanding of Judaism. We must begin to fill the Yiddisher cup with the kind of useful Jewish knowledge that will assure both our success and our survival. To do this, we will have to loosen the monopolistic hold that rabbis now have over Jewish education, so that we can begin to compete effectively in the marketplace of ideas for the minds and hearts of our Jewish youth.
GARCIA-LEE I don't think I have my full capacity back. I've started dancing again, and it just feels like something is off in my chest.
Well, only to correct because of the severity, he's actually in Georgia, being charged with felony murder. Which means that if he's not put to death, he will spend the rest of his life in prison without a chance for parole. And to answer your question, it's heavy on my heart and disheartening, not so much of the charge, as the fact that the due process and the investigation that led to the charge was not done at all, and very done improperly.
CW: But doing it in a national security sense. Or do you?
Although she didn't know it at the time, Mr. Hocking was thinking the same thing.
Ten days after her release Miss Holiday gave a concert at Carnegie Hall to a packed house but, although she appeared at concert halls in New York from time to time after that, she was not allowed to appear in New York night clubs. As a result of her narcotics conviction, she could not get the necessary cabaret license. During the Nineteen Fifties Miss Holiday's voice began to lose its useful elasticity. This, combined with occasional brushes with narcotics agents, made her last years difficult, although she continued to record frequently. Miss Holiday appeared in a film, New Orleans, in 1946 and was featured in a Broadway revue for a short run a few years later. In 1954 she made a tour of Europe and was featured in a widely acclaimed television program, The Sound of Jazz, in 1958. She is survived by her husband, Louis McKay. A previous marriage, to Joe Guy, a trumpet player, ended in divorce.
As Brad and Susan led me on a walking tour of their offices, which they moved into in 2012 and, later on, their manufacturing facility, their rapport seemed warm and relaxed, both with their employees and each other. Their work space is an open floor plan, painted white, with skylights, windows and plants scattered about. No one has an office except for Mr. Black, Ms. Griffin-Black, and the head of human resources. The couple's own offices, across the hall from each other, are unprepossessing to the point of minimalism — equipped with a standing desk (for Ms. Griffin-Black) and a stool (for Mr. Black), couches and various personal items, such as travel photos and Buddhist memorabilia.
Martin is a history teacher with the listless, sloping posture of a comma. He walks slowly, as though every step ignites a jolt of pain. His job is uninspiring; his marriage is falling apart. Have I become boring? he asks his wife. Do you find me boring?
On the way out, I told the receptionist I was sorry if I had been rude. I've had a bad morning, I said. It was true: I've had bad mornings for three years.
A Times evaluation of Mr. Yang's tax plan by N. Gregory Mankiw, professor of economics at Harvard, found that Mr. Yang's tax plan would target the affluent who spend their money lavishly while incentivizing people to save.
Every now and then during my visit, she sat at her large wooden desk and took out a legal pad. In that space, she seemed to imagine her former self returning, as if a professional atmosphere could reawaken her lost language. I longed to see sentences flow onto the page. But after scribbling two lines in half an hour, she put down her pencil in exhaustion.
BS: Any more than they already are.
TV, etcetera, has had a terrible effect on perpetrators. It has given them style. And TV has ruined American juries for ever. And American lawyers. But TV has also fucked up us police. No profession has been so massively fictionalized. I had a bunch of great lines ready. Like: I was quit when you came in here. I'm twice as quit now. But this was Colonel Tom I was talking to. So I spoke the plain truth.
For decades in this chaparral-covered ecosystem, it's been a ritual: after the burn comes the rebuild. But as the nation's most populous state stares down a seething climate crisis, one that cranked temperatures into triple digits last fall and set off a series of infernos that exploded, into bone dry air, the rebuilding process is beginning to look different.

For Anna (Maggie Siff), the 44-year-old star of a popular, long-running television series in Los Angeles, burnout is imminent. Weakened by an autoimmune disease and weary of her brittle character, she abandons the series and returns to New York City to reconnect with the friends and collaborators who helped spark her career. But a lot can happen in two decades, and Anna is about to learn that the bits of ourselves we leave behind can't always be reclaimed.
Will the man chosen to be the next Pope be willing to give bishops greater autonomy -- thus opening the door for discussion of other changes, like relaxing the moral doctrine and even reconsidering celibacy and the role of women? Whatever happens, the Catholic laity may well continue do as it thinks best in the moral sphere. American Catholics have matured, says William D'Antonio, a research professor at Catholic University. Vatican II has succeeded. The real documents of Vatican II are freedom of conscience and the responsibility of individuals not to blithely follow the leader. According to the University of Maryland Survey Research Center, more than two-thirds of Catholics say that when their conscience is at odds with the Pope, they should follow their conscience.
We wish him success in his future endeavors, Bruce Allen, the Redskins' team president, said in a statement. The team will have no further comment on his departure.
The effects of these economic changes, Autor wrote, have been devastating:
BA: Your proposal is oddly regressive. On the benefits side you're proposing that people will have to choose between this benefit and their existing federal benefits while someone like me just all the sudden gets a new check in their mailbox every month. On the funding side you're relying on a VAT, which is an inherently regressive funding mechanism. You've proposed some offsets, but I still don't understand why you don't just embrace a progressive approach to taxation. Either raise top rates or a wealth tax. If there are people who need help, why aren't you trying to help them as much as possible?
CW: Who else besides you that you're running against understands the internet?
JI: I actually really quickly want to go back to a question that Binya was asking you. You said, you gave us the example of parents with two kids and you're on food stamps and you're worried about your kids' future. And at the end of that explanation, you said that you are not for curtailing social supports, but isn't your plan such that, that mother, aside from what the kids would get in the future, that mother would have to choose between the food stamps and the actual U.B.I., right? Is that correct?
I love work, and the numbers also clearly show that people need work. Men in particular, without work, they volunteer less than employed men. So think about that for a second. They have higher rates of substance abuse, their health deteriorates, all these social ills accompany. Of course, we need to create jobs in as many communities as possible.

Prayer Break: Michael Dobbins (left) and Brian Bashista in an afternoon ritual.
Aftershocks is thematically structured like an earthquake, including the rumbling foreshocks and the shuddering ground after an upheaval. The narrative swings back and forth in time, from Owusu's earliest memories to a week she spent in her room a decade ago, when she was 28, barely moving from a blue rocking chair she had pulled off the street and hauled up to her Manhattan apartment. I have written for meaning rather than order, she says in a prefatory note. She keeps returning to her chosen metaphor, looking for the fault lines, closing in on the epicenter. The softer the soil, the stronger the shaking, she writes.
Wow, I love this question. There are many causes of poverty, and the fact that we're not able to put food into people's houses and on their tables is a structural problem. My campaign's based upon the premise that we're going through this profound economic transformation, the fourth industrial revolution. And one of the major problems is that we still pretend we're in the economy of the '70s or '80s.
We speak of mixed motives as if they were a special case and our motives were normally pure. Maybe it's the other way around. In this instance, you're justly angry about what your ex has done. (I leave aside the issue of whether you have reason to reproach yourself for your own conduct: continuing to pursue a relationship with someone who, you'd learned, was in another one.) Still, it's important that, if you share your experience with the fiancée, you do so out of concern for her and not out of hatred for him. Which makes it important, in turn, that you ask yourself whether telling her will really be for her own good.
So you definitely need to bring the tech companies to heel and say, Look, here are the list of problems we're concerned about. But the solution to the abuse of power is not to say like, Hey, we're just going to try and keep anyone in the country from having the ability to do wrong. What you have to do is you have to figure out what the abuses you're concerned about are, and then actually address them directly.
So if you look at other countries, they have a value-added tax and then they take those resources and put them to work toward various social programs in ways to balance out the inequality. Now, another thing I love about the value-added tax is you can either reduce it or exempt things like diapers, toilet paper, eggs, milk, things that Americans consume just to make ends meet, and you can dial it up on things like artificial intelligence, yachts, luxury watches. There are ways that you can make it so that it falls more heavily on people that would barely notice. And we're taking the resources plus an additional hundreds of billions of dollars and putting it directly into the hands of working Americans. This would increase the buying power of literally 90 percent of Americans.
In addition to the nine we already have. I believe that — so if you look at the Constitution, there is nothing there that stipulates the number of Supreme Court justices. We've had fewer than nine, we've had more than nine. I think that appointing new justices would be helpful on several levels. It would help depoliticize the process, at least marginally, because if you have 17 justices and one steps down, then it's not as much of an earthquake. Well, right now we we're hinging our laws on the health of an octogenarian. It would literally be rational for us to all just to follow Ruth Bader Ginsburg around and just scrub any door knob she touches. You know what I mean?
In Text Me When You Get Home Kayleen Schaefer recalls a first date — not with a potential romantic partner but with a potential friend. Describing the emotional rush of an evening spent colluding and conjoining, she sounds as if she has a new crush: I related to every single thing she said, Schaefer tells us, reporting that they discussed things I don't typically share with someone I'm just sitting down with for the first time. She gushes to her mother via text the next day: I have a new best friend. … I love her.

Well, the labor force participation rate has declined precipitously, so I don't buy that somehow the government started giving people more money over the last number of years. And the headline unemployment rate, and I'm sure you know this, it doesn't measure underemployment, 40 to 44 percent of recent college graduates are now doing a job that does not require a college degree. It does not measure the fact that 94 percent of new jobs in the economy are temp, gig or contract jobs that do not have health care benefits and can disappear at any moment. It doesn't include the fact that you might be doing two or three jobs to make ends meet.
The other way is that many of these competitive markets end up very quickly accelerating toward one or two winners and saying, I'm going to break you up. Does not solve that problem. I joke that it would be cruel and unusual punishment to say you have to use the fourth-best navigation app. Like what is that? Apple Maps. We all hate Apple Maps, right? If you use that thing, you're like, Oh. You curse the gods until you figure out how to get Google Maps going. So going up and saying, Look, you're the winner in the space. We're going to break you up, it doesn't revive Main Street businesses, and it doesn't actually end up solving the competition problem.
Mr. Booker has made criminal justice reform a cornerstone of his Senate tenure. He sought early on to craft bipartisan bills that would have changed penalties for nonviolent crimes and reduced prison sentences, though neither effort became law. Late last year, Congress passed a criminal justice reform act, signed by President Trump, that Mr. Booker had originally sponsored. But during his time as mayor, Newark's police department faced accusations of brutality and intimidation, and the Department of Justice launched an investigation into the department; Mr. Booker said he welcomed the inquiry.
McKelley noted that he keeps seeing 'testosterone is missing' show up in critiques of the guidelines, but psychologists don't measure or manipulate testosterone levels in patients.

They postponed their 200-person wedding that was scheduled for October 2020, and the couple married on New Year's Eve at an Airbnb property in Mount Kisco, N.Y. And, in true pandemic fashion, their 14 guests, which mostly included close relatives, sent screen shots of their negative Covid-19 tests before arriving.
The academy said that 62 women were nominated across all categories, a record. The documentary branch nominated four feature-length films that were directed or co-directed by women: American Factory, about a Chinese billionaire who reopened an Ohio automotive plant; The Edge of Democracy, which focused on Brazilian politics; For Sama, about a woman's life in war-torn Syria; and Honeyland, which looks at a female beekeeper in the Republic of North Macedonia. The fifth documentary nominee was The Cave, the story of female physicians in Syria who treat patients in an underground hospital.

In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, architecture found itself back at the drafting table. Clients got spooked (or went broke), construction rates plummeted in the United States and Europe, and young architects in particular had to find new ways to work. And so this past decade has greeted a welter of digital projects, performances, pop-up designs and paper architecture, by practitioners born too late for big budgets.
At The Seattle Times, where he shared a Pulitzer in investigative reporting in 1997, and later at The Los Angeles Times, where he was Seattle bureau chief, Mr. Tizon (pronounced TEA-zahn) was admired as a prose stylist and was known for long, deeply reported articles.

In a 1985 study of college men, Hoge concluded that making celibacy optional, as it is for Eastern Orthodox and Protestant clergy (celibacy has been required of Catholic priests only since the Second Lateran Council in 1139), would increase the number of candidates fourfold. So far, though, the church hierarchy has shown no interest in such a reform, and with the exception of Bishop Raymond A. Lucker of New Ulm, Minn., who called in a pastoral letter last fall for a dialogue on celibacy, very few American bishops have spoken publicly on the issue. A former architect who practiced for seven years before entering the seminary, Bashista would have been an anomaly 30 years ago, when nearly three-quarters of entering seminarians were under 25. But today he is the norm; 86 percent of seminarians are older than 25 when they enter, and 16 percent are older than 40, meaning that -- with four years of theology in front of them, often preceded by a year or more of pretheology and sometimes interrupted by a mandatory year of ministry or reflection -- some will be 50 or older by the time they become priests. The student body at Mount Saint Mary's includes a doctor, a concert pianist and several military officers -- evidence of the rising number of second career priests who embarked upon secular lives after college, but then experienced spiritual epiphanies that upended those lives and remade them.
At the moment of this confrontation, Aldo tells Vanda only that he's been with another woman, not the more hurtful truth that he's deeply in love with Lidia. We learn years later about his lack of nerve. Several years after this dramatic rupture, Aldo and Vanda come back together — a painful process that takes time; their new equilibrium requires them to hide things from each other. They live together for decades. One day, they return from a beach vacation to find their Rome apartment ransacked.
Mr. Kelly's brothers discuss their childhood in Chicago, including how Mr. Kelly was sexually abused by a family member and a family acquaintance.
When Mr. Rainey opened Hung on You in 1965, he had little fashion or tailoring experience, but the store flourished as part of a vanguard of hip London shops like Granny Takes a Trip. His frilly shirts, jackets with velvet cuffs, kipper ties, lemon-hued sharkskin suits, Great Leap Forward Mao jackets and reworked military uniforms turned customers into peacocks.
Sylvia Chase, an Emmy Award-winning correspondent whose professionalism and perseverance in the 1970s helped a generation of women infiltrate the boys club of television news, died on Thursday in Marin County, Calif. She was 80.

In their separate spheres, Davis and Crawford deal with the success of Baby Jane very differently. In real life, Davis did tons of publicity for the film (Sarandon re-creates Davis's appearance on the Andy Williams Show when, in a flowing, sky-blue dress, she sings a funky pop song called Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?). Crawford did very little publicity, despite Warner's warnings that this could hurt her come Oscars season. The reviews of Baby Jane focus mainly on Davis, causing Joan to toss down a newspaper in fury: It's like I wasn't even in the damn thing!
There has been a continuing controversy over Hong Kong's law banning masks to target anti-government protesters. One court ruling found it unconstitutional, but a later ruling temporarily reinstated it.
August 27, 1974 OBITUARY Daring Lindbergh Attained the Unattainable With Historic Flight Across Atlantic By ALDEN WHITMAN In Paris at 10:22 P.M. on May 21, 1927, Charles Augustus Lindbergh, a one-time Central Minnesota farm boy, became an international celebrity. A fame enveloped the 25-year-old American that was to last him for the remainder of his life, transforming him in a frenzied instant from an obscure aviator into a historical figure. The consequences of this fame were to exhilarate him, to involve him in profound grief, to engage him in fierce controversy, to turn him into an embittered fugitive from the public, to accentuate his individualism to the point where he became a loner, to give him a special sense of his own importance, to allow him to play an enormous role in the growth of commercial aviation as well as to be a figure in missile and space technology, to give him influence in military affairs, and to raise a significant voice for conservation, a concern that marked his older years. All these things were touched off when a former stunt flier and airmail pilot touched down the wheels of his small and delicate monoplane, the Spirit of St. Louis, on the tarmac of LeBourget 33 1/2 hours after having lifted the craft off Roosevelt Field on Long Island.
The power-sharing arrangement was developed when Malaysia became independent from Britain in 1957 and the sultans — who had previously ruled independently, with support from the British colonial authorities — needed to nominate a figurehead to rule over a newly federalized nation.

Mr. Gillis issued what some saw as a non-apology, writing on Twitter that he is a comedian who pushes boundaries and his intention is never to hurt. He added, I'm happy to apologize to anyone who's actually offended by anything I've said.
He articulated a vision for the future of work, education and technology for the nation. The board also delved into Mr. Yang's approach to foreign policy and military intervention, and learned of his fascination with aliens and fear of flying vacuum cleaners.
When Grace Rhona Wurtele Gillis died on Jan. 17 in suburban Montreal at 97, she and her sister, Isabella Rhoda Wurtele Eaves, who survives her, were remembered as pioneers of women's skiing in Canada.
Whether it's reacting against patriarchy, pixelation, or the oppressive austerities of midcentury Minimalism, the use of crafty patterns in contemporary visual art has always had a political charge. But several of the 26 artists in this exhibition — jointly organized by El Museo del Barrio, the Hostos Center for the Arts & Culture and the Bronx Council on the Arts — make those politics even more explicit by combining decorative motifs with images of the body.
When he finished he walked slowly up the Democratic side of the aisle, Democrats applauding him and hugging him as he moved along. The Republicans remained fixed in their seats.
Mr. Lownes had a heart attack at his New Year's Eve celebration and died in the hospital after a second heart attack, Glenn Young, a book publisher and longtime friend, said.
So, right now, the government is like this flopping appendage behind a lot of this stuff. I mean, honestly. The Office of Technology Assessment was eliminated in 1995. So our legislature is literally 24 years behind the curve on technology, and they don't understand. They're totally outgunned. They don't know what's going on.
Even after people leave religions where they have suffered abuse, they can still harbor the emotional conviction that they are basically sinful and wrong, says Marlene Winell, a human development expert who coined the term religious trauma syndrome in a series of articles in 2011.
His son Errol said the cause was emphysema.
The Joffrey, formed in 1956 by Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino, is now under the artistic direction of Ashley Wheater. In its heyday, it held an important place in dance, as a crucial repository for historical works by choreographers like Léonide Massine and Vaslav Nijinsky.
The other way is that many of these competitive markets end up very quickly accelerating toward one or two winners and saying, I'm going to break you up. Does not solve that problem. I joke that it would be cruel and unusual punishment to say you have to use the fourth-best navigation app. Like what is that? Apple Maps. We all hate Apple Maps, right? If you use that thing, you're like, Oh. You curse the gods until you figure out how to get Google Maps going. So going up and saying, Look, you're the winner in the space. We're going to break you up, it doesn't revive Main Street businesses, and it doesn't actually end up solving the competition problem.

That Mr. Biden finds himself in this role at all is an unlikely turn of events for a man whose political career seemed to have stalled or ended so many times, including when tragedy struck just after he won his first election to the Senate in 1972. But after 36 years in the chamber and eight years as vice president, he became a familiar figure in the country's political consciousness. When Americans sought a way back to stability after four years of tumult, Mr. Biden felt like a comfort to many voters. As Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, one of Mr. Biden's most important supporters in the primary race, is fond of saying and repeated in an interview on Tuesday: We know Joe and Joe knows us.
But Florida has used only about 30 percent of the vaccine doses it has received, a smaller proportion than 29 other states. How do you do something this huge and roll it out? said Dr. Leslie M. Beitsch, the chairman of the behavioral sciences and social medicine department at Florida State University. It's not in any way surprising — to anyone who followed it closely, for sure — that there would be halting kind of progress and missteps getting something of this magnitude underway initially, whether we're talking about Florida or the entire country. With states and counties left by the federal government to sort out logistics largely by themselves, the rollout has gone anything but smoothly. In Florida, images of seniors camped on sidewalks overnight in Fort Myers and Daytona Beach for first-come, first-served vaccines drew national attention. Health department offices that tried to offer scheduled appointments saw their phone systems and websites crash; at least one now accepts requests only by mail. Each of our 67 counties seems to be taking a slightly different pathway — and that's remarkable, because we have a single department of health that is supposed to cover the entire state, Dr. Beitsch said.

Brilliant, beautiful. Yeah, I'm thinking: To-die-for brilliant. Drop-dead beautiful. And not intimidating--or only as intimidating as the brilliant-beautiful can't help being, no matter how accessible they seem. She had it all and she had it all, and then she had some more. Her dad's a cop. Her considerably older brothers are cops--both with Chicago PD, Area Six. Jennifer was not a cop. She was an astrophysicist, here at Mount Lee. Guys? She combed them out of her hair, and played the field at CSU. But for the last--Christ, I don't know--seven or eight years, it must be, she was shacked up with another bigbrain and dreamboat: Trader.

Personally, I don't really focus on making money. I have more money than I ever thought I would have. It's certainly not what motivates me to work. But I don't want to sound flippant because money is important, and it's great. I have been very, very poor in my life, and it's not as good as being wealthy.
Part of the problem is the United States lacks any truly toothy privacy law. We don't even pretend that we think privacy is something to be protected, and there are no consequences for revealing someone else's personal foibles made into so much data.
But I wonder if this connects to something that you said earlier. You said that you don't see race. And I wonder if you've ever heard pushback on that concept, the idea that it's possible to be colorblind. Because there's a very strong line of thinking that —
The battle for best picture, on the other hand, is just getting started.
No. I'd have to look at the facts at the time that that decision was being made.
I ask myself why using autism the way these books do feels wrong. As a child who was disappointed to find the only Asian characters in any book in the library to be the Japanese-American family in Farewell to Manzanar, I am acutely aware of the importance of feeling represented in literature. And yet, when it comes to autism appearing in literary fiction, I instinctively feel a need to protect my son from these portrayals. He's not an Ojibwe curse, a savant or an alien. Nor is he an emotionless cipher with no inner life.
Jared is particularly interesting because it shows where America has come to, he said, and that America is a much, much more tolerant place than it was.
Elizabeth Knox's THE ABSOLUTE BOOK (Viking, $28) contains multitudes, spanning the geographies of Canada, Britain and New Zealand; the cosmologies of fairies, demons and angels; and the genres of thriller, domestic realism and epic fantasy.
I've been a registered Democrat since the Clinton years; I was an Obama appointee. I had a fund-raiser for John Kerry. It wasn't a great fund-raiser because I was kind of young; it wasn't one of those fancy ones where you generate tens of thousands.
No, because the taser isn't considered unusable after the two shots. The taser also has a method or a way to use it in a drive-stun situation. And what that means is you can actually walk up to a person — like the old stun guns that arc in between and you used to touch people with them — the taser still has that effect. So it's still an active weapon.
Efforts to get to the root of the problem, including seeing a qualified therapist, should be a priority before making the decision to have a secret life.
Mr. Lari, a leading force for historic preservation in Pakistan, died in Karachi, Sindh's capital, on Dec. 5. He was 84. The cause was complications of Covid-19, his family said. His wife, Yasmeen Lari, a prominent architect, contracted Covid-19 in December but recovered.

JI: I actually really quickly want to go back to a question that Binya was asking you. You said, you gave us the example of parents with two kids and you're on food stamps and you're worried about your kids' future. And at the end of that explanation, you said that you are not for curtailing social supports, but isn't your plan such that, that mother, aside from what the kids would get in the future, that mother would have to choose between the food stamps and the actual U.B.I., right? Is that correct?

We need to let our historic allies know that our commitments are good, and that if we want to make a change, we want to do it in a way that's not pulling the rug out from under you but actually consultative. If we want other people to invest more, then we have to try and sit down with them and drive them to do so without questioning our commitment to NATO wholesale. But to me, trying to nickel-and-dime our relationships with our historic allies is not the best way forward. I think it was James Mattis that said that if you invest more in diplomacy, you have to invest less in ammunition, which should be the goal. So we need to make sure our partnerships and alliances are actually strong, stable and secure, and then we can put pressure on Russia and China with more of a global consensus, and maintain the international world order that's benefited us for decades that now is falling apart because Donald Trump is so erratic and unreliable, even with the people we've been allies with for decades.
The real strategic question in the next election is which platform — moderate or progressive — will resonate with the greatest number of voters in the battleground states. It is clear that Bret Stephens prefers the moderate — a candidate focused on infrastructure spending, a carbon tax and modest increases in taxes on the wealthy matched to the promise of a balanced budget.
Mr. Biden proposed a wide range of efforts to help those who have suffered the most under the economic shutdowns, including emergency paid leave to 106 million Americans, regardless of the size of their employer, and extending tax credits to many families to offset up to $8,000 in annual child care costs.
News reports: A Times report detailed how, after Mr. Trump fired James Comey as F.B.I. director, the bureau became so concerned by the president's behavior that they took the aggressive step of opening a counterintelligence inquiry into whether he had been working on behalf of Russia.
He might have continued that run of success but for an ugly incident in December 1967, when he was pulled over by a man who, he later said, was an off-duty Los Angeles police officer and beat him severely.

Once announced, the wall began to divide people (as walls do), stirring up debates about painful historical events that are never far from the surface in Germany. I don't believe in reconstructing a totalitarian system as an experiment, said Sabine Bangert, a politician from the Greens party, who, like many Berliners, felt that the construction of a concrete barrier just meters from where the Berlin Wall once stood was an insult to those whose lives had been torn apart by it.
The donor appears to have been a French programmer with clear right-wing sympathies, Chainalysis found. The technology behind Bitcoin makes it possible to hold and send money in ways that governments are unable to regulate or stop. This has made it popular with rogue governments and terrorist groups, along with many right-wing activists who have been blocked from using traditional payment networks.

The allure of hooking up has not been quashed by the pandemic. A couple in Barcelona. At a time when social norms around physical touch and closeness have been altered, those looking to hook up are having to rewrite the rules. Credit... Nacho Doce/Reuters If you're in a relationship (or haven't been out much since March), it may be news to you that despite a raging pandemic, people are meeting up, cuddling, making out and having sex with new partners, often weighing their emotional and physical needs against safety concerns. Some have gone about their private lives quietly, out of fear that those in their social circles — especially established couples — would judge their choices. Others have been more conspicuous when hooking up. In November, New York sheriffs broke up an 80-person party at a sex club in Queens. That same month, a swingers' convention in New Orleans led to 41 people testing positive for the coronavirus. Going on dates has involved a mental calculus not unlike the kind applied to other social interactions in the Covid-19 era: Will I feel safe? What is the likelihood of infection? How many people could this hurt? But hookups have been viewed with particular scrutiny. Even pre-pandemic, there was a lot of stigma around sexuality and sex in general, said Dr. Oni Blackstock, the former assistant commissioner at the New York City Department of Health's Bureau of H.I.V. With the pandemic, there's another layer of expectations and judgment.

Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, was an unpublished, unemployed single mother in Edinburgh in 1995 when she sent Mr. Little the first three chapters of her first book after finding his name in a directory of literary agents.

Others in the party, led by Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, were pushing back hard against a conviction, warning it would harm the party and the country, as federal authorities cautioned about continued violent threats from pro-Trump extremists. With Mr. McConnell sending mixed signals about where he would come down, Republican strategists and seniors aides on Capitol Hill believed he could ultimately swing the result one way or another. If all senators voted, it would take 17 Republicans joining all Democrats to convict Mr. Trump. If they did, it would only take a vote by a simple majority of senators to disqualify Mr. Trump from ever holding office again.
We need to modernize the court. Lifetime appointments might have made sense at one point a long time ago, but when the Constitution was drafted, people did not live as long. And also, people stepped down from the Supreme Court for any of a range of reasons. They did not wait until they were at death's door. This is not a way to run a 21st-century society.

Accomplishing that in a way that isn't just depressing or infuriating involves turning the profession and the time period into a raucous combination of pageant and farce. Harlots doesn't shy away from doubt, sorrow and the straightforward presentation of appalling exploitation, but it doesn't linger on them — it always moves right along to the next scene of intrigue and competition between brothels, or the next bit of comic business involving the desperate buffoonery of the male customers. All against a backdrop of jolly sex and nudity, mostly by extras.

So the clearest emblem of this is NASA and space travel where we all watched the Apollo 13 movies and we've seen the armies of research scientists helping launch these missions. Now where those research scientists? They're all at Space X and Blue Origin and they're there working for the tech guys who are putting billions into it. It's going to be very, very difficult to somehow reverse essentially decades of talent migration into the private sector. And if you're a talented kid out of Stanford, why would you work for the federal government? It's like if you're working in the private sector, you feel like you're going to go faster, you're certainly going to get paid more. You're going to be working with smarter people and you idolize Elon Musk, like who the heck, you know?

Earlier this year, the Library of America published a volume of McCullers's short stories, plays, essays, memoirs and poems. But it's the author's fiction (also published by the Library of America, among others) that keeps her reputation strong a century on. Her debut, The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, is routinely listed among the best books of the 20th century, and Rose Feld's assessment of it in the Book Review in 1940 proves that its towering reputation was formed more or less immediately.

A senior official at the National Security Council and a former top lawyer to Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Ellis applied months ago to be the National Security Agency's general counsel. He was one of three finalists, although he did not get the highest score from the panel evaluating the candidates, according to people familiar with the hiring process. Nevertheless, White House officials told the Defense Department general counsel that the administration favored Mr. Ellis for the job. Positioning a political appointee in a Civil Service job is a complex procedure requiring various approvals to prevent favoritism in the hiring process. With Mr. Ellis, the Office of Personnel Management eventually determined that the general counsel position was exempt from a policy requiring special approval, though those deliberations slowed the process. Mr. Ellis also had to seek a new security clearance. Although General Nakasone was not pleased that Mr. Ellis was chosen over career officials at the National Security Agency, he did not actively block or slow the process of installing Mr. Ellis in the position, according to two people familiar with the matter. He did however, insist that all procedures were followed and all approvals be put in writing. Frustrated by what they saw as a slow-rolling of Mr. Ellis's installation, the Pentagon ordered the National Security Agency to swear him in, a move The Washington Post reported on Saturday.

Recalling the pants' entrance into pandemic life is difficult because this particular pair of pants — priced at $98, made of an Italian wool trademarked as GoWeave — is supposed to transcend any one season. What this means is that it is not right for any season. They are too hot in summer, too flimsy in the winter, easily soaked by spring showers and … well, they are OK in the fall.

Kamala Harris will resign from her Senate seat on Monday. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris speaking in Wilmington, Del., on Saturday. Credit... Amr Alfiky/The New York Times Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, who remains a United States senator from California, plans to resign from her seat on Monday ahead of her inauguration two days later, a Harris aide said. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, a fellow Democrat, will appoint a successor to Ms. Harris, who was elected in 2016. Mr. Newsom said last month that he intended to tap Alex Padilla, California's secretary of state, for the seat. Mr. Padilla's Senate term will expire in 2022, when he can seek re-election. Ms. Harris continued to attend Senate sessions after her November election, and was in the Capitol for the certification of the election results this month when the building was stormed by a violent mob of Trump supporters. Ms. Harris will be sworn in as vice president on Wednesday by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a ceremony in which the first woman of color to become vice president will take her oath from the first woman of color to sit on the Supreme Court. Ms. Harris chose Justice Sotomayor for the task, according to a Harris aide who was confirming a report by ABC News. The vice president-elect and Justice Sotomayor have a shared background as former prosecutors. And Ms. Harris has called the justice a figure of national inspiration.
THE AFTERMATH (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. Keira Knightley and Alexander Skarsgard play grief-stricken lovers in this wartime romantic drama by the director James Kent (Testament of Youth). Rachael (Knightley) arrives in postwar Hamburg in 1946 to reunite with her husband Lewis (Jason Clarke), a British colonel in charge of rebuilding the city. The couple lost their son during the Blitz, and their marriage has been on thin ice ever since. They settle into a mansion requisitioned from Stephen (Skarsgard), a German widower. Rachael is seething when Lewis offers to share the space with Stephen and his daughter. But soon enough her animosity gives way to desire, and a love triangle unfolds under one roof. The film has been praised for its dazzling visuals, yet critics have said it lacks nuance and emotional depth.

It's obviously much harder. I'm all about trying to maximize the possible. And so, if we don't get a majority — I expect the Democrats will win a slight majority in the Senate. I'm very optimistic that way, but we're going to get done what we can get done with the branch of the government we have control of. And I will say too, I believe that we can get some things done that are traditionally bipartisan, regardless of who has control of the Senate. To me, I cannot believe that we did not get infrastructure done during the first couple of years of the Trump administration. I thought at least he would build some bridges and roads, and I was even willing to accept the Trump name on those bridges and roads if it got some bridges and roads built. I was, At least we're going to get this.
Oh, I think the market will work beautifully toward what it's designed to do. The market is designed for maximal capital efficiency, and it is doing a phenomenal job. That's why you see the returns on capital outstripping the returns on labor at historic levels. The market is not designed to maximize human well-being.
I believe that Jewish life can thrive in the next century, not despite the end of institutional anti-Semitism, the end of Jewish persecution, and the end of Jewish victimization, but because of these positive developments. The ultimate good news may be that the denouement of negative Judaism--Jewish identification based largely on circling the wagons to fend off our enemies--compels us to refocus on a more positive and enduring Jewish identification, which will be more suitable to our current situation and the one we will likely be facing in the twenty-first century, when Jews will have the unconstrained choice whether to remain Jewish or to assimilate. We may be entering a true Jewish golden age, during which we will prove, once and for all, that Jews do not need enemies to survive. To the contrary: We can thrive best in an open society where we freely choose to be Jews because of the positive virtues of our 3,500-year-old civilization.
The Democrats appealed the ruling, expecting to lose because such appeals are considered a challenge to the right of the majority party to run the House. Their motion failed 230 to 204. Two Republicans, Constance A. Morella of Maryland and Peter T. King of Long Island, broke with precedent and crossed party lines to vote with the Democrats.

You can build it around the town library, because a lot of them have this bulletin board that serves as the skeleton of a local paper when the local paper has gone out of business. A lot of these papers would be able to get by if they did not have to generate stock market level returns for hedge fund owners and private equity owners. If you had a cooperative model and it's made a certain amount of money, spent a certain amount of money, ran as a nonprofit, you could restore and sustain local journalism and thousands of communities, but it will not happen without government support. It just won't.
Any American who wants to gamble online on a poker site can do so from any state in the country right now. If it's illegal in your state, you just end up using an offshore betting site, which is shady, has problems, but it's not going to ease your gambling addiction at all. So the question is, do we want Americans, in the vast majority of the country, on offshore betting sites, dealing with shady characters and generating no revenue and still being addicted? Or would we prefer that they do business with American firms, where we do have better regulations, we know they're not getting cheated, we know they're not getting exploited, and you generate tax revenue that you can use to treat gambling addiction.

Pete is unusual in a business full of potty mouths in that he has a Christian background and works clean, which could be interesting. But it's an attribute that the show doesn't so much explore as merely mention from time to time. In truth, the show doesn't explore much of anything; it, like its central character, just meanders along.
Detroit is a city of 680,000 people. Its peak population was 1.7 million. If you look this direction, you can see a thriving neighborhood, and then you turn 90 degrees and you see abandoned buildings as far as the eye can see. If we were adapting, you would see not multidecade low rates of interstate migration, which we have right now. You would not be seeing 80 percent of the country have multidecade low levels of business formation, which we have right now. You would not be seeing historic lows of business formation among young people, which we have right now. You would not see labor force participation at 62.9 percent, a multidecade low which we have right now. You would not see record-high levels of drug overdoses and suicides to the point that America's life expectancy has declined for three years in a row, which we have right now.
Hi, Mr. Champion. Nice to meet you.
I liked that our May-September romance was unconventional. Bucking the norms I had hewed to out of a sense of duty felt as validating as it did challenging.
So you came to success relatively late. You were 43 when Malcolm in the Middle started — I really enjoyed Malcolm in the Middle — 51 when Breaking Bad came out. How is that, coming to the success at your age? You've been in tons of movies and a character actor before that, but how do you look at the trajectory of your career?
It wasn't supposed to be that way. Owusu was raised to feel as if she could live anywhere. I know how my parents believed their love and the birth of their daughters to be a part of something important, she writes, a movement fueled by borderless love. Her father's family lamented his decision to marry a white woman. Any river loses its identity when entering the sea, they said. The marriage failed; Owusu had to struggle to piece together who she was, where she belonged, whom she loved. Was her father's family right?
Now, after two millennia of persecution and victimization, we may well be moving into a new era of Jewish life during which we will not be persecuted or victimized. If this comes to pass, we will need to refocus our attention on defining the positive qualities of Jewish life that ought to make us want to remain Jews without help from our enemies. We must become positively Jewish instead of merely reacting to our enemies.

Yeah, there you go. You have the technology caught up. The screens are phenomenally clear and beautiful. They're much cheaper. And the sound in the scale of it — you're watching from your living room — it's almost the same scale as if you were in the theater.

When you are drawn together and make a pledge with a person, the swirl doesn't end; it's just that you'll ride it together. In the Regime of Covenants, making the right one-time selection is less important than the ongoing action to serve the relationship.
Large house to one-bedroom apartment to studio apartment until you're in a small room that has little else in it but a bed. Home is bed. Home is also your mind, as always, only your mind may not retain much of that long life or even what happened five minutes ago. What has surprised me in all that shrinkage isn't the fact that my mother has again found love — because at 95 she is still pretty, kind and witty — but how she's found the attachments that seem very like marriages. Love, it turns out, comes on the wings of assigned seating.
Negotiations over the weekend appeared to offer little hope of an immediate agreement between Democrats and President Trump over his demands for a border wall. Democratic leaders have repeatedly said they would not agree to any funding for the wall. The White House is also digging in, insisting on $5.7 billion in wall funding, even as some Republicans have started to call for an end to the shutdown. Mr. Trump gave little ground. They don't like concrete, so we'll give them steel, he said.
In the final chapter, I propose a series of steps that I believe we must take in order to safeguard the Jewish future. We must change the nature of American Jewish life in fundamental ways if we are to survive the new threats to our continuity as a people. These changes must make us more adaptive to the reality that we can no longer define ourselves--and our children--by reference to our past victimization and persecution. We must adopt a new, more positive, Jewish identity based on a 3,500-year-old tradition of education, scholarship, learning, creativity, justice, and compassion. But first we must figure out a way to make this diverse library of Jewish knowledge accessible and useful to generations of Jews who are abysmally ignorant of their remarkable tradition. The famed Yiddisher cup (khop)---Jewish head--is only half full: the typical Jewish college graduate is extraordinarily well educated about general subjects, but goes through life with a kindergarten understanding of Judaism. We must begin to fill the Yiddisher cup with the kind of useful Jewish knowledge that will assure both our success and our survival. To do this, we will have to loosen the monopolistic hold that rabbis now have over Jewish education, so that we can begin to compete effectively in the marketplace of ideas for the minds and hearts of our Jewish youth.
BS: Remember The New Yorker cartoon?
And virtually immediately he began to plan the details of the trip--getting financial backing, getting a specially designed plane, mapping the route, seeking to eliminate any chance of failure. Ultimately, he persuaded a group of St. Louis businessmen to put up $15,000, which was one reason why the plane was called the Spirit of St. Louis. After many racking incidents, the Ryan Company, with Lindbergh's help, designed and built a craft tailored for him and the Wright Company built an engine of 223 horsepower to accommodate the plane. For several years after the Paris flight, Lindbergh lived in the glare of publicity and popping camera flashbulbs. The public would not let him alone. I recall steeping out of a building on Wall Street, and having almost everyone on the street turn and follow me, he said. He was regarded as a sort of oracle, and his opinion was solicited on every conceivable subject. He was, moreover, linked falsely in the press with a number of girls. His interest, however, was in Anne Spencer Morrow, the beautiful blue-eyed daughter of Dwight Morrow, then Ambassador to Mexico. The couple met in Mexico City at Christmastime in 1927, when Miss Morrow, then a Smith student, went there for the holidays. They were married in a private ceremony in the Morrow home in New Jersey on May 27, 1929. The marriage was union of opposites. Sensitive, retiring, a poet, Mrs. Lindbergh wanted nothing so much as a life of peace and quiet.
Her mother, who had gotten married at 14 to a stranger twice her age, couldn't understand the fuss. She'd stuck with her husband for five decades until he died, and was appalled that young women these days didn't do the same.

In contrast, California textbooks are more likely to note when a historical figure was an immigrant. And they include more detail on the role immigrants such as Japanese and Filipino farmworkers played in labor movements.
The trial, which took more than two years and attracted news media attention in China as well as Canada, underlined how Vancouver has become a global sanctuary for foreign money moving from Asia to North America. Mr. Yuan was a millionaire who had gamed the Canadian immigration system, building a business and acquiring Canadian real estate worth millions of dollars.
Some Republicans said Mr. McCarthy, the son of an assistant chief with the Bakersfield Fire Department, has done too much for conservative voters in the region for them to abandon him. They believe his delicate navigation of the events in Washington in recent days — speaking out against impeachment but saying the president bears responsibility for the attack on Congress by rioters — would not hurt him significantly in his district as he eyes becoming speaker of the House in two years. Mr. McCarthy, now entering his eighth term in the House, has become a kingmaker of sorts in Kern County, helping his allies climb the political ranks, and enjoys a reservoir of good will among Republicans. But the events of this month in Washington have brought Mr. McCarthy, 55, more criticism than he is accustomed to in his hometown. Manny Fernandez and
CW: Going back though, my question is, there's an issue of power here. I mean, sure. You might not want to. You might not be able to address the problems of Facebook if you break it up from Instagram, and I understand that, and there's still going to be addictive products, but there's an issue of the consolidation of actual power, the ability to buy those companies, to make those acquisitions. Just simply the leverage that Mark Zuckerberg can use to have a meeting with Donald Trump that they won't tell us about, I mean, how do you — if you don't break them up, how do you get rid of that conglomeration of power?
After the class recited the Our Father, the teacher, Sister Paula Jean Miller, got down to business: the topic of the day was the theology of sexuality. Drawing on Pope John Paul II's theology of the body, Miller explained that total self-donation, or self-gift, is the goal for human relationships -- and also a way of explaining why married people should not use contraception. Sexual intercourse is a cause of grace within the sacrament of marriage, Miller said. Just as the Father gives himself totally to the Son and the Son gives himself back totally to the father, that's the standard of love for us. Contraception is a holding back of some very critical aspect of ourselves, of who I am. It's saying to you, I want you but I don't want your fertility, at least not right now. And the goal is total self-gift. (Actually, a majority of Catholic theologians disagree with this position.) Only in the last 30 years has the concept of self-gift come to coexist with procreation in the Catholic Church as the criterion for the moral rightness of a sexual act, according to Richard McCormick, professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame. Self-gift, the seminarians are taught, can be used to explain what is wrong with masturbation (it involves no giving to another), lust (it involves taking rather than giving, thus reducing one's partner to the status of an object) and homosexuality (the other is not other, and thus self-gift is not really possible).

As disappointed as many Virginians might have been in Mr. Northam, several said they were not surprised.
One Monday in 2014, Christopher Justin Hanson sat down for a job interview at the headquarters of Covington & Burling, a law firm in Washington. As the interviewer, who was stationed in front of windows overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue, thumbed through Mr. Hanson's résumé, he noticed that Mr. Hanson didn't have any experience in Washington. Mr. Hanson lived in Wisconsin at the time. Why, the interviewer asked, did Mr. Hanson want to start practicing in Washington?
His family said in a statement that the cause was Covid-19.

The majority of the protagonists in Back Talk, Danielle Lazarin's debut story collection, seemingly heterosexual women and girls, are caught in this very quandary. The stories drift around and over certain characters — an American woman going to college in Paris, the members of a troubled family — some connected in a common fictional universe and others simply echoes of one another, like the characters in Lucia Berlin's short fiction. The younger women are learning, however obliquely, to line themselves up with men, to put themselves in the context of a man's world. The older women are trying to extract themselves from that world and discovering how obscenely difficult this can be.

It appears that what I was missing was Greta Gerwig — along with the real-life story of Alcott, on whose life the book was based, with a few major differences.

As they tried to make a place for themselves in the Catholic Church and a case for this church in the wider intellectual world, the first generation of converts found little Catholic literature in English on which to build. They had to start almost from scratch in trying to show what Catholic science or Catholic history as serious intellectual enterprises would be like. We Catholics have no philosophy, wrote John Acton, an English cradle Catholic, in a letter of 1854 to the American convert writer Orestes Brownson. You alone can prepare us for the great controversies by founding among us a school and arming it with the principles of a sound philosophy. For Brownson and his fellow converts Catholicism was something quite new, but at the same time they were aware that it was far more ancient than its Christian rivals and that they had inherited a vast intellectual patrimony. They set to work, exploring and reinterpreting the Catholic past, trying to recover it from the obloquy of Protestant historiography as well as from the syrup of Catholic hagiography.
Athill lived with the Jamaican playwright Barry Reckord for nearly 40 years, though she was his lover for fewer than 10.

Mr. Yang has frequently said that automation contributed heavily to Mr. Trump's win, because voters feel disaffected and worry that the futures of their jobs and industries are in jeopardy.
A number of Republicans said they did not think a perjury charge in Ms. Jones's civil case warranted impeachment, particularly since Clinton's deposition had been held by a judge to be immaterial. Many of them also looked dimly at impeaching the President for abuse of power -- a term taken from the proceedings against Nixon in 1974 -- simply because his answers to 81 questions from the Judiciary Committee were legalistic and evasive.
Mr. Yang has said most Americans don't want to work for the federal government and argued that his Freedom Dividend would therefore be more effective than a program like a federal jobs guarantee.
This eight-episode series written and directed by Sigal Avin (#ThatsHarassment), shown last summer on the Israeli cable channel HOT, is an ambitious and sometimes absorbing attempt to do something a little different. Avin plays with the conventions of the psychosexual thriller and the backstage drama: Alice (Ayelet Zurer of Munich), a filmmaker who could use a hit, and her actor husband, David (Gal Toren), find themselves collaborating on a darkly erotic script by a young, seductive and possibly sinister writer, Sophie (Lihi Kornowski of False Flag). (A significant character is named Nomy, in what feels as if it must be a shout out to Showgirls.)
For candidates seeking to lead the party into its post-Obama era, their hope is that the base is more concerned with defeating President Trump and Republicans than holding every candidate to rigid standards of ideological purity.
Jaap van Zweden, the music director designate of the New York Philharmonic, built up good will with the orchestra's extended audience on Tuesday evening when he announced the details of his first season, which begins in September. He enthusiastically discussed his plans and programming, including five premieres he will conduct, the introduction of two new-music series tied to themes the season will explore, and much more. It was an auspicious occasion for the Philharmonic.
President Franklin Roosevelt tried to advance a court-packing strategy to ensure favorable rulings on New Deal legislation. He wanted to appoint up to six additional justices, one for every justice older than 70 years. The plan was unpopular in Congress and among the Supreme Court's justices.
The day before she was supposed to meet a date, one of her roommates got a positive coronavirus test result. When she and her four other roommates went to get tested, their results were negative. She told her date what had happened, and he said he wanted her to come over anyway. But when she arrived, he raised some doubts about having sex. Ms. Nguyen told him that whatever he wanted to do was fine, and she would leave if he wanted her to.
As their motion failed, the Democrats briefly marched out of the House chamber in protest. But they returned to vote on the four articles of impeachment.
He was also invited by the German Government to inspect the Luftwaffe and warplane factories in the Reich. He received red-carpet treatment, visited many factories and was told repeatedly that the Nazis were eager to create an air force second to none. He visited Germany several times before 1938 and was increasingly impressed with the quality of the air force. It seemed to him all the more fearsome by comparison with the air arm in Britain, France and the Soviet Union. By 1939 he had concluded that the power of the Luftwaffe was overwhelming, and that the air forces of other European countries were comparatively insignificant. In off-the- record conversations with the leaders of these countries, the Soviet Union excepted, he sought to warn them of the perils they were facing. Neither then nor later did Lindbergh, according to his journals, believe that German air power would be the decisive factor in a war so much as it would be an essential element. And he sought to impress on France, Britain and the United States the need to bestir themselves. Lindbergh and his family returned to the United States in 1939 shortly before World War II broke out. He felt he ought to do all he could to prevent American involvement. Not a pacifist nor an isolationist, he was a noninterventionist.
How can the Senate hold a trial if Trump is out of office? There is no precedent for the Senate holding an impeachment trial after a president has left office, but it has done so for other government officials. Democrats who control the House can choose when to send their article of impeachment to the Senate, at which point that chamber would have to immediately move to begin the trial. But even if the House transmitted the charge to the other side of the Capitol right away, an agreement between Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate would be needed to take it up before Jan. 19, a day before Mr. Biden is inaugurated. Since Mr. McConnell said on Wednesday that he would not agree, the trial cannot start until after Mr. Biden is president. That could clog the Senate floor in the early days of Mr. Biden's administration, at a time when he will be eager to have the chamber confirm members of his cabinet. Would impeaching Trump disqualify him from holding office again? Conviction in an impeachment trial would not automatically disqualify Mr. Trump from future public office. But if the Senate were to convict him, the Constitution allows a subsequent vote to bar an official from holding any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States. That vote would require only a simple majority of senators. There is no precedent, however, for disqualifying a president from future office, and the issue could end up before the Supreme Court.
Most American laborers work in the services sector, according to Pew Research — in July 2019, 107.8 million people worked in private service-providing industries including trade, transportation and utilities.

This interview was conducted by the editorial board of The New York Times, which will announce its Democratic primary endorsement on Jan. 19.
Mr. Yang's argument that he is pulling 10 percent or more of Trump supporters was not rated favorably on PolitiFact — the 10 percent figure comes from a July YouGov poll, and subsequent polls found the number to be lower.

Does Dante count as one of Rauschenberg's collaborators? Probably more than Charles Atlas, a video artist prized for his work with choreographers. Now 68, Mr. Atlas is still lanky and boyish, with sideburns that are dyed psychedelic orange. Someone had the good idea to hire me, he said with a chuckle when we met recently at MoMA. It's the first time they have hired an artist to do anything like this. Mr. Atlas is designing the video portion of the show, including a nine-channel installation to commemorate 9 Evenings, a series of quixotic performances that Rauschenberg spearheaded in 1966 with his engineer-friend Billy Kluver, in the hope of forming a brave new alliance between art and technology.

That distinction has made Jersey a popular tax haven, but its financial laws have not always kept up with the times: Under its current tax law, introduced in 1928, only the husband in a heterosexual marriage can pay taxes, with his wife's earnings considered part of his income. She has needed his permission to be treated separately or even to discuss her financial affairs with the tax office.
Jane Yunhee Junn, a professor of political science at the University of Southern California, was outspoken in her view:
Throughout Billions, we've witnessed Bobby Axelrod, a fearsome hedge-fund billionaire, trying to leverage his way into New York's powerful elite, but to only limited success. Nothing makes him happier than bullying an old-money family off their turf, as he did when he snapped up the naming rights to a performing arts building in the first season. But more often, that same aggression and lust for power and credibility makes him seem gauche, a nouveau riche sleaze who may know how to work the angles on Wall Street, but who doesn't speak the language of high society. For all his diabolical brilliance, he often comes across as a Beverly Hillbilly in designer slacks.

I started and ran a national nonprofit called Venture for America that recruited enterprising college graduates to help grow businesses in Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, New Orleans, Birmingham, Baltimore, and nine other American cities. We helped create several thousand jobs. I'm very, very proud of that. But I realize that the jobs we were creating were only going to apply for a small slice of the population. And these jobs were pouring water into a bathtub that has a giant hole ripped in the bottom. I'm running for president to let America know that it is not our imagination, the water is rushing out of the bathtub. Immigrants have nothing to do with it. It's the fact that we're going through the greatest economic transformation.
I think it's actually unfortunate that I get asked about those sorts of questions, in the sense that I feel like men should leave the room and let women decide what to do with your bodies. I have a feeling I know what you would decide, and then we could come back and say, Hey, what did you decide? I also think that if men got pregnant, this would be a very, very different conversation. And we'd have a completely different approach to these issues. So, I don't have a short list of Supreme Court justice appointees, but safeguarding women's reproductive rights and having an evolving sense of the law would be very important.
Each day on average, about another 295,000 people around the world gained access to electricity for the first time, according to Max Roser of Oxford University and his Our World in Data website.

Iran and its populations have thousands of years of history in the region. That doesn't get rooted out with assassinations and missile strikes. These relationships — among Revolutionary Guards cadres and between the guards and their allies abroad — are deep, and they do not rely on one figure. In fact, Iran has already named General Suleimani's longtime deputy, Ismail Qaani, as his successor.

All this may seem an awfully low priority when the to-do list is a mile long and the wedding planner needs an answer now. But in married life, a sense of emotional emergency almost always means it's time to slow down. Emotions are often inconvenient.
Time passed. She sold her house, she moved to a retirement community. This is the shrinkage that takes place in the modern story of the very long life: First comes love, then marriage, the baby in the carriage, and after decades, the retirement joint with craft classes, edifying programs, exercise routines, followed by the broken hip, assisted living, and finally, the dementia unit, the lockup.
I was devastated! Ms. Collins said from the couch in her suite. She had a show later that night in the hotel. You live through the ups and downs of your personal life, and you have these favorite things in your life and then poof — they disappear.
Nor is the answer easy to detect in her personality. It was not a caring instinct that drove her — I have no turn for benevolencies, she wrote to her brother Henry in 1855 — or a curious one, to advance medical science beyond leeches, mercury and prayer. And while she was roused by the Transcendentalist Margaret Fuller's exhortation to let them be sea-captains, if you will, she was no feminist foremother: She did not believe in suffrage and rejected the fellowship of the burgeoning women's movement. She denounced women as petty, trifling, priest-ridden, gossiping, stupid, inane, and desperately in need of leadership from a superior being like herself. More than anything, Elizabeth Blackwell became a doctor to show the world that she alone could do it.
On this line, Burnham did something dramatic: He shrank the frame even more, moving in on Rock like a microscope, so close to him that it obscured part of his head. It's an aggressive move, and one that both underlines the question of what is wrong with men and broadens it, giving this personal story a new weight, especially since it came out just months after the Harvey Weinstein exposé and inevitably evokes the #MeToo movement.
The Custom of the Country (1913), by Edith Wharton, is about many things: the terrifying ambition of its protagonist, Undine Spragg; marriage; divorce; New York and Paris society — but also the arrival of new American money into those fashionable circles, the ranks of which have always been carefully guarded. Undine, who is originally from the fictional Midwestern town of Apex City, and who marries into the old-world Marvell family, is the perfect embodiment of such aspirational consumerism. And Wharton, who was born into a prominent New York family and was the beneficiary of not one but three legacy inheritances over the course of her life, was in a unique position to observe this monied world and conjure a version of it on the page. (The exact amount Wharton received was and still is a point of contention, on account of antiquated wills that put her trusts in the hands of her brothers, but still, the sum was substantial. A legacy left by her father of $20,000 in the early 1880s amounts to half a million dollars today; $120,000 from a cousin would now be $3.4 million, and a $90,000 gift from her mother is equivalent to an additional $2.7 million upon whose interest and annuities she could draw.) In her novel, Wharton describes in meticulous detail myriad gowns and pieces of jewelry, various properties, priceless artworks and much more.

Being gay and an emblem of progress hasn't given Buttigieg any special traction with younger Democrats, who respond much less favorably to him than older Democrats do. It hasn't established any solidarity with other minorities, though he reached for such a connection when stating a commitment to racial justice during the Democrats' November debate.
What was the attitude you started out with when you looked out into the crowd?
It led, among other things, to his being called a Fascist sympathizer, particularly when he declined a suggestion in 1942 to repudiate it; and the medal plagued his reputation for the rest of his life. He disdained the criticism, however, saying: Personally, I am not at all concerned about any damage that may have been done to my reputation by the presentation of the medal. I felt the throwing back of the medal was like taking part in a child's spitting contest. If I must fight, I'll fight; but I prefer not to spit at my enemy beforehand. Also, I felt Goering had given me the medal with good intent and in friendship. Regardless of how much I disagreed with him about other things, or later on, I did not want to throw it back in his face. Nonetheless, Lindbergh, in his later years, was defensive in reciting the medal episode and sensitive in having it known that his wife was among his critics. Like most people, Lindbergh was a bundle of unresolved contradictions. Stubborn, proud, unable to see how Jews might be offended by obvious facts, blind to the villainies of Hitlerism, he was, in his relationships with his few close friends, a considerate, delightful, sensitive, helpful, unpretentious person who did not obtrude his social and political views, nor make agreeing with them a condition of steadfast friendship. Although he was the object of much flattery and one who succumbed to some of it, he did not like a fuss made over him.
She has certainly furnished the play with all the original equipment. For starters, there's the zingy premise: Over dinner one night, Nancy, a retired librarian approaching 80, turns to Bill, her husband of 50 years, and calmly announces that she wants a divorce. All right, he answers, continuing to eat as the audience roars.
In the late 1980s, she attempted a comeback with Senator Joe, a pop opera about Joseph McCarthy. (Mr. Cohn had been his right-hand man in pursuing suspected Communists in government.) But the show never opened, partly because of financial problems.

Historically, therefore, there has been some descriptive truth to this pendulum view of persecution alternating with assimilation. Jews have retained their Jewish identity, at least in part, because of tsuris. Our enemies herded us into ghettos, created pales of settlement, discriminated against us, excluded us from certain livelihoods while pressing us into others. We stuck together and remained Jews, resisting as best we could the persecution by our enemies.
Season 3, Episode 4: 'The Hour and the Day'
In American Men in Paris I Did Not Love, the story's very structure is defined by its male characters. The narrator has forgotten how to be around other women and instead moves through a series of relationships — some sexual, some not — in which she is almost comically uninvested. These men are insufferable: They smirk, they lecture, they play jokes they think are funny, they push boundaries. They use her, to paraphrase Virginia Woolf, as a mirror, enjoying the way she distorts their reflection in pleasant ways. She silently judges them, she dodges their moves. But only rarely does a radical impulse rise up: And for once I don't care whether the professor likes me, if I'm pleasant or easy to teach, whether my work is any good. But the impulse quickly fades. I am not beautiful, but I am pretty enough, she remarks. That year, and for years after, I hold on to the pretty parts, to the appearance of being open. If only I had allowed myself to look mean in those photos.
There is a strikingly different approach to the debate over masculinity in a different branch of academic inquiry. As David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., wrote in response to my query:

That's a fun exercise, too. I haven't gotten into the judicial appointment shortlist yet, but safeguarding women's reproductive rights would be one clear criteria. Because women's reproductive rights are fundamental human rights in my mind.
Moments before the impeachment votes, Democrats tried to bring to the floor their own proposal to censure Clinton. But after some debate, their motion was held to be not germane to impeachment and ruled out of order by Representative Ray LaHood, an Illinois Republican whom Speaker Gingrich named to preside over the impeachment proceedings.
archived recording (paul howard) We've charged it based upon the facts. And I'm hoping that the people in this country will get away from the little criticisms and understand the broad picture. This is a 27-year-old man who's dead. He didn't have to die. These shootings are continuing to happen all over our country. And I think what those protesters and all over the country, they're not demonstrating because they thought Paul Howard did something political. They're demonstrating because citizens in our country continue to die, and a high number of those citizens are African Americans.
Obviously, the trend of allowing the outside to see the inside is not a new one — gossip and its tabloid incarnations, as well as tell-alls and all the shabby circuses like it, were skulking around well before the digital age ever dawned. But the trend has accelerated in the last few years, as means of communication have mutated and proliferated. It's too easy now to forget that at least some of our utterances are not meant for public consumption.
In a vacuum, you're 100 percent correct. But it's failing to account for the fact that we're taking that money, and then some, and putting it directly into the hands of the American consumer.
Well, in this case, what's interesting is it's up to the employer, and it was NBC and Saturday Night Live. Even as I made the statement saying I didn't think he should be fired, I thought he probably would be fired. Because if you're NBC and SNL, you look up and say, what is my upside for keeping this guy? He's not exactly a huge moneymaker, he hasn't worked a day on the set. Like, that's not a really powerful set of incentives. And so I thought they probably would fire him. I'd suggest that the extent there are consequences for people's misstatements, they should be somewhere commensurate to the level of power and influence they have and the harm that they're doing. In Shane Gillis's case, he was a comedian. I'd never heard of the guy before.

In our conflict-averse culture we don't necessarily think of these skills as part of romance. But I've seen how the best marriages involve people who can deal with strong negative emotions — and who are cleareyed about how hard it can be. They don't avoid anger, but they don't indulge it. They tackle hard issues without shutting down. They apologize for their own bad behavior.
Since my husband's arrival, I had been bumping up against the uncomfortable understanding that the way I wanted to live as a woman in my 50s was starkly different from how he thought life in his late 20s should look. My middle-aged friends bored him. My insistence on living in a clean and orderly house was, to him, senseless. And the hours he lost to Facebook, to watching European football, seemed pointless to me.
In the press materials for Killing Eve, Ms. Waller-Bridge talks about her desire to subvert the spy-action-thriller genre, and the show is described (in publicist-speak) as the thunder of empowered women working in front of and behind the camera. And it's certainly true that scenes and characterizations play out differently than we're used to. When Eve, freaked out by all the killing, impulsively shatters a bus-stop partition, the mood instantly shifts to comic as she frantically paws at the shards of glass in her hair. A traitor's I had to do it for my family speech sounds pathetic coming from a feckless, overbearing male agent.
This time she was sentenced to nine to 18 years. When she was released in June 2010, she was in her 80s.
My mother and father both worked outside the home, but like many women of their generation, my mother was in charge of keeping the home and caring for the children on top of her paying job. When my boyfriend and I moved in together, I made sure not to take over the housekeeping. We both cooked and cleaned and knew how to operate the washing machine. Home maintenance was either a joint effort or jointly neglected.
I feel like you want something from me, remarks Kate (Cara Seymour), welcoming yet wary. At 50, Kate is no longer an actor and is facing financial and other crises of her own. As is Isaac (John Ortiz), a playwright and the third member of their former theater group. With a teetering marriage and vague future, the gentle Isaac could have seemed a mere go-between for his two circling friends; but Mr. Ortiz is so quietly compelling that he makes Isaac's modest ambitions feel improbably consequential.
Several more Capitol rioters have been arrested including man who carried a Confederate flag inside building. Kevin Seefried has been identified as having carried a Confederate flag into the Capitol during the siege last week. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times A man seen holding a Confederate battle flag, a person identified as striking a police officer with a flagpole and a retired firefighter identified as having thrown a fire extinguisher at officers were among those arrested Thursday for their role in the riot at the U.S. Capitol last week. A federal prosecutor in Texas also said on Thursday that a retired Air Force officer who stormed the Senate chamber dressed in military-style clothing and holding zip ties had intended to take hostages. The retired officer, Larry Rendell Brock, was arrested in Texas on Sunday on one count of unlawfully entering a restricted building and another of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, the Justice Department said at the time. He means to take hostages, the Texas prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Weimer, said on Thursday, The Associated Press reported. He means to kidnap, restrain, perhaps try, perhaps execute members of the U.S. government. The Justice Department has said that images from the Capitol siege appeared to show Mr. Brock wearing a green helmet, a tactical vest, a camouflage jacket and trousers holding zip ties that are used by law enforcement officers to restrain and/or detain subjects.

The SAT was first administered in 1926 and evolved out of a test used for admission to Princeton University and Cooper Union. It was inspired by military experiments with I.Q. testing.
In Wuhan, residents savor ordinary pleasures that a year ago became forbidden hazards, like strolling along the historic Jianghan shopping street. Office workers jostle for seats on the subway, which was shut throughout the lockdown. Riverside restaurants, karaoke bars and music clubs are a hubbub of conversation and song that was unthinkable last year, and remains unthinkable for much of the world still in the grips of the pandemic.
In 1975 she founded the influential literary journal Bananas, which published new work by Mr. Ballard, Beryl Bainbridge, Angela Carter and the science-fiction writer Michael Moorcock. She served as editor for three years.
The book, which will be published at the end of January, describes a nest of back-stabbing and duplicity within the West Wing, a narrative by now familiar from other books and news media reports. But Mr. Sims, who left last year after clashing with Mr. Kelly, is one of the few people to attach his name to descriptions of goings-on at the White House that are not always flattering to Mr. Trump, and many of the scenes are not particularly flattering to anyone, including himself.
This year was meant to be something of a Kurt Weill festival in Berlin, the city that shaped — and was shaped by — his partnership with Bertolt Brecht. There were going to be new productions of The Threepenny Opera and Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, as well as performances by the Berlin Philharmonic. Little of those plans remains, but the Philharmonic musicians are able to gather, without live audiences, for the online festival The Golden Twenties — which opens with Weill's First Symphony (1921), an unruly early work that reflects both the spongy mind of a precocious student and the gift for orchestration and scale that would come to define his Berlin-era sound. There's more Weill throughout the month: the Violin Concerto and Second Symphony (Feb. 16); a Mahagonny suite (Feb. 20); and Little Threepenny Music (Feb. 23) in a concert that also includes, fittingly, Berlin Lit Up.

Gov. Gavin Newsom of California on Thursday authorized the deployment of 1,000 National Guard troops and surrounded the state Capitol grounds in Sacramento with a six-foot, covered chain-link fence to prepare for and respond to credible threats.
Adrien Proust was originally intended for the priesthood and he brought a nearly religious zeal to his work as a doctor. It was he who made famous--and effective--the idea of a cordon sanitaire, a sanitary zone circling Europe in order to keep out cholera. In order to put his principles to work Dr. Proust traveled to Russia, Turkey, and Persia in 1869 and figured out the routes by which cholera in previous epidemics had entered Russia and thereby Europe. For this successful investigation and the resulting efficacious sanitation and quarantine campaign Dr. Proust was awarded the Legion of Honor. He became one of the most celebrated professors of medicine and practicing physicians of his day. Whereas Marcel would be willowy, artistic, asthmatic, and obsessed with titled ladies, his father was the very model of the solid upper-middle-class citizen, fleshy, bearded, solemn, and, thanks to his wife's fortune, rich. He was also, unbeknownst to his son, an inveterate ladies' man. His extramarital adventures were never noticed by Marcel's mother--or if she did know something about them, she was too discreet to mention it.
By this time last year, Oscar's top race had become a head-to-head matchup between Green Book and Roma, but 2020 has brought us the most wide-open best-picture contest in ages: As many as five nominees (out of a field of nine announced Monday) all have a very real path to victory. Below, your Carpetbagger surveys Oscar's most crowded field, but be forewarned: This contest is going to go down to the wire.
Sharing a common language and literary heritage, the British and American Catholic converts followed each other's progress closely. In both countries Catholics were a numerical minority, more or less resented by the Protestant majority and sometimes victimized by anti-Catholic uprisings, anti-Catholic political organizations such as the Know-Nothings, and a general cultural antipathy to all aspects of popery. Because Catholicism was a minority religion in the English-speaking nations, its adherents tended to cleave to one another and to respect their clergy. Anticlericalism, a fact of life in Italy, France, and Mexico, was very rare in Britain and America, although English-speaking Catholics had good reason to think that the Catholic hierarchy in Rome did not understand the situation in their nations. They sometimes found it vexing to act upon Vatican directives that had no relevance to their situation. Convert intellectuals responded to their shared problems by encouraging and aiding one another. A regular traffic developed as they crossed and recrossed the Atlantic to confer, teach, and spread the word in each other's nations.
Yeah, that's it. What would you do if you felt that your child was under mortal threat? Would you voluntarily become a criminal?
She prays that Mary-Beth will become a nun too, though she admitted that the possibility seemed remote for her lively, sociable daughter, who is chairman of her prom committee. He seldom knocks us off a horse like he did Paul, Aileen reflected. If we're always listening to rock music or doing homework and busy with worldly things, you seldom get to hear our Lord. Enough, said Mary-Beth. Brian Bashista's upbringing was not intensely religious, and he and his older brother, John, now married and a father, attended public schools. My mom and dad were not always so strong in their faith, Bashista explained. John and I were never altar boys. When he was in junior high school, his mother plunged more deeply into Catholicism and pressed her son Brian to do the same. In her fervor, it wasn't necessarily an invitation, he said. It was: 'You need to do this. It will help you.' John and I were teen-agers, and we both resisted. 'Say the family rosary, Mom, are you kidding? I'm going out with friends.' These memories may partly explain Bashista's scrupulous effort never to sound overbearing or judgmental. Propose, not impose, is a phrase he often repeats. Lead them to the truth, don't slam them with it. That's not the way Jesus did it. Bashista is more judgmental when describing his own life before he entered the seminary. Our Lord gave me everything I ever wanted, he recalled.
He sometimes sounded pompous in print, but he was not in person. Indeed, he was a man of genuinely simple tastes who was happier in a sleeping bag than in a luxury hotel, who preferred eating wild boar with his fingers in the jungle to dining in expensive restaurants, who found more inner satisfaction with primitive than with sophisticated people and who was more at ease in knockabout attire than in street dress. Lindbergh's life, like his personality, was full of shadows and enigmas. Born Feb. 4, 1902, in Detroit, he was the son of C. A. Lindbergh, a prosperous Little Falls, Minn., lawyer and land speculator, and his second wife, Evangeline Lodge Land. The elder Lindbergh's first wife had died, leaving him two daughters. Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr. was born in Detroit because his mother's uncle was a physician there. He was returned to Little Falls six weeks later and lived in that small town, the center of a farming and timbering community, with few interruptions until he was 18. His paternal antecedents were Swedes, who changed their name from Mansons to Lindbergh when they emigrated from Sweden in 1860. They had a history of independence and vigor. The Lands, of Irish and English background, arrived in the United States shortly after 1812. Lindbergh's maternal grandfather was C. H. Land, a dentist and inventor. Both Dr. Land and C. A. Lindbergh were strong advocates of free inquiry and individual initiative, and both impressed on young Charles the merits of personal independence.
The royal palace offered no explanation for why the king, Sultan Muhammad V of Kelantan, stepped down after serving only two years of a five-year term.

Indeed, the movie's most authentically romantic moment occurs not between Clara and her suitors, but between her sister and brother-in-law (Tiaré Scanda and K. C.

Particularly because I think we've become unduly vindictive and punitive toward statements that people find objectionable. A friend of mine said something, he said, If the online universe descends on someone, and they lose their job, the online universe moves on a week later, but that person still does not have a job a week later. That the impact on the individual lasts much, much longer than the rancor. So I shared this.

Well, I think it really begins with a fairy tale.
Jews have faced dangers in the past, but this time we may be unprepared to confront the newest threat to our survival as a people, because its principal cause is our own success as individuals. Our long history of victimization has prepared us to defend against those who would destroy us out of hatred; indeed, our history has forged a Jewish identity far too dependent on persecution and victimization by our enemies. But today's most serious threats come not from those who would persecute us, but from those who would, without any malice, kill us with kindness--by assimilating us, marrying us, and merging with us out of respect, admiration, and even love. The continuity of the most influential Jewish community in history is at imminent risk, unless we do something dramatic now to confront the quickly changing dangers.
As of today--April second--I consider the case Solved. It's closed. It's made. It's down. But yet the solution only points toward further complexity. I have taken a good firm knot and reduced it to a mess of loose ends. This evening I meet with Paulie No. I will ask him two questions. He will give me two answers. And then it's a wrap. This case is the worst case. I wonder: Is it just me? But I know I'm right. It's all true. It's the case. It's the case. Paulie No, as we say, is a state cutter. He cuts for the state. He dissects people's bodies and tells you how come they died.
So this is not a left or a right idea, this is bipartisan. And many Republicans will see that this is going to be a huge win for their constituents, for rural areas, for red states on the interior. We don't need 80 percent of Congress to pass it, we just need a majority.

No, let me just get through this, because I think it's important. That concept, it may be very well-intentioned — I don't see race. But the thinking is that it's actually dangerous, because if a person says, I don't see race, then what you may actually be saying is that you don't see Black people as different from white people, or as treated differently. And then, therefore, you don't see racism. And it means that no measures will be put in place to acknowledge that the reality of being a Black person is different than the lived reality of being a white person, right? So the point being, it's actually important to see race. It's important to see race in order to change policing. I mean, what do you think of that?

Thomas recounts the major moments in an undeniably eventful life. He supported the black power movement in the '60s and '70s and voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980; his conservative turn, he says, was the inevitable reaction to liberal hypocrisy. Clips of Anita Hill testifying at Thomas's confirmation hearings in 1991 appear in the second half of the film, after the filmmakers have taken care not to disturb their admiring portrait of Thomas as a faithful Christian and doting family man. Hill's recollections of sexual harassment get predictably cast as part of a feminist smear campaign designed to destroy him.
The two-part, 20-episode first season of the animated fantasy spoof Disenchantment introduced the story of an unconventional princess nicknamed Bean (voiced by Abbi Jacobson), who'd rather have rowdy drunken adventures than marry some drippy prince. As the second two-part season begins, Bean's wild wanderings around the kingdom have caused major problems for her family, provoking a crisis. The show's creative team (led by The Simpsons and Futurama creator Matt Groening) clearly have fun riffing on the trappings of sword-and-sorcery sagas; but all the while they've been making a pretty good one of their own, with a story that gets more involving with each new batch of episodes.

Everybody knows that the easiest way to boost the sales of a book is to put a particular familiar word in its title. That word, of course, is Constitution. Geoffrey R. Stone is a professor and former dean at the University of Chicago, and his title is a bit of a tease. There is virtually nothing about the Constitution in this book until Page 263, and even then, it is only to say, Don't get too excited yet. Until the 1950s, Stone reports, the Supreme Court had little to say about the possible relevance of the Constitution to laws dealing with such issues as obscenity, contraception, abortion and homosexuality. Stone concedes, though he might not regard it as a concession, that the general assumption was that government could legitimately — and constitutionally — forbid behavior that the majority deemed immoral.

Higashida's mother created a special alphabet grid that eventually allowed her son to communicate by pointing. While still a teenager, he wrote The Reason I Jump, describing what it feels like to have autism.
Years later, she wrote, when a mutual friend gave Williams a copy of the manuscript for 'Where Are the Children?,' which had just sold to Simon & Schuster, his comment was, 'I have a lot of friends who can write better than that,' so I guess I didn't fascinate him either. We'll call it a draw.'
Rock's extended version remains tougher-minded but moves closer to this posture. He removes the extreme close-up, which, along with its role in drawing attention to the material, is something of a signature Burnham shot. He used it at the start of his direction of Jerrod Carmichael's game-changing special 8 — whose filmic aesthetic inspired Rock to hire him. In place of that touch, Rock adds a new shot, a mouse-eye view of the star from the front of the stage partly obscured by what appears to be a member of the audience. This new angle looks up at a performer, in awe.
Some say you can't top the adrenaline (and the dirty cash) of Narcotics, and all agree that Kidnapping is a million laughs (if murder in America is largely black on black, then kidnapping is largely gang on gang), and Sex Offenses has its followers, and Vice has its votaries, and Intelligence means what it says (Intelligence runs deep, and brings in the deep-sea malefactors), but everyone is quietly aware that Homicide is the daddy. Homicide is the Show.
KK: Have you spoken to Republican lawmakers about the Freedom Dividend?
Well, thank you for saying so. Yeah, in 2019 dollars it must be at least $6,000. I've been a Democrat for years and years, and if you look at my alignment on the vast majority of issues, they're lock step with the Democratic Party. So it was very natural for me to run as a Democrat. I've ruled out completely any third-party bid because that would in my mind increase the chances of Donald Trump winning, and the mission is to defeat Donald Trump and help move the country forward.
A picture caption with an article on Saturday about the United Methodist Church's plan to split over same-sex marriage misstated the location of two churches shown in a collection of images. The church in the top-right image is in Winona, Minn., not Homer, Ark.; the church in the bottom right photo is in Highland Falls, N.Y., not High Falls, N.Y. The caption also referred incorrectly to the United Methodist Church. It is the second-largest Protestant denomination in the United States, not in the world.

We can create an analogous situation for data and technology and then use that to try and curb some of their worst abuses and behaviors. Now, is this going to happen in time to help Hong Kong?

Gary Gensler has been tapped to head the S.E.C. under Biden. Gary Gensler in 2018 at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, where he teaches financial technology. Credit... Kayana Szymczak for The New York Times The Biden administration is tapping two financial regulators from the Obama administration to oversee key departments that had loosened their grip of the industry under President Trump, according to two people with knowledge of the plans. Gary Gensler, who led the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the Obama administration from 2009 to 2014, will be President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s nominee to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, these people said. Also, Rohit Chopra, the former assistant director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has been chosen to run that agency. Mr. Gensler is a veteran regulator who played a central role in bringing the big banks to heel in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, giving new teeth to a watchdog agency. Lately, as an academic, he has been schooling himself on digital currencies like Bitcoin that have become an important part of the S.E.C. 's regulatory mandate. Mr. Gensler, 63, will step into an agency that has faced criticism as being too lenient in pursuing high-profile cases involving Wall Street and corporate America. The agency that Mr. Chopra will take over has been defanged under Mr. Trump.

Oh, I think the market will work beautifully toward what it's designed to do. The market is designed for maximal capital efficiency, and it is doing a phenomenal job. That's why you see the returns on capital outstripping the returns on labor at historic levels. The market is not designed to maximize human well-being.
I mean, as of right now, no. He's too much in the public eye. Every single talk show host does an impersonation of him. He is ubiquitous to the point of overkill, and that's not good for an actor to take on a character that's so indelible. I was once offered to do the Scarecrow, a play version of The Wizard of Oz. And I thought, oh my gosh, that'll be exciting. How fun will that be? Until I thought about it and realized, wait a second, that character is so specific and indelible in the minds of everyone who's ever watched Wizard of Oz. If I didn't do an impersonation of Ray Bolger doing the Scarecrow, I'd be booed because people would go, oh, that's not the Scarecrow. So it didn't leave any room for the actor to carve out my impression or my sensibility of where the Scarecrow could be. You had to stand in line and march exactly to the drumbeat of what that movie role did. So then I realized, oh, no, that's a trap. I don't want to do that role. And I think the same thing is right now for Trump until 10 years from now. If you ask me that five to 10 years from now, hopefully when he's no longer in the public eye —

People say, write what you know, but it's really, write about what obsesses you, she said. Write about what you're thinking about all the time.
It's just trial and error, she said in a short biographical film made in 2011 for the Cleveland Arts Prize, which she won in 1993. She added, I don't have anything in my head that I want them to say, but it's entirely what happens when they get together that makes the story, so the story is brand new to me.
If you have term limits, it is bipartisan. Because ——
The 21st-century framework. First, you don't use price as your primary determinant of whether or not there are antitrust problems, because the tech companies would say, What? We would never gouge anyone. It's free. We're underselling everyone. So that you have to get rid of, and that's not something she's advocating, but what she is advocating, which I find to be a bit backward looking, is thinking that competition is the answer in these spaces. And competition misses the point in one way and another way.
¿Quieres quedarte con tu burbuja pandémica?
What do you mean? I know you came out right away and you said that firing Officer Rolfe was rushed. Do you still feel that way after reading the charges, after watching the news conference from the district attorney, the videos — all the information that has come out?
In 1849, when Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman doctor in America, the medical profession was neither well established nor well respected nor well paid. Germ theory was more than a decade away, and in hospitals for the poor, surgeons in blood-caked aprons went from handling corpses to delivering babies without washing their hands. In wealthy homes, physicians coasted on charisma and connections as much as skill. At all levels of society, doctors had little more to rely on than purgatives, laudanum and lancets. What kind of woman would fight to join their ranks?
The majority of the protagonists in Back Talk, Danielle Lazarin's debut story collection, seemingly heterosexual women and girls, are caught in this very quandary. The stories drift around and over certain characters — an American woman going to college in Paris, the members of a troubled family — some connected in a common fictional universe and others simply echoes of one another, like the characters in Lucia Berlin's short fiction. The younger women are learning, however obliquely, to line themselves up with men, to put themselves in the context of a man's world. The older women are trying to extract themselves from that world and discovering how obscenely difficult this can be.
But Mr. Trump, and much of the political class that was shocked and disoriented by his 2016 win, has sometimes conflated his reputational resilience with a notion that nothing he says can hurt him, no matter how ostensibly damaging.
Starting in 1979, productivity and pay sharply diverged — productivity rose nearly 70 percent, while typical hourly pay essentially stagnated, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
But it's the lying, or deception, or really just the uncertainty about other people that dominates the rest of this collection. A woman desperate for marriage spends a weekend with a guy she used to date who hasn't always been particularly nice to her. She doesn't know that he's tying up loose ends before killing himself, and afterward she has to deal with the puzzle of his intentions. Even years of shared life fail to produce real intimacy. Parents are just as untrustworthy as lovers. In Owl Eyes, a geeky kid at a math camp runs into a professor who tells him a story about how he used to be involved with the boy's mother — that he used to be a father to the boy himself. Vague memories come back to the boy, but it's hard to tell if they offer doubt or hope.
He got the job. Four years later, the location change paid off handsomely.
Re President Repeats Threat to Target Cultural Sites (news article, Jan. 6):
Here are the highlights of Biden's $1.9 trillion 'American Rescue Plan.' Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:34 - 0:00 transcript Biden Outlines $1.9 Trillion Economic Rescue Package President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday proposed a spending package to combat the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. The plan includes $1,400 direct payments to individuals and more generous unemployment benefits. During this pandemic, millions of Americans, through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck. Millions of Americans never thought they'd be out of work — many of them never even envisioned the idea — are facing eviction, waiting for hours in their cars to feed their families as they drive up to a food bank. A growing chorus of top economists agree that the moment of crisis — in this moment of crisis, with interest rates at historic lows, we cannot afford inaction. Our rescue plan also includes immediate relief to Americans hardest hit and most in need. We will finish the job of getting a total of $2,000 in cash relief to people who need it the most. The $600 already appropriated is simply not enough. One in seven households in America, more than one in five Black and Latino households in America, report they don't have enough food to eat. So we're going to extend emergency nutritional assistance for 30 — for 43 million children and their families enrolled in the SNAP program through the rest of this year.
By the 1950s some converts had persuaded themselves that their highbrow evangelizing effort was gaining ever more ground and that a demoralized secularist enemy was on the verge of capitulation, ready to throw itself into the arms of the pope. Not for the first time they were indulging in wishful thinking. Even as they made their hopeful prophecies, the long Catholic rear guard against modernity began to collapse from within. Catholic academics, priests and laity alike, began to question the adequacy of a scholastic and natural law approach to all issues. The church reformed itself at the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), abandoning its intransigence toward the outside world and looking with a new sympathy both on the Catholic innovations of recent decades and on the non-Catholic branches of Christianity. It belatedly opened itself to scientific and philosophical systems that for a century it had repudiated, and at the same time it surrendered some of the characteristics that had made its outlook distinctive. By the 1970s many of the special qualities of Catholic scholarship were disappearing, or else were confined to the angry handful of traditionalists who refused to forsake the ways of a lifetime. Ironically some of the intransigents were intellectuals who had converted to get away from modernism in its many guises, only to find that their church too was now negotiating with modernist teachings on all sides. It only compounded the irony that converts had done much to pave the way for these changes.

Donald Trump tapped into that. He did tap into that. Some people felt it was the right thing to do, to say, and they followed him by the millions, as we find out. However, when you look at it and assess it — and I think history will be accurate in this — they will realize that there was emptiness to Donald Trump's words. There was impulse to it but not strategy. There was hyperbole without wisdom. And I think that's what will be his legacy. Whereas Howard Beale spewed emotional frustration and intellectual thought and then let the chips fall where they may, and I think that's the difference.
Progressive government by definition must be functional, the governor said, returning to a common theme and citing his father, the former governor, Mario M. Cuomo.
For a couple who typically spend about 300 days on the road a year, it has been an adjustment.
Generally speaking, I think we have become overly aggressive and optimistic about what we can accomplish in various foreign theaters. I've signed a pledge to end the forever wars because I don't believe it's the will of the American people for us to be in a constant state of armed conflict in foreign theaters for years and even decades at a time. Our Constitution says that it's in Congress's hands to declare war, but Congress has completely ceded this authority through the A.U.M.F. [Authorization for Use of Military Force] and then just said, Hey, executive branch, you can do what you want. And now they want nothing to do with it, and that is not the will of the American people, and it's not the will of the Constitution. So we should repeal the A.U.M.F. and say, Look, Congress, if we want to authorize armed conflict, it should be on you and it should be the will of the people.

Yes. I have three major pro-journalism proposals on my website, including federally funding journalists for every congressional district, billions of dollars in grants to help transition local journalism. Matching grants, so you're not like saying, Hey, we're going to do this. But matching grants to help transition them to cooperative models of ownership to nonprofit and philanthropic models.

In the days that followed, I packed my books and clothing in a suitcase and then took them out again. I told myself the right thing to do was to let him go so he could build a cabin near Susquehannock State Park with a woman who kept her word, but I couldn't convince myself to leave. I kept remembering how he brushed his hair back and blinked at the same time. For some reason, this tiny movement is what I loved about him most.
I'd like to amend the caption for the illustration of medieval tooth extraction that accompanied Josephine Livingstone's review of Jack Hartnell's Medieval Bodies: Life and Death in the Middle Ages and Sylvia Townsend Warner's The Corner That Held Them (Jan. 5). The image, taken from the 14th-century London encyclopedia Omne Bonum, shows a dental instrument on a belt or snakeskin with sewn-in teeth. Such devices were used by itinerant dentists rather like a modern pair of pliers, often at country fairs. Ouch.
To me, one of the worst things you can do in a relationship is if you have this longstanding understanding or a friendship or partnership, and then you try and change the understanding at a particular point in time and do it unilaterally.
He has never considered words to be as significant as actions, or even in the same category of prospective offense. Words were whatever got him through the next interaction, people who worked with him say. Words were not deemed important enough to invite serious trouble.
The Custom of the Country (1913), by Edith Wharton, is about many things: the terrifying ambition of its protagonist, Undine Spragg; marriage; divorce; New York and Paris society — but also the arrival of new American money into those fashionable circles, the ranks of which have always been carefully guarded. Undine, who is originally from the fictional Midwestern town of Apex City, and who marries into the old-world Marvell family, is the perfect embodiment of such aspirational consumerism. And Wharton, who was born into a prominent New York family and was the beneficiary of not one but three legacy inheritances over the course of her life, was in a unique position to observe this monied world and conjure a version of it on the page. (The exact amount Wharton received was and still is a point of contention, on account of antiquated wills that put her trusts in the hands of her brothers, but still, the sum was substantial. A legacy left by her father of $20,000 in the early 1880s amounts to half a million dollars today; $120,000 from a cousin would now be $3.4 million, and a $90,000 gift from her mother is equivalent to an additional $2.7 million upon whose interest and annuities she could draw.) In her novel, Wharton describes in meticulous detail myriad gowns and pieces of jewelry, various properties, priceless artworks and much more.
His popularity in Zimbabwe reflects the fact that in a country bitterly divided by political allegiances, he positioned himself as a unifier. While Mr. Mapfumo took a strong political stance in his music — pioneering a genre known as chimurenga (revolutionary struggle music in Shona) before the fall of white minority rule, then vigorously criticizing Robert Mugabe, who ruled the country from 1980 to 2017 — Mr. Mtukudzi generally avoided taking a political side. He sang at events for the ruling ZANU-PF party, as well as the wedding and funeral of the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai.
I think we all make compromises. Certainly, in journalism, social graces force you to adjust. You're at a holiday dinner table, and what you feel is the direct opposite of what this person's saying. Do you open your mouth? Well, maybe. Sometimes restraint is the better part of valor, and you pick and choose when to fight your battles. Howard Beale has been toeing the line for a long, long time. And it got to a point where it became intolerable, and he had a breaking point and then realized, I just don't care anymore. And he decides, to hell with it, I'm going to say exactly what I feel when I feel it. When I think it, I'll say it with no filter. And it has a resonance to Donald Trump's reign in some ways. And in other ways, Howard Beale had a lot more content.
A billionaire would have a return that would be literally three feet high, he added. Our $100 million clients own multiple closely held businesses. All of them would require an expert valuation and five-year financials.

Covid-19 has deepened the challenges of adopting through the foster care system. Floyd Scott at home in The Dalles, Ore., where he lives with his adoptive family along with his siblings, Mesha and Jermain. Credit... Michael Hanson for The New York Times The last step in the long journey to adopt a child through the foster care system is the courtroom finalization. It's traditionally provided an important opportunity for loved ones to gather and pose for pictures as a judge blesses the creation of a new forever family with a smack of the gavel. But, like so many other things in the Covid-19 era, this tradition has gone virtual. We finalized our adoption over the phone, said Celeste Scott, who last May adopted her three youngest children — who were 4, 5 and 6 when they first came to live with her in the spring of 2019. It was kind of anticlimactic. Still, Scott, of The Dalles, Ore., knows she is fortunate to have finalized the adoptions at all. If she lived elsewhere in the country, she could very well still be waiting. The pandemic has created new challenges in the foster care system and worsened old ones — creating delays in placements and adoptions and forcing some older youth to exit the system amid a public health and economic crisis. The child welfare system is extremely complex and can vary widely by state, and even by county, said Celeste Bodner, executive director and founder of FosterClub, an advocacy organization for foster youth.
Michael Kraus, a professor at the Yale School of Management, argued in an email that
His grades were poor and he left after a year and a half, but not before learning how to shoot quarters out of the outstretched fingers of his friend at 50 feet with a rifle. From Wisconsin, he motorcycled to the Nebraska Aircraft Corporation in Lincoln, which was then producing an airplane and giving flying lessons to promote the product. I can still smell the odor of dope [cellulose acetate or nitrate] that permeated each breath, he said years later in recalling his first close-up view of an aircraft. Lindbergh took his first flight April 9, 1922. In succeeding months he learned to fly, to wing- walk and to parachute. Of equal importance, he absorbed all there was to know about the planes of that day and the various styles of flying. And he made friends with fliers who passed through Lincoln and with Harlan A. (Bud) Gurney, with whom, among others, he barnstormed over the Midwest. Called Slim by his friends because of his lithe, gangling body and 6-foot-2 1/2-inch height, Lindbergh was billed to the public as Daredevil Lindbergh for his stunt feats. However, he did not solo until April, 1923, when he purchased his first plane, a Jenny, in Georgia. Shortly afterward he began to earn his living as a flier by taking up passengers in various towns at $5 a ride.
Nice, nice. You're good with the whistles. All right, last question, then. You articulate a lot of characters who are middle aged, unhappy. Like you talked about, you represent people who have been frustrated, which is happening in this country, which is an interesting juxtaposition. Do you have any advice to them?
It's impossible to deny how absolutely out of control the White House staff — again, myself included — was at times, Mr. Sims writes.
Then it was Mr. Nicolau's turn to enter that caldron of tension. A longtime fan of the Detroit Tigers, he brought an extensive background as a labor lawyer and an arbitrator for the National Basketball Association and its union as well as in other fields, like aviation, communications and entertainment.

JW: Right, but you're talking about expanding the court, too, and if you expand the court, as you say correctly, that it's a federal law, there's nothing in the Constitution about the number of justices. You expand it to 13, the next Republican who comes in, who is furious about women having too many reproductive rights, will expand it to 17 to overturn the rulings you just got. So, how doesn't that just become — doesn't devolve into ——
I have family in Hong Kong. I spent a semester there in college, and so when I see those streets wracked with riots and violence, I actually remember being on those streets. And so it's incredibly jarring, and it's an extraordinary situation because of Hong Kong's status as this semiautonomous region that's being reintegrated back into China.
Paradise was lost. Eighty-five people died, and more than 90 percent of its population was driven out. Two years later, about 4,000 residents have returned to its scorched earth to lay new foundations and test fate once again. Mr. Singer, who has spent the past 24 months preparing to rebuild his home, is among them.
The Democrats appealed the ruling, expecting to lose because such appeals are considered a challenge to the right of the majority party to run the House. Their motion failed 230 to 204. Two Republicans, Constance A. Morella of Maryland and Peter T. King of Long Island, broke with precedent and crossed party lines to vote with the Democrats.
Ms. Vella, a historian by training, found one of her richest subjects close to hand, in her native city. Intimate Enemies, published in 1997, told the story of Micaela Leonarda Antonia Almonester y Rojas, daughter of the richest man in New Orleans. Her marriage at the age of 15 to the son of a French baron set in motion a family scandal whose intricacies enthralled the novelist Stendhal.
My job, simply speaking, is to get things right. So there is no worse feeling than the realization that you have entered a correctable error into print and that a correction will appear a day or two later to proclaim, Because of an editing error …
It's an example of this general policy of pushing costs onto the people who have incurred the misfortune, which drives a cycle of increased vulnerability, she said.

To those who say that Jewish fund-raising, charity, and defense organizations are the answer, I say, Work on, raise money, build buildings, elect officers, bestow honors, monitor anti-Semitism, support Israel. But do not count on it to ensure the Jewish future, because maybe the next generation will not be as attracted to these institutions as the post-Holocaust generation was.
Ms. Bezos, 48, has written two books. In 2005, she published The Testing of Luther Albright: A Novel, a psychological thriller set in Sacramento, Calif. The New York Times called it a quietly absorbing first novel. Her second book, Traps, is a tale of four women who meet on a road trip to Las Vegas.
Admit it: Wouldn't you love to have Neil Gaiman come to your home and read stories to you? Yeah, you would. Or I would anyway. Ideally in one of those glass-ceilinged igloos in some Scandinavian country. Specifically, I'd like him to read from the material that has so deeply informed the otherworlds of his phenomenal fiction: the Norse myths, those ancient and weird tales.
His daughter, Ida Ashworth, said the cause was cancer.
The season starts strong, purring like a well-tuned Ducati, and a stand-alone episode portraying Ciro's temporary exile in Bulgaria (following further gunplay at the end of Season 2) is a prime example of the show's moody, violent romanticism. The energy runs out around the fifth episode, though — the protestations of brotherhood start to sound rehearsed, and the inevitable web of betrayals and bloodshed feels engineered, more outcome-based than character-based. The soundtrack by Mokadelic, with its sensation of a constantly gathering storm, is called on to supply emotion rather than reinforce it. With any luck, Season 4 (almost three years old at this point) will arrive soon and make things better. (HBO Max, Thursday.)
In Florida's vaccine free-for-all, one state site is closing Monday for a football game. Frontline health care workers and people 65 and older waited in line outside the East County Regional Library in Lehigh Acres, Fla., last month. Credit... Octavio Jones for The New York Times The state of Florida's coronavirus testing and vaccination site at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens — the recent scene of long lines of people awaiting vaccination — will be shut down for much of Monday to make way for the College Football Playoff national championship game. No testing will be done on Monday, and vaccinations will end at noon, the Florida Division of Emergency Management announced on Sunday. The pandemic is in an alarming new upward spiral in Florida, with nearly 20,000 new cases of the virus reported there on Friday and more than 15,000 on Saturday. But the state's well-intended effort to throw open the doors of the vaccine program to everyone 65 and older has led to long lines, confusion and disappointment. The temporary closure of the Hard Rock Stadium site to accommodate a football game seemed likely to complicate things further for Miamians. Experts say Florida is an example of what happens when officials attempt to distribute a vaccine that is still in very limited supply to a broad spectrum of the population. In a state with about 4.4 million people 65 and older, more than 402,000 doses had been administered as of Friday, according to federal data, the fourth-highest total in the nation.
No. I'd have to look at the facts at the time that that decision was being made.
Jesse Wegman: Is the inside of the helmet warm?
That's right. And in that regard, it's a lot like the Brexit debate itself. The people who voted to leave imagined some greater Britain. But instead, they may wind up not only with a much diminished country, but with a much diminished monarchy.
The show's casting diversity is its most immediately striking quality, not just in Black aristocratic characters like the duke and Lady Danbury, but also in the entrepreneurial Madame Genevieve Delacroix (Kathryn Drysdale) and the working-class couple Will and Alice Mondrich (Martins Imhangbe and Emma Naomi). All of them are central to the complicated social caste system that make up the show's version of early 1800s London.
Beyond the official preparations, a group of Washington community organizations, including the city's Black Lives Matter chapter, called on area hotels to close in the lead-up to the inauguration to signal to Trump supporters that white supremacists are NOT WELCOME in D.C.! And after some of the rioters last week targeted reporters and photographers in the Capitol, the Committee to Protect Journalists advised anyone covering the inauguration to avoid wearing press lanyards and to carry as little equipment as possible. Since the attack on the Capitol, Mr. Trump has begrudgingly and inconsistently pledged a peaceful remainder of the transition period — something he refused to commit to for more than two months after he lost the election. Mr. Pence tried to assure Americans more explicitly. We are going to ensure that we have a safe inauguration, and President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are sworn in as the president and vice president of the United States in a manner consistent with our history and traditions, he said.

Ms. Bezos, 48, is a novelist. But Amazon has defined her public image almost wholly. The announcement this week that she and her husband would be getting a divorce may soon change that. A statement signed Jeff & MacKenzie, which was first posted to Mr. Bezos's Twitter account, read: After a period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends.
In addition to the nine we already have. I believe that — so if you look at the Constitution, there is nothing there that stipulates the number of Supreme Court justices. We've had fewer than nine, we've had more than nine. I think that appointing new justices would be helpful on several levels. It would help depoliticize the process, at least marginally, because if you have 17 justices and one steps down, then it's not as much of an earthquake. Well, right now we we're hinging our laws on the health of an octogenarian. It would literally be rational for us to all just to follow Ruth Bader Ginsburg around and just scrub any door knob she touches. You know what I mean?
I looked for a sound the guitar couldn't make, in a guitar' he told the South African publication TshisaLIVE in an interview shortly before his death, remembering his early years. Professional guitarists at the time used to laugh at me. I used to look for a mbira on the guitar strings, he said, referring to a traditional Shona thumb piano.
A senior official at the National Security Council and a former top lawyer to Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Ellis applied months ago to be the National Security Agency's general counsel. He was one of three finalists, although he did not get the highest score from the panel evaluating the candidates, according to people familiar with the hiring process. Nevertheless, White House officials told the Defense Department general counsel that the administration favored Mr. Ellis for the job. Positioning a political appointee in a Civil Service job is a complex procedure requiring various approvals to prevent favoritism in the hiring process. With Mr. Ellis, the Office of Personnel Management eventually determined that the general counsel position was exempt from a policy requiring special approval, though those deliberations slowed the process. Mr. Ellis also had to seek a new security clearance. Although General Nakasone was not pleased that Mr. Ellis was chosen over career officials at the National Security Agency, he did not actively block or slow the process of installing Mr. Ellis in the position, according to two people familiar with the matter. He did however, insist that all procedures were followed and all approvals be put in writing. Frustrated by what they saw as a slow-rolling of Mr. Ellis's installation, the Pentagon ordered the National Security Agency to swear him in, a move The Washington Post reported on Saturday.
This is a game changer for Americans in any circumstance. And I am not for reducing or curtailing any of these social programs. For me, we're trying to lay a foundation that works for all Americans, and then we need to keep building on top of it. So if there are people that post-Freedom Dividend need additional programs and assistance, I'm all for it.
BA: But that doesn't make our tax code more progressive.
I mean, to answer your question, no. I don't think so. And I don't know how you could — I mean, other than we are in the climate that we're in today — how you draw that.
Like so many egalitarian efforts, our domestic parity was lost once we had a baby. Everyone probably has a story of how it happened to them. In our case, my husband fell into a depression. On top of that, our 2-week-old baby needed surgery for a stomach condition called pyloric stenosis, and he came out of the operation weak and underweight. Along with the love I gave him, I went into a tough-broad-who-gets-everything-done mode. But I never came out of it.
So Tom Bradby asks Meghan Markle —
As for hormones and menopause, I have treated many women in their 70s and 80s whose sex lives were more active and satisfying than those of women in their 30s and 40s. If problems arise, topics including sexual desire, frequency, pornography, a lack of desire and open marriage need to be discussed openly and honestly.
Dr. Twist, who also runs a clinical practice in family and sex therapy, said she has had several patients in their 20s and 30s who qualify as second-wave digisexuals.
Though I care deeply about the survival of the Jewish people, I do not believe that survival is assured by any biblical imperative or divine promise. I approach the issue of Jewish survival as I would any other important empirical challenge: with an open mind ready and willing to accept any pragmatic solution, or combination of solutions, that will work. I am committed to doing whatever is in my power to help ensure the Jewish future. I know that many Jews feel the same way.
Yeah, it was too thin. And I thought, well, this is not right. But I knew that I needed to do and wanted to do a comedy. I was doing drama after drama after drama. And my whole structure of my approach to the career, long term, is to keep twisting and turning — do comedy, do drama, do stage, do film, do adult theme, do a children's show, whatever. So I knew I needed to do comedy, and it was time to do a big studio comedy, where I'm one of the two stars. But this was just so thin. I thought, I don't know. So I actually called Paul Rudd, and I said, Paul, the premise is so thin. He goes, This is the way those comedies are. When you get on the set, they rely heavily on improvisation. You get these people together, and you start improving and improving and improving. And they cull the story out of that. And he said, I think you'll have a great time. And I can honestly say, I don't think I've had a better time on any film set than Why Him? in my career. It was hilarious.
His other favorites included recordings of Beethoven by the pianist Richard Goode and the Emerson String Quartet.
I saw the headlines about how people were making fun of him. I was like, Oh man, this is really — we really have to put an end to this administration.
I believe your reporters then talked to maybe half a dozen or more of Kim's contemporaries at the organization and found out that those allegations were completely groundless, which they were.
But PG&E has to emerge from bankruptcy by June 30 — on terms acceptable to the governor — in order to take part in a new $20 billion state fund designed to shield large utilities from large wildfire claims. Without that protection, PG&E's restructuring plan would fall apart and its viability would be in question.
Oh, you might not want to push the money to the states and then have them determine how to use it in their budgets. You could empower a national program or an agency to help administer it at the federal level, if you didn't trust the states to actually use it in the right way.
Neither Mr. Mawhinney's lawyer, Jeremy Donnelly, nor state prosecutors offered any new revelations about his connection with Mr. Dulos.
Ms. Wilson did not plan her elaborate constructions, which hinted at Surrealism and Modernism. She did not explain their meaning (if they had any — she left that up to the observer). And she did not say why she chose particular items and arranged them as she did in boxes and other containers.
In addition to writing novels, Ms. Wilhelm and her husband, the author and editor Damon Knight, trained generations of writers through their Clarion Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers' Workshop (now at the University of California, San Diego), and the annual Milford Writers' Conference (originally in Pennsylvania but more recently in Wales).
The lead-up to the French presidential election has been rife with debates over immigration, terrorism and the European Union, but one nonpolitical factor has fascinated the public in France and abroad: the 24-year age gap between Emmanuel Macron, 39, the candidate who will face off against Marine Le Pen on Sunday, and his wife Brigitte, 64.
The couple, who have four children, wrote that they see wonderful futures ahead, as parents, friends, partners in ventures and projects, and as individuals pursuing ventures and adventures.

We should have 18-year term limits, increase the number of justices, make it so it's predictable that you lose an election, the other party might get one or two justices, and then we don't need to literally be monitoring the health of our justices. Or, the most ridiculous thing is you're literally looking at the age of the person you're appointing being, Ooh, this person will be there for 30, 40 years. What kind of system do you want where you're having a society decide 30 years ago what women's rights are today? Doesn't make any sense.
In the original Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, the five cheerfully judgy taste mavens uncovered plenty of fashion choices in their subjects' homes that made them cringe. But the series' revival finds a new one while visiting Cory, a NASCAR-loving Georgia police officer: a Make America Great Again cap.
One criticism of government subsidized journalism is that it could stifle the media's capacity to serve as a watchdog.
So if you cannot learn from the experiences of other countries, what can you learn from? We have to take a policy that actually works, and what those countries and every other developed country have determined works, is a value added tax. Because a value added tax is impossible to game your way out of. If you're a trillion-dollar technology company — you know, I was just in New Hampshire campaigning yesterday, and you know what I say to them? I say to everyone around the country, Amazon, a trillion-dollar technology company sucking up $20 billion in business every year, closing 30 percent of your stores and malls, paying zero in taxes, how do you feel about that? You know? And they are angry. They say, how the heck can Amazon be paying zero in taxes? And I was like, I know. And it's up to you, the people of New Hampshire, to change it. So if you look at other countries ——
Chuck McCann, a comic whose loopiness defined live children's television beginning in the 1950s and who later became a familiar TV and film character actor and a versatile voice on cartoons, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. He was 83.
Mrs. West was a pioneer of mainstream environmental conservation, embracing it well before most Americans. In the 1960s, for instance, though struggling with the financial burden of maintaining Ossabaw Island, which her parents bought in 1924, she rebuffed lucrative offers from developers and instead sold the island to the State of Georgia for $8 million, half of the island's appraised value.
I found him to be a very sympathetic character, which I did not expect. I think that's the part I was surprised by because he's such a cartoon character of kind of a bully, but he really isn't, in a lot of ways.
KK: For millions of Americans, church and religion are the centers of their communities. Do you believe in God? Do you go to church regularly? Who are your spiritual advisers?
Our guide to stand-up, improv and variety shows happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
Mr. Blinken intends to keep the tougher tone that Mr. Trump struck against China — an overarching strategy the Biden administration will wield either to confront Beijing on human rights abuses and military aggressions, or to compete against it in Africa, Europe and the Indo-Pacific.
Here is a selection of a few of our favorite Will you marry me? moments we learned about from couples who married in 2020.
Maybe, though, it is almost impossible to write the truth about these things without seeming — how like a woman! — hysterical. As with the return of fascism and the measles outbreak, it's difficult to believe that mere foolishness and complacency could return us to the bad old days until we actually see it happen. And the novel gives the reader much to enjoy in the meantime. Zumas is a skillful writer, expertly keeping each of her characters in balanced motion, never allowing one to dominate the rest. Her cunning device of not revealing the name of each character in the sections she narrates grants us a multidimensional perspective on all four women, highlighting their roles in one another's stories. It's a beautiful metaphor for the interdependence of women's lives — for the way that, as Paley would remind us, the laws that imprison or criminalize one of us narrow the options for all of us.
Mm-hmm. And I think that's where somebody who is Black, and somebody who has had an experience with the police that is unpleasant and maybe even violent, would say, that's not a perception. That's their reality.
He was also invited by the German Government to inspect the Luftwaffe and warplane factories in the Reich. He received red-carpet treatment, visited many factories and was told repeatedly that the Nazis were eager to create an air force second to none. He visited Germany several times before 1938 and was increasingly impressed with the quality of the air force. It seemed to him all the more fearsome by comparison with the air arm in Britain, France and the Soviet Union. By 1939 he had concluded that the power of the Luftwaffe was overwhelming, and that the air forces of other European countries were comparatively insignificant. In off-the- record conversations with the leaders of these countries, the Soviet Union excepted, he sought to warn them of the perils they were facing. Neither then nor later did Lindbergh, according to his journals, believe that German air power would be the decisive factor in a war so much as it would be an essential element. And he sought to impress on France, Britain and the United States the need to bestir themselves. Lindbergh and his family returned to the United States in 1939 shortly before World War II broke out. He felt he ought to do all he could to prevent American involvement. Not a pacifist nor an isolationist, he was a noninterventionist.
Jerry Brandt, a promoter and entrepreneur who owned two nightclubs, the Electric Circus and the Ritz, that were attention-getting parts of New York's music scene in their day, died on Jan. 16 in Miami Beach. He was 82.
I saw the headlines about how people were making fun of him. I was like, Oh man, this is really — we really have to put an end to this administration.
Anthony Rendon, the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly, said in an interview Monday morning that while he supported some of Mr. Newsom's initiatives, he had strong reservations about raising taxes to pay for them, as Mr. Newsom's aides have suggested.
If you want to solve the hyperacquisition problem, which is a problem, then you have to go in and say, Look, you have to not acquire businesses that are in your space with these criteria. That would be a legitimate stance to take, because right now the business model in Silicon Valley is not to try and outcompete the behemoth. It's just to get bought by them. If you get to a point where they'll offer you $1 billion and you win, your investors win, you're rich and then these get folded in, and it doesn't even matter what they do with your business at that point.
He had had various health problems, including several heart attacks late last year, the environmental group Friends of the Earth, on whose board he served, said in announcing his death.
Freddie, there are two kinds of people in this world, and you ain't one of them. — Dolly Parton, in Rhinestone
A Times evaluation of Mr. Yang's tax plan by N. Gregory Mankiw, professor of economics at Harvard, found that Mr. Yang's tax plan would target the affluent who spend their money lavishly while incentivizing people to save.
archived recording (gordon sondland) Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing the investigations of the 2016 election, D.N.C. server, and Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the president of the United States. And we knew these investigations were important to the president.
JI: In that system, a lot of that money didn't actually go to treating tobacco-related health problems. A lot of it went to shoring up state budgets, and some of them even went to the tobacco industry actually, so I don't know if that's the best model.
When I'm on the subway, people will look at me and then look at me. And then eventually someone will inch over and say, Hey, you running for president? And then I'll say, Yes, I am. They'll say, Yeah, yeah, I like you. Thousand bucks a month, something like that. And then they want to take pictures. And then as soon as someone breaks the seal, then it's safe for everyone to do it. And so, then I'll be — and then there's this uncomfortable period in this subway car after you've taken the pictures with him, you're still sitting there. And so then they're, So, where are you going? Or, how's Bernie? Or whatever the questions are. And so, I have not been riding the subway lately, but I've ridden the subway an awful lot over the years. Now my preferred mode of transportation is the bike, because if someone recognizes me, it's generally too late.
The job, which eventually led to his working on the design specifications for the Boeing 747, allowed him great freedom to travel and to develop any interest he chose. And travel he did, seemingly having no settled abode. In Africa, in 1964, he found an interest that was to occupy his last years and to bring him out of his public reticence and reclusiveness. The issue was conservation. Lying under an acacia tree with the sounds of the dawn around me, he recalled, I realized more clearly the facts that man should never overlook: that the construction of an airplane, for instance, is simple when compared to the evolutionary achievement of a bird; that airplanes depend on an advanced civilization, and that where civilization is most advanced few birds exist. I realized that if I had to choose, I would rather have birds than airplanes. He concluded, he said, that I ought to do something. Concern for Environment That imperative, which unfolded slowly, led him to activity in conservation organizations, to having a large hand in saving the humpback and the blue whales, to concern for endangered species and to public advocacy of steps to save the world's environment. He made his first public speech in 1968--the first since 1941--to the Alaska Legislature. The following year he granted what amounted to his first newspaper interview in 35 years. This was to The New York Times and this writer, the occasion being his conservation activity in the Philippines.
More precisely, I lumbered, jogged, waddled and generally humiliated my way around a track as I tried — and failed — to keep up with the world's most exceptional race walker.
His son Errol said the cause was emphysema.
He said, 'I offered it to you but you turned me down,'  Ms. LeBell recalled.
The Covenant people tend to have a we consciousness. The good of the relationship itself comes first and the needs of the partner are second and the individual needs are third. The covenant only works if each partner, as best as possible, puts the other's needs above his or her own, with the understanding that the other will reciprocate.
His son Daniel said his death, at George Washington University Hospital, was caused by complications of a fall at Mr. Wofford's Washington apartment several days earlier.
I've been a registered Democrat since the Clinton years; I was an Obama appointee. I had a fund-raiser for John Kerry. It wasn't a great fund-raiser because I was kind of young; it wasn't one of those fancy ones where you generate tens of thousands.
So effortlessly did Keller glide along life's surface that for a long time few people had any inkling of his personal struggles away from the pool. In the months before the 2004 Athens Olympics, for example, Keller endured a stretch of sleeplessness and malaise that culminated in what his coach at the time, Jon Urbanchek, described as an emotional breakdown.
You had, for example, a gospel choir —
Mr. Zwick was a second-year law student at Harvard when Ralph Nader, an alumnus, came to the campus in the late 1960s recruiting Nader's raiders to work on his citizen-advocacy projects. Mr. Zwick expressed interest, but Mr. Nader thought he was too immersed in school to be an immediate candidate.
During a booming economic era for Los Angeles in the mid 1980s, the city was terrorized by a serial rapist and murderer dubbed the Night Stalker. In the chilling four-part docu-series Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer, some of the people involved in hunting down this criminal — eventually identified as Richard Ramirez — talk about the stress of the pursuit, and how difficult it was to catch a man whose pattern of behavior defied logic. What emerges from this story is a study of someone who seemed drawn to evil for its own sake, as the ultimate way of disturbing the peace.
KK: Do you feel like President Obama achieved the change that he had promised in the 2008 campaign?
The reason I am drawing, in some polls, 10 percent or more of Donald Trump voters to my campaign is that Republicans and conservatives do not hate economic buying power in citizens' hands. What they hate is a giant bureaucracy making everyone's decisions. So you ask what my main priority will be as president, it will be to get the Freedom Dividend across the finish line and get buying power into Americans' hands, which will then lead us to be able to solve many other problems much more quickly.
The bureau closed for six weeks at the start of the pandemic, but since reopening in late April, it has churned out licenses from 8 a.m. to midnight, seven days a week, including holidays. That license is the ticket to a legally valid marriage at one of the city's dozens of chapels, which offer fast, budget-conscious services in themed settings ranging from elegant to rococo.
Really? So, we have to get done what we can get done. And if we have to focus on things that are traditionally bipartisan, I'd be excited to lead with that. I mean, I'd be much more excited to lead with a much bigger agenda to balance out this economy, to work for people. And I will say that's bipartisan, too. When I go around to Americans around the country, if you were to go to a room of Republicans and say, Hey, how do you feel about Amazon paying zero in taxes? They're not excited about that. They feel like this economy is rigged against them and their families, and they're generally correct, and that is bipartisan.
But the prosecutor countered that Mr. Zhao had confessed the killing to the police, including that he had used a power saw to cut up the body. As the judge read aloud the decision, Mr. Zhao, who was wearing a navy blue suit, stared forward calmly, listening intently to his interpreter.
The bill, which has been passed by the cabinet, must now be adopted by the country's conservative Parliament to become law, but women's advocates are hopeful of success.

MANCHESTER, N.H. — For months, he played the big-talking front-runner, swaggering if rarely steady, hoping voters would not linger long on the tautology of his premise: Joe Biden was the candidate who should win, he told fellow Democrats, because he was the candidate who could win.
Wow, these questions are really fun. Who's broken my heart?
He articulated a vision for the future of work, education and technology for the nation. The board also delved into Mr. Yang's approach to foreign policy and military intervention, and learned of his fascination with aliens and fear of flying vacuum cleaners.
I rapped on the half-glass back door.
SUGIMOTO IS NOT a licensed architect, though he doesn't really care for labels. As he wrote in the chapbook he created about the apartment for his personal collection: Recently, architecture is getting closer to art while art is becoming more architectural; seldom, however, does one hear of them coming together in a beautiful or harmonious manner. Architecture's sense of inferiority to art and art's own jealousy of architecture are inextricably entangled. His first foray into architectural work was restoring the medieval Go'o Shinto Shrine on the island of Naoshima, in 1996. He subsequently opened an architecture practice in Japan under the name New Material Research Laboratory with Tomoyuki Sakakida, a trained architect. New Material has completed a number of noteworthy buildings, including the Enoura Observatory, which is part of the Odawara Art Foundation that Sugimoto founded in 2009 on the coastline of the Kanagawa Prefecture, just south of Tokyo. Enoura's cantilevered main gallery with glass walls is elegantly oriented to glimpse the sun as it rises from the east. The firm's name, however, is cheekily disingenuous; Sugimoto is fond of repurposing ancient materials. In the Manhattan apartment, the dining room floors are planks of Yakusugi — cedar from Yakushima island that is more than a thousand years old. (It is now illegal to harvest the forests of Yakushima; the wood he used had been in storage for some time.) For centuries, the wind ripped across the island, causing the growth rings of the trees to bend and swirl into mesmerizing shapes.
KK: Think you might be overly optimistic. Maybe we'll move on to foreign policy, if you don't mind?
I commented to one of my team members, I feel like running for president is at least a glimpse into what it's like to be a professional woman because I feel like I care about my appearance more now than I ever did. And there are people that are always like looking after ——
KK: I meant more make people want to work for government? And I think that's your question, right?
The conversations are really questioning whether we want to continue to do the job.
Active play between fathers and children has a functional element correlated with several positive child outcomes, such as competitiveness without aggression, cooperation that buffers anxiety, healthy experimentation, social competence, peer acceptance and popularity, and a sense of autonomy.
KK: I thought you were going to say it's a lot harder to ride the subway now because of the breakdowns of New York infrastructure.
DICK GREGORY at Carolines on Broadway (April 9-10, 7:30 p.m.). Mr. Gregory is both an immensely important stand-up comic and a prominent civil rights activist. A performer since the 1950s, he broke ground as the first African-American comedian to be called over to the couch for a conversation on The Tonight Show. He aimed his comedy at white Americans, pushing them to understand the black experience in America in the 1950s and '60s. Now 84, he continues to perform politically minded material.
Her current memoir comes from a much darker place. It begins in the summer of 2012. Ronan is dying, and Black is actively considering a jump from the Rio Grande Gorge bridge. Her marriage has imploded — exploded, really — after the corrosive effects of too many days and nights of anger, guilt, resentment, exhaustion and, above all, a never-ending, all-consuming grief. Black's coping mechanism has been desperate self-numbing — compulsive extramarital sex, extreme exercise, any sort of tangible, identifiable, physical pain. Her husband has fled into rage. Their self-immolation and ultimate split amount to a rupture that a crater of any size in any ground and beneath any sky failed to accurately depict, and in the aftermath, she has been left feeling mentally fractured, she writes. My mind was shifting and molting as my life broke slowly apart, like some strange and painful rebirth, but with no imaginable future — for what mother can imagine a future without her child?
In her richly detailed and propulsive biography of Elizabeth and her sister Emily Blackwell, Janice P. Nimura considers and discards a couple of possible origin stories. The most narratively appealing is 17-year-old Elizabeth's experience caring for her father on his deathbed, in which it is tempting to discern … the germ of her medical future. Tempting, but too easy. No single story convincingly explains why a young woman enthralled by literature and philosophy should plummet into the earthy business of bodies.
Martin is a history teacher with the listless, sloping posture of a comma. He walks slowly, as though every step ignites a jolt of pain. His job is uninspiring; his marriage is falling apart. Have I become boring? he asks his wife. Do you find me boring?
So when I heard that Shane Gillis had called me Jew chink — I think was the slur — my reaction was the same reaction anyone would have, which was like, who the heck is this guy, and he sounds like a total jackass. Well, my wife actually had heard about it independently and was also like, Who the heck is this guy? And so then I sat down and started to figure out who Shane Gillis was, what he did for a living, and then I sat down and watched some of his comedy to try and get some context.
Allow me to apologize in advance for the bad language, the diseased sarcasm, and the bigotry. All police are racist. It's part of our job. New York police hate Puerto Ricans, Miami police hate Cubans, Houston police hate Mexicans, San Diego police hate Native Americans, and Portland police hate Eskimos. Here we hate pretty well everybody who's non-Irish. Or nonpolice. Anyone can become a police--Jews, blacks, Asians, women--and once you're there you're a member of a race called police, which is obliged to hate every other race.
El problema con muchos propósitos es que tienden a ser inherentemente autocríticos y provienen de una especie de pensamiento mágico que gira en torno a la idea de que con un gran cambio —algo de pérdida de peso, ejercicio regular, más dinero— la vida se transformará. Es demasiado fácil buscar un comportamiento por el que te criticas regularmente o por el que te sientes culpable, dijo McGonigal. Es esa falsa promesa del tipo: 'Si cambias esto, cambiarás todo'.
But remember, the sympathetic part is that he has this tremendous ambition to do good, to be a righteous man, and remember what you talked about, his deep insecurities. Well, doesn't bullying come from insecurity, really? So that's where that stems from, his fear of failing and oh my god, I'm going to be known as the worst president. It drives him to force his will upon people and give him what was called the Johnson treatment.
In New York during the 1970s one popular T-shirt, using the Yiddish word for a female gossip, brandished the slogan Proust Is a Yenta!
JI: You've proposed legalizing gambling at the federal level, regulating it.
Ms. Zang quickly made her way to Kitchen Zinc's fancier sister restaurant, and spotted Ms. Reville waiting. The mistake didn't damper their chemistry — after introducing themselves, they fell into an easy banter, debating the merits of professional sports and talking about Ms. Zang's summer working at the Maryland Attorney General's Office.
This is what's so tough right now is that countries are trying to figure out what are the benefits of being an ally of the United States and doing what we want them to do, and then what are the costs. Unfortunately that calculation is going against us more and more. Turkey's relationship with the U.S. has been stronger than our relationship with many other countries in that region. I think we should invest in that relationship if we're going to be able to accomplish any of our goals there. And that includes, to me, being a little bit more accommodating about behaviors that we might find objectionable or troubling from them than we might from another country.
Right. He's portrayed as such a good guy, and you begin by liking him. But I have to say, I already dislike him because some of the corners you're cutting and how quickly he went right into criminality, really, just so easily — and sloppily, by the way.
She married Louis G. Johnson six months after the premiere. That marriage ended in divorce, as did a second marriage, in 1955, to Robert William Chambers.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the federal government commissioned a series of experiments to look at how guaranteed income effects labor participation. Researchers discovered that a program like U.B.I. doesn't have the drastic effect on work that some might predict; households overall reduce their workload by roughly 13 percent, according to a paper in the Canadian Public Policy journal.
Her death, at a care facility, was confirmed by her daughter, Linda Alvarado.
And that's probably a generous response. Some of the responses would be worse than that. So if you get the boot off people's throats, then you can start making progress on our health, on our educational outcomes, on our political polarization.
In episode two, Ms. Hawkins shares her story on camera for the first time. Mr. Kelly used to call her the cable girl, because she hooked him up: She connected him to other young girls whom he had sex with, all of them, she said, between the ages of 14 and 16. He was 25 at the time. Eventually, Mr. Kelly began having sex with her, too. She later sued him and settled for $250,000. As part of the settlement, she signed a nondisclosure agreement, the first in a series of confidentiality agreements with women that kept his conduct a secret, and allowed it to continue.
Freshwater is a poetic and disturbing depiction of mental illness as it haunts the protagonist from birth to adulthood: the brief insanities that are in you, not just the ones that blossomed as you grew taller … but the ones you were born with, tucked behind your liver. It is an unflinching account of the way mental illness can grow, transform and destroy not just relationships, but one's sense of self as well. Unlike many depictions of dissociative identity disorder in fiction, Emezi steers clears of hysteria and fear-driven drama. The voices in Ada's mind build creatively on a consistent belief about madness: that in the height of suffering, sufferers are not themselves; they become possessed by different spirits. As Sylvia Plath famously wrote in 1962, I am terrified by this dark thing that sleeps in me.
Her answer seems to confirm what he already knows: You're not the same Martin I first met.
But there is more--much more--to Jewish identity than collective self-defense. There is something important that is worth defending. After all, until anti-Semitism changed from religious bigotry to racial bigotry--roughly near the end of the nineteenth century--persecuted Jews generally had the option of conversion. Unlike Hitler, our religiously inspired persecutors--the Crusaders, the Inquisitors, Martin Luther, and the pogromists--did distinguish between Jews who converted to Christianity and Jews who did not. Indeed, it was precisely their religious mission to convert the Jews, by whatever methods it took.
Anshai Lal's Phillauri is a Bollywood movie toggling between a contemporary screwball rom-com and a sweeping historical love story. Balancing both proves to be challenging.
Her seven days in the blue chair were occasioned by her stepmother telling her that her father hadn't died of brain cancer, as Owusu had believed, but of AIDS. Owusu had idolized her father; she calls him her Baba-Mama, the parent who believed in her, who loved her. He died just before she turned 14; she remembers him slipping in and out of delirium, crying out for his own mother in his sleep. They were living in Rome at the time, because her father happened to be stationed there. But Ghana, which she visited, didn't feel like home to her either. The ancestral mourning rituals that his family forced her to endure made her feel even more alienated.
What will matter most in marriage is what's possible on the other side of love's first blush: conversations that are rewarding, intimate and real. It's not that we come together in electric recognition and pure understanding, then fall away from that through conflict. Rather, we come together in a rush of passion, then we achieve love through continuing conversation.
He said, 'I offered it to you but you turned me down,'  Ms. LeBell recalled.
Lesli Linka Glatter, a director and executive producer, admitted she also quizzed Mr. Patinkin about his turn as Inigo Montoya (catchphrase: You killed my father. Prepare to die.) in the 1987 comedy. I was a little like, 'Should I bring this up?' she said. But definitely I asked all the questions, I was so in awe.
Rachel Jennifer Heyman did some quick-fire swiping on the Tinder dating app at her apartment in Manhattan one Saturday evening in January 2019 with her friend over glasses of wine, a variety of Trader Joe's appetizers and reality TV.

And the problem has persisted. In 2013, a priest in Uganda was suspended after he raised concerns about his fellow priests engaging in sexual relations with women, including nuns. In India, a bishop currently faces charges of repeatedly raping a former mother superior.

On Monday, he used his speech to laud Mr. Brown's tenure; the mention of his predecessor's name drew a standing ovation. But Mr. Newsom left little doubt that he had a broader view of government than the moderate Mr. Brown. The departing governor inherited a $28 billion deficit and left Mr. Newsom a $14 billion surplus; he also created an $18 billion so-called rainy day fund to help the state get through what is widely viewed as an inevitable coming recession.
One person who is not laughing is Brown's protagonist, Alice Hale, the 21st-century newlywed who has recently left a once-promising career in public relations and moved from Manhattan to a sleepy New York suburb. In the basement of her new house is a box left by the previous owner that's filled with magazines from the 1950s plus a dusty, circa-1930s copy of Cookbook for the Modern Housewife. The collection offers a trove of anachronistic recipes and rules, but mostly, the box is a portal to another world, one that makes Alice feel a little less lonely in her new directionless life. At the other end of the portal is Nellie Murdoch, a Betty Draper type whose life is spent tending to her spectacular garden, baking cakes for Tupperware parties and keeping up appearances while living with her philandering, physically abusive husband.

The show's advance sales, once hefty, are now zero. The lead producer says she expects to spend at least $3 million to restart the show on Broadway. But hope is increasingly replacing despair.
Andrew Yang's message is remarkably similar to Elizabeth Warren's and Bernie Sanders's — the American economy is not working for enough Americans, and it's going to require structural change to do better. Where Mr. Yang differs — beyond his almost complete lack of government or political experience — is in his prescriptions, including his signature Freedom Dividend.
Well, I'm all about trying to improve the reality on the ground, to the extent that we can actually put resources and funds to work in communities to make sure that women have access to reproductive rights in clinics. Certainly any way we can make sure that there aren't any obstacles to the funding of Planned Parenthood clinics around the country. I would take those actions immediately. A lot of the legislative actions, you need a bit more time and a bit more buy-in from Congress, but at the Supreme Court level, I would consider appointing more justices if it was necessary to safeguard women's reproductive rights.
Railsback and Walter Flowers, a Democrat, basically created the coalition that was necessary to make the House Judiciary Committee vote a bipartisan one, Michael Koncewicz, the author of They Said No to Nixon: Republicans Who Stood Up to the President's Abuses of Power (2018), wrote in an email.
To those who say that Jewish education is the key to Jewish survival, I say, You are undoubtedly right. Whatever the essence or essences of Judaism may be, they are in large part, at least, to be discovered and rediscovered in our books, in our history, and in our approach to learning. But we cannot count on all Jews, so many of whom are busy with their successful careers, to become Jewishly educated, especially since Jewish education today is controlled almost entirely by the religious component of Jewish life and has been one of the great failures of the American Jewish community.
If you gaze at the many portraits of half-Japanese, half-Dutch subjects photographed by Mr. Miyazaki, you can see the searching in their faces, the puzzling out of what hapa means. But you can also gain the sense that there are deep currents, forces old and powerful, in opposition to wall-building and racial hunkering.
To me, one of the worst things you can do in a relationship is if you have this longstanding understanding or a friendship or partnership, and then you try and change the understanding at a particular point in time and do it unilaterally.
When Kamala Harris is sworn in as vice president, she will represent many firsts: First woman vice president. First Black woman. First woman of Indian descent. But there is another milestone that will be on display: that of her family.
Porn, necessarily, cuts to the chase: a little less conversation, a little more action.
I agree neither with those theologians who believe that Jewish survival is assured because God promised it nor with those demographers who believe that Jewish disappearance is inevitable because of forces beyond our control. I believe that our future as a people is largely in our own hands, and I want to help define and defend the new Jewish state of mind.
While both states devote many pages to the women's movement, Texas books, in general, avoid discussions of sex or sexuality.

As part of a plea deal, she acknowledged guilt on one count of larceny and was sentenced to four to eight years. She served four (1990-94).
Victor Lownes, a professed rake whose close friendship with Hugh Hefner helped shape Playboy magazine, its libertine ethic and the Playboy empire's business success, died on Wednesday in London. He was 88.
Mr. Gillis was hired by Saturday Night Live last September, then dropped days later after clips surfaced showing him using slurs and language offensive toward Asian and L.G.B.T.Q. people, including one specifically about Mr. Yang. Mr. Yang later said the comedian should have had the chance to keep his job and explained: As a society, we have become unduly punitive and vindictive about people making statements that some find offensive or distasteful.
KK: Do you feel like President Obama achieved the change that he had promised in the 2008 campaign?
Yet, for all of the Democrats' charges of excessive partisanship today, enough Republicans did pick and choose among articles of impeachment to send only two of the four that had come out of the House Judiciary Committee on to the Senate.
So when I heard that Shane Gillis had called me Jew chink — I think was the slur — my reaction was the same reaction anyone would have, which was like, who the heck is this guy, and he sounds like a total jackass. Well, my wife actually had heard about it independently and was also like, Who the heck is this guy? And so then I sat down and started to figure out who Shane Gillis was, what he did for a living, and then I sat down and watched some of his comedy to try and get some context.
Mr. Yang's candidacy has centered on the idea of his Freedom Dividend, essentially universal basic income — which has a long history, drawing support from Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King Jr. and Friedrich von Hayek, but also a controversial one. (Later annotations will look at why.)
Ultimately, the play's insistence on the sanctity of open marriage, a stance that apparently reflected Mr. Malleson's own beliefs and practices, isn't all that persuasive. If the central claim, that to live effectively you must walk the line between a great slope of complacence on one side and rather a mess-up of promiscuity on the other, sounds reasonably plausible in the moment, that is a credit to the dapper Mr. von Essen. Does the road to moral enlightenment and matrimonial contentment absolutely lead into the beds of selected others? Is there really no other way? Separate vacations, maybe?
Still, recent textbooks have come a long way from what was published in past decades. Both Texas and California volumes deal more bluntly with the cruelty of the slave trade, eschewing several myths that were common in textbooks for generations: that some slave owners treated enslaved people kindly and that African-Americans were better off enslaved than free. The books also devote more space to the women's movement and balance the narrative of European immigration with stories of Latino and Asian immigrants.

The race for this year's acting Oscars couldn't possibly be less suspenseful: You can engrave those Academy Awards right now for Joaquin Phoenix (Joker), Renée Zellweger (Judy), Brad Pitt (Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood) and Laura Dern (Marriage Story), the fearsome foursome set to sweep up every trophy from now until Feb. 9, when the ceremony will take place.
Among Maher's wise choices is to accept that the very publicness of Baloch's life makes her, on some level, unknowable. She was a construction, down to her name, which was invented. (Indeed the disclosure of her real name by local media may have played a role in her death, by exposing her family to local ridicule and judgment.) Maher sprinkles the book with Baloch's own words, spoken and written, but she doesn't try to resolve their contradictions. Baloch was brave and foolish, phenomenally independent and pathetically needy, protective of her virtue and, as was her right, also willing to trade on it. She was a type (see: a Kardashian, to whom she was sometimes compared) but also only herself. She was proof, if we needed it, that a life can be lived simultaneously on the rise and on the run.
Jared is particularly interesting because it shows where America has come to, he said, and that America is a much, much more tolerant place than it was.
Mixing is happening all around, and the results can be surprising, wondrous, and unstoppable: Who knew that there were so many hapas in Holland? Yet in the hapa world, anxiety about breeding and bloodlines is never far from the surface. An essay in Hapa Japan recounts the paroxysms felt by some Japanese-Americans in California in the late 1970s, when an article in a newspaper of the Japanese American Citizens League warned that interracial marriage was a threat worse than a hundred million Manzanars, Tule Lakes, or Pearl Harbors.
But on Wednesday, Dr. Biden arrived at the White House with a higher profile, a platform similar to the one she had as second lady, and an East Wing stocked with aides she trusts. They include Anthony Bernal, a senior adviser who has been with the Bidens since the Obama campaign. Julissa Reynoso Pantaleón, an Obama State Department alumnus, is her chief of staff.
I also bring to this book a unique perspective informed by my experiences growing out of the publication of Chutzpah five years ago. Since that time, I have spoken to well over 100,000 Jews in nearly every city with a significant Jewish population, not only in this country but throughout the world. The talk is usually preceded by a social hour and followed by a question period. I estimate that I have been asked more than a thousand questions by concerned Jews. I have received more than ten thousand letters and phone calls from Jewish men, women, and children. I have also been teaching young students, many of them Jewish, for a third of a century. I have served as faculty adviser to the Harvard Jewish Law Students Association, have been an active participant in Hillel, and have spoken to Jewish student groups at many colleges and universities around the world. Over these years, I have discussed virtually every Jewish issue--from God to intermarriage to Israel to anti-Semitism to Jewish feminism--with thousands of students. These questions, letters, calls, and discussions have given me an extraordinary window into the fears, hopes, and beliefs of a wide assortment of Jews. It has been quite an education. I think I understand what is on the minds and in the souls of many Jews, of all ages, and I try to address myself to these concerns in this book.
I don't think she will influence society, Ms. Hung said in a telephone interview. I think she's way more influenced by Chinese society, especially the internet world. She just confirmed what the Chinese public expects out of rich kids in China.
Dog says he has 12 children, 11 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He also says he has had four wives, been convicted of robbery 18 times and captured 10,000 fugitives. And he claims God promised to make him famous.
Covid-19 has deepened the challenges of adopting through the foster care system. Floyd Scott at home in The Dalles, Ore., where he lives with his adoptive family along with his siblings, Mesha and Jermain. Credit... Michael Hanson for The New York Times The last step in the long journey to adopt a child through the foster care system is the courtroom finalization. It's traditionally provided an important opportunity for loved ones to gather and pose for pictures as a judge blesses the creation of a new forever family with a smack of the gavel. But, like so many other things in the Covid-19 era, this tradition has gone virtual. We finalized our adoption over the phone, said Celeste Scott, who last May adopted her three youngest children — who were 4, 5 and 6 when they first came to live with her in the spring of 2019. It was kind of anticlimactic. Still, Scott, of The Dalles, Ore., knows she is fortunate to have finalized the adoptions at all. If she lived elsewhere in the country, she could very well still be waiting. The pandemic has created new challenges in the foster care system and worsened old ones — creating delays in placements and adoptions and forcing some older youth to exit the system amid a public health and economic crisis. The child welfare system is extremely complex and can vary widely by state, and even by county, said Celeste Bodner, executive director and founder of FosterClub, an advocacy organization for foster youth.
I'm grateful to the religious community that I grew up in because the challenges that they presented have brought me to the place I am today, he said. I'm also thankful for my sexual orientation because it has opened me to deeper ways of being in relationship to God.
Jonas Mekas, a filmmaker, curator, archivist, critic and all-around evangelist for independently made movies in general, and for those variously known as experimental, underground or avant-garde in particular, died on Wednesday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 96.
Mr. Yang was the C.E.O. of a boutique test prep company that was purchased by Kaplan in 2009. The company flourished during the 2008 financial collapse, becoming the country's foremost preparatory company for the GMAT as more people flocked to business school.
I lost my last 12 contracts, Borstelmann said. That hit me hard. My gosh. That's probably the money that I'm able to save from a whole season after expenses and everything else.
The Rockwells' residence is in the northwestern suburbs, out to Blackthorn: Twenty minutes. I had Johnny Macatitch stay in the car while I went around the back way like I normally would when paying a call. I was coming by the side of the house and I paused. To step on my cigarette. To breathe. And I could see them, in through the leaded windows and past the potted plants of the kitchen, Miriam and Colonel Tom, dancing. Dancing the twist, slow, and without a whole lot of bend in the knees, to the lecherous saxophone frying like the dinner in the pan. They clinked glasses. Red wine. Up above the moon throbbed full, and the clouds it raced through seemed to be the moon's clouds rather than our clouds. Yes, an unforgettably beautiful night. And that beauty was part of this story. As if staged for my benefit, like the picture framed by the kitchen window: A forty-year marriage that still had fucking in it. Under a night so sweet it looked like day.
Now he let me look at him. The panic had left his eyes. As for what remained, well, I've seen it a thousand times. The skin is matte, containing not a watt of light. The stare goes nowhere into the world. It cannot penetrate. Seated on the other side of the desk, I was already way out of range.
Just when you think Phillauri is becoming a Ghost Town- or Topper-type romp, it switches gears, as Shashi imparts her own past. Flash back to almost a century ago, when she was a poet, secretly submitting verse to a newspaper under an assumed name. When she meets another poet, Phillauri (Diljit Dosanjh), a dashing ne'er-do-well, they fall into a love forbidden by Shashi's pious brother. It's painful to witness the script's transformation of Shashi at that point from a hardheaded freethinker into a lovelorn obsessive. But things become worse for her: The abuses of British rule — specifically the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, in Amritsar, Punjab, in 1919 — lead to a dire personal loss.
Countercultural is not a word one would readily pin to the amiable, clean-cut young men who are enjoying a rare night out at the diner for ice cream and cheesecake. And yet in America today, a man whose personal heroes are martyr-saints, who invokes God often in conversation, who worries intensely about the poor and believes that contraception and masturbation are always morally wrong is, to put it mildly, outside the mainstream. He stands apart. Sometimes it's hard to talk about Jesus Christ, says Damien Cook, 25, a friendly, Falstaffian-looking deacon from Omaha. I remember in high school, you feel odd bringing Him up. You're told by the culture that Christianity oppresses people. Like all counterculturalists, seminarians and priests can provoke suspicion, even hostility, from a society whose values they seem, by their very presence, to challenge. Seminarians say they're frequently approached by strangers who disagree with the church's position on women's ordination or, more often, celibacy. They go: 'Father, you can't get married, right? Well, I don't agree with that,' Brian Bashista, who is 34 and from Arlington, Va., recounts. You try to explain, but some of them don't want to hear it. Maybe I took offense the first couple of times, but it happens so much that I say, Lord, you must be doing something. Maybe this is an opportunity to try to help teach. Seminarians often confront the suggestion that a high proportion of them are homosexual.

For 17 years, until Rubinstein's retirement in 1976, Mr. Wilcox produced some 60 of his recordings for RCA Victor Red Seal. He counted Rubinstein's recordings of Chopin's repertoire among his favorite productions.
If you were a person in that town in Missouri and you wanted to start a bakery, before the dividend, it's a dumb idea. Post-dividend, it might be a great idea. You can hire someone to help staff the bakery, you know if the bakery fails, you're going to survive because you have this income that you can rely upon. This is the most stable and secure way to create jobs that actually reflect our community's needs and values. What are the other alternatives? For the government to come in and say, Hey, we're going to designate five people to clean up this park forever. We're going to designate 10 people to make our people stronger forever, regardless of whether or not they're ——
But now it has run completely aground. Developments in the case are so slow-moving and diffuse that it's hard to keep track of them, and most of them are probably red herrings anyway. Dead ends are to be expected in the middle of an eight-hour whodunit, but that doesn't absolve the series's creator, Nic Pizzolatto, from the responsibility to keep plugging away. It's not just the detectives in The Hour and the Day who are losing their sense of direction — it's as if the show itself had unscrewed the cap on a bottle of Jack Daniels and gone for a swim. Maybe it will wake from its stupor and start working the case again, but for now it's passed out on the couch. And it's dreaming about the Viet Cong.
BA: But we also have record low unemployment, and when you mention labor force participation, some people think a big factor there is that the government already is giving people too much money.
All this may seem an awfully low priority when the to-do list is a mile long and the wedding planner needs an answer now. But in married life, a sense of emotional emergency almost always means it's time to slow down. Emotions are often inconvenient.
The friendship/hateship between Susan and Ro, the ways in which each experiences the mere existence of the other as both a reproach and a criticism, is one of the great delights of this lyrical and beautifully observed reflection on women's lives. Ro cannot stop thinking of Susan's offhand remark that you don't truly become an adult until you have kids. Susan is preoccupied with the thought of Ro's questioning her reasons for changing her surname: How come nobody's allowed to criticize a woman's decision to give up her name for a man's name? Just because it's her choice? I can think of some other bad choices that—. Both women keep lists: Ro's is a self-flagellating inventory of reasons it's a bad idea for an unwed 42-year-old to raise a child; Susan's is a lengthy accounting of the unrelenting and grindingly dull routine of raising children: Herd crumbs into palm. Spray table. Wipe down table. Rinse cups and bowls, and on and on. Susan's resentment of Ro's rich intellectual life means the exhausted mother can't empathize with the single teacher's loneliness. But Ro's corresponding resentment of Susan's full family life means she can't empathize, either, with her friend's boredom and despair. These carefully chosen details feel urgent in our present moment, when women are constantly encouraged to compete with one another to attain an unattainable ideal of our gender.

Ms. Yao, the daughter from Mr. Ren's second marriage, unquestionably grew up in privilege, perhaps more than her older half siblings. She traveled widely, living in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Britain, according to her own biographical descriptions. Her globe-trotting was such that she recently had to fend off the Chinese news media's questions about her nationality, saying she was born in Kunming, a city in southern China, and carries a Chinese passport.
Would it offend you to know I watched the LBJ — though I had seen it on stage — on my iPhone in bed, the whole thing.
MIAMI — In his first public appearance since the strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran, President Trump rallied his evangelical Christian base of supporters on Friday, portraying himself as the restorer of faith in the public square and claiming that God is on our side.
At the end of the tunnel, connected by a belt to Lisa and Rae, Naum Kushner faltered. I told my children: 'You are young, go save yourself, leave me here,'  he was quoted in Nechama Tec's Defiance as saying. One of my daughters had an onion and an apple. She smeared the onion over my face and I felt better.8 The sting woke him up. He kept moving. Chanon Kushner was not so lucky. He and the other leaders of the escape became disoriented when they exited the tunnel in the driving rain. There was delirium in being free, out beyond the ghetto walls. The boys became confused and started to run in different directions. The next day, the enraged Nazis found Chanon and the others, and shot them. This was the second time the Nazis had shot Chanon and left him for dead. This time, he did not survive.
Since 1982, Alaska has been giving every resident an annual check from its $66.3 billion permanent fund, which gets at least 25 percent of the state's mineral royalties every year. The results of the experiment have been mixed — crippling poverty is low, but unemployment rates are among the highest in the country, and the fund's value fluctuates with oil prices.
Throughout the narrative, which jumps back and forth in time between the late 1980s and 2007, the events leading to Jodi's conviction spin in her memory, becoming clearer bit by bit. Her teenage affair with Paula once took Jodi into a dark, frightening and exciting underworld of gambling, guns and passion. At one point, remembering a flight in a small plane over the ocean with Paula, Jodi searches in vain for the right words to describe the color of the water, as elusive as her swirling emotions — words sufficient to catch the heart-wild magic of it.
In police work you soon get to be familiar with what we call the yeah, right suicide. Where you go in the door, see the body, look around the room, and say, Yeah, right. This was definitely not a yeah-right suicide. I have known Jennifer Rockwell since she was eight years old. She was a favorite of mine. But she was also a favorite of everybody else's. And I watched her grow into a kind of embarrassment of perfection.
You have to go back to May of 2018 and the wedding of Prince Harry and his American bride, Meghan Markle. And on one level, this wedding had all the elements that one would expect from a royal wedding.
With retirement from ABC looming after the season, this was the 70-year-old Jackson's last sojourn to Ann Arbor to call a Michigan game. Nearly three decades since redefining the sound of televised college football with an evocative idiom and a storyteller's brio, he insists that it is time to see whether the young bucks in his shadow are as talented as they think. You want to go when it's time, he said. You're better off if you go a little early.
I was a working actor since the time I was 25. I made a living as my career. That's the professional achievement I'm most proud of is that I crossed a threshold — somehow, some way — when I got a job in New York City, moved from LA to New York to be on a soap opera for two years.
In this true crime documentary, a man ventures with two bounty hunters into Honduras to avenge the killing of his father. But the film struggles to fit the crime.
Walter Bernstein, whose career as a top film and television screenwriter was derailed by the McCarthy-era blacklist, and who decades later turned that experience into one of his best-known films, The Front, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 101.
A critique of President Obama's financial policies by Matt Stoller, of the Open Markets Institute, argues that the Obama administration let banking executives off the hook for their role in the financial crisis and enabled nine million foreclosures.
But even by that standard, the marquee productions of this year's Prototype, the festival of new music-theater that sprawls throughout the city and runs through Sunday, are extreme. There are scenes in Prism, ThisTree and especially 4.48 Psychosis of almost cataclysmic suffering, the kind of pain that lingers without reason or resolution.
If you look at our proposals, we have a tax on financial transactions, which would obviously end up falling most heavily on the wealthiest Americans and the wealthiest companies. We have a carbon tax, which tends to fall most heavily on the wealthiest industries, which are emitting a lot. The value-added tax would obviously be enormously generative from people who benefit from society and consume the most. I'm for trying to restore our income tax levels to previous levels to be more progressive.
If you have term limits, it is bipartisan. Because ——
The police searched the hole and the area around it in August, but they never found human remains, signs of the tarp or of lime. However they reviewed cellphone data that showed that Mr. Mawhinney's phone had been used near the gun club on March 29 and again at about 11 p.m. on May 31, a week after Ms. Dulos's disappearance.
As the paranoid Lise grows convinced that her husband is plotting to induce her to commit suicide, the voices ratchet up, accusing her of various offenses: of being an inattentive wife, an inconstant mother, a solipsistic writer. You've never seen anything but yourself in the whole world, she envisions her beloved daughter, Hanne, admonishing her. That madness can be more incisive than the rational is the novel's resonant irony, one that still lands. So, of course, does the crime of female subjectivity, of believing oneself a worthy literary subject, capacious enough to contain multitudes.
archived recording (meghan markle) When I first met my now-husband, my friends were really happy because I was so happy. But my British friend said to me, I'm sure he's great, but you shouldn't do it, because the British tabloids will destroy your life.
Ms. Meng's fate throughout what has turned into a long extradition process has soured views toward the United States. Chinese officials have portrayed her as an innocent victim of a highly politicized case to damage the company.
Keller rebounded to deliver one of the signature moments of those Games, holding off the Australian star Ian Thorpe over the final 100 meters of their anchor legs to clinch the gold for the United States in the 4x200 freestyle relay. It was his second medal of the Olympics, and the fourth of five he would eventually claim in his decorated international career.
I believe your reporters then talked to maybe half a dozen or more of Kim's contemporaries at the organization and found out that those allegations were completely groundless, which they were.

So we need to have better, more holistic ways of measuring how our kids are doing educationally, and we need to empower teachers and let teachers do their jobs. Because if you are a teacher and you're teaching to the test, you end up making decisions in the classroom that you know are not right for the students.
Cherubino, a horny pageboy sung by a woman in adolescent male drag, was one of Ms. Graham's calling cards in the 1990s. To hear a superb rising artist in the role, 24 hours after hearing Ms. Graham limn the stages of a woman's life, was a poignant juxtaposition, but also a lovely one. The kids are all right, these performances made clear, and so are the parents.
CNN trails President Obama and his staff members as they prepare for the transition of power to a new administration. Six tells fictional stories inspired by a real-life Navy SEAL team. And in Melancholia, a young bride awaits the end of the world.
Public opinion was bitterly divided between the leftist Dreyfusards, who demanded justice and truth, and the anti-Dreyfusards, who led an anti-Semitic campaign, defended the honor of the army, and rejected the call for a retrial. The conflict led to a virtual civil war. In 1899 Dreyfus was found guilty again, although this time under extenuating circumstances--and the president pardoned him. Only in 1906 was Dreyfus fully rehabilitated, named an officer once again, and decorated with the Legion of Honor. Interestingly, Theodor Herzl, the Paris correspondent for a Viennese newspaper, was so overwhelmed by the virulent anti-Semitism of the Dreyfus Affair that he was inspired by the prophetic idea of a Jewish state.
This isn't to say that his only interesting work belongs to this period, or that his movies from The Purple Rose of Cairo through Husbands and Wives can be watched today without queasiness or qualm. On the contrary, Ms. Farrow's presence in most of them — and the glimpses of her household, including some of her children — make it impossible not to think about Mr. Allen's personal life, and challenges the notion that it can be easily separated from his work.
Is my child's behavior normal? It's a parenting question for the ages, particularly at a time when a certain type of parent (present company included) frets over every childhood quirk, no matter how mundane. Does the preschooler with a predilection for hitting need a professional intervention, or maybe just a taekwondo class? Is the kid who drops naps but not tantrums a future rageaholic? This sort of hand-wringing, at its most extreme, is at the center of Ashley Audrain's taut, chilling debut novel, The Push.
Mr. Duncan is best known for his work in Washington, D.C., as the former general counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a conservative organization that defends religious liberty for all. He played a leading role in opposing the provision of the Affordable Care Act requiring employers to provide insurance coverage for contraceptives. Mr. Duncan also defended North Carolina's photo ID law that the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit wrote had targeted black voters with almost surgical precision. He also defended Louisiana's ban on gay marriage in several different courts before the Supreme Court prohibited state bans on gay marriage.
She has entered into two significant unions since my father's death 35 years ago. The first occurred in assisted living, when at mealtimes she had to sit with Violet, full of complaint, and Bud, who grumbled nonstop when he wasn't singing Gilbert and Sullivan, and Bob, who didn't speak at all. After some time Bob departed and a man I'll call Pete Gilbert appeared. Oh, Pete Gilbert, as if floated down from the heavens, a cheerful, insightful man in a soft plaid shirt. He was interested in the world, he loved to read, and he had narrative skills. My mother, for her part, made him laugh. He had immediate affection for her, and soon an abiding tenderness. They did not spend time together away from the dining room table; it wasn't that kind of thing. The essentials of true marriage had once more changed in my thinking, so that now I knew it actually involved only the enormity that is Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner, day after day. That, it still seems to me, is the crux of real companionship, time spent over the grapefruit, the grilled cheese, the tilapia. I take you to be my beloved Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. Until Assigned Seating says otherwise.

That is correct. But when I've dug into it, very, very few Americans are getting $1,000 in food stamps. And most of the people who are on government assistance live in fear of losing that assistance because there are various requirements that tend to come with it. And when, if you ask them, say, Hey, would you prefer $1,000 unconditional that you can rely upon, they actually think that's too good to be true.

Other candidates have taken a different approach to creating a nest egg for low-income youth — Senator Booker, for example, favors baby bonds, which would provide every infant with a savings account that the government would contribute to annually depending on family income.

So, and I know The New York Times, I mean you've had your issues with Facebook and the rest of it, and they made a change and then all sorts of things happen.
Well, for example, The Express covered a very similar incident, which is both women talking about their love of avocados. And the two headlines tell the tale. In the first headline about Kate, it says, Kate's Morning Sickness Cure. Prince William Gifted with an Avocado for Pregnant Duchess. Same story, same newspaper about Meghan Markle, and the headline is Meghan Markle's Beloved Avocado Linked to Human Rights Abuse and Drought. Millennial Shame.
One of the most illuminating discussions in the book centers around the idea of adult orphans, individuals who have lost the capacity to exist as parts of that complementary human group which we call the family and who, if they marry, merely beget and rear other adult orphans. On a different level of social analysis and seriousness is the amusing chapter headed Love of Women, which discusses the way some mysterious occult agreement among women changes the styles in men (when the men aren't looking), so that the poor male who has just got himself finally organized to be a Raftish character given to black hats, dark looks and contempt for women finds that the style has shifted and women are giving the unpurchasable look to good-natured athletes, broad-shouldered and broad-minded.
Indeed, the latest generation of robotic sex toys make Charlotte's low-tech Jack Rabbit vibrator from Sex and the City look as antique as the 28,000-year-old siltstone dildo found in a cave in Germany a few years ago.
In Bryan Cranston's case, you go on to play even more powerful men. He was Lyndon Baines Johnson in Broadway's All The Way, and he was Howard Beale in Network. He won the Tony for both roles. And these days, he's New Orleans judge Michael Desiato in the Showtime series Your Honor. His character's son has just accidentally killed a kid on a motorcycle — but not just any kid on a motorcycle.
The government's repayment policy is an extension of its approach to British tourists or other citizens who get in trouble abroad and need help returning to the United Kingdom. People 18 years or older have to reimburse the government.

KK: Do you think — speaking of allies, do you think Turkey is still an ally to the United States, and do you think the U.S. should have nuclear weapons there?
You wouldn't guess that from the opening of Haircut, in which a professionally logorrheic barber entertains a new customer with tales of life in his two-bit town. There's this practical joker, you see, and this gal who won't give him the time of day and this doctor she likes and so on. But the story soon asserts itself, or rather insinuates itself, as a scathing indictment of good-old-boy-ism: the barely civilized tradition of men playing tricks on one another and arranging nasty traps (including marriage) for women.
KARACHI, Pakistan — A court in the northern city of Lahore in Pakistan has abolished so-called virginity tests, which women are subjected to in sexual assault cases, setting a precedent for the practice to be potentially outlawed nationwide.
What is less clear is whether what works in a primary will be harmful in the general election and whether the cascade of apologies risks making Democrats look like the hypersensitive, politically correct crowd Republicans make them out to be — especially when compared with President Trump, who often insults and offends people and almost never apologizes for anything.
Like so many egalitarian efforts, our domestic parity was lost once we had a baby. Everyone probably has a story of how it happened to them. In our case, my husband fell into a depression. On top of that, our 2-week-old baby needed surgery for a stomach condition called pyloric stenosis, and he came out of the operation weak and underweight. Along with the love I gave him, I went into a tough-broad-who-gets-everything-done mode. But I never came out of it.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the federal government commissioned a series of experiments to look at how guaranteed income effects labor participation. Researchers discovered that a program like U.B.I. doesn't have the drastic effect on work that some might predict; households overall reduce their workload by roughly 13 percent, according to a paper in the Canadian Public Policy journal.
Ms. Michels, who goes by Mindy, was with a Canadian friend, and so Ms. Hartman, who lives in Amsterdam, thought she was also Canadian. Ms. Hartman was taken by her curly hair.
Mr. Yang founded Venture for America, a fellowship program for recent college graduates, in 2011, with the goal of creating 100,000 new jobs in the country's most underresourced cities. As of 2019, the nonprofit has created around 3,500 jobs.
That rift has already surfaced this year, as the governor and other Democrats grapple with the political fallout from a new law that sharply reduced the use of cash bail. The law went into effect on New Year's Day, and since then, concerns over a spate of anti-Semitic incidents and other recent alleged crimes committed by those released have led to calls for changes in the law, including by Mr. Cuomo himself.
I have family in Hong Kong. I spent a semester there in college, and so when I see those streets wracked with riots and violence, I actually remember being on those streets. And so it's incredibly jarring, and it's an extraordinary situation because of Hong Kong's status as this semiautonomous region that's being reintegrated back into China.
That was the transport minister in New South Wales describing the fires ravaging Australia. Searing heat and afternoon winds propelled fires on Saturday, above in Tomerong, adding to the devastation of a deadly fire season that has now claimed 24 lives.

The census data from the Ministry of Interior and Safety showed that South Korea's population totaled 51,829,023 as of Dec. 31, down 20,838 from the end of 2019. There were 275,815 births, down 10.65 percent from 2019, and 307,764 deaths, up 3.1 percent from 2019. The ministry expressed alarm about the implications, saying that amid the rapidly declining birthrate, the government needs to undertake fundamental changes to its relevant policies.
The defense and prosecution agreed on a judge rather than a jury trial.
A half-century later, all of it — her extraordinary clarity and imperfect femininity, her unstinting account of the struggle to reconcile art and life — still lands. The construct of memoir (and its stylish young cousin, autofiction) involves the organizing filter of retrospection, lending the impression that life is a continuous narrative reel of action and consequence, of meanings to be universalized. Ditlevsen's refusal to present her failings as steps on the path to some mythical plane of self-awareness reminds me of how potent the form can be when stripped of that pretense. Only at the conclusion of her memoirs, where we find her as she was when she wrote them — clinging to scraps of herself, a stranger to her children, gingerly returning to the page, the hunger lingering in her veins — did I really understand what occasioned these rare and indelible texts: the desire to be rid, finally, of her shame. Ditlevsen's voice, diffident and funny, dead-on about her own mistakes, is a welcome addition to that canon of women who showed us their secret faces so that we might wear our own.
Let me explain. I'm a parent. I've got — how many of you all are parents? So if your kids are like my kids, they are mesmerized by any screen that is nearby. I regularly challenge my kids. I say, What's more important? People or screens? And they know the right answer's people. And then if they say screens, then I hold them upside down by their ankles until they say, People, people. And the people that are most diligent about screen time are the tech folks in Silicon Valley. You go there, and all of a sudden there's not a screen to be had because they know that we have the smartest engineers in the country turning supercomputers into dopamine delivery devices for kids, because that's how they make their millions of dollars.
While Axe made plenty of mistakes in the first season — he tore his own office down to the foundations in the end — one of the strengths of the second season is that it's willing to expose his weak spots and fallibility. He can plot or buy his way out of many sticky situations, and he always seems a step ahead of other hedge-funders and Wall Street sharks. But he's also impulsive and ego-driven, and his hot temperament sometimes gets the better of him. In this episode, even Wags — Wags! — advises him to cool off a little and stop obsessing over Foley's intervention in the Sandicot deal. When the guy who lustily indulges in vaportinis and an empowering cabaret that celebrates the feminine ideal (i.e. lap dances) tells you to slow your roll, maybe it's best to listen.
It all started with Orsini's, Mr. Nelson said, referring to the famed pasta house in Midtown Manhattan where the couple had their first date. There was nothing like Orsini's.
Both of the officers are represented by the International Brotherhood of Police and by Vince Champion, who quickly criticized the investigation. We wanted to understand why Champion, a union official who supports reform, is defending the officers in the Brooks killing. I wonder what it means to have a member of your union — a police officer — charged with murder in the line of duty.
I'm not going to dispute the fact of what you're saying. One, I haven't pulled the stats. I'll take your word for the stats. You said three or four cities. I said one city. So the thing is, you can go to your state's and pull yours. I can go to my state's and pull mine. Now, is there departments that actually may have it? I'm not going to argue that point. You're probably — yes, that could be absolutely right. I just think that trying to go to our respective corners, if you would, and make our arguments is not going to do it. We in law enforcement have to admit that in the Black community, this is how they feel. How do we prevent them from feeling that way?
BA: But that doesn't make our tax code more progressive.
Mr. Yang has argued that his Freedom Dividend is one answer to the needs of the millions who will lose their jobs to automation.
And while some of that was perhaps legitimate, you also began to see just a more petty flavor to the coverage. And it's really perhaps most visible if you look at the coverage of Meghan Markle side by side with that of Kate Middleton, who married Prince Harry's brother, William.
His former wife, Marilyn Nix Kuechenberg, said the cause was a heart attack.
'The Bong Show' opens at Film at Lincoln Center. Bong Joon Ho's Parasite was one of the best films of 2019, but it's just the latest in the South Korean filmmaker's strong body of works, most of which comment on humanity (or the lack of it) in some manner. He combines showmanship with social awareness in a way that re-energizes the faded but nonetheless durable democratic promise of movies, A.O. Scott wrote about the filmmaker. Most of his films are available on streaming platforms, but all of his films will be screened as part of this retrospective. From Jan. 7-14; filmlinc.org.

When it comes to politicians, he said he marks a sharp divide between political life and personal life, and he argues that the president's personal behavior is irrelevant to his public message.
MR. DAWSON Not just us. The call went out — we won't be the only ones to answer.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, like Mr. Yang, has argued that the country's approach to antitrust regulation is outmoded. In early 2019, the Federal Trade Commission created a new task force focused on monitoring competition in technology markets, which the foundation celebrated as a step toward modernizing antitrust.
BA: But we also have record low unemployment, and when you mention labor force participation, some people think a big factor there is that the government already is giving people too much money.
The editorial board recently called for the Trump administration to break the impasse on funding for the proposed rail tunnel under the Hudson River in an editorial titled: Build the Donald J. Trump Tunnel. The vital infrastructure project has stalled because of political infighting.
And again, all you have to do to look at it is to say, stock market prices and G.D.P. record highs, life expectancy declining. Like, that sums it up. You know? You don't need any clearer divergence than that.
But he said that Clinton had become a Commander in Chief who by lying in legal forums trivializes, ignores, shreds, minimizes the sanctity of his oath of office. Representative Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut said there can be no justice without the truth.
Mr. Yang's comments, on Mr. Gillis and on judgment more broadly, contribute to a growing conversation among political and cultural figures about the merits and downsides of cancel culture. Former President Obama, for example, spoke out about the prevalence of call-out culture during an interview in October, arguing that criticizing people on social media for not being woke enough is not activism and not bringing about change.
KK: And do you think President Xi is a dictator?
A priest is called to be an alter Christus, to stand in the Person of Christ and perform the sacraments, through which grace is conferred by God. Nowadays, though, the distance between the Catholic priesthood and the surrounding culture has given it a near occult mystique. As America hurtles forward unblinkingly into the consumer-driven, technological and environmental unknown, the Catholic priesthood remains becalmed in a zone of otherworldly preoccupations relatively unbuffeted by present-day vicissitudes. Today, as, say, 500 years ago, a man -- and only a man -- who senses he has a vocation, or a call from God to the priesthood, hands over his life irrevocably to the church, promising celibacy and obedience. Now, as centuries ago, he answers to the bishop of his diocese, celebrates the Mass, performs the sacraments and, if he has been appointed a pastor, oversees and maintains the solvency of his parish. (A religious-order priest like a Franciscan or Jesuit makes an additional promise of poverty, and commits his life to his religious community and its particular mission.) In exchange for these sacrifices, a diocesan priest typically receives from his diocese a room, board, a place to retire when he is too old or sick to serve any longer and around $10,000 a year. It is perhaps not surprising that in contemporary America, with its focus on individualism and personal achievement, not to speak of wealth, the number of men seeking out this sort of existence has plummeted.
The reason I am drawing, in some polls, 10 percent or more of Donald Trump voters to my campaign is that Republicans and conservatives do not hate economic buying power in citizens' hands. What they hate is a giant bureaucracy making everyone's decisions. So you ask what my main priority will be as president, it will be to get the Freedom Dividend across the finish line and get buying power into Americans' hands, which will then lead us to be able to solve many other problems much more quickly.
The Covenant people tend to have a we consciousness. The good of the relationship itself comes first and the needs of the partner are second and the individual needs are third. The covenant only works if each partner, as best as possible, puts the other's needs above his or her own, with the understanding that the other will reciprocate.

To the short list of television shows focused on prostitution — Hung, Secret Diary of a Call Girl, The Girlfriend Experience — add Harlots, an eight-episode British costume extravaganza that started this week on Hulu. If the cool minimalism of Steven Soderbergh's Girlfriend Experience isn't your thing, then the strenuously theatrical Harlots (keywords bawdy and voluptuous) might be more your speed.
The United States had a civil war over slavery in the 19th century and a continuous history of structural racism and white oligarchical rule until the 1960s, and in many aspects until the present. Europe lacks this legacy.
We should have 18-year term limits, increase the number of justices, make it so it's predictable that you lose an election, the other party might get one or two justices, and then we don't need to literally be monitoring the health of our justices. Or, the most ridiculous thing is you're literally looking at the age of the person you're appointing being, Ooh, this person will be there for 30, 40 years. What kind of system do you want where you're having a society decide 30 years ago what women's rights are today? Doesn't make any sense.
Their partnership has endured through distance, even as both pursued solo projects. About 15 years ago Mr. Torres left New York for Orlando, Fla., while Mr. Ahearn continued working in his South Bronx studio. With Mr. Ahearn the one with connections to the city's art world, people sometimes forget about Mr. Torres's equal contributions to their oeuvre. But if anything, Mr. Ahearn was relieved and excited when Mr. Torres returned to his studio recently to prepare several pieces for a show in Chelsea in the fall.
I am the Southeast regional director for the International Brotherhood of Police Officers. Basically, I'm the director for the police union.
Well, it sounds like you've been there.
Absolutely. It was unbelievable. And I remember how irritated my eyes were. But yet, it was a physical manifestation of the irritation. So that was that. But it also taught me, like, wow, at the right time, if that can happen, how dramatically appealing it can be.
archived recording (michael bruce curry) — once said, and I quote, We must discover the power of love.
As she travels the stage in an introductory zigzag, greeting her friends and family with upper body gestures, her feet sing with youthful brilliance — small sideways jumps (pas de chat) and incisive pointwork. After the first 10 seconds, her energy changes to even higher spirits and bigger contrasts. In one repeated phrase (13 seconds to 24 seconds), her torso leans forward as she gives special emphasis to one small step (petit développé); then another step (a turning relevé grand développé) opens her body up more expansively; and there follows a bigger, quicker jump.
KK: I meant more make people want to work for government? And I think that's your question, right?
In 1849, when Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman doctor in America, the medical profession was neither well established nor well respected nor well paid. Germ theory was more than a decade away, and in hospitals for the poor, surgeons in blood-caked aprons went from handling corpses to delivering babies without washing their hands. In wealthy homes, physicians coasted on charisma and connections as much as skill. At all levels of society, doctors had little more to rely on than purgatives, laudanum and lancets. What kind of woman would fight to join their ranks?
Samuel Beckett, when asked one beautiful spring morning whether such a day did not make him glad to be alive, responded, I wouldn't go as far as that. Life is a predicament, death the elephant at the horizon that looms larger as the years pass.
To me, the economic imbalances are causing many of our other problems. If you look up and down the line, health problems, poor educational attainment and results, even political polarization, they stem from the fact that we have this pervasive financial insecurity where 78 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Almost half can't afford an unexpected $400 or $500 bill. If you can't pay next month's rent, it's very hard to worry about climate change. I come and talk to you and say, Hey, we need to fight climate change. And you look up and say like, I'm worried about next month. Next year, next decade has to wait in line.
On Wednesday, Democratic House impeachment managers began laying out their case to senators for convicting and removing President Trump from office, accusing him of a corrupt scheme to pressure Ukraine into tarnishing his political rivals.
But Suzanne Agee and others close to Mr. Agee disputed the Alzheimer's diagnosis and said he was mentally competent. In an Oct. 29 email exchange, Bruce A. Miroglio, a lawyer and friend to the couple, wrote that Ms. Cunningham Agee had retained counsel, to help her get Bill declared incompetent. He wrote, Bill is still competent. Mr. Agee was never declared mentally incompetent by the courts.
But it's the lying, or deception, or really just the uncertainty about other people that dominates the rest of this collection. A woman desperate for marriage spends a weekend with a guy she used to date who hasn't always been particularly nice to her. She doesn't know that he's tying up loose ends before killing himself, and afterward she has to deal with the puzzle of his intentions. Even years of shared life fail to produce real intimacy. Parents are just as untrustworthy as lovers. In Owl Eyes, a geeky kid at a math camp runs into a professor who tells him a story about how he used to be involved with the boy's mother — that he used to be a father to the boy himself. Vague memories come back to the boy, but it's hard to tell if they offer doubt or hope.
It's just trial and error, she said in a short biographical film made in 2011 for the Cleveland Arts Prize, which she won in 1993. She added, I don't have anything in my head that I want them to say, but it's entirely what happens when they get together that makes the story, so the story is brand new to me.
We have to be working toward China's second main priority, which is maintaining robust economic growth. So there are two goals. There are two primary goals that are sometimes in tension, of maintaining social order and maintaining robust economic growth. And the best way we can try and contain their behavior in Hong Kong is to say, Look, the economic costs are going to be very, very high. And the best way we can do that is to build global consensus around certain norms and behaviors.
I want to make sure I understand what you are referring to. When you say that there are cases where the district attorney may have misspoken, what do you mean?
So the Shane Gillis opinion was not based upon the timeline, it was just based upon my reaction as a person, and the person that was directly named. I certainly think there should be consequences for one's statements and actions, and I certainly think that obviously he made the statements within the year, and that if you did have some sort of time frame when you would want to overlook something, it would be much longer than a year.
JW: I just wanted to tie together the question — a question from Lauren and a question from Michelle, and ask you about Washington, both with regard to Supreme Court confirmation process and your agenda more generally. You said at the very beginning of our conversation, in response to Katie, that you don't need a — you were talking about various [cross talk].
The artist Georgia O'Keeffe said, Nobody sees a flower — really — it is so small it takes time — we haven't time — and to see takes time, like to have a friend takes time. What most people want from marriage is an intimate friend. The key to lasting love is taking time to understand and respond.
Why ouch? Bryan, come on, why?
Dr. Bateson's parents, Dr. Mead and Gregory Bateson, an Englishman, were celebrated anthropologists who fell in love in New Guinea while both were studying the cultures there. (Dr. Mead was married to someone else at the time.) They treated their daughter's arrival almost as more field work, documenting her birth on film — not a typical practice in 1939 — and continuing to record her early childhood with the intention of using the footage not just as home movies but also as educational material. (Dr. Bateson's first memory of her father was with a Leica camera hanging from his neck.)
Indeed, in her video apology Ms. Gabbard said her views had significantly changed.
Eight of the last 10 best-picture winners also nabbed a screenplay Oscar along the way, so Monday's Writers Guild of America nominations may shed a little more light on an unusually wide-open Oscar race.
Oh, well, I always know that NPR sound. I don't have an NPR voice, unfortunately. Here in the small village of San Juan. You know, they're always somewhere beautiful and calm.
That'd be my first question if I got in there, I'd be, All right, let me see them. Let's see what we've been hiding all of these years.
The problem with letting publishers back out of contracts with noncelebrity, nonreligious, non-children's book authors on the grounds of immorality is that immorality is a slippery concept. Publishers have little incentive to clarify what they mean by it, and the public is fickle in what it takes umbrage at.
A 489-day hunger strike, an international campaign and pressure from Washington helped me regain my freedom on May 30, 2015. I felt more solidarity from strangers than I did from some of my own blood relatives.
Yeah, you said you don't need 80 percent of Congress, you need a majority. And I would push back and say neither of those is correct. You need 60 percent of the Senate currently. The question is, how do you plan to get things done, even if you had a Democratic majority in the Senate? Which I think is right now less than an even chance. How do you propose getting your agenda through Congress when the filibuster is in place?
While representing the prosecutors when the case went to the Supreme Court, Mr. Duncan was serving as what he later called solicitor general of Louisiana, a position that does not exist. He devised the argument that, although the district attorney had withheld evidence in many cases involving innocent men, there was no need to train lawyers in his office because they would have learned about their obligation in law school.
The Covenant Regime is based on the idea that our current formula is a conspiracy to make people unhappy. Love is realistically a stronger force than self-interest. Detached calculation in such matters is self-strangulating. The deepest joy sneaks in the back door when you are surrendering to some sacred promise.
In 1959, he started driving Grand Prix cars for the Ferrari factory of Italy for $130 a week plus half of his prize and starting money. He earned $7,500 that year. By 1970, when he retired after 15 years of racing, he had won Grand Prix races in France, Mexico and Belgium.
It was the beginning of what one British newspaper called the most commercially successful relationship in literary history. The book was a hit in Britain, and Mr. Little sold the U.S. rights for just over $100,000 and, soon after that, the film rights for $1.8 million.
Jersey, a small island in the English Channel a few miles from the French coast, is a dependency of the British crown but is by and large independent of Britain, with its own directly elected assemblies, fiscal system and courts.
The job, which eventually led to his working on the design specifications for the Boeing 747, allowed him great freedom to travel and to develop any interest he chose. And travel he did, seemingly having no settled abode. In Africa, in 1964, he found an interest that was to occupy his last years and to bring him out of his public reticence and reclusiveness. The issue was conservation. Lying under an acacia tree with the sounds of the dawn around me, he recalled, I realized more clearly the facts that man should never overlook: that the construction of an airplane, for instance, is simple when compared to the evolutionary achievement of a bird; that airplanes depend on an advanced civilization, and that where civilization is most advanced few birds exist. I realized that if I had to choose, I would rather have birds than airplanes. He concluded, he said, that I ought to do something. Concern for Environment That imperative, which unfolded slowly, led him to activity in conservation organizations, to having a large hand in saving the humpback and the blue whales, to concern for endangered species and to public advocacy of steps to save the world's environment. He made his first public speech in 1968--the first since 1941--to the Alaska Legislature. The following year he granted what amounted to his first newspaper interview in 35 years. This was to The New York Times and this writer, the occasion being his conservation activity in the Philippines.
Depending on who you ask, Chelsea's Maritime Hotel could be seen as proof of the architect Albert C. Ledner's inspired vision — or a monolithic monument to 1960s kitsch. Originally designed as a hiring hall for the National Maritime Union, the 11-story, porthole-adorned tower has since served as a shelter for runaways and as housing for the New York Service Center for Chinese Study Fellows, before opening as a fashionable hotel in 2003.
In a Jan. 7 National Review article, Grown Men Are the Solution, Not the Problem, David French, one of the most outspoken critics of the A.P.A. guidelines, wrote We are in the middle of an intense culture war focused around men.
What does all this tell us? That Aurora's native language is classical ballet. Her parents express themselves in mime alone, but she speaks pure dance (like her fairy godmothers in the ballet's Prologue), and she possesses full command of its vocabulary and resources. Here she is all outward impulsiveness, but during the ballet, she changes gear and mood, again and again.
Mr. Gillis issued what some saw as a non-apology, writing on Twitter that he is a comedian who pushes boundaries and his intention is never to hurt. He added, I'm happy to apologize to anyone who's actually offended by anything I've said.
The Globes, awarded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, are not taken seriously as markers of artistic achievement. But Hollywood covets the red-carpet spectacle, which comes during nomination balloting for the Academy Awards. (Voting for the Oscars started on Thursday and concludes on Tuesday; nominations will be announced on Jan. 13.) Studio marketers will use Globe wins to promote winter films. NBC, which broadcasts the ceremony live, makes a fortune on ad sales.
Ditlevsen's faceted truths tend to cut in more than one way — a jab in the heart, a slash to the throat. The confirmation party her mother throws to usher her, at 14, into the working ranks is another set piece of tenderly wrapped horror. The trap of filial piety isn't lost on Ditlevsen, but escaping a fate of low expectations and lower-paying jobs is never as simple as recognizing their cruel, gray facts. At first, she plays this for bruising comedy, recounting a stint as a nanny to a small boy who tells her, You have to do everything I say or else I'll shoot you. When she finally earns enough money to rent that essential room of her own in which to write, it is in a flophouse run by a blowsy Nazi who blasts Hitler's speeches on the radio but complains about the clatter of Ditlevsen's typewriter.
President Obama referred to education as the civil rights issue of our time, as did former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. Indeed, the gap between education outcomes for black and white students has barely budged in recent decades, according to research from the Brookings Institution.
BlackRock's big move on climate change
Romantic comedies are essentially cinema's comfort food, and expecting them to stray from formula is almost as fruitless as expecting McDonald's to alter the flavor of its fries. So to say that Everybody Loves Somebody is predictable is no real criticism, as being able to foresee the ending — almost from the beginning — is exactly what most viewers expect.
This dirty, darling eight-episode series is a teen sex comedy, a perceptive family dramedy and a thoughtful examination of the roles sex and sexuality play in how we construct our social identities. Otis (Asa Butterfield) is a high school student whose mother, Jean (Gillian Anderson), is a sex and relationship therapist. Some of her therapeutic techniques have rubbed off on her anxious son, and he slowly becomes a therapist to his classmates.
His wife, Gloria Loomis, said the cause was pneumonia.
So this is not a left or a right idea, this is bipartisan. And many Republicans will see that this is going to be a huge win for their constituents, for rural areas, for red states on the interior. We don't need 80 percent of Congress to pass it, we just need a majority.
That's a fun exercise, too. I haven't gotten into the judicial appointment shortlist yet, but safeguarding women's reproductive rights would be one clear criteria. Because women's reproductive rights are fundamental human rights in my mind.
I'm curious if producers be less willing to take chances on risky plays. That's where I see the thing. And a friend of mine just told me they thought that there'd be more frivolity and sort of vapid fluff because playing it safe and fun. After this era of both Trump and the pandemic and all this partisanship, they might play it safe with revivals and shows based on pop music and lighter fare.
[Thousands of readers have responded to this article. Here is what they had to say.]
James Rosenquist, who helped define Pop Art in its 1960s heyday with his boldly scaled painted montages of commercial imagery, died on Friday in New York City. He was 83 years old.
Mr. Northam won 80 percent of the vote in predominantly black communities, according to Ms. Nguyen. While his call for the removal of Confederate monuments in the wake of Charlottesville might have deepened his minority support, the racist photo on his yearbook page showed that he was not immune to the state's deeply rooted racism, several Virginians said.
A donor would usually go to a bank once or twice a week over months to produce enough sperm to sell to dozens of families.
I put aside the CSSS layout I'd been staring at and I did my face. Too, I buzzed Linda, asking her to greet the elevator and bring the Colonel right on in.
Mr. Biden also named two co-chairs of the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology: Frances H. Arnold, the first American woman to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and Maria Zuber, a geophysics and planetary science expert and the first woman to lead a NASA spacecraft mission. Mr. Biden also said that Dr. Francis S. Collins would remain as the director of the National Institutes of Health. Earlier on Saturday, the Biden-Harris transition team announced several nominations to the State Department, including that of Brian P. McKeon, who has worked with Mr. Biden for more than 25 years, to be deputy secretary of state for management and resources. Bonnie Jenkins, a veteran arms control expert, was nominated for under secretary for arms control and international security affairs; Ms. Jenkins is also the founder of a group for women of color in national security. Uzra Zeya, who has held multiple roles at the State Department, was nominated for under secretary for civilian security, democracy, and human rights. Mr. Biden also formally announced the nominations of Wendy Sherman to be deputy secretary of state and Victoria Nuland as under secretary for political affairs; his plans to nominate both Ms. Sherman and Ms. Nuland were previously reported.
We need to let our historic allies know that our commitments are good, and that if we want to make a change, we want to do it in a way that's not pulling the rug out from under you but actually consultative. If we want other people to invest more, then we have to try and sit down with them and drive them to do so without questioning our commitment to NATO wholesale. But to me, trying to nickel-and-dime our relationships with our historic allies is not the best way forward. I think it was James Mattis that said that if you invest more in diplomacy, you have to invest less in ammunition, which should be the goal. So we need to make sure our partnerships and alliances are actually strong, stable and secure, and then we can put pressure on Russia and China with more of a global consensus, and maintain the international world order that's benefited us for decades that now is falling apart because Donald Trump is so erratic and unreliable, even with the people we've been allies with for decades.
Mr. Yang was raised in New York; his parents immigrated from Taiwan.
Here are other developments in the fallout from the Capitol siege: A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a bill in the House on Thursday to award Eugene Goodman, a Capitol Police officer, the Congressional Gold Medal because of his efforts to keep the violent mob of Trump supporters from accessing the Senate last week. Mr. Goodman was captured on video running up the stairs in the Capitol. The F.B.I. has warned police departments across the country to be on high alert for extremist activity and violence in their communities ahead of the inauguration next week. It also cautioned law enforcement agencies to look for armed militias and extremists who want to trigger a race war.
I said, Colonel Tom? Miriam? But Miriam was already falling away and fading from my sight. Falling away at thirty-two feet per second squared. You lost your daughter on this day. You lost your Jennifer.
After watching back-to-back programs by the Joffrey Ballet, I have many questions, but first things first: Why would a company that relocated to Chicago from New York in 1995 because of financial difficulties open its first New York season in more than 20 years with a subpar version of Romeo & Juliet?
It hasn't been difficult for Germany to neglect one of its most significant and innovative composers: Weill, born in 1900, left the country in 1933 and vehemently rejected the idea of returning. He had a full life and career after settling in the United States, becoming an ambitious Broadway composer until his death in 1950.
This, to me, is an emblem of what's gone wrong in American life. Where the market is all knowing and all powerful, and if the market decides that local journalism has zero value, then it has zero value. And that is not the way forward for us. We need to make our own independent determination of our own value as people, of the value of local journalism, of the value of arts, of the value of volunteering, of caregiving, of — like all the most important things in American life. And so you, in many ways, you're like the guardians of this incredible journalistic tradition, and it's like a unique privilege because the people who've pursued the same vocation in other parts of the country are just seeing it disappear.
In a year that has been described as a women's renaissance, female friendship feels particularly worthy of contemplation. As professional opportunities broaden and cultural attitudes shift, competition between women has given way to allyship. Through the return of women's social organizations and the formalization of whisper networks, female solidarity is more pervasive than ever, a byproduct of girl power and the cumulation of years of quiet rebellion.
A VAT (value-added tax) is a tax on consumption, so the burden disproportionately falls on low-income households, who spend a larger portion of their income.
While conservative Catholics have doubled down on abortion policy and religious freedom for the past four years, Mr. Biden's policy priorities reflect those of Pope Francis, who has sought to turn the church's attention from sexual politics to issues like environmental protection, poverty and migration.
Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood is less a movie about the murderous Manson family than it is a homage to Tinseltown itself, every scene a love letter to the Los Angeles of a half century ago. With the film earning 10 nominations up and down the Oscar ballot, it is fair to ask: Does Hollywood love films about itself?
The comment about I wouldn't want to be judged for something 25 years ago was about something completely independent. I think I'd seen something where Joe Biden was being called out for something he'd said 25 years ago, when I said I wouldn't want to be called out for some misstatement I'd made 25 years ago. And then I joked, good thing no one cared about what I was doing 25 years ago, because I was at that point a 20-year-old man, and the internet didn't really have full documentation of how I spent those years.
Being gay and an emblem of progress hasn't given Buttigieg any special traction with younger Democrats, who respond much less favorably to him than older Democrats do. It hasn't established any solidarity with other minorities, though he reached for such a connection when stating a commitment to racial justice during the Democrats' November debate.
[MUSIC PLAYING] When you walk in the room, do you have sway?
Jerry Brandt, a promoter and entrepreneur who owned two nightclubs, the Electric Circus and the Ritz, that were attention-getting parts of New York's music scene in their day, died on Jan. 16 in Miami Beach. He was 82.
So well-developed were Mr. Trump's survival instincts, in theory, that he had all but perfected the art of semi-plausible deniability — an upside of being on seemingly every side of every major political issue at various points in his adult life.

Good point. I mean, and I can't disagree with that.
It was a blustery March day and the Upper West Side streets were teeming and heaving in that way peculiar to New York City. But Ms. Wolitzer's apartment, on West End Avenue, was a bookshelf-centric oasis of serenity. A late-middle-aged Havanese dog named Jet sniffed around, then repaired to his position on the bed in the master bedroom. Ms. Wolitzer's husband, the science writer Richard Panek, wandered companionably in and out of the kitchen.

BA: So a Republican would say that alternative is to let markets work. Is that what makes you a Democrat — you don't think the market will create enough jobs for Americans?
Huawei has become the focal point of a geopolitical battle between China and the United States as the Trump administration has sought to curtail the country's technological advances. Ms. Meng, who was for years the public face of the company, was detained in Canada in 2018 on an arrest warrant from the United States, where she faces charges of financial fraud related to evading sanctions against Iran.

Last week, Dr. Biden appointed Rory Brosius, a former Biden campaign adviser, as director for the Joining Forces initiative, a program supporting military families Dr. Biden started with Michelle Obama when she was first lady. Dr. Biden is also expected to push for free community college and raise awareness for breast cancer prevention, aides said.
Yeah. And I think in some ways, there's some positive lessons to be drawn from that time, because there were some significant accomplishments during that era.

We should definitely do that, in a very big and dramatic way. And I have proposals to help move us toward a better model of high school education. Only 6 percent of American high school students are in technical, trade or apprenticeship tracks. In Germany, that's 59 percent. Think about that gulf. Meanwhile, there are millions of those trade and middle-scale jobs that are left unfilled. Why is this?
AH: I mean, I don't think most people had.
Mr. Yang told Vox's Recode that one of the reasons he quit Venture for America, the nonprofit he created, was because he realized it couldn't achieve the change he wanted at the necessary scale. For instance, it had fallen short of the 100,000 jobs he set out for it to create.
If you want to solve the hyperacquisition problem, which is a problem, then you have to go in and say, Look, you have to not acquire businesses that are in your space with these criteria. That would be a legitimate stance to take, because right now the business model in Silicon Valley is not to try and outcompete the behemoth. It's just to get bought by them. If you get to a point where they'll offer you $1 billion and you win, your investors win, you're rich and then these get folded in, and it doesn't even matter what they do with your business at that point.
Mr. Newsom's agenda is likely to be costly, and thus likely to face obstacles as the new governor prepares to offer a new budget. Mr. Brown, among others, has warned that California is heading into a recession, and there are concerns in the business community and among some moderate Democrats that the former San Francisco mayor might take a decidedly different approach to spending than Mr. Brown.
Mr. Yang has frequently said that automation contributed heavily to Mr. Trump's win, because voters feel disaffected and worry that the futures of their jobs and industries are in jeopardy.
The Texas edition goes further to highlight criticism of federal efforts to subsidize the green energy industry: Republicans accuse the government of wasting taxpayers' money, for example by supporting the failed solar manufacturer Solyndra. The Solyndra controversy was a fixation for conservatives in 2011, when the company went bankrupt after accepting half a billion dollars in federally guaranteed loans.
By that time, which was 1969, Dr. Sandler was more than annoyed. She was good and mad. And that led her to become the driving force behind the creation of Title IX, the sweeping civil rights law of 1972 that barred sex discrimination by educational institutions that received federal funding.
Our best path forward with China is to try and have them continue to show restraint, but also see that the costs to human rights abuse is not just in Hong Kong, but with their ethnic minorities and the Muslim population of Uighurs, that the costs are higher than their perceived benefits of maintaining social order and stability. In order to have those costs feel real to the Chinese, we can't just moralize and say, Hey, do the right thing. Because at this point they're looking at us and saying like, Keep your opinions and value statements to yourselves.
DICK GREGORY at Carolines on Broadway (April 9-10, 7:30 p.m.). Mr. Gregory is both an immensely important stand-up comic and a prominent civil rights activist. A performer since the 1950s, he broke ground as the first African-American comedian to be called over to the couch for a conversation on The Tonight Show. He aimed his comedy at white Americans, pushing them to understand the black experience in America in the 1950s and '60s. Now 84, he continues to perform politically minded material.
To the millions of you just looking for a fighting chance in this economy, I promise you, we will not forget you. We understand what you're going through. We will never, ever give up. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday proposed a spending package to combat the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. The plan includes $1,400 direct payments to individuals and more generous unemployment benefits. Credit Credit... Amr Alfiky/The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday proposed a $1.9 trillion rescue package to combat the economic downturn and the Covid-19 crisis, outlining the type of sweeping aid that Democrats have demanded for months and signaling the shift in the federal government's pandemic response as Mr. Biden prepares to take office next week. The package includes more than $400 billion to combat the pandemic directly, including money to accelerate vaccine deployment and to safely reopen most schools within 100 days. An additional $350 billion would help state and local governments bridge budget shortfalls, while the plan would also include $1,400 direct payments to individuals, more generous unemployment benefits, federally mandated paid leave for workers and large subsidies for child care costs. During this pandemic, millions of Americans, through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck, Mr. Biden said in a speech to the nation on Tuesday evening. There is real pain overwhelming the real economy.
consistent with the decline in the odds of marriage between high school dropouts and those with more education since the 1970s, a period over which the real wages of men in this education group declined.
I have no idea how much, if any, X-rated material Mr. Ansari or his date consumes. Statistically, we know that modern men and women have access to every kind of explicit material, literally in their pockets. And they're watching: One recent study found that 79 percent of men and 76 percent of women between 18 and 30 look at pornographic websites at least once each month, while another showed that three out of 10 men in that age group were daily viewers.
The numbers. So keep in mind, I didn't just wake up and say, Hey, technology is changing the world. I spent seven years working in Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis, Baltimore and other cities that have been blasted by the waves of automation.

Court packing isn't a violation of any part of the Constitution, but it is widely debated with critics pointing out that it would trigger severe political backlash.
That is correct. But when I've dug into it, very, very few Americans are getting $1,000 in food stamps. And most of the people who are on government assistance live in fear of losing that assistance because there are various requirements that tend to come with it. And when, if you ask them, say, Hey, would you prefer $1,000 unconditional that you can rely upon, they actually think that's too good to be true.
Earmarking allows Congress to appropriate discretionary funds for specific projects. Mr. Yang supports them because he feels they allow representatives to generate revenue for their constituents to offset costs their area might experience from a given piece of legislation.
responded to the housing crisis with bailouts of the lenders and interlinked financial institutions, not of the folks losing their homes. And the stagnation of wages and income for the middle and bottom of the income distribution continued under Obama. And the various Covid aid packages, while they include payments to the unemployed, are also helping big businesses more than the small businesses that have been and will be permanently going out of business due to the lockdowns (and they include various forms of pork.
Well, one of the joys of running for president is you get to know incredible people on the trail, including some of the other contenders. I'm on the record saying I would prefer to have a female running mate. I think teams run better if you have men and women leaders at the highest possible levels. I joke, but it's mostly true, that if you get too many men alone for too long, we kind of become morons. So we need to keep that from happening at the highest levels.
Phillipa is infuriated by the older woman's refusal to divulge anything about her early life or ancestry, speculating that she is a Nazi in hiding, living in fear of being ushered to the gallows at Nuremberg. Later, over the course of a 60-page dream sequence, she imagines Bernadette as a teenager in occupied France, subjected to graphic sexual brutality by a Nazi soldier. The novel can't seem to decide whether this episode is a parable or a revenge fantasy, revealing something that runs much deeper and darker than mere extramarital passion.

Focus is crucial, and we do best when monotasking: Even disruptions of a few seconds can derail one's train of thought. Students process information better when they take notes — they don't just transcribe, as they do with laptops, but they think and record those thoughts. One study found that laptops or tablets consistently undermine exam performance by 1.7 percent (a significant difference in the context of the study). Other studies reveal that writing by hand helps memory retention. Screens block us from connecting, whether at dinner or in a classroom. Kelly McGonigal, a psychologist and lecturer at Stanford University, says that just having a phone on a table during a meal is sufficiently distracting to reduce empathy and rapport between two people.
The first enslaved Africans brought to this country came through Virginia's shores 400 years ago. The commonwealth passed Jim Crow era laws to prevent interracial marriage. Rather than following the Supreme Court's order to send white and black children to the same schools in the 1950s, some counties in the state closed school doors. And just two years ago, white supremacists marched in Charlottesville to violently protest the removal of a Confederate statue.
The cause was a heart attack, said Leonardo Pavkovic, Mr. Holdsworth's former manager.
I felt like I was a holding pattern until I got out of school, in terms of following my personal thread. But then in my last semester, one day I walked into the lunchroom and several people I knew but didn't like were all sitting together at the same table. It was an overwhelming experience to see them there. I couldn't control myself. I went up to painting class and I did a painting that really went beyond painting the model. It was a group of people that had sharp tongues and looked weird; it was not what you were supposed to paint in art school. That was the start of figuring out that I could paint what I wanted to paint, rather than what I was told to paint.
Reliable numbers are tough to find in Sperm World. Researchers cite data collected in the 1980s to estimate the number of children born by donor sperm in the United States at anywhere from 30,000 to 60,000 a year, though advocates push back even on that range, saying there are no dependable figures because there is no regulation. Sperm banking itself was about a $4 billion industry in 2018.

But I also noticed times when I mistook benevolence for selfishness, times when my motive was all about avoiding a difficult, but necessary, conversation. I struggled greatly to be honest with my husband about how I had developed intense feelings for another man. Once I finally spilled the truth, it opened up a conversation about our very different expectations of marriage — mine turned out to be very high, even though I hadn't fully acknowledged it. We navigated our way around unhelpful emotions like blame and found each other again, ultimately coming out stronger. But I never would have understood who I was inside my marriage without the conversations my honesty forced.
Wow, I love this question. There are many causes of poverty, and the fact that we're not able to put food into people's houses and on their tables is a structural problem. My campaign's based upon the premise that we're going through this profound economic transformation, the fourth industrial revolution. And one of the major problems is that we still pretend we're in the economy of the '70s or '80s.
At the airport in Bucharest, I was surrounded by customs officials. They said, 'You're dead,' he recalled with disbelief. I thought they were joking. I was the only one who didn't know. The people who escorted me off the plane knew, everyone knew except me.
I would see Shane every once in a while at the store, and I thought he was cute, said Ms. Monk, 43, of Shane Gerdes, an espresso machine repair technician. They met in 2007, when he was hired to work at the company warehouse across town. Espresso emergencies happen only so often. Crushes sometimes can't wait.
No, certainly not before the statements had taken place, and in terms of consequences, I would suggest that someone like Shane had probably paid a price in many ways. Like, aside from being fired, there are many circles that, if he shows up in, he'd be labeled very, very negatively. He reached out to me personally, and I had a conversation with him. The conversation with him made me feel more confident that I'd done the right thing. Because I think in many cases we're trying to follow up on a sense of shame and humiliation that the person might already feel.
This remarkable story is all too typical of how so many Jewish leaders throughout our history have reasoned about Jewish survival. Without tsuris--troubles--we will cease to be Jewish. We need to be persecuted, impoverished, discriminated against, hated, and victimized in order for us to retain our Jewishness. The chosen people must be denied choices if Judaism is to survive. If Jews are given freedom, opportunity, and choice, they will choose to assimilate and disappear.

My father's dubious acting career did influence, to the point where I wasn't going to be an actor. I was going to be a police officer, going into college. But it was an acting class in college that changed my mind back to acting because I felt I had an ability. But I think because of my father's struggles as a professional actor, I didn't set my sights on being a star. My dad needed to be a star, and anything less than that was failure. And so he experienced failure.
His death, in a hospital there, was announced by the Archdiocese of St. Andrews and Edinburgh, which he served as archbishop from 1985. He was chosen as a cardinal in 2003 by Pope John Paul II. He had broken his collarbone and injured his head in a fall last month, they said.

What are the true threats of the 21st century? Climate change is number one, and then cybersecurity and A.I., loose nuclear material, military drones in the hands of nonstate actors. It's very hard to secure a location from something the size of a flying vacuum cleaner. That's very, very difficult. So we're entering an era where it's going to be much easier to be offensive than defensive, and you don't need massive levels of resources to cause significant levels of damage. To me, a new aircraft carrier does not make our elections any more secure from Russian hacking, which is the most direct threat to our democracy upcoming in this cycle. We're spending money on the threats of the 20th century, and we need to try and modernize our approach as quickly as possible.

Mr. Bloomberg's campaign had seized the moment of chaos in the Democratic primary on Tuesday to stress a broader focus beyond Iowa and New Hampshire. Seeking to emphasize just how robust its infrastructure was little more than three months since Mr. Bloomberg became a candidate, the campaign said it had hired more than 2,100 staff members — 450 of them in battleground states like Pennsylvania.
One of the reasons why Donald Trump is our president is that millions of Americans feel like our government is unresponsive to our needs and the needs in our communities. They've been casting about for some sort of change agent for years. And it's not just Donald Trump's victory; it was Bernie Sanders outsized success. In some ways, it was even Obama's victory in 2008. If you remember that campaign, it was oh, hope, change. It was not, get the most experienced person in the seat as possible, because we are decades behind the curve in addressing the problems and challenges that are tearing us apart. Now ——
Mr. Koster remained oblivious to Ms. Ingraham's crush for more than a year, until she invited him to her house after an off-campus hangout with colleagues. I was like, 'You know what? You should come home with me,' she said. He told her she was drunk and said no, but that invitation set the wheels of romance in motion. After that, I finally got that she had been trying to hang out with me, he said.

Well, let me finish. If you're asking me if a white person, man or woman, would have done exactly what Mr. Brooks did, would they have been shot and possibly died from it? Yes. If they did exactly what it is, I believe that would have happened the same way. But the way you framed it is that if it was a white person, would they have been killed? You keep saying, would they have been killed? Mr. Brooks was killed because of actions that led up to it. The officer did not go out, again — and I don't know why we have to keep stressing this — he didn't go out to plan to kill Mr. Brooks or anybody that day. But the way you made it sound, if that was a white person — let's just go there — if that was a white person that did the exact same thing that Mr. Brooks did? Absolutely. They would have been shot. I don't know how to say that any clearer. But let's caveat that by saying with the exact same actions. But they've got to be the exact same actions. We have to be talking about the same situation and just switching the color.
Seldom coddling her, her husband proved hyperactive, happy as a nomad who was rarely at home for long periods. Yet despite some moments of tension, the marriage was an enduring and affectionate one. For a while Mrs. Lindbergh accompanied her husband on many of his trips--to the Caribbean, where he was laying out air routes; to Europe and to Asia. He had taught her to fly, and she learned to navigate and to operate a Morse Code radio. North to the Orient is her chronicle of one of these flights. Their first child, Charles Augustus 3d, was born June 24, 1930. Twenty months later, when Mrs. Lindbergh was pregnant with her second child, the baby was kidnapped from his nursery crib in his parent's home in Hopewell, N. J. The date was March 1, 1932. On May 12 the baby's body was found in a shallow grave not far from the house. In between, there was a bizarre hunt for the child that included payment of a $50,000 ransom at a cemetery in the Bronx and a cast of characters that ranged from Dr. John F. (Jafsie) Condon, a school principal, to Gaston B. Means, a swindler. There were false leads and sensations galore, through all of which Lindbergh bore himself with great public stoicism. His private emotions were never disclosed, and about the only references that he made in later years to the kidnapping and murder were fleeting mentions of that New Jersey business.

Top-heavy and buffeted by winds, the chugging old Pinto struggled. My traveling companion — a cat who refused to use the litter box on the back seat — was perched on my headrest, her claws gripping my scalp as eighteen-wheelers barreled past us in the dark. In the cassette player on the passenger seat, Paul Simon was singing Graceland. It is not too much to say that Graceland got me safely over Monteagle Mountain when I was in danger of going over the edge.
A judge late last month ordered the removal of the portraits ahead of Terrance Shipp Jr.'s Jan. 4 trial, ruling that the presence of the artwork, depicting judges who served in Fairfax County, could have suggested that the legal system is biased. The judge, David Bernhard of the Fairfax Circuit Court, wrote in his Dec. 20 opinion that the court was concerned the portraits might serve as unintended but implicit symbols that suggest the courtroom may be a place historically administered by whites for whites, and that others are thus of lesser standing. The display of portraits of judges in courtrooms of the Fairfax Courthouse is based on a non-racial principle, yet yields a racial result, he said.
But the overriding tenor of this documentary is triumphant and upbeat. Thomas's journey is intermittently visualized by footage from inside a boat as it makes its way through marshy wetlands before arriving, just as the sun is setting, at a sturdy dock.
In the history of creative duos, John Ahearn and Rigoberto Torres may not have name recognition — or money — but they have longevity. For almost 40 years the two artists have collaborated on life casts, making them from the South Bronx to Taiwan and from Brazil to Puerto Rico. Creatively, they are like John Lennon and Paul McCartney, sharing credit on life-size sculptures of famous and obscure people. Temperamentally, Mr. Torres can be reticent to the point of being more like George Harrison, the quiet Beatle.
KK: Oh, sorry, I just wanted to ask you, you know, there are some people who would suggest that a better use of money, instead of giving a Freedom Dividend, would be to dramatically overhaul America's high schools and start teaching people different skills instead of trying to continue the race against A.I. Why isn't that a path? Why couldn't we instead change how we do education in this country?
But for them the challenge is not even what's happening internally. The challenge is whether or not they can get developing countries on board with their technology standards to be able to roll them out internationally. So if you're a third party, let's say you're a developing country in Africa or Latin America, then you have a choice essentially between the global standard and the Chinese standard. And if you're the Chinese, you do not want a standard that only you are using over time, because that's going to curb your economic upside to all of the software that you're building. One of the reasons why our tech companies are so successful is that they export it to virtually the entire rest of the world, and China does not want to be in the opposite position.
Stephanie Kugler, an eighth-grade history teacher in West Sacramento, Calif., said she had expanded an idea mentioned briefly in her classroom's textbook, about women who dressed as men to fight in the Civil War and continued to live as men, into an entire lesson on troops who today would be considered transgender. The students read accounts of those soldiers' lives alongside more traditional sources, such as letters written by a black Union soldier and a Confederate soldier.
In an essay called On Pandering, which appeared in Tin House magazine in 2015, the novelist Claire Vaye Watkins wrote about the struggle to establish herself as a woman artist in the face of the patriarchy. It was, in part, a discussion of the way men, both well-intentioned and not, had consciously and subconsciously asserted their authority, but it was also an acknowledgment of her own complicity, her desire to pander to the male gaze. The essay was challenging, provocative and ultimately chilling in a the call is coming from inside the house sort of way. It put internalized misogyny on full display. It also became part of a larger conversation about divestment — from maleness, from whiteness, from straightness and thinness and cisgenderness — and how we might reconsider our assumptions about whose perspectives are worthy of literary treatment.
When I speak to older Jewish audiences, I am often accused, sometimes stridently, of minimizing anti-Semitism and am told that it is worse than ever. Social scientists call this dramatic disparity between the reality of declining anti-Semitism and the widespread belief that it is increasing a perception gap between what is actually happening and Jewish sensibilities. Some of the Jews who believe this are similar in this respect to some feminists and black activists I know, who insist that the plight of women and blacks is worse than it ever was. These good and decent people, whose identities are so tied up with their victimization, are incapable of accepting the good news that their situation is improving. It is not even a matter of perceiving the glass as half full or half empty. They see the glass as broken, even though it is intact and quickly filling up. As the sociologist Marshall Sklare puts it: American Jews respond more readily to bad news than to good news.

But the real thrill of this collection is its inevitable march into poetry, what Dickey called a magical arena. Gautreaux delivers a reliable, generous, surprising profusion of metaphors in each of these 21 stories. In one, a garage full of junk is slowly revealed as a stand-in for the mysteries of marriage. In another, a windshield breaks into a million diamonds, and the man recovering from the crash feels his mind come back to him changed, like a book dropped in the ocean and washed up on shore, all there, but slightly warped.
Thanks to the guards' ad hoc structure, the relationship between the Revolutionary Guards and Iraqi and Lebanese Shiite armed groups is a long and deep one. During my time in Lebanon and Iran, I met foreign militants who spent long stretches in Iran, for both work and pleasure. They spoke fluent Persian and fully understood the Revolutionary Guards ethos. The ties that bind many of these groups together include generations of marriage, commerce, history and culture. General Suleimani, as important as he was, was not singular.
This is what's so tough right now is that countries are trying to figure out what are the benefits of being an ally of the United States and doing what we want them to do, and then what are the costs. Unfortunately that calculation is going against us more and more. Turkey's relationship with the U.S. has been stronger than our relationship with many other countries in that region. I think we should invest in that relationship if we're going to be able to accomplish any of our goals there. And that includes, to me, being a little bit more accommodating about behaviors that we might find objectionable or troubling from them than we might from another country.
When William Blake Hoffman, an architect and designer at Architecture, Incorporated in Reston, Va., matched with Mr. Hanson on Tinder in September 2018, he didn't have grand visions of romance. Mr. Hoffman had moved to Washington a couple of years earlier, for what he intended to be only a few years. He didn't plan to plant roots. So he suggested to Mr. Hanson that they meet for a drink at a beer garden located right on Mr. Hoffman's way home from work. It was a Wednesday night.
So for a high school graduate in America to get by, if you have one health problem or car breakdown, it can take a very tenuous financial situation and send it in a downward spiral. Then how do you put food on the table? In theory, there are nonprofits and food pantries that would see to this, but we all know that they're dramatically underresourced relative to the need. And so when you look at the causes of food poverty, to me the best solution is instead of trying to create organizations that will put food into people's hands, which we should do obviously, we should just put money into Americans' hands and then they would be able to procure food to provide for themselves and their families.
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — The ancient cemetery of Makli, near the city of Thatta in Sindh Province, is one of the largest necropolises in the world, so rich in monuments that UNESCO declared it a World Heritage site.
Note meant n.o.d.--notification of death. In other words, he wanted me to go tell somebody that somebody close had died. That somebody they loved had died: This was already clear, from his voice. And died suddenly. And violently. I considered. I could have said, I don't do that anymore (though Asset Forfeiture, in fact, is hardly corpse-free). And then we might have had one of those bullshit TV conversations, with him saying You got to help me out and Mike, I'm begging you, and me saying Forget it and No way and Dream on, pal, until everyone is bored blind and I finally come across. I mean, why say no when you have to say yes? For things to proceed. So I just said, again: Well, let's hear it.

No, I give a numerical value to — Number one is the story. I give it from one to five on the value of just the story. Did it move me? Was it important? Did it resonate? Did it stay with me? From there, I go to the written word, which I separate from the story. Because you can have a great story, and you read it, and it's like, oh, I don't think the writer really got it. So I have to give that a separate rating. And the third thing is the character because I truly believe that it's the story and the power of the written word first that inspires a character. And I say this with all great respect to Meryl. I say, if you gave Meryl Streep C-level material, she could get it to a B. Her ability is unbelievable.
It was tough to fight those battles.
This is not just a timely topic but a timeless one. (Kathy Bates's Joan Blondell points this out in one of the show's 1978 interview segments: Any film starring women that makes money will be treated as a fluke by the Boys Club.) We're seeing a situation like that right now with Hidden Figures, the best picture nominee that is still in theaters months after it opened and has box-office receipts far exceeding those of X-Men: Apocalypse and Star Trek Beyond, according to a recent report by The Wrap. Will the success of Hidden Figures be treated as a fluke? Or will it spur a paradigm shift in terms of business decisions? Money talks. The Boys Club would do well to listen.
Ms. Hecht affords Esther pragmatic sympathy. But this is not Esther's play. At one point Solomon tells her, Darling, why don't you leave it to the boys? and The Price treats her with a similar condescension, sidelining her in her pert pink suit while the brothers argue, stranding her with domestic concerns while they debate moral philosophy.
Well, one of the joys of running for president is you get to know incredible people on the trail, including some of the other contenders. I'm on the record saying I would prefer to have a female running mate. I think teams run better if you have men and women leaders at the highest possible levels. I joke, but it's mostly true, that if you get too many men alone for too long, we kind of become morons. So we need to keep that from happening at the highest levels.
I am attracted to characters that are somewhat damaged, I suppose. Those are the most interesting, dramatic characters that I see, as long as you get a sense that they have some level of humanity. Otherwise, they're unrelatable. You could play a really dastardly character, a vicious killer, but you still need to find threads of humanity to where the audience understands or believes that part of you. That makes it more devastating, to me, about a human being gone wrong.
Representative Henry J. Hyde, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who himself saw a past affair come to light as he presided over the House's nine-week impeachment inquiry, said: Infidelity, adultery is not a public act, it's a private act, and the Government, the Congress, has no business intruding into private acts.
Created as a brainchild of Senator Elizabeth Warren as part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, the consumer bureau was made largely ineffectual after Mr. Trump appointed Mick Mulvaney to run it as interim chair. He pledged to run the agency with humility and prudence and requested no funding from the Federal Reserve. Kathy Kraninger, who took over as director of the agency in 2018, has been lambasted by Democrats for undermining the bureau, which they have accused of denying consumers of millions of dollars in relief. Democrats have been pressuring Ms. Kraninger to resign or face being fired. In June, the Supreme Court ruled the president has the power to remove the C.F.P.B. director before his or her five-year term is up. Matthew Goldstein, Lauren Hirsch and
Since 2012, scientists based in New York and experts at the Munch Museum in Oslo have been working on this canvas — which was stolen in 2004 and recovered two years later — to tell a story of color. But the research also provides insight into Munch and how he worked, laying out a map for conservators to prevent further change, and helping viewers and art historians understand how one of the world's most widely recognized paintings might have originally looked.

Mr. Bauman wrote scores of books and taught for many years at the University of Leeds, in England. He became a scholar to be reckoned with relatively late in his career. A major success came in 1989, at age 64, when he published a landmark study, Modernity and the Holocaust. Against the widespread view that the Holocaust reflected an anti-Semitic madness that had seized civilized Germany and thrown it back into an atavistic state, Mr. Bauman described the genocide as an all-too-characteristic creature of the modern era.
JW: And let me just, one last follow-up on that. If Democrats don't take back the Senate, how do you feel with the Supreme Court — how do you, I mean, put aside expanding the number of justices, how do you even get a justice onto the court in the first place?

Before the mob breached the Capitol, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, overseeing the certification of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory and debate over a Republican effort to subvert those results in certain states, admonished Republicans for having too many people on the floor and for some objectors refusing to wear masks as they spoke. As the 117th Congress reconvened a week ago, multiple lawmakers tested positive for the coronavirus after taking their oath. Late Wednesday, one Republican, Representative Jake LaTurner of Kansas, received positive test results after voting on the House floor to overturn Arizona's results and did not return for a second vote early Thursday. It was unclear where Mr. LaTurner was sheltering in place as the mob tried to break into the House chamber, but in a statement issued shortly before 3 a.m. on Thursday, his office said he was not experiencing symptoms. Because lawmakers qualified for early access to the coronavirus vaccine, many have received at least one shot of a two-dose vaccine, with some receiving both doses. Some congressional aides have been authorized to receive the two-dose vaccine.

Conservatives have fought for schools to promote patriotism, highlight the influence of Christianity and celebrate the founding fathers. In a September speech, President Trump warned against a radical left that wants to erase American history, crush religious liberty, indoctrinate our students with left-wing ideology.
I think his power was determination. He's faced with the idea of his demise within two years. He has a son with special needs. He as a child on the way and a wife, and he has no means of supporting them. When he's on his way out, his body will diminish. His wife will have to wipe his drool and empty his bedpan. His children will only know him as that skinny, sickly man in the other bedroom, and then he's gone. And that's just not what he wants. So his determination to change the text of his life was what drove him. And then what he discovers, purely accidentally, is that he's really good at it, and his ego came in and took control. You played the clip where he says, Say my name — and you're goddamn right. He's now fully embraced with that new persona. It was dormant within him, apparently, and that had awakened.
Railsback and Walter Flowers, a Democrat, basically created the coalition that was necessary to make the House Judiciary Committee vote a bipartisan one, Michael Koncewicz, the author of They Said No to Nixon: Republicans Who Stood Up to the President's Abuses of Power (2018), wrote in an email.

Kothari's novel plays out a dark fantasy. The narrator, Simeen, has a husband who is terminally ill. When an old friend moves in with the couple to help out, a flame is rekindled between wife and friend. In the hands of another novelist, the husband's illness could function as a simple narrative device, moving him offstage at the convenient moment and allowing Simeen's romance with their friend, Zayaan, to proceed blamelessly. But Kothari takes the story in an unexpected direction, forcing her characters to contemplate the idea of sustained romantic commitment outside the boundaries of monogamous love instead.
Before the six of them — damaged and desperate — shoehorn into Miranda's Chevette and head up to West Virginia in time for Jodi's first appointment with her parole officer, Jodi tells Ricky, Whatever you want for a new life, bring it here with you in the morning. But the new life they're all fleeing toward is harsh, and its margins so tight that a welfare benefits card counts as a major asset.
So for a high school graduate in America to get by, if you have one health problem or car breakdown, it can take a very tenuous financial situation and send it in a downward spiral. Then how do you put food on the table? In theory, there are nonprofits and food pantries that would see to this, but we all know that they're dramatically underresourced relative to the need. And so when you look at the causes of food poverty, to me the best solution is instead of trying to create organizations that will put food into people's hands, which we should do obviously, we should just put money into Americans' hands and then they would be able to procure food to provide for themselves and their families.

If these are your measurements, then of course you're going to think things are going in one direction, while your way of life disintegrates. Even the inventor of G.D.P., Simon Kuznets, said 100 years ago, this is a terrible measurement of national well-being, and we should never use it as that.
Fesen's story -- of having his vocation acknowledged by someone else before he knew it himself -- is one you hear repeatedly from seminarians, many of whom fell away from the church at some point in their lives. Michael Dobbins, 32, a husky, mirthful deacon from Arlington and therefore a D.B., or diocesan brother, to Bashista, had the sort of childhood that might have resulted in a fairly direct journey to the priesthood in a prior era. I played Mass as a kid, he says. My sisters were the altar boys. My dad had this old copper chalice for his beer on football Sundays, so I used that. And Wonder Bread, something white, you'd press it down flat and use a glass to cut a circle out. I wasn't very clear on the vestments, so I used a big bedspread. In college, though, Dobbins stopped going to a Catholic church and began attending a Baptist church instead, where he became involved with a Baptist woman. At one point in college, he was briefly engaged. In my last year, he recounts, I was reading my Bible, and I got to John 6. At the end it says, 'And some of his disciples no longer followed him.' I'd read that a thousand times before, but something in that passage hit me like a big brick. And I was like, holy cow -- that's me. I cried like a baby.
La Sirena's décor plays off the '60s architecture with a retro flair. This could be a Fellini set, right? Look at that floor, look at that lighting, look at the Caesarstone walls, says Batali, surveying the restaurant from the corner of its expansive bar. (Batali has admitted that La Sirena's opulence had a high price: Originally set to open months ago, the restaurant ballooned millions over budget.) This is a different beast for us, he says. Serving all the way through the day is something that is going to give us more fun to play around with. Eventually we'll have a high tea in the afternoon. The world has changed a lot, and we're embracing it. Batali is also considering limiting meals to the tables, except for a cart that carries salami, Cravero Parmigiano Reggiano and marinated olives. I like the idea of a stand-alone bar, because if I'm at a hotel, I don't want to be aced out by 34 seats of people eating their dinner. I want to go have drinks.
Almost certainly, yes. And you saw it a little bit with Barack Obama where he tapped Joe Biden in part because Joe had very deep relationships on Capitol Hill. If you had another outsider like me, we'd still be trying to figure out who to call. So, you need to have folks who have deep relationships on Capitol Hill from day one.

It was one of those rare instances for me as an actor where what I say as the character very much overlapped with what I believe as a person myself. And so I felt a lot of the emotions I imagine Seretse Khama would have felt. We shot it in Botswana in front of a Botswana crowd, a lot of whom would know who Seretse Khama was. So in some ways, it's a real test to play this leader who means so much to them and to convince them both within the film and as real people who see me as an actor not from Botswana.

As a critical voice on the bench, she's showing all our children what's possible. Justice Sotomayor, who was confirmed to the Supreme Court in 2009, swore in Joseph R.

In 2017, Mr. Booker announced his support for the Medicare for All Act drafted by Senator Bernie Sanders, and reiterated his support in an interview after he announced his candidacy Friday, saying I signed up and am a big believer in Medicare for all. But as a senator from New Jersey who had received millions in campaign contributions from the pharmaceutical industry, Mr. Booker had been reluctant to focus regulatory efforts on the industry, voting against a measure in 2017 that would have greatly reduced drug prices by allowing imports from Canada. He has since reversed course, announcing his support this year for Mr. Sanders's bill to rein in prescription drug costs.

Mr. Biden's ability to steer and stay the course calmly through turbulence is a testament, say friends and family, to both Mr. Biden's unabashed optimism and his deep belief in the importance of American political norms and traditions. The man who came to Washington at age 30 as one of the youngest senators in history now enters the White House as the oldest president in history, with more experience in government and legislating to guide his path than any leader in decades.
I have no idea how much, if any, X-rated material Mr. Ansari or his date consumes. Statistically, we know that modern men and women have access to every kind of explicit material, literally in their pockets. And they're watching: One recent study found that 79 percent of men and 76 percent of women between 18 and 30 look at pornographic websites at least once each month, while another showed that three out of 10 men in that age group were daily viewers.
For years, population experts have warned that demographic trends in South Korea, like those in Japan, show declining growth — a bad signal for replenishing the labor force and caring for retirees and other older people as they become a larger share of society. The new data from South Korea, while not a surprise, were nonetheless concerning for a country that in recent decades has become one of Asia's economic and cultural dynamos.

In her richly detailed and propulsive biography of Elizabeth and her sister Emily Blackwell, Janice P. Nimura considers and discards a couple of possible origin stories. The most narratively appealing is 17-year-old Elizabeth's experience caring for her father on his deathbed, in which it is tempting to discern … the germ of her medical future. Tempting, but too easy. No single story convincingly explains why a young woman enthralled by literature and philosophy should plummet into the earthy business of bodies.
I have more than four years of aviation behind me. I've barnstormed over half of the 48 states. I've flown my mail through the worst of nights. There had been two previous Atlantic flights--both in 1919, the first when one of three Navy craft flew from Newfoundland to the Azores; and the second when John Alcock and Arthur Brown made it from Newfoundland to Ireland. But no one had made the crossing alone, or from continent to continent. Once he conceived the notion of the flight, Lindbergh, with characteristic energy, began to elaborate the details. He helped design the plane to his specifications, calculating every ounce that went into it. He laid out his route. Every foreseeable circumstance was checked out. Two elements could not be figured: the weather and his ability to stay awake. With the weather he took a calculated risk. Fighting off sleep proved a problem, and only his indomitable determination overcame that, although he conceded there were moments of touch-and-go. One of the attractions for the Paris flight was a $25,000 prize, for which there were several competitors, among them Clarence Chamberlin and Adm. Richard E. Byrd. Lindbergh, though, was confident he could be first and be successful. He was motivated, he told this writer in later years, by a desire to improve his standing as a pilot as well as by an eagerness to win the prize.
With their identical dresses and hairdos, synchronized movements and sweetly innocent voices, the McGuire Sisters — Christine, Dorothy and Phyllis — were the musical embodiment of popular culture in their day, singing for audiences who watched Your Hit Parade on television and listened to Perry Como, Patti Page and the lingering postwar strains of the big band era.

A priest is called to be an alter Christus, to stand in the Person of Christ and perform the sacraments, through which grace is conferred by God. Nowadays, though, the distance between the Catholic priesthood and the surrounding culture has given it a near occult mystique. As America hurtles forward unblinkingly into the consumer-driven, technological and environmental unknown, the Catholic priesthood remains becalmed in a zone of otherworldly preoccupations relatively unbuffeted by present-day vicissitudes. Today, as, say, 500 years ago, a man -- and only a man -- who senses he has a vocation, or a call from God to the priesthood, hands over his life irrevocably to the church, promising celibacy and obedience. Now, as centuries ago, he answers to the bishop of his diocese, celebrates the Mass, performs the sacraments and, if he has been appointed a pastor, oversees and maintains the solvency of his parish. (A religious-order priest like a Franciscan or Jesuit makes an additional promise of poverty, and commits his life to his religious community and its particular mission.) In exchange for these sacrifices, a diocesan priest typically receives from his diocese a room, board, a place to retire when he is too old or sick to serve any longer and around $10,000 a year. It is perhaps not surprising that in contemporary America, with its focus on individualism and personal achievement, not to speak of wealth, the number of men seeking out this sort of existence has plummeted.
Oh, you could be on that.

4.48 is an adaptation of the final work by Sarah Kane, the British playwright who died in 1999. A fragmented, incantatory immersion in clinical depression, filled with descriptions of psychotropic drugs, sets of numbers, angry rants and stark wordplay, the script specifies neither characters nor precise plot, nor even the number of performers.
Proust never refers to his Jewish origins in his fiction, although in the youthful novel he abandoned, Jean Santeuil (first published only in 1952, thirty years after his death), there is a very striking, if buried, reference to Judaism. The autobiographical hero has quarreled with his parents and in his rage deliberately smashed a piece of delicate Venetian glass his mother had given him. When he and his mother are reconciled, he tells her what he has done: He expected that she would scold him, and so revive in his mind the memory of their quarrel. But there was no cloud upon her tenderness. She gave him a kiss, and whispered in his ear: `It shall be, as in the Temple, the symbol of an indestructible union.' This reference to the rite of smashing a glass during the Orthodox Jewish wedding ceremony, in this case sealing the marriage of mother to son, is not only spontaneous but chilling. In an essay about his mother he referred, with characteristic ambiguity, to the beautiful lines of her Jewish face, completely marked with Christian sweetness and Jansenist resignation, turning her into Esther herself--a reference, significantly, to the heroine of the Old Testament (and of Racine's play), who concealed her Jewish identity until she had become the wife of King Ahasuerus and was in a position to save her people. The apparently gentile Proust, who had campaigned for Dreyfus and had been baptized Catholic, was a sort of modern Esther.

In 1990, 12 European countries had some form of a wealth tax, while today only three have kept the policy — Norway, Spain and Switzerland. Reports by the O.E.C.D. and others have found that the tax led to an exodus of the wealthy and didn't raise as much revenue as anticipated.

Our best path forward with China is to try and have them continue to show restraint, but also see that the costs to human rights abuse is not just in Hong Kong, but with their ethnic minorities and the Muslim population of Uighurs, that the costs are higher than their perceived benefits of maintaining social order and stability. In order to have those costs feel real to the Chinese, we can't just moralize and say, Hey, do the right thing. Because at this point they're looking at us and saying like, Keep your opinions and value statements to yourselves.

Studying him, of course, can have a disastrous effect on a young writer, who either comes under the influence of Proust's dangerously idiosyncratic and contagious style or who feels that Proust has already done everything possible in the novel form. Even Walter Benjamin, who became Proust's German translator, wrote the philosopher Theodor Adorno that he did not want to read one more word by Proust than was actually necessary for him to translate because otherwise he would become addictively dependent, which would be an obstacle to his own production.
But of course what it really sounds like is this, Abigail says, interrupting. When we then hear it unmusicalized, as clashing lines of dialogue, it's just awful chaos.
The Catholic Church saw itself as embattled against the rest of the world and tried to recruit its converts as polemicists, but they, more often than not, retained heavy intellectual debts to their Protestant past and could not repudiate their personal and intellectual heritage. Paradoxically, then, Catholicism was both totally different from its rivals and yet, at the same time, remarkably continuous with them. It was a paradox that frequently caused friction between the new and old Catholics.
The later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries showed unmistakably that the Catholic Church had decided to climb out of the river of contemporary intellectual life rather than swim along in midstream, despite the hopes of Newman, Brownson, Hecker, and many other converts. The papal hammer fell frequently on efforts to modernize Catholic thinking, an enterprise in which converts were often closely involved. For example, Pope Pius IX (1846-1878) issued the Syllabus of Errors in 1864, condemning many of the principles upon which contemporary scientists, social scientists, and biblical critics outside the Catholic Church were then working. It concluded by condemning the proposition that the Roman Pontiff can and ought to reconcile himself to, and come to terms with, progress, liberalism, and modern civilization. The condemnation brought the work of several convert intellectuals under scrutiny, and it discouraged them from showing the consonance of their work with contemporary philosophy and science. Among the converts affected was the English evolutionary biologist St. George Mivart, who was ultimately excommunicated for his assertion that the Catholic doctrine of hell was untenable. The seemingly antiintellectual animus of the syllabus also disillusioned some converts, among them Thomas Arnold, who reverted to Anglicanism when he learned of it.
Blythe's postpartum experience is familiar, and Audrain renders it flawlessly.

Blythe struggles to adapt to motherhood and she sees seismic shifts in her relationship to her husband, Fox. Noticeably absent is any sense of joy or wonder. I was so disappointed she was mine, Blythe says of Violet. She admits to ignoring her baby's cries for hours on end.

The great Colette completely failed to sense his value when she first ran into Proust (they were both very young and just starting out as writers). She'd even gone so far, in one of her early Claudine novels, as to call him a yid (youpin), but her husband urbanely crossed out the insult and replaced it with boy (garcon). Even cleaned up, the passage doesn't make for very pleasant reading. It states that at a literary salon, I was pursued, politely, all evening by a young and pretty boy of letters. Because of her cropped hair, unusual for the period, he kept comparing her to the young god Hermes or to a cupid drawn by Prud'hon. My little flatterer, excited by his own evocations, wouldn't leave me alone for a second.... He gazed at me with caressing, long-lashed eyes.... At the same time, in 1895, she wrote Proust a letter in which she acknowledged that he had recognized a crucial truth: The word is not a representation but a living thing, and it is much less a mnemonic sign than a pictorial translation.
If you run an organization, imagine having an organization that has the wrong measurements. How is that organization going to fare over time? That is where we are in the United States of America right now. We're riding a century-old measurement off a cliff, while our way of life deteriorates underneath our feet. If you looked at levels of anxiety, stress, mental health, depression, suicides, drug overdoses, you would see that we're in a mental health recession or depression, we're in a wellness or life expectancy recession or depression, and the corporate profits are going to keep on going up, because in the 21st-century economy, companies can do very, very well while not hiring a lot of people, not treating them as full-time employees, and they don't need to care what happens in their own backyard because they sell everywhere.
An article on Monday about Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's assistance in roadside emergencies misidentified the hurricane in Puerto Rico for which he helped in recovery efforts. It was Hurricane Maria, not Hurricane Irene.
Wow, these questions are really fun. Who's broken my heart?

Well, I'm all about trying to improve the reality on the ground, to the extent that we can actually put resources and funds to work in communities to make sure that women have access to reproductive rights in clinics. Certainly any way we can make sure that there aren't any obstacles to the funding of Planned Parenthood clinics around the country. I would take those actions immediately. A lot of the legislative actions, you need a bit more time and a bit more buy-in from Congress, but at the Supreme Court level, I would consider appointing more justices if it was necessary to safeguard women's reproductive rights.
Well, Mr. Hanson said, I read in The New York Times that it's the No. 1 place to live, if you're a gay man, to meet people. That's why I'm applying here.
BANGKOK — An American woman who has been living in Bali during the pandemic was deported on Thursday after she praised the Indonesian island as queer friendly and offered to help foreigners enter the country despite its coronavirus travel ban.
Let me explain. I'm a parent. I've got — how many of you all are parents? So if your kids are like my kids, they are mesmerized by any screen that is nearby. I regularly challenge my kids. I say, What's more important? People or screens? And they know the right answer's people. And then if they say screens, then I hold them upside down by their ankles until they say, People, people. And the people that are most diligent about screen time are the tech folks in Silicon Valley. You go there, and all of a sudden there's not a screen to be had because they know that we have the smartest engineers in the country turning supercomputers into dopamine delivery devices for kids, because that's how they make their millions of dollars.
But the pandemic has altered his timeline — and in a surprising way.
Democrats and progressives will be so thrilled to have defeated Donald Trump, they will love the fact that we're going to put buying power into families' hands, make children stronger and healthier. But here's the great thing: The Republicans will look up and say, Wait a minute, do I hate the Freedom Dividend? And they look up, and they notice only one state's had a dividend for almost 40 years, and it's Alaska, a deep red conservative state, that was passed by a Republican governor.
I commented to one of my team members, I feel like running for president is at least a glimpse into what it's like to be a professional woman because I feel like I care about my appearance more now than I ever did. And there are people that are always like looking after ——
A Times evaluation of Mr. Yang's tax plan by N. Gregory Mankiw, professor of economics at Harvard, found that Mr. Yang's tax plan would target the affluent who spend their money lavishly while incentivizing people to save.
Silvera went in to bag the weapon. Then the crime-lab techs would get her prints and measure distances and take many photographs. And then the ME would come and roll her. And then pronounce her.
Finally getting the nerve to ask Mandy what it was like to be in 'The Princess Bride' was one of the greatest moments of my life, he said. It took me six years to finally ask, I was so nervous.
How do you see TV changing in the next decade? And what are you worried about, and what are you looking forward to?
I feel like you want something from me, remarks Kate (Cara Seymour), welcoming yet wary. At 50, Kate is no longer an actor and is facing financial and other crises of her own. As is Isaac (John Ortiz), a playwright and the third member of their former theater group. With a teetering marriage and vague future, the gentle Isaac could have seemed a mere go-between for his two circling friends; but Mr. Ortiz is so quietly compelling that he makes Isaac's modest ambitions feel improbably consequential.
Our best path forward with China is to try and have them continue to show restraint, but also see that the costs to human rights abuse is not just in Hong Kong, but with their ethnic minorities and the Muslim population of Uighurs, that the costs are higher than their perceived benefits of maintaining social order and stability. In order to have those costs feel real to the Chinese, we can't just moralize and say, Hey, do the right thing. Because at this point they're looking at us and saying like, Keep your opinions and value statements to yourselves.
Our economy is breaking down on all levels. Again, if you are fortunate enough to graduate from college today, you're in the top third of the population, you're graduating with tens of thousands in school loans very, very often, and there's a 40 to 44 percent chance you're going to do a job that does not require your college degree. That's if you're one of the winners in our society today. I spent seven years working with, frankly, some of the top educational products in our country. I saw that even the winners are not winning right now. And so imagine if you're a nonwinner, what this looks like.
Yeah, that's it. What would you do if you felt that your child was under mortal threat? Would you voluntarily become a criminal?
Public opinion was bitterly divided between the leftist Dreyfusards, who demanded justice and truth, and the anti-Dreyfusards, who led an anti-Semitic campaign, defended the honor of the army, and rejected the call for a retrial. The conflict led to a virtual civil war. In 1899 Dreyfus was found guilty again, although this time under extenuating circumstances--and the president pardoned him. Only in 1906 was Dreyfus fully rehabilitated, named an officer once again, and decorated with the Legion of Honor. Interestingly, Theodor Herzl, the Paris correspondent for a Viennese newspaper, was so overwhelmed by the virulent anti-Semitism of the Dreyfus Affair that he was inspired by the prophetic idea of a Jewish state.
Mr. Trump likes to say that the economy has reached historic highs under his administration. However, life expectancy has been falling and other measures of well-being have declined, including rising rates of depression diagnosis.
A progressive tax is one in which the rate increases with income, while a regressive tax increases inversely with income.
It led, among other things, to his being called a Fascist sympathizer, particularly when he declined a suggestion in 1942 to repudiate it; and the medal plagued his reputation for the rest of his life. He disdained the criticism, however, saying: Personally, I am not at all concerned about any damage that may have been done to my reputation by the presentation of the medal. I felt the throwing back of the medal was like taking part in a child's spitting contest. If I must fight, I'll fight; but I prefer not to spit at my enemy beforehand. Also, I felt Goering had given me the medal with good intent and in friendship. Regardless of how much I disagreed with him about other things, or later on, I did not want to throw it back in his face. Nonetheless, Lindbergh, in his later years, was defensive in reciting the medal episode and sensitive in having it known that his wife was among his critics. Like most people, Lindbergh was a bundle of unresolved contradictions. Stubborn, proud, unable to see how Jews might be offended by obvious facts, blind to the villainies of Hitlerism, he was, in his relationships with his few close friends, a considerate, delightful, sensitive, helpful, unpretentious person who did not obtrude his social and political views, nor make agreeing with them a condition of steadfast friendship. Although he was the object of much flattery and one who succumbed to some of it, he did not like a fuss made over him.
The difference between economic winners and losers, captured by income inequality, poverty, and illiteracy rates within the dominant white ethnicity, is much greater than in most other Western countries, and there is no dense welfare state safety net to buffer the fall of people into unemployment and poverty.
HURDER I'm terrified, because my show is so physically demanding. I am concerned about what that's going to be like when I go back. I guess we're going to find out.
Raskin, lead impeachment prosecutor, says Trump is guilty of 'the most serious presidential crime' in U.S. history. Representative Jamie Raskin, center, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi at a meeting of House impeachment managers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times Representative Jamie Raskin, the Maryland Democrat who will lead the prosecution of President Trump in a Senate trial, vigorously defended the impeachment effort on Sunday, arguing that Mr. Trump needed to be held accountable even after he leaves office for his role in inciting a mob of loyalists that culminated in a deadly riot and the first occupation of the Capitol in two centuries. This was the most serious presidential crime in the history of the United States of America — the most dangerous crime by a president ever committed against the United States, Mr. Raskin, a constitutional law professor, said on CNN's State of the Union. Everything is due to his actions. Mr. Raskin took on the high-profile role of lead impeachment manager this month soon after burying his 25-year-old son, Tommy, who died by suicide on New Year's Eve. I'm not going to lose my son at the end of 2020 and lose my country and my republic in 2021, Mr. Raskin told CNN's Jake Tapper, as he delivered a heartfelt eulogy. Another of the nine impeachment managers, Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, said on ABC's This Week that the team would not need much lead time to move forward with a Senate trial.
But at the same time, in order to have someone at that level of relationship, you need to have as much trust as possible and I'm still developing that kind of relationship with some of the other, not just candidates, but also people who could be running mates that are not currently running.
On their second date, another park walk followed by queso at a nearby restaurant, Ms. Cheever, who works as an attorney at Kirkland & Ellis in Manhattan, mentioned that her birthday was the next day.
Southern whites resisted Reconstruction, according to a McGraw-Hill textbook, because they did not want African-Americans to have more rights. But the Texas edition offers an additional reason: Reforms cost money, and that meant higher taxes.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, like Mr. Yang, has argued that the country's approach to antitrust regulation is outmoded. In early 2019, the Federal Trade Commission created a new task force focused on monitoring competition in technology markets, which the foundation celebrated as a step toward modernizing antitrust.
The court, however, found that the government took the right steps to introduce the sweeping program, provided the public enough information, and did not coerce people to register.
The editorial board recently called for the Trump administration to break the impasse on funding for the proposed rail tunnel under the Hudson River in an editorial titled: Build the Donald J. Trump Tunnel. The vital infrastructure project has stalled because of political infighting.
As a writer, I understand the absurdity of trying to place restrictions on what can and can't be written about. Keats defined negative capability as an artist's ability to transmute an experience or idea into art even if she hasn't experienced it herself; without it, we'd have no historical fiction, no Madame Bovary, no Martian Chronicles.
JI: In that system, a lot of that money didn't actually go to treating tobacco-related health problems. A lot of it went to shoring up state budgets, and some of them even went to the tobacco industry actually, so I don't know if that's the best model.
The muddled ballet, choreographed by Krzysztof Pastor, opened at the David H. Koch Theater on Wednesday, presented by the Joyce Theater Foundation; it comes to dancing life through the lens of 20th-century Italian politics. On Thursday, a mixed bill, featuring works by Yuri Possokhov, Myles Thatcher and Christopher Wheeldon — an all-too typical array of male ballet choreographers — didn't wash away the sense that this is a company in need of an identity.
Mr. Lownes had a heart attack at his New Year's Eve celebration and died in the hospital after a second heart attack, Glenn Young, a book publisher and longtime friend, said.

Lawmakers may have been exposed to the coronavirus while sheltering during the Capitol riot, a doctor says. Members of the House of Representatives leaving the floor on Wednesday. Credit... J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press While sheltering in a secure location as a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday, House lawmakers may have been exposed to someone who was infected with the coronavirus, Congress's Office of the Attending Physician said on Sunday. In an email sent to lawmakers, Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician, said that while the time in this room was several hours for some and briefer for others, during that period, individuals may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infection. He told lawmakers to obtain a P.C.R. test as a precaution and continue taking preventive steps against the spread of the virus. Congress has long struggled to stem the spread of the virus within its ranks, with mixed guidance and a delayed testing regimen. Dozens of lawmakers, staff members and reporters took shelter in the secure room on Wednesday, but a handful of Republicans refused to wear masks, one person there said, even as Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester, Democrat of Delaware, tried to pass out masks.
No, because the taser isn't considered unusable after the two shots. The taser also has a method or a way to use it in a drive-stun situation. And what that means is you can actually walk up to a person — like the old stun guns that arc in between and you used to touch people with them — the taser still has that effect. So it's still an active weapon.
The Obama administration named Mr. Yang a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship in 2015 and a Champion of Change in 2012.

People who study marriage, or work with couples in therapy, as I do, talk about the need for a we story, a collaboration between partners about values and goals. But if couples are going to collaborate, they have to figure out how to have a productive conversation. A conversation — as opposed to parallel monologues — involves two people who are making an effort to understand each other. In the grip of strong emotion, productive conversation can be surprisingly hard.
All right, perfect. That's a perfect way to end. Mr, Cranston, thank you so much for doing this. It was a really fascinating conversation.
JW: You remember what happened the last time a president tried to do this, right?
Mr. Yang has said most Americans don't want to work for the federal government and argued that his Freedom Dividend would therefore be more effective than a program like a federal jobs guarantee.
These papers and transcripts were put together piecemeal over a period of four weeks. I apologize also for any inconsistencies in the tenses (hard to avoid, when writing about the recently dead) and for the informalities in the dialogue presentation. And I guess I apologize for the outcome. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
MG: So, if you become president, what government secret are you most excited to learn about?
Manhattan, Woody Allen's cinematic love letter to his hometown, was released in 1979 and nominated for two Academy Awards the following year. But you would think it belonged to the 2018 awards season, given how much it is being quoted and discussed these days.
KK: For millions of Americans, church and religion are the centers of their communities. Do you believe in God? Do you go to church regularly? Who are your spiritual advisers?
JI: I actually really quickly want to go back to a question that Binya was asking you. You said, you gave us the example of parents with two kids and you're on food stamps and you're worried about your kids' future. And at the end of that explanation, you said that you are not for curtailing social supports, but isn't your plan such that, that mother, aside from what the kids would get in the future, that mother would have to choose between the food stamps and the actual U.B.I., right? Is that correct?
KK: Do you feel like President Obama achieved the change that he had promised in the 2008 campaign?
'ABOUT ALICE' at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center (in previews; opens on Jan. 20). Based on what The New York Times Book Review called a slim but walloping book, this Theater for a New Audience play by Calvin Trillin relates his long, fine romance with his wife, Alice, who died in 2001. Under Leonard Foglia's direction, Jeffrey Bean and Carrie Paff portray Calvin and Alice.
The Globes, awarded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, are not taken seriously as markers of artistic achievement. But Hollywood covets the red-carpet spectacle, which comes during nomination balloting for the Academy Awards. (Voting for the Oscars started on Thursday and concludes on Tuesday; nominations will be announced on Jan. 13.) Studio marketers will use Globe wins to promote winter films. NBC, which broadcasts the ceremony live, makes a fortune on ad sales.
If you want to solve the hyperacquisition problem, which is a problem, then you have to go in and say, Look, you have to not acquire businesses that are in your space with these criteria. That would be a legitimate stance to take, because right now the business model in Silicon Valley is not to try and outcompete the behemoth. It's just to get bought by them. If you get to a point where they'll offer you $1 billion and you win, your investors win, you're rich and then these get folded in, and it doesn't even matter what they do with your business at that point.
From the mangroves of the Yucatán watching for green-winged teals to the grand ballet of fly-fishing on the Salmon River in Nova Scotia, Mr. Bryant's often-poetic, first-person accounts took readers to many places, but perhaps none more so than the mythical past, when boys went fishing with their fathers, watched rainbow trout hover above the pebbles in a brook and learned that patience, cultivated during hours in a duck blind, was more than a needlepoint virtue. His insights appealed to many readers who had never set foot in woods or a stream.
KK: Yeah, that's literally our question.
He articulated a vision for the future of work, education and technology for the nation. The board also delved into Mr. Yang's approach to foreign policy and military intervention, and learned of his fascination with aliens and fear of flying vacuum cleaners.
Nominating American Factory was the equivalent of sending an Oscar invitation to Barack and Michelle Obama. The former president and first lady have a multiyear production deal with Netflix, and American Factory, produced with Participant Media, was their first release.
Mr. Yang and his family began attending Sunday services at the Reformed Church of New Paltz after they purchased a home nearby in 2015.
What I'm suggesting is we actually make capitalism's goals align with ours, as human beings, as parents, as Americans. Instead of maximizing these capital efficiency measurements, we should be maximizing our own health and life expectancy, our children's education and success rates, our mental health and freedom from substance abuse, our environmental sustainability. Then we can line up the power of the markets with how we are doing. But the markets do not care one whit about us and our children.

CLAYTON Every once in a while, like at bedtime, I feel like I have a 25-pound dumbbell on my chest.
It's very hard to actually be that radically different about an avocado. But the British press figured out how to do it. While this is at some level humorous and not extremely serious, it did over time bleed into more sinister types of coverage of Meghan Markle, really around her mixed racial background. So you began to see descriptions of her in the press as, quote, exotic, or headlines that said that Harry's new girl is quote straight outta Compton. In other words, portraying Meghan as a coming up from the mean streets of Los Angeles. And so there is an element of it that is deeper, and more problematic, and gets at out-and-out racism. And certainly portraying her not just as an entitled millennial, but as an altogether more threatening figure.
In her insightful review of Gillian Gill's Virginia Woolf: And the Women Who Shaped Her World (Jan. 12), Claire Jarvis refers to the incestuous advances Woolf suffered at the hands of her half brothers. George Duckworth's actions were not advances. They were repeated, physical, full-on sexual abuse. After their parents married, Duckworth, who was 14 years older than his half sister and then in his 20s, repeatedly entered her bedroom secretly at night and sexually abused her until her older sister, Vanessa, also his victim, reported her own abuse to a family doctor.
But the overriding tenor of this documentary is triumphant and upbeat. Thomas's journey is intermittently visualized by footage from inside a boat as it makes its way through marshy wetlands before arriving, just as the sun is setting, at a sturdy dock.

Though many of the darker scenarios in Brown's novel don't elicit the heavy emotions they're meant to, and the 1950s references can feel gratuitous more than textured (housewives cooking while listening to Hound Dog; doctors casually prescribing Thalidomide and recommending cigarettes to pregnant women), it's easy to keep turning the pages as we toggle back and forth between Alice and Nellie, who — breaking news — has a far more complicated life than a stack of Ladies' Home Journals would lead Alice to believe.
But even by that standard, the marquee productions of this year's Prototype, the festival of new music-theater that sprawls throughout the city and runs through Sunday, are extreme. There are scenes in Prism, ThisTree and especially 4.48 Psychosis of almost cataclysmic suffering, the kind of pain that lingers without reason or resolution.
BA: But that just brings us to the other side of it, where what you're proposing is not to give as much more money to the people who need it the most. You're saying, if you get food stamps, the amount by which your government benefits increase will be less than for me or you.
There were hurdles, of course. At 8, Mr. Ratelle moved with his mother to Miami and, eventually, to Houston, where church attendance remained central to his life. He bridled at the rituals. I would say, 'No, I don't feel like washing that person's feet during communion.'
I call the approach taken by these rabbis the Tsuris Theory of Jewish Survival. Under this theory, the Jews need external troubles to stay Jewish. Nor has this fearful, negative perspective on Jewish survival been limited to ultra-Orthodox rabbis. Many Jewish leaders, both religious and secular, have argued that Jews need enemies--that without anti-Semitism, Judaism cannot survive. Theodor Herzl, the founder of political Zionism and a secular Jew, believed that our enemies have made us one ... It is only pressure that forces us back to the parent stem. In a prediction that reflects an approach to the survival of Judaism strikingly similar to that of the founder of the Lubavitch Hasidim, Herzl warned that if our Christian hosts were to leave us in peace ... for two generations, the Jewish people would merge entirely into surrounding races. Albert Einstein agreed: It may be thanks to anti-Semitism that we are able to preserve our existence as a race; that at any rate is my belief. Jean-Paul Sartre, a non-Jew, went even further, arguing that the sole tie that binds [the Jewish people together] is the hostility and disdain of the societies which surround them. He believed that it is the anti-Semite who makes the Jew.
The decline of male status in the family is more sharply articulated than in Europe, hastened in the U.S. by economic inequality (men fall further under changing economic circumstances) and religiosity (leading to pockets of greater male resistance to the redefinition of gender roles).
KK: With inflation, though, it would be higher, right?
Something came apart in me after that. In life, there are certain truths you hold on to: I am good. We are good. When a truth you believe in falls away, a friend told me, everything seems uncertain. I stopped eating, sleeping and caring what I wrote or what I did.
On a Friday night soon after, I kissed the man who sent me the folk-blues songs. When I came home and got in bed, my whole body itched. I thought of the unfaithful wife I had interviewed who had believed it was wrong to let the other man kiss her, but she also knew she would go wild with loneliness if she didn't.
The events of last year, both 'honor killings' that got national attention and the #MeToo movement in Iran, have increased the pressure on the government to push this bill that was in the making for almost a decade, said Tara Sepehri Far, a researcher for Human Rights Watch based in New York, referring to the murders of women by male relatives for supposedly shaming their families, even if the women themselves were victims of sexual violence.
JI: Yes. Regulating it heavily and using the revenue to treat gambling addiction. Can you talk through that? You say on your website that you think gambling addiction doesn't get nearly enough attention, and it is a really important issue. How does legalizing gambling, even if you use the revenue, not make that problem worse?
The underlying truth of a Covenantal Regime is that you have to close off choice if you want to get to the promised land. The people one sees in long, successful marriages have walked the stations of vulnerability. They've overthrown the proud ego and learned to be utterly dependent on the other. They've faced the ways they are difficult to be with and tried to address them. They've gone through all the normal episodes of confession, apology, defensiveness, forgiveness and loving the other most when there's nothing lovely about them.
BEIJING — The number of babies born in China last year fell to a nearly six-decade low, exacerbating a looming demographic crisis that is set to reshape the world's most populous nation and threaten its economic vitality.
Gross domestic product is a measure of a country's entire economic output. Its inventor worried that it might be mistaken as a measure of citizens' well-being. Mr. Yang's campaign has proposed that America measure its economic prosperity with a different index that accounts for human and not just monetary factors, including inequality and quality of life.
But even as Mr. Graham lobbied his Republican colleagues to vote against convicting Mr. Trump and offered a stream of flattery about the president's success in office, he rejected the suggestion that Mr. Trump should pardon any members of the mob before leaving office. I don't care if you went there and spread flowers on the floor, Mr. Graham said of the rioters. You breached the security of the Capitol. Other Republicans maintained that the House has moved too quickly to impeach. Representative Nancy Mace, a first-term Republican from South Carolina who voted against impeachment, said that the House had every right to impeach the president but that the process should have been more deliberate. The fact that we bypassed Judiciary, we did not open up an investigation, that we bypassed due process, that set a dangerous constitutional precedent for others, she said on NBC's Meet the Press. No matter — even if you think the president is guilty as hell, like many, many do believe, there has to be due process, there has to be an investigation. When asked if she felt the same way as Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas, who revealed last week that he feared his vote against impeachment would ultimately put him on the wrong side of this debate after more facts came to light, Ms. Mace said that she was also concerned. She argued that more Republicans would have backed the effort if more due process had been allowed beforehand.
She's not going to walk in the door and go, 'What's my identity as first lady?' Shailagh Murray, a former senior adviser to Mr. Biden and Mr. Obama, said in an interview. It's just going to be the first lady version of what she's been doing all along.
The wealth of individual Jews grew perceptibly during this decade, with 25 percent of America's richest people being of Jewish background. (If only earned, as distinguished from inherited, wealth is counted, the percentage would be even higher.) An American Leadership study in 1971-72 found that Jews represented more than 10 percent of America's top movers and shakers in business, a higher percentage than any other ethnic group. Jews' per capita income is nearly double that of non-Jews. Twice the percentage of Jews as non-Jews earn more than $50,000 a year. And twice the percentage of non-Jews as Jews earn less than $20,000. Jewish charitable giving has increased along with Jewish wealth. Jews are now among the largest contributors to universities, museums, hospitals, symphonies, opera, and other charities. In 1991, the United Jewish Appeal raised more money than any other charity in America, including the Salvation Army, American Red Cross, Catholic Charities and the American Cancer Society. Yet only one-tenth of Jewish philanthropists limit their giving to Jewish charities alone, while one-fourth give only to non-Jewish causes.
Reviewing a performance by Mr. Holdsworth in 1983, The New York Times's Jon Pareles wrote: He pours out notes in a liquid rush without slurring a single one. His sense of harmony reveals itself in daring melodic extrapolations and in chords that are complex and impressionistic yet as transparent as folk music.
His son, William, said Mr. Borders' body was discovered on Thursday. He said an autopsy would be performed.

That rift has already surfaced this year, as the governor and other Democrats grapple with the political fallout from a new law that sharply reduced the use of cash bail. The law went into effect on New Year's Day, and since then, concerns over a spate of anti-Semitic incidents and other recent alleged crimes committed by those released have led to calls for changes in the law, including by Mr. Cuomo himself.
It's almost enough to make you wonder if they've been hasty in calling the whole thing off. Alas, it's not over until it's officially over. There's still no word on whether Divorce — whose flagging ratings got a midseason bump after Frances and Robert ended up, briefly, back in each other's arms — has been renewed for a third installment. But whatever the show's fate, the Season 2 finale, airing Sunday, March 4, offers a bittersweet denouement. Just don't start dressing that carriage just yet, Mr. Church said in a Times interview. We never know what can happen in the post-mortem of that divorce. KATHRYN SHATTUCK
If The Animators suffers from the debut novelist's curse of trying to do too much, Whitaker's obvious talent with dialogue and establishing a sense of place prevents it from feeling weighed down.

I rode the subway maybe six weeks ago or so. It's become much more of a pain in the neck now that I actually get recognized. I confess that that's been the biggest adjustment in running for president. Because I was, No, I'm not going to get recognized on the street. Of course, keep in mind, when I started my run I was completely anonymous. I mean none of you had ever heard of me. And also there is, and this is not to make too much of it, but there's also this invisible Asian man thing. That you feel like all you have to do is just not want to be seen and then you disappear, and that doesn't work anymore.
KK: Do you believe in government subsidies for journalism?

Once announced, the wall began to divide people (as walls do), stirring up debates about painful historical events that are never far from the surface in Germany. I don't believe in reconstructing a totalitarian system as an experiment, said Sabine Bangert, a politician from the Greens party, who, like many Berliners, felt that the construction of a concrete barrier just meters from where the Berlin Wall once stood was an insult to those whose lives had been torn apart by it.
No, it was about that, and I was glad I did it.
Her first book, Feed Me I'm Yours, began inauspiciously as an anthology of favorite recipes that she organized with several neighbors in 1974 as a stay-at-home new mother. The collection was intended to raise money for the Minneapolis chapter of the Childbirth Education Association, which advocates family-centered maternity care. Later published widely, the book sold millions of copies.

Even the most contemplative graphic novels offer a kinetic sense of play guaranteed to hook your colleagues' interest. Why not launch your feminist exploration with an illustrated book set in a place that may be unfamiliar to all of you? Marguerite Abouet's six-volume Aya comics series, set in Ivory Coast in the 1970s (illustrated by Abouet's husband, Clément Oubrerie, and translated by Helge Dascher), follows the lives of its ambitious but dutiful namesake protagonist and her more freewheeling friends, Bintou and Adjoua. In Aya: Love in Yop City — which encompasses the last three chapters in the series — Aya, now a medical student, is sexually assaulted by her biology professor. The shame she feels in the wake of her attack shifts over the course of the book as she plans a fiery revenge.
Although Mr. Ellis had no formal training in the classification of national security information, he overruled the decision by a career official to clear Mr. Bolton's book for publication. The Justice Department, under pressure from Mr. Trump, has sued Mr. Bolton to recoup his profits from book. A judge overseeing the case issued a ruling on Thursday that makes it highly likely that Mr. Bolton's lawyer, Chuck Cooper, can question White House officials, like Mr. Ellis, about whether the classification decisions were made in bad faith.

Ten days after her release Miss Holiday gave a concert at Carnegie Hall to a packed house but, although she appeared at concert halls in New York from time to time after that, she was not allowed to appear in New York night clubs. As a result of her narcotics conviction, she could not get the necessary cabaret license. During the Nineteen Fifties Miss Holiday's voice began to lose its useful elasticity. This, combined with occasional brushes with narcotics agents, made her last years difficult, although she continued to record frequently. Miss Holiday appeared in a film, New Orleans, in 1946 and was featured in a Broadway revue for a short run a few years later. In 1954 she made a tour of Europe and was featured in a widely acclaimed television program, The Sound of Jazz, in 1958. She is survived by her husband, Louis McKay. A previous marriage, to Joe Guy, a trumpet player, ended in divorce.
4.48 is an adaptation of the final work by Sarah Kane, the British playwright who died in 1999. A fragmented, incantatory immersion in clinical depression, filled with descriptions of psychotropic drugs, sets of numbers, angry rants and stark wordplay, the script specifies neither characters nor precise plot, nor even the number of performers.
California Texas Takeaway California refers to the income gap and explains that changes in tax structures and safety-net programs and higher costs for education, child care, and housing played a role.

She changed her surname to Bosworth from Crum after her father told her, If you become an actress and you get a bad review, critics will say, 'Crummy performance by Patricia Crum,' so take your mother's maiden name.
Chuck McCann, a comic whose loopiness defined live children's television beginning in the 1950s and who later became a familiar TV and film character actor and a versatile voice on cartoons, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. He was 83.
I think that he did a lot of great things and he did a lot of what he could, but to the extent that there was a missed opportunity, it was in the wake of the financial crisis. And it's very hard to Monday morning quarterback a team when they literally felt like the economy itself was at stake, but we should have done much more to recapitalize homeowners as opposed to the banks. We could have kept many more people in their homes. We could've kept many of these communities ——

Loews Hotels says it won't host a fund-raiser with Senator Josh Hawley. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri challenged the legitimacy of Pennsylvania's electoral votes hours after a mob attacked the Capitol this month. Credit... Win Mcnamee/Getty Images Loews Hotels said on Saturday that it would not host a fund-raiser with Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, the latest indication that many companies are distancing themselves from Republicans who voted to overturn the election results. Fighting for Missouri, a political action committee affiliated with Mr. Hawley, had planned to host a fun-filled, family-friendly Orlando weekend event with the senator at the Loews Portofino Bay Hotel in Orlando, Fla., from Feb. 12 to Feb. 15, according to an invitation for the event. Tickets were being sold for $1,000 to $5,000, depending on the size of the group. But Loews said that the fund-raiser had been called off after the deadly riot at the Capitol, which many Democrats and Republicans have blamed in part on Mr. Hawley and other members of his party who supported President Trump's efforts to stop the certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory. We are horrified and opposed to the events at the Capitol and all who supported and incited the actions, the company said on Twitter. In light of those events and for the safety of our guests and team members, we have informed the host of the Feb. fund-raiser that it will no longer be held at Loews Hotels.
BA: But that just brings us to the other side of it, where what you're proposing is not to give as much more money to the people who need it the most. You're saying, if you get food stamps, the amount by which your government benefits increase will be less than for me or you.
Lauren Kelley: Mr. Yang, can you say who is on your short list for running mate?
Oh, man. Well, thank you for making the trip. Then you know. First, any person who says they're going to run government like a business does not know what they're talking about, because they are two completely different things.
Christina Vella, the author of several colorful works of narrative history, notably Intimate Enemies: The Two Worlds of the Baroness de Pontalba, a tale of wealth and scandal in 19th-century France and New Orleans, died on March 22 in New Orleans. She was 75.
Think of Michael Caine in Hannah (1986), a sympathetic sinner animated by lust, envy and pride, and one of a gallery of semi-suitable suitors — along with Max von Sydow's imperious artist and Mr. Allen's spiritually anguished television writer — who surround the title characters. (It is worth noting that Mr. Allen's character undergoes an epiphany while seeing Duck Soup, perhaps a signal of resurgent Marxism.) And those women, played by Barbara Hershey and Dianne Wiest as well as Ms. Farrow, are examples of the kind of complex, serious women who would eventually disappear from Mr. Allen's films, replaced by romantic foils and melodramatic fantasies.
You approach the character the same way, as far as developmental qualities. You have to be insatiably curious and enjoy the research. You have to have talent to be able to bring it out. You have to use your imagination to string together any elements of a character that you have not had personal experience with. And the last part, the fourth part, is that you must be willing and able to open up the cavity of your own emotions to pull out what is appropriate, and that is to make yourself look good, bad. It's rage. It's public or physical vulnerability. Like in Breaking Bad, I wanted the character to be soft and pudgy and overweight, so I wanted the love handles to spill out over my underwear. I wanted that. I needed the audience to feel sorry for this guy, that he's gone to seed, that he's lost his desire and his hope and his drive. And that's the whole point of the story is that he gets that back once he makes his decision to do his evil deeds. So he transforms his body and his look and his attitude and his ability to intimidate and his level of confidence, and all those things completely change.
Ms. Dunn, 47, is also the creator and executive producer of the popular sitcom American Housewife and the author of two previous novels. She would like to make it clear that the book is fiction, though, as she pointed out in a recent interview, married people often like to fantasize about these things.
We had this great normal banter, said Ms. Heyman, 36, a clinical social worker, is the director of the opioid treatment program at the Center for Comprehensive Health Practice in East Harlem in Manhattan. She graduated from Binghamton University, and received a master's in social work from the University of Pennsylvania. It was familiar, with no crazy red flags, she said. I loved that he was a special ed teacher and close to his family.
It was about honor and decency and integrity and the truth, DeLay said, his voice breaking, everything that we honor in this country. It was also a debate about relativism versus absolute truth. He charged that the President's Democratic defenders would lower the standards of society.
I have family in Hong Kong. I spent a semester there in college, and so when I see those streets wracked with riots and violence, I actually remember being on those streets. And so it's incredibly jarring, and it's an extraordinary situation because of Hong Kong's status as this semiautonomous region that's being reintegrated back into China.
Here, it's as if the costume designer Sarah J. Holden has placed lead weights in Mr. Ruffalo's epaulets and helium lifts in Mr. Shalhoub's shoes. Mr. Ruffalo's body looks slumped and stunted, his speech a mumble. Mr. Shalhoub meanwhile keeps straining upward. His arms and hands reach high, his voice rises until it cracks.
Why ouch? Bryan, come on, why?
At one point, Simeen wonders why it's unacceptable for three people to openly love each other. It's an interesting thought, one that poses a fresh conceptual question about marriage and love. But the power dynamics among the characters aren't sufficiently developed to dramatize that question convincingly. As for the status of her husband, Nirveen, in the triangle, Simeen says: He'd say, 'Jump.' We'd ask, 'How high?' He was dying. We were not. It was that simple. Was it? Such simplicity, even if plausible, forecloses on some of the complexity that could help bring the novel to life.
I have said that I am used to being around dead bodies. But I took a full hot flush when I saw Jennifer Rockwell, glazed naked on the chair, her mouth open, her eyes still moist, wearing an expression of childish surprise. The surprise light not heavy, as if she had come across something she'd lost and no longer expected to find. And not quite naked. Oh my. She'd done it with a towel turbaned around her head, like you do to dry your hair. But now of course the towel was wet through and solid red and looked as though it weighed more than any living woman could carry.
The Gendys, who live in Fresh Meadows, Queens, base their volunteerism at St. Mary and St. Antonios Coptic Orthodox Church in Ridgewood, where they have been members for more than 30 years. Membership at the church increased significantly after the fall of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in 2011. The subsequent rise of the Muslim Brotherhood prompted many Copts — members of the country's Orthodox Christian minority — to flee for the United States.
CW: Yeah. Rather than, you know, a big exit or something like that. Sexy start-up.
JERUSALEM — Yechiel Eckstein, an Israeli-American rabbi whose organization has raised more than $1.5 billion for Israel by promoting closer ties with evangelical Christians abroad, died on Wednesday at his home in Jerusalem. He was 67.
The title of Joyce Carol Oates's new collection of stories, Beautiful Days, is drawn from Les Beaux Jours, a painting by Balthus of a girl reclining in a chair and examining herself in a hand mirror, while a faceless man tends the fireplace behind her. But it might equally refer to Fleuve Blue or Big Burnt, the first two stories in the book — which are about (among other things) the strange disconnection that separates our romantic lives from the rest of life. Fleuve Blue describes an affair between a prominent small-town lawyer and a younger woman, whom he first sees walking across a bridge. He thinks, I will marry her. That one. Except, of course, he's already married. Later, he offers her a ride when she gets caught wearing high heels in a downpour and they start meeting in the afternoon in a rented room. She told him it would be the inside-out of the rest of her life, her relationship with him. … She meant, what they had together was a counter-world. … 'Because I'm always lying. In that other life. In my real life. I tell people — I tell myself — I live for my children. I adore my children.'  Unsurprisingly, their affair turns out to be susceptible to the same sort of forces that she wants to escape in her real life — boredom and the passage of time.
So the same forces that pushed for Britain to leave the E.U., and are now craving its greatest symbols of nationalism in the form of the monarchy, they are the same forces who have inflicted all of this on Meghan and on Harry. And perhaps driven them to leave the monarchy, to weaken the monarchy. It's a, perhaps, classic case of getting what you wanted until you realize that it's not really what you wanted.
People ask me, do you really want a general election between two New York billionaires? he said. To which I say, who's the other one?
CW: Going back though, my question is, there's an issue of power here. I mean, sure. You might not want to. You might not be able to address the problems of Facebook if you break it up from Instagram, and I understand that, and there's still going to be addictive products, but there's an issue of the consolidation of actual power, the ability to buy those companies, to make those acquisitions. Just simply the leverage that Mark Zuckerberg can use to have a meeting with Donald Trump that they won't tell us about, I mean, how do you — if you don't break them up, how do you get rid of that conglomeration of power?
A decade later, Mr. Jones was arrested in South Africa for protesting the country's apartheid policies. He later helped draft the Constitution that ended that country's system of legal racial segregation and advised emerging African nations in designing judicial systems.
What they've been into is sex tech, toys they can control with their tech devices, that attach to their penis or their vulva, she said. They haven't had contact with humans, and really don't have any interest in sex with people. This is what they want to be doing, and if they could afford a sex robot, they would.
Any American who wants to gamble online on a poker site can do so from any state in the country right now. If it's illegal in your state, you just end up using an offshore betting site, which is shady, has problems, but it's not going to ease your gambling addiction at all. So the question is, do we want Americans, in the vast majority of the country, on offshore betting sites, dealing with shady characters and generating no revenue and still being addicted? Or would we prefer that they do business with American firms, where we do have better regulations, we know they're not getting cheated, we know they're not getting exploited, and you generate tax revenue that you can use to treat gambling addiction.

At a pivotal moment in World War II, Allied forces are stranded on a French beach at Dunkirk. After a call goes out to British civilians across the channel to help rescue troops, Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance), piloting his yacht, the Moonstone, with the help of Peter and George, comes across a soldier (Cillian Murphy) shivering amid wreckage in the water.
There have always been infertile straight couples in need of donor sperm, but with the legalization of gay marriage and the rise of elective single motherhood, the market has expanded over the last decade. About 20 percent of sperm bank clients are heterosexual couples, 60 percent are gay women, and 20 percent are single moms by choice, the banks said.
From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today: In the weeks since George Floyd was killed by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, Americans have been confronting hard questions about bias and racism within policing, and what the role of the police should be. And in the face of those questions is another question: Is the culture of policing, and the resistance to change by some police unions, so entrenched that whatever change is necessary would require fundamental rethinking from the outside, rather than incremental change from within police departments and their unions? In that context, we wanted to talk to someone who sits at the heart of these questions. Vince Champion is a police union representative in Atlanta, Georgia. Georgia is a right-to-work state, where police officers aren't required to join the union or pay dues, so the unions don't hold the same power to block reforms as they do in many states. And Champion has supported some of the reforms that unions have been criticized for resisting in the past, including banning chokeholds, the use of body cams, and transparency around police officers' records. And like many law enforcement officials, Champion has forcefully condemned officer Chauvin. But when it comes to another high-profile police killing in his own city — the killing of Rashard Brooks, just weeks after Floyd's death — Champion's views are more complicated. It's Monday, June 29.

Mr. Gillis was hired by Saturday Night Live last September, then dropped days later after clips surfaced showing him using slurs and language offensive toward Asian and L.G.B.T.Q. people, including one specifically about Mr. Yang. Mr. Yang later said the comedian should have had the chance to keep his job and explained: As a society, we have become unduly punitive and vindictive about people making statements that some find offensive or distasteful.
There is a long and rich tradition of debate in philosophy and cognitive science about the nature of those entities, which the three main aliens resolve with impressive practical acumen. For them, to acquire a concept is to steal it from the person who explained it, a theft that is consummated by a brisk tap on the forehead. The victim crumples to the ground (there are some variations on this procedure) and then resumes life missing a key piece of mental furniture.
Well, thank you for saying so. Yeah, in 2019 dollars it must be at least $6,000. I've been a Democrat for years and years, and if you look at my alignment on the vast majority of issues, they're lock step with the Democratic Party. So it was very natural for me to run as a Democrat. I've ruled out completely any third-party bid because that would in my mind increase the chances of Donald Trump winning, and the mission is to defeat Donald Trump and help move the country forward.

In a December 2018 paper, When Work Disappears: Manufacturing Decline and the Falling Marriage Market Value of Men, Autor, David Dorn, an economist at the University of Zurich, and Gordon Hanson, an economist at the University of California-San Diego, argue that adverse trade shocks, like a surge of imports from China, differentially reduce employment and earnings of young adult males, reduce marriage and fertility, heighten male idleness and premature mortality, and raise the share of mothers who are unwed and the share of children living in below-poverty, single-headed households.
An online video created for AeroMexico by the Ogilvy advertising agency last year played on the trend, offering discounts to Americans to fly to Mexico based on the portion of their heritage that a DNA test determined was from Mexico. Amid the debate around border security, the ad has recently gone viral on the Internet. John Raul Forero, the chief creative officer for Ogilvy Latam confirmed in an email that the ad had been created last year for the airline but had no further comment. The DNA promotion is no longer valid, according to Paula Santiago, a spokeswoman for the agency.
So, and I know The New York Times, I mean you've had your issues with Facebook and the rest of it, and they made a change and then all sorts of things happen.
After watching his comedy, I felt that he wasn't a malignant racist and that his slur toward me was just very, very bad comedy run amok. Which did not strike me as a fireable offense, and I realized that if I was the individual who was actually directly slurred, and I did not feel that he should lose his job over it, then I should probably share that sentiment with other people.
Offill's whittled narrative bursts are apt vessels for the daily experience of scale-shifting they document — the vertigo of moving between the claustrophobia of domestic discontent and the impossibly vast horizon of global catastrophe. This fragmented form is weirdly well-suited to both melodrama and plotlessness: In Dept. of Speculation, it allowed Offill to narrate marital infidelity, which can easily verge into soap opera, with an oblique, devastating grace — its searing shards summoning the sensation of holding a hot saucepan for just a moment, before it burns the skin off your fingers. Offill's agent once described that book as an X-ray rather than a novel, but in Weather we have something like an inverted X-ray: a narrative that illuminates not the obvious bones of the story but its unexpected details; not the bold lines of your femurs but the detritus in your pockets — the crumpled receipts, the pacifier dropped on the sidewalk, the key whose lock you can't remember. These bits and bobs highlight the feeling of daily life, but their mundane silhouettes are backlit by something more like a nuclear explosion.
In my 10 years in Iran researching the Revolutionary Guards and their depiction in Iranian media, one of my key observations was that wherever they operate, in Iran or on foreign battlefields, they function with that same ad hoc leadership: Decisions and actions don't just come from one man or even a small group of men; many within the organization have experience building relationships, creating strategies and making decisions.
Part of the problem is the United States lacks any truly toothy privacy law. We don't even pretend that we think privacy is something to be protected, and there are no consequences for revealing someone else's personal foibles made into so much data.
Let me ask you, then, so I can get it with a big role. So LBJ, all the others, this recent one and Your Honor and Breaking Bad, those are all top numbers, I'm assuming. But I want you to explain how you scored these roles, if you don't mind, if you'll indulge me — Rear Admiral Lyle Haggerty in Contagion, ramrod straight — by the way, prescient.
Well, you're assuming that they didn't fire simultaneously. You don't know that, and we don't know that. You're assuming that he's fired the taser, and then Officer Rolfe shot. Well, nobody knows that, including the district attorney. You don't know when Officer Rolfe decided to squeeze the trigger. We don't know when Mr. Brooks decided to squeeze the trigger. Did they do it at the same time? Did they not? We don't know. We can find that out. So again, you're making an assumption that Brooks fired and then the officer fired. We just don't know that, and I can't make that assumption either.
When I'm on the subway, people will look at me and then look at me. And then eventually someone will inch over and say, Hey, you running for president? And then I'll say, Yes, I am. They'll say, Yeah, yeah, I like you. Thousand bucks a month, something like that. And then they want to take pictures. And then as soon as someone breaks the seal, then it's safe for everyone to do it. And so, then I'll be — and then there's this uncomfortable period in this subway car after you've taken the pictures with him, you're still sitting there. And so then they're, So, where are you going? Or, how's Bernie? Or whatever the questions are. And so, I have not been riding the subway lately, but I've ridden the subway an awful lot over the years. Now my preferred mode of transportation is the bike, because if someone recognizes me, it's generally too late.
OK well, one, you mentioned replace. I'm not asking to replace. They have to go hand-in-hand. There has to be more of them, or as many of them as there is officers.
Next up are more things to slurp. One of the goals of Julia Sullivan, the chef and an owner, who opened the restaurant with the general manager and sommelier Allie Poindexter, was to fill the void in Nashville's oysterscape. A small, perfectly nice selection hailing from both coasts, Canada and the Gulf, comes with a seasonal mignonette (in our case, juicy watermelon) in addition to the usual condiments. The best oysters, though, come out of the wood-burning oven, slathered with a grassy pesto-like green curry then cooked until custardy.

So you're looking at a nation of high school graduates. And what do high school graduates do for a living? The top five occupational categories are retail and administrative, which includes call center work, retail, food service and food preparation, transportation, primarily truck driving, and attendant supportive jobs and manufacturing still. We all know that we have gutted many of these industries, and their labor bases have shrunk.

Over the last decade, the Academy Awards have become a bit superfluous, with a torrent of precursor ceremonies leaving fans (and honorees) exhausted and the contents of the envelopes unsurprising. The academy's board of governors, alarmed by sharp declines in television ratings, decided in 2018 to move up this year's ceremony. It will be held on Feb. 9, two weeks earlier than the last go-round, a seemingly small truncation that nonetheless has the movie capital in a tizzy.

If you run an organization, imagine having an organization that has the wrong measurements. How is that organization going to fare over time? That is where we are in the United States of America right now. We're riding a century-old measurement off a cliff, while our way of life deteriorates underneath our feet. If you looked at levels of anxiety, stress, mental health, depression, suicides, drug overdoses, you would see that we're in a mental health recession or depression, we're in a wellness or life expectancy recession or depression, and the corporate profits are going to keep on going up, because in the 21st-century economy, companies can do very, very well while not hiring a lot of people, not treating them as full-time employees, and they don't need to care what happens in their own backyard because they sell everywhere.

Under the policy, detailed in articles in The Times of London last week, four British women were each charged roughly $900 for the government's efforts to free them from a religious institution in Somalia where, they said, they had been chained, whipped and told they would be held until they married. The women's families had sent them there because they thought the women were too independent.

Joyce met Proust once and they exchanged scarcely a word, even though they shared a cab together (neither had read the other). Beckett wrote a small critical book about Proust; Woolf admired Proust so intensely that she felt swamped by his genius. Gide's bitterest regret was that as a founder of a fledgling but already prestigious publishing house, he turned down Swann's Way, the first volume of Proust's masterpiece (he thought of Proust as a superficial snob and a mere reporter of high-society events). Genet began to write his first novel, Our Lady of the Flowers, after reading the opening pages of Proust's Within a Budding Grove. Genet was in prison and he arrived late in the exercise yard for the weekly book exchange; as a result he was forced to take the one book all the other prisoners had rejected. And yet once he'd read the opening pages of Proust he shut the book, wanting to savor every paragraph over as long a period as possible. He said to himself; Now, I'm tranquil, I know I'm going to go from marvel to marvel. His reading inspired him to write; he hoped to become the Proust of the underclass.

But I think I've been a moth to the flame on a lot of the things that I've done in my career. Anything that kind of scares me, I'm attracted to. And being on stage and singing is a fearful position to be in.

The director Martin Scorsese and his crew turn their cameras on the outspoken New York humorist Fran Lebowitz, and then just let her riff at length about the past, present and future of human existence. Scorsese and Lebowitz collaborated previously on the feature-length documentary Public Speaking, about her life and career as a writer and raconteur. But the docu-series Pretend It's a City is much less formal. It's more of an extended hangout session, edited together from different interviews and public appearances, shot all around the city — New York — that these two love the most.

For the next ten days, from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur, the Kushners and the country boy hid in the bushes in the pouring rain. Lisa almost gave up, What kind of life is this? she asked. Let them kill us already. Eventually, they found a farmer to take them in. After two days, wagons pulled up. At first, Rae thought it was the Nazis. The men had machine guns. But soon they recognized the Jewish partisans. Tuvia Bielski had heard of their escape and dispatched a group to look for survivors.

Despite the high profile of the scandals involving the sexual abuse of minors by Catholic priests, there is no evidence that the incidence of sexual misconduct is greater among priests than among clergy of other denominations or the population at large. But this is of little comfort to Catholic clergy or parishioners -- nor is it likely to alter the widely held perception that men who choose to live celibate lives have psychological problems they wish to conceal. This perception is not lost on the seminarians. Magat was dating a woman before he entered the seminary, but he avoided telling her that he was considering a vocation until the last possible moment. I was afraid, he says. If I decided not to go to the seminary and I'd told her in advance, then I'm out of the vocation and I'm out of her. Because I knew she would have dropped me like a hat. For a long time, Bashista says, he was critical of the fact that priests cannot marry, and celibacy was a big impediment for many years as he struggled with the idea of becoming a priest. I really felt that I was called to be a father and a husband, he says. I thought that was why I was placed on earth. There was a girl I dated in college -- we'd even had talks about getting married. Bashista's initial aversion to celibacy is widespread among men of his generation, according to Dean Hoge, a professor of sociology at Catholic University.
Molina has been doing wonderful work in the series, and this week he has one of his best moments, when he is overcome by a sense of shared pride at seeing Joan Crawford surrounded by a crowd of fans after a preview of Baby Jane. It's extremely vulnerable work from him. He bursts with happiness for her. (Jessica Lange's stare back at him is an intense kaleidoscope of pride, gratitude and steely self-satisfaction.) Aldrich's career unhappiness post-Baby Jane is evident when we see him directing a bullying and uncooperative Frank Sinatra (Toby Huss) in 4 for Texas and trying to assuage the fears of Davis, who is baffled that the offers haven't been pouring in.
PHILADELPHIA — Michael R. Bloomberg is gearing up for his second rally of the day, at the National Constitution Center, which more than 1,000 people are registered to attend. Milton and Phyllis Trachtenburg, who had heard about the event through a Facebook ad, were waiting in one of two long lines to get inside.
That's what I am. I had a very profound experience watching it. It was mostly because everyone was asleep, and I didn't want to make noise. I watched your other one on the big screen in my home, which was great, and with a great sound system.
Mr. Brown's insistence on holding onto state revenues was a source of continued friction with Democratic allies in the Legislature, who wanted to use the money to restore spending cuts that had been in place during the Great Recession.
The sisters, who called themselves the Flying Twins, did not win an Olympic medal, but they often finished first or second in Canadian and American ski championship events in the 1940s and early '50s. They also taught thousands of Canadians to ski in a half-century as instructors.
Last year was also a period of transition for Mr. Cuomo: For the first eight years in office, Mr. Cuomo worked with a Republican State Senate, which often backed his pleas for fiscal austerity and batted back progressive reforms. That changed in the 2018 midterm elections, when Democrats took control of the Senate with the help of a number of young, liberal candidates who repeatedly challenged Mr. Cuomo, sometimes leading to heated conflicts.
JI: Yes. Regulating it heavily and using the revenue to treat gambling addiction. Can you talk through that? You say on your website that you think gambling addiction doesn't get nearly enough attention, and it is a really important issue. How does legalizing gambling, even if you use the revenue, not make that problem worse?
The California edition does not mention Solyndra or the other nations. However, it does include a section on the threat to American states and cities from rising sea levels, noting that the impact on tourism in Florida could hurt that state's economy, and that transportation networks and buildings could be threatened.
Along parallel lines, a far lower percentage of Republicans than Democrats believe that changing gender roles have made it easier for marriages to be successful (26 percent of Republicans compared with 47 percent of Democrats). Similarly, 36 percent of Republicans compared with 58 percent of Democrats believe changing gender roles have made it easier for women to lead satisfying lives. Fewer Republicans than Democrats (30 to 48 percent) believe changing gender roles have made it easier for men to lead satisfying lives.
Bishop Blake is not someone to be found on protest lines or shouting down law enforcement; he tends to advocate through more formal channels. He departs from some activist ministers in his social conservatism, opposing same-sex marriage and abortion. Yet he tries to strike a welcoming posture in an era of activists who can feel like the church is judging them.

In the decades since, El Cap has become one of the most famous climbs in the world. Some professional climbers ascend it without ropes, or climb so rapidly they seem to sprint up the side; the speed record on a route called the Nose, set in 2018 by Tommy Caldwell and Alex Honnold, is just under two hours.
When I started talking to sperm banks last spring, they were already concerned about supply.
A working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that U.B.I. could redirect spending to more affluent and middle-income families, therefore leaving low-income families worse off; a U.B.I. large enough to direct more funds to low-income households would be extremely costly. Read the paper here.
And how does this attitude begin to manifest itself?
So if you had, for example, a rule that said, Look, the government is allowed to match whatever salary a private sector employee is being offered, then you'd have more success. If you said, Look, you don't need to move to Washington, D.C., and sit in the thing that was built decades ago, that's like solace, and you have this giant parking lot and you just feel miserable being there for like a day, let alone a career.

That's right, and they speak very quietly.
If you want to solve the hyperacquisition problem, which is a problem, then you have to go in and say, Look, you have to not acquire businesses that are in your space with these criteria. That would be a legitimate stance to take, because right now the business model in Silicon Valley is not to try and outcompete the behemoth. It's just to get bought by them. If you get to a point where they'll offer you $1 billion and you win, your investors win, you're rich and then these get folded in, and it doesn't even matter what they do with your business at that point.
Black resists the pull of the river 565 feet below. And that choice — equal parts survival instinct and desire to live — marks a turning point in her trajectory. Ronan's life can go only in one tragic direction — he died on Feb. 15, 2013, just before his third birthday — but Black's refusal to die means that she can open up a little bit of space in which she can find a way to live in the world, as she puts it. And that space, in which life and death, love and loss, rage and happiness, pleasure and pain can tolerably intermingle, is the mourner's sanctuary.
Binyamin Appelbaum: Yes. After every invention basically since the plow, people have found new uses for the time saved by new technologies. You've argued that this time, this won't happen quickly enough. Why will this time be different? What gives you the confidence that we're confronting something new in all of human history?
Unsurprisingly, their experiences diverge. The husband, Owen, essentially jumps into bed with the first hot single woman he meets, only to find that she is kind of unhinged as well as much more annoying than his wife. The wife, Lucy, embarks on an orderly affair with a man who's up for some no-strings-attached sex once a week, and the two inconveniently fall in love.
Immanuel Kant begins his Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals by declaring that the only thing that can be called good without qualification is a good will. By a good will, he meant, roughly, the desire to do what the moral law requires just because the moral law requires it. But beyond the Kantian worry — that your desire to do the right thing is enmeshed with a desire for revenge — is a psychological one: Your pain and outrage could hamper your assessment of what you ought to do.

I made a list of about 20 possible theme entries of varying lengths. In addition, I was determined to hide our names somewhere in the grid, as well as somehow create an attribution to my father who passed away over the summer. More on that last part in a bit.
We should have 18-year term limits, increase the number of justices, make it so it's predictable that you lose an election, the other party might get one or two justices, and then we don't need to literally be monitoring the health of our justices. Or, the most ridiculous thing is you're literally looking at the age of the person you're appointing being, Ooh, this person will be there for 30, 40 years. What kind of system do you want where you're having a society decide 30 years ago what women's rights are today? Doesn't make any sense.
But at the moment that Officer Rolfe shot Mr. Brooks, he wasn't in close range, and it wasn't capable of being a stun gun. So I just want to be very clear on the question of in what way Officer Rolfe would have believed that his life was in danger in that moment. You're painting a scenario where something could have changed. Someone might have done something. Brooks might have turned around, might have come back at him. But at that very moment, 18 feet away or so, when the cartridges had been spent and it's only role was as a stun gun, how was Officer Rolfe's life in danger?
Our best path forward with China is to try and have them continue to show restraint, but also see that the costs to human rights abuse is not just in Hong Kong, but with their ethnic minorities and the Muslim population of Uighurs, that the costs are higher than their perceived benefits of maintaining social order and stability. In order to have those costs feel real to the Chinese, we can't just moralize and say, Hey, do the right thing. Because at this point they're looking at us and saying like, Keep your opinions and value statements to yourselves.

AY: Yeah. And I will say on a personal level, I spent seven years recruiting some of our top educational products to Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis. So I have seen that essentially the tide has turned in the direction it's gone and we should not be relying upon the government as the primary employer of a lot of this tech talent. We have to face facts and say, at this point, most of the intellectual capital is being attracted to these private firms and we need to instead try and support and work with the private firms.

That's probably a good assessment. I think that's probably right. And then, as you said, people will forget, and they'll come back in. And then they will demand more weighty storytelling.
I would point very keenly to the level of planning and coordination we've been carrying out for more than nine months, Mr. Murray said, adding that he believed the security measures the Secret Service had planned for the inauguration would have prevented the Capitol attack had they been in place at the time. The Secret Service, which is leading the effort to secure the presidential inauguration, said on Thursday that it would establish a green zone in downtown Washington this weekend, shutting down traffic and train lines as National Guard troops continue to flood into the increasingly militarized city. Most of the streets around the Lincoln Memorial and the scene of the deadly siege of the Capitol would be shut down from Saturday morning until the day after the inauguration. A green zone will also be established in the downtown area, with National Guard troops in place to verify entering residents or business owners. The Memorial bridge connecting Washington to Arlington, Va., will also be closed and multiple train stations in downtown Washington will be temporarily inaccessible, according to the statement. The area around the National Mall on Thursday resembled a city under siege, with multiple military vehicles stationed at intersections and steel fencing erected along streets near the Potomac River. As of Thursday afternoon, there were about 7,000 National Guard members deployed from D.C. and 13 states. About 20,000 overall were expected to be in Washington for the inauguration.
Do you ever find yourself, as a union leader, representing a police officer who has been disciplined and who faces, perhaps, expulsion, termination, and yet, because of a contract, or because of your own union instincts and ethos, you're supposed to defend them? I'm thinking about, for example, officers that we have learned about over the past few years, with 10, 12, 15, 17 complaints of misconduct against them, who end up in one of these shootings. And everyone looks back and says, wow, look at that record. And then I always imagine, and maybe I'm mis-imagining, that there is a union official — maybe he looks like you — and he is defending that officer from being terminated.
I think you need to work hard to bring everybody to the table to figure out a way to help workers with health insurance, with education, even with housing.
What I'm suggesting is we actually make capitalism's goals align with ours, as human beings, as parents, as Americans. Instead of maximizing these capital efficiency measurements, we should be maximizing our own health and life expectancy, our children's education and success rates, our mental health and freedom from substance abuse, our environmental sustainability. Then we can line up the power of the markets with how we are doing. But the markets do not care one whit about us and our children.
Rory didn't try to fix the situation or talk it away, Ms. Carryer said. She was just there for me, and when that happened I thought, 'This is the person I want to go through the hard times with.'
Yes. All of this is a prelude to say that, should some of the tech companies be asked to divest parts of their businesses? One hundred percent yes. Like Amazon should not be selling its own house brand to its advantage to other goods. These companies do have excessive power and influence. At this point you could argue they control our democracy.
The blueprint of executive action comes after Mr. Biden announced that he will push Congress to pass a $1.9 trillion package of economic stimulus and pandemic relief, signaling a willingness to be aggressive on policy issues and confronting Republicans from the start to take their lead from him. He also plans to send sweeping immigration legislation on his first day in office, providing a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people living in the country illegally. Along with his promise to vaccinate 100 million Americans for the coronavirus in his first 100 days, it is an expansive set of priorities for a new president that could be a defining test of his deal-making abilities and command of the federal government.

It shouldn't have worked, but Dave had an ESP about musicians and knew somehow Eugene would work, Philip Clark, the author of Dave Brubeck: A Life In Time (2020), said in a phone interview. Eugene was a light-fingered player who could swing heavily, but he had a spongy sound that gave albums like 'Time Out' and very intricate pieces like 'Three to Get Ready' a chamber music quality.
In the new Netflix series Russian Doll, Nadia (Natasha Lyonne), a cynical video game programmer with commitment issues, finds herself caught in a never-ending cycle of death and resurrection on the night of her 36th birthday party. No matter what Nadia does, she eventually dies and awakens in the same bathroom on that same night at that same party. And with almost every reset, the staccato piano chords of a nearly 50-year-old pop tune kick in.

Romantic comedies are essentially cinema's comfort food, and expecting them to stray from formula is almost as fruitless as expecting McDonald's to alter the flavor of its fries. So to say that Everybody Loves Somebody is predictable is no real criticism, as being able to foresee the ending — almost from the beginning — is exactly what most viewers expect.
JW: You remember what happened the last time a president tried to do this, right?
I think a part of him was like, 'I'm going to trust this.' Maybe it's because he really wanted to have sex, she said. But did he feel pressured because I was there?
The conflict now enters uncharted seas. The Nixon resignation, for one, cut the matter short, and the Andrew Johnson trial occurred more than 100 years ago, in a different America, one without nuclear weapons or cable television or public opinion polls.
To Mr. Biden's friends and family, his success at winning the White House is proof that there is something fundamentally reassuring about his character — his loyalty, his empathy and his experience — that Americans want after four years of an unpredictable and chaotic administration. Even when he misspeaks, they argue, it underscores his authenticity, the journey of a man who moved through the darkness of the losses of his young wife, baby daughter and adult son to remain optimistic about politics, the country and his own destiny.

The Democrat-dominated Assembly has voted to close the loophole for years, but the measure went nowhere in the Republican-led Senate.
Excuse me, sir, is the case being worked? Is Silvera on it? What?
I mean, the reason I'm asking these questions is because some police unions around the country have resisted efforts to make public complaints against police officers, and they have fiercely resisted eliminating, firing police officers who are accused of a pattern of misconduct. Do you feel like unions are invested in the status quo in ways that mean that it is going to be hard, is hard, will always be hard to change policing in this country?
A 2016 study from the economists Lawrence Katz at Harvard and Alan Krueger at Princeton found that 94 percent of net job growth between 2005 and 2015 was alternative work, including independent contractors, freelancers and temps.

She was soon arrested again, on grand larceny charges. It was revealed that she had told numerous associates that their investments — in oil and mineral deals — had been guaranteed by the banker David Rockefeller, to whom she claimed to be secretly married. That lie was bolstered by at least one fake marriage license and by a framed silver photo of him at her bedside. It was later reported that the photo had been clipped from a magazine.

Each loss meant that Mary had to work harder. To help pay expenses after her father's death, she got after-school jobs. In one of those jobs, as a switchboard operator at the Shelton Hotel in Manhattan, she eavesdropped on inhabitants, including Tennessee Williams — who, she noted in her memoir, had the cheapest room in the hotel, at $30 a month.
Now, Borstelmann said, I want to go until I'm 70. I'm not letting the pandemic retire me.

Justice Bader Ginsburg has had a series of health scares in recent years, including surgery for lung cancer and radiation treatment. She also had surgery for early-stage pancreatic cancer in 2009.

On the other hand, another group of converts, the Ultramontanes, became such fervent Romanizers that they dismayed the pragmatic Old Catholics of England. Henry Manning and William George Ward, for example, two Oxford converts, were among the leaders of the movement to declare the pope infallible on questions of faith and morals at the First Vatican Council (1869-1870) and some of the most passionate defenders of the pope's temporal power, which was threatened by the unification of Italy. These converts' views dismayed English Old Catholics who, over three centuries or more, had gradually adapted their faith to indigenous conditions. The converts were, then, anything but unanimous among themselves but tended toward radical or extreme positions in one direction or another, arousing resentment from their new coreligionists in either instance.
But the real thrill of this collection is its inevitable march into poetry, what Dickey called a magical arena. Gautreaux delivers a reliable, generous, surprising profusion of metaphors in each of these 21 stories. In one, a garage full of junk is slowly revealed as a stand-in for the mysteries of marriage. In another, a windshield breaks into a million diamonds, and the man recovering from the crash feels his mind come back to him changed, like a book dropped in the ocean and washed up on shore, all there, but slightly warped.
So I have agents and lawyers who look out for that. They're incentivized to do well by me, and that's great. But I certainly don't make my decisions based on financial considerations.

A second article of impeachment, charging Clinton with obstruction of justice, passed on a narrower vote of 221 to 212. It accused him of inducing others to lie in order conceal his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. This time 12 Republicans voted no, while 5 Democrats voted yes.
We're trying to get creative, because it is rough right now. The intensity has taken an emotional and physical toll on the emergency medical workers, he said. They are stressed, they are overworked. It's been a struggle, no doubt about it. In Habersham County, in the state's northeast, the average number of calls per day for emergency medical service crews has been far higher than usual, said Chad Black, the director for emergency services for the county and the board chairman of the Georgia E.M.S. Association. About every other call is related to Covid, he said, and ambulances have had to wait upward of two hours to unload patients. The county has had staffing problems for years, he said, a complication aggravated when employees contract the virus and must isolate. Some days, ambulances are at 50 percent staffing, Mr. Black said. They know when they come in, in the morning, that there's a great chance they're going to be up for 24 straight hours, Mr. Black said about the ambulance workers. You've got to worry — is there a breaking point? And in the Atlanta area, Mr. Black said, emergency crews are often hospital shopping — calling multiple facilities in the metro area and driving around until one agrees to admit their patient. In Arizona, which has a higher rate of new cases per capita than any other state, according to a New York Times database, E.M.S.
That is correct. But when I've dug into it, very, very few Americans are getting $1,000 in food stamps. And most of the people who are on government assistance live in fear of losing that assistance because there are various requirements that tend to come with it. And when, if you ask them, say, Hey, would you prefer $1,000 unconditional that you can rely upon, they actually think that's too good to be true.
Buettner ha trabajado en varias ciudades para tratar de replicar el efecto moai. En Nápoles, Florida, por ejemplo, encontró a 110 personas que querían mejorar sus hábitos alimenticios, y comenzó agrupándolos por vecindario. (Si viven demasiado lejos, no se reunirán, dijo). Luego les hizo preguntas sobre intereses y valores compartidos, como si una persona veía Fox News o CNN, si le gustaban las vacaciones en la playa o las caminatas, si iba a la iglesia o si le gustaba la música country. Las personas con intereses compartidos que vivían cerca unas de otras formaron moais de cinco o seis personas, y luego planearon cinco cenas en la que cada uno llevaba un tipo de comida.
In the partially autobiographical novel Jean Santeuil, written while his parents were still alive, Marcel portrays his father as a brute (What a vulgar man, thinks Jean Santeuil), someone whose peasant ways had not been amended by a lifetime of honors. In his correspondence Marcel later told his editor that his father had tried to cure him of his effeminacy and neuroses by sending him to a whorehouse. But by the time he came to write Remembrance of Things Past, after his parents' death, he idealized both of them and disguised his father as a wise, indulgent minister of state.
The fabric feels cheap, though. I hate the fabric. I hate the fit. They squeeze my thighs when I pull them up to my natural waist and flatten my butt when they fall to my hips. They are bulky without keeping me warm, and there is no shirt that can make the awkward length — too long to be short pants, too short to cover my ankles — work at all. And yet, beginning in September, I have been wearing them at least three times a week.

So if you look at other countries, they have a value-added tax and then they take those resources and put them to work toward various social programs in ways to balance out the inequality. Now, another thing I love about the value-added tax is you can either reduce it or exempt things like diapers, toilet paper, eggs, milk, things that Americans consume just to make ends meet, and you can dial it up on things like artificial intelligence, yachts, luxury watches. There are ways that you can make it so that it falls more heavily on people that would barely notice. And we're taking the resources plus an additional hundreds of billions of dollars and putting it directly into the hands of working Americans. This would increase the buying power of literally 90 percent of Americans.
In the Danish director Thomas Vinterberg's Another Round, a film about breaking the rules and, in doing so, breaking free, Martin is one of four high school teachers who decide to test a theory about alcohol: As long as they maintain a consistent level of it in their blood, their lives will improve.

The Americans returns for a final season. And a docuseries on YouTube follows the international pop stars BTS on tour.
I mean, as of right now, no. He's too much in the public eye. Every single talk show host does an impersonation of him. He is ubiquitous to the point of overkill, and that's not good for an actor to take on a character that's so indelible. I was once offered to do the Scarecrow, a play version of The Wizard of Oz. And I thought, oh my gosh, that'll be exciting. How fun will that be? Until I thought about it and realized, wait a second, that character is so specific and indelible in the minds of everyone who's ever watched Wizard of Oz. If I didn't do an impersonation of Ray Bolger doing the Scarecrow, I'd be booed because people would go, oh, that's not the Scarecrow. So it didn't leave any room for the actor to carve out my impression or my sensibility of where the Scarecrow could be. You had to stand in line and march exactly to the drumbeat of what that movie role did. So then I realized, oh, no, that's a trap. I don't want to do that role. And I think the same thing is right now for Trump until 10 years from now. If you ask me that five to 10 years from now, hopefully when he's no longer in the public eye —

I started and ran a national nonprofit called Venture for America that recruited enterprising college graduates to help grow businesses in Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, New Orleans, Birmingham, Baltimore, and nine other American cities. We helped create several thousand jobs. I'm very, very proud of that. But I realize that the jobs we were creating were only going to apply for a small slice of the population. And these jobs were pouring water into a bathtub that has a giant hole ripped in the bottom. I'm running for president to let America know that it is not our imagination, the water is rushing out of the bathtub. Immigrants have nothing to do with it. It's the fact that we're going through the greatest economic transformation.
The books The Times analyzed were published in 2016 or later and have been widely adopted for eighth and 11th graders, though publishers declined to share sales figures. Each text has editions for Texas and California, among other states, customized to satisfy policymakers with different priorities.
Still, more than any group of its time, the Kingston Trio captured the youthful optimism of the Kennedy years. The title song of a 1962 album was The New Frontier, echoing President John F. Kennedy's own phrase and alluding to his inaugural address with the lyrics Let the word go forth from this day on/A new generation has been born.
I am a police. That may sound like an unusual statement--or an unusual construction. But it's a parlance we have. Among ourselves, we would never say I am a policeman or I am a policewoman or I am a police officer. We would just say I am a police. I am a police. I am a police and my name is Detective Mike Hoolihan. And I am a woman, also.
In 1954, not long after Mr. Hefner founded Playboy in Chicago, he met Mr. Lownes, a dapper and sophisticated man-about-Chicago, Frank Brady wrote in the 1974 biography Hefner.

Once the program got underway, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign sought to hit a lot of notes, with speeches touching on a range of issues — gun violence, climate change, marriage equality, reproductive rights and the federal courts.
The judge said the case had hinged on Mr. Zhao's mental state at the time of the shooting and whether he had the intent necessary for the crime to qualify as murder.
I mean, ultimately, I'm asking all these questions because I think a lot of people's reaction to this incident, above all, is, why did a man who was found asleep in a Wendy's drive-through — a man who was not armed when this interaction began, and a man who really just wanted to go home — why did he end up dead at the end of this encounter and at the hands of police?
The question is, what is the means to creating those jobs? What I'm suggesting is that if you were to put $12,000 a year into the hands of every American adult … Let's say there's a town in Missouri of 10,000 people. Let's say after I'm president, their disposable income goes up by $10 million a month. Where is that money going to go? It's going to go into car repairs, day care expenses, Little League sign-ups, the occasional night out.
For years, a college friend (in her 50s) has forbidden me from telling anyone we went to school together. Since moving to Hollywood, she deducted 10 years from her age (some of it with cosmetic surgery) to preserve her writing career, she claims. She is afraid that my salt-and-pepper hair will bust her. Lately, she has been mostly out of touch. But the implication that I look so much older than her has rankled for years. When I confided my hurt feelings to her, she was unapologetic. Blame the industry and ageism, she said, not her. Do I have a right to feel hurt?
I think you use a broad brush. When I first took over in Florida — the union, when I was first elected as a president — I lost members, because I refused to lie for them to try to keep their jobs.
So if you had, for example, a rule that said, Look, the government is allowed to match whatever salary a private sector employee is being offered, then you'd have more success. If you said, Look, you don't need to move to Washington, D.C., and sit in the thing that was built decades ago, that's like solace, and you have this giant parking lot and you just feel miserable being there for like a day, let alone a career.
It's a question that kept coming to mind as I read My War Criminal: Personal Encounters With an Architect of Genocide, Jessica Stern's mystifying account of her conversations with Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader who was convicted in 2016 of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, and is serving a life sentence in prison at The Hague. Stern, a scholar of terrorism and trauma who served on President Bill Clinton's National Security Council, conducted 12 interviews with Karadzic over the course of two years — making hers the first such study, she says, of a leader tried for war crimes at an international tribunal since the Nazis were evaluated at Nuremberg.
So it was with some apparent humility — and then plenty of residual swagger — that Mr. Biden, days off a fourth-place debacle in Iowa, opened Friday night's debate with an unusual prediction: He would probably do some more losing next week.
The world, as we know, divides unequally between those who love aspic (not too many) and those who loathe and fear it (most). — Laurie Colwin, More Home Cooking
The show's advance sales, once hefty, are now zero. The lead producer says she expects to spend at least $3 million to restart the show on Broadway. But hope is increasingly replacing despair.
Except for the cheating part, Ms. Dunn said, Owen bears many resemblances to her husband, the writer and editor Peter Stevenson, who is also the model for the husband in American Housewife. The two live in Garrison, N.Y. with their young children, one of whom is autistic and is the inspiration for the son in The Arrangement.
When I say I don't see race, that means I treat everybody as the same. But it doesn't mean that I don't see the struggles that other people have. And that is, that's the difference. And if that offends somebody, I apologize to that. But what I mean is, they're a human being. But it's not that I don't see that there's racism. I'm not saying that there isn't. What I said to you is, I don't see it as far as I don't do it. Me, as my person — me, as Vince Champion — I do not subscribe to that type of stuff. And you know, it's interesting. We're sitting there having this conversation, but nobody really wants to talk about how many times officers have stepped in and protected people from racism. And nobody knows about it, because, you know why? Because that's our job. And you talk about seeing it? Absolutely, we see it. It just seems like everybody wants to make people talk different and act different, when you asked the question.
When Bernice Sandler was a schoolgirl in the 1930s and '40s, she was annoyed that she was not allowed to do things that boys could do, like be a crossing guard, fill the inkwells or operate the slide projector.
The Spanish Socialist Party confirmed her death, saying emergency services had discovered her body. An autopsy was to be performed. Ms. Chacón was known to have had a congenital heart condition.
I mean, you could make it so it's analogous to what happened in the tobacco industry, where there's a certain level of revenue that gets set aside and then you have various public service announcements.

I asked some of those involved in preparing the A.P.A. guidelines for their response to criticisms of the report, including Pinker's.
The world is, as everyone knows, going to hell, but there's still the nervous thrill of waiting to see precisely which dark force will take us down. Will the economy collapse first, the ice sheets melt first, or chaos and war envelop us first?
Rita Vidaurri, who became famous across Latin America as a ranchera singer in the 1940s and '50s and stopped performing at the height of her renown, only to rekindle her career when she was nearing 80, died on Jan. 16 in San Antonio. She was 94.
They flock to Donut — a particularly cute dog, he says — and he often finds himself surrounded by a gaggle of young women who want to know how old she is (4), if he raised her from a puppy (yes) and if they can pet her (sure).
Despite Proust's silences and lapses on the subject of his mother's religion, it would be unfair, especially in light of the rampant anti-Semitism of turn-of-the-century France, to say that he was unique or even extreme in his prejudice against Jews. And yet his anti-Semitism is more than curious, given his love for his mother and given, after her death, something very much like a religious cult that he developed around her. His mother, out of respect for her parents, had remained faithful to their religion, and Proust revered her and her relatives; after her death he regretted that he was too ill to visit her grave and the graves of her parents and uncle in the Jewish cemetery and to mark each visit with a stone. More important, although he had many friends among the aristocracy whom he had assiduously cultivated, nevertheless when he was forced to take sides during the Dreyfus Affair, which had begun in 1894 and erupted in 1898, he chose to sign a petition prominently printed in a newspaper calling for a retrial.
For the migration authorities, it is a job, said Melvin Gómez, 18, who is from the Mexican state of Chiapas. For Mexicans and Central Americans, immigration is a dream.
A critique of President Obama's financial policies by Matt Stoller, of the Open Markets Institute, argues that the Obama administration let banking executives off the hook for their role in the financial crisis and enabled nine million foreclosures.
Mr. Weinstein's lawyers have long made it clear that they intend to discredit his accusers by focusing on emails that suggest the producer's relationship with the women was consensual and had lasted long after the alleged crimes.
Well, I guess the first reaction I had was that it's kind of interesting that after 27 years at this newspaper, I have risen up to the exalted position of being a gossip reporter.
Sharing a common language and literary heritage, the British and American Catholic converts followed each other's progress closely. In both countries Catholics were a numerical minority, more or less resented by the Protestant majority and sometimes victimized by anti-Catholic uprisings, anti-Catholic political organizations such as the Know-Nothings, and a general cultural antipathy to all aspects of popery. Because Catholicism was a minority religion in the English-speaking nations, its adherents tended to cleave to one another and to respect their clergy. Anticlericalism, a fact of life in Italy, France, and Mexico, was very rare in Britain and America, although English-speaking Catholics had good reason to think that the Catholic hierarchy in Rome did not understand the situation in their nations. They sometimes found it vexing to act upon Vatican directives that had no relevance to their situation. Convert intellectuals responded to their shared problems by encouraging and aiding one another. A regular traffic developed as they crossed and recrossed the Atlantic to confer, teach, and spread the word in each other's nations.
Everyone knows my flagship proposal is this Freedom Dividend of $1,000 a month for every American adult, which is not a new idea. And it's not my idea. Thomas Paine was for it at the founding of the country. Martin Luther King fought for it and was fighting for it when he was assassinated. So after I'm the nominee and I defeat Donald Trump, everyone will know that I'm in the White House because of the Freedom Dividend.
From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.
Occasionally during class, I would comment that it took courage to have conversations about, for instance, the role that religion played in shaping expectations for appropriate female behavior. The students didn't think of themselves as brave, however; they just enjoyed the conversations. Maybe they didn't think of conversations as brave because for each of them, the decision to study at New York University Abu Dhabi was itself an individually brave, even radical, break with convention.
Ms. Harris did not have children. In her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in August, Ms. Harris spoke about her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, an immigrant who came to California as a teenager and raised Kamala and her sister, Maya, after she and their father divorced. For most of Ms. Harris's life, it was the three of them. When Maya became pregnant at 17 with her daughter, Meena, it became four. When their family gathers this week in Washington, it will be the first time they've all seen each other in more than two months. The last time was the week of the election, gathered at a house in Delaware, where they passed the time with games, karaoke, food — and waited, anxiously, for the official results to come in. There was one night that just turned into a dance party, Cole said. In other words, just a family hanging out — hoping for history to be made.

In 1990, 12 European countries had some form of a wealth tax, while today only three have kept the policy — Norway, Spain and Switzerland. Reports by the O.E.C.D. and others have found that the tax led to an exodus of the wealthy and didn't raise as much revenue as anticipated.

Immigration and nativism are major themes in American history textbooks. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Continuity and Change, California, P. 736 California includes an excerpt from a novel about a Dominican-American family. McGraw-Hill, United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 609 In the same place, Texas highlights the voice of a Border Patrol agent.
And, not incidentally, to the locals, from whom she intends to pluck a new crop of devotees, like the frenzied Bacchae of ancient days. She sets her sights on a group of female pals, neighbors on a comfortable cul-de-sac who weathered the last lethal storm together.
Yeah, there you go. You have the technology caught up. The screens are phenomenally clear and beautiful. They're much cheaper. And the sound in the scale of it — you're watching from your living room — it's almost the same scale as if you were in the theater.
It's a progressive Protestant church. We primarily go upstate, where we have a house in a town called New Paltz. They've got a rainbow flag up front. It's a very welcoming community.
But if there's one aspect of homicide work that women do about a thousand times better than men it's riding a note. Women are good at that--at breaking the news. Men fuck it up because of the way they always handle emotion. They always have to act the n.o.d., so they come on like a preacher or a town crier, or all numb and hypnotized like someone reading off a list of commodity futures or bowling scores. Then halfway through it hits them what they're doing and you can tell they're close to losing it. I've seen beat cops burst out laughing in the face of some poor little schnook whose wife just walked under a Mack truck. At such moments, men realize that they're impostors, and then anything can happen. Whereas I would say that women feel the true weight of the thing immediately and after that it's a difficult event but not an unnatural one. Sometimes, of course, they crack up laughing--I mean the supposedly bereaved. You're just getting into your my-sad-duty routine and they're waking up the neighbors at three in the morning to pop a party.
When Mr. Bentley ran for governor in 2010, Christian voters saw extraordinary promise in the obscure lawmaker from Tuscaloosa who liked to tell people about how Bear Bryant, the revered University of Alabama football coach, had been one of his patients. He seemed oddly ordinary, the politician who was thought to be tailor-made for a state increasingly frustrated by decades of corruption in Montgomery.
A report released by PEN America in November found that more than 1,800 local print outlets have closed since 2004, and at least 200 counties have no newspaper.
There was no outrunning pasts — that was what I saw now. There was no papering over flaws with research and interviews. When I had interviewed the wife about her infidelity, I had inwardly judged her for what she had done. Or maybe I had been judging myself, predicting all along that this would happen.
Bernard Grofman, a political scientist at the University of California, Irvine, put it this way in an email:

Less auspicious was Mr. van Zweden's conducting on Wednesday night at David Geffen Hall. The concert, a program pairing the New York premiere of a short, recent work by John Luther Adams with a concert performance of Act I from Wagner's Die Walküre, was an opportunity to find out more about what he might bring to the Philharmonic, and to New York audiences. If anything, Mr. van Zweden can be too feisty and forceful in his performances of the standard repertory. So I was surprised that his account of this 70-minute Wagner act often lacked tension and urgency.
This was an interesting one. It didn't make the cut. It didn't make it. I turned it down twice.
I think his power was determination. He's faced with the idea of his demise within two years. He has a son with special needs. He as a child on the way and a wife, and he has no means of supporting them. When he's on his way out, his body will diminish. His wife will have to wipe his drool and empty his bedpan. His children will only know him as that skinny, sickly man in the other bedroom, and then he's gone. And that's just not what he wants. So his determination to change the text of his life was what drove him. And then what he discovers, purely accidentally, is that he's really good at it, and his ego came in and took control. You played the clip where he says, Say my name — and you're goddamn right. He's now fully embraced with that new persona. It was dormant within him, apparently, and that had awakened.
This is — I mean, this is going to make me very sad to say, but I feel like I had an arc or a relationship with President Obama, where it was inspirational when he won. I was celebrating with my wife in the streets. And then over the years I began to feel like we'd missed a great opportunity. So, I'd say there was some heartbreak attached to that. And I worked with the president afterward, and I still admire him a great deal, but I think we could have done a lot more, and I don't think opportunities like that come along very often.
The California edition does not mention Solyndra or the other nations. However, it does include a section on the threat to American states and cities from rising sea levels, noting that the impact on tourism in Florida could hurt that state's economy, and that transportation networks and buildings could be threatened.
I guess, yeah, something. But the platforms don't want to reveal those numbers.
You can build it around the town library, because a lot of them have this bulletin board that serves as the skeleton of a local paper when the local paper has gone out of business. A lot of these papers would be able to get by if they did not have to generate stock market level returns for hedge fund owners and private equity owners. If you had a cooperative model and it's made a certain amount of money, spent a certain amount of money, ran as a nonprofit, you could restore and sustain local journalism and thousands of communities, but it will not happen without government support. It just won't.
His wife, Jani, said the cause was Parkinson's disease.
I made a list of about 20 possible theme entries of varying lengths. In addition, I was determined to hide our names somewhere in the grid, as well as somehow create an attribution to my father who passed away over the summer. More on that last part in a bit.
La Sirena's décor plays off the '60s architecture with a retro flair. This could be a Fellini set, right? Look at that floor, look at that lighting, look at the Caesarstone walls, says Batali, surveying the restaurant from the corner of its expansive bar. (Batali has admitted that La Sirena's opulence had a high price: Originally set to open months ago, the restaurant ballooned millions over budget.) This is a different beast for us, he says. Serving all the way through the day is something that is going to give us more fun to play around with. Eventually we'll have a high tea in the afternoon. The world has changed a lot, and we're embracing it. Batali is also considering limiting meals to the tables, except for a cart that carries salami, Cravero Parmigiano Reggiano and marinated olives. I like the idea of a stand-alone bar, because if I'm at a hotel, I don't want to be aced out by 34 seats of people eating their dinner. I want to go have drinks.
In this second-echelon American city, mildly famed for its Jap-financed Babel Tower, its harbors and marinas, its university, its futuristically enlightened corporations (computer software, aerospace, pharmaceuticals), its high unemployment, and its catastrophic inner-city taxpayer flight, a homicide police works maybe a dozen murders per year. Sometimes you're a primary investigator on the case, sometimes a secondary. I worked one hundred murders. My clearance rate was just above average. I could read a crime scene, and, more than once, I was described as an exceptional interrogator. My paperwork was outstanding. When I came to CID from the Southern everybody expected my reports to be district quality. But they were downtown quality, right from the start. And I sought to improve still further and gave it a hundred percent. One time I did a very, very competent job, collating two rival accounts of a hot-potato homicide in the Seventy-Three: One witness/suspect versus another witness/suspect. Compared to what you guys give me to read, pronounced Detective Sergeant Henrik Overmars, brandishing my report at the whole squad, this is fucking oratory. It's goddamn Cicero versus Robespierre. I did the work as best I could until I entered my own end-zone and couldn't do it anymore. In my time, I have come in on the aftermath of maybe a thousand suspicious deaths, most of which turned out to be suicides or accidentals or plain unattendeds. So I've seen them all: Jumpers, stumpers, dumpers, dunkers, bleeders, floaters, poppers, bursters. I have seen the bodies of bludgeoned one-year-olds.
Thousands--no one knows how many--trampled through fences and over guards to surround the silvery plane and to acclaim, in a wild outburst of emotion, the first man to fly the Atlantic solo nonstop from the United States to Europe--a feat that was equivalent in the public mind then to the first human step on the moon 42 years later. Icarus had at last succeeded, a daring man alone had attained the unattainable. What enhanced the fear for many was that Lindbergh was a tall, handsome bachelor with a becoming smile, an errant lock of blond hair over his forehead and a pleasing outward modesty and guilelessness. He was the flawless El Cid, the gleaming Galahad, Frank Merriwell in the flesh. The delirium that engulfed Paris swirled out over the civilized world. Banner headlines heralded the event. Medals galore were bestowed on Lindbergh. He was gushed over, adulated, worshiped, feted in France, Belgium and Britain. President Calvin Coolidge sent the cruiser Memphis, flagship of the United States European Fleet, to bring him and the Spirit of St. Louis back to the United States and later awarded him the Medal of Honor, previously reserved only for military heroes. And already a captain in the United States Officers Reserve Corps, Lindbergh was jumped to a full colonel. As the cruiser steamed up Chesapeake Bay, she was met by four destroyers, two Army blimps and 40 airplanes from the Army, Navy and Marine Corps.
But where is Quentin Tarantino, who has won two screenwriting Oscars and took the Globes' screenplay prize for Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood? Since he has refused to join the Writers Guild, the group has ruled him ineligible for nominations. Eligibility requirements also excluded films like The Farewell and Pain and Glory, both of which should remain in the Oscar race.
Before his accident, he was often the life of the party, cajoling friends into dance competitions. He designed an obstacle course for my birthday, made a glow-in-the-dark hula hoop to use at our annual big group camping trips and organized 10 grown men to dance to Beyoncé's Single Ladies for my bachelorette party. Now he tired easily in social situations and would nap in a quiet room or sit with his eyes closed in the corner.

Mr. Yang has a fervent online following that calls itself the Yang Gang.
AY: Yeah. And I will say on a personal level, I spent seven years recruiting some of our top educational products to Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis. So I have seen that essentially the tide has turned in the direction it's gone and we should not be relying upon the government as the primary employer of a lot of this tech talent. We have to face facts and say, at this point, most of the intellectual capital is being attracted to these private firms and we need to instead try and support and work with the private firms.
Ms. Chase was one of a number of correspondents hired by network and local television news departments — along with Connie Chung, Cassie Mackin, Marya McLaughlin, Virginia Sherwood, Lesley Stahl and others — at a time when women were striving to be taken seriously and to defy being typecast as eye candy for male viewers.

On the 60th anniversary of the Cuban revolution, which the ruling Communist Party celebrated on Tuesday, the island nation is stable, having overcome such existential threats as the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 and a half-century of diplomatic isolation and withering economic sanctions imposed by the United States.
News reports: A Times report detailed how, after Mr. Trump fired James Comey as F.B.I. director, the bureau became so concerned by the president's behavior that they took the aggressive step of opening a counterintelligence inquiry into whether he had been working on behalf of Russia.
Patricia Arquette, winning for her supporting role in the Hulu limited series The Act, offered a stern dose of reality, reminding everyone that, among other things, America was on the brink of war and that President Trump had tweeted about destroying Iranian cultural sites earlier in the night.
She traces her feelings about money to her grandmother, who raised her and her brother until Anna was 12. They lived in servants' quarters in a white neighborhood near downtown Dallas.
Mr. Yang has argued that his Freedom Dividend is one answer to the needs of the millions who will lose their jobs to automation.
I really feel like I'm in love. I'm engaged, and I'm getting ready to get married.
Mr. Dillard said it was time for the left to do some soul searching. Take political parties out of it; that imagery and that behavior still exists today, he said. I do believe that there are probably still Democrats who have the same types of situations, same types of backgrounds as we discovered with Ralph Northam.
In an exclusive interview with Andrew, the money management giant's chief, Larry Fink, discussed his decision to make climate change a focus of BlackRock's investment strategy. The shift could reshape how Wall Street invests.
Mr. Yang's campaign estimates that federally regulating the U.S. online poker market could raise $2.2 billion just in its first year. The campaign also argues that federal regulation would make it easier to combat money laundering.
KK: Do you believe in government subsidies for journalism?
The Animators covers familiar debut-novel territory: the search for identity, the desire for success, the bewildering experiences of small-town misfits leaving home for the bright lights of New York City. But Whitaker turns these motifs on their heads simply by changing the direction of the road and populating it with women. New York success is left behind in favor of rural America — where a man will hit a woman in public just as easily as he'll open the door for her — a place sketched out with convincing ease by Whitaker, a Kentucky native. Sharon, who begins as an updated version of Sal Paradise or Nick Carraway, manages to draw herself (literally) into the starring role of her life and work, instead of simply chronicling the lives of those around her.
Democrats and progressives will be so thrilled to have defeated Donald Trump, they will love the fact that we're going to put buying power into families' hands, make children stronger and healthier. But here's the great thing: The Republicans will look up and say, Wait a minute, do I hate the Freedom Dividend? And they look up, and they notice only one state's had a dividend for almost 40 years, and it's Alaska, a deep red conservative state, that was passed by a Republican governor.
On many of these recordings the accompanying musicians were members of Count Basie's band, a group with which she felt a special affinity. She was particularly close to Mr. Basie's tenor saxophonist, the late Lester Young. It was Mr. Young who gave her the nickname by which she was known in jazz circles--Lady Day. She in turn created the name by which Mr. Young was identified by jazz bands, Pres. She was the vocalist with the Basie band for a brief time during 1937 and the next year she signed for several months with Artie Shaw's band. Miss Holiday came into her own as a singing star when she appeared at Cafe Society in New York in 1938 for the major part of the year. It was at Cafe Society that she introduced one of her best-known songs, Strange Fruit, a biting depiction of a lynching written by Lewis Allen. During that engagement, too, she established trade-marks that followed her for many years--the swatch of gardenias in her hair, her fingers snapping lazily with the rhythm, her head cocked back at a jaunty angle as she sang. Arrested in 1947 In 1947, a cloud that had been gathering over Miss Holiday and which was to cover the rest of her career, burst on her. She was arrested for a narcotics violation and, at her own request, was committed to a Federal rehabilitation establishment at Alderson, W. Va., for a year and a day in an attempt to rid herself of the habit.
The 432-to-202 vote was the biggest loss in the House of Commons in recent history for a prime minister. The turn of events thrusts Britain into further political chaos just 10 weeks before the country's scheduled exit from the E.U. Mrs. May above center.

Ada's voices don't just talk to her; they fight with her during the novel's narration in a moving portrayal of a struggle against something that exists within, a mental anguish that no amount of reasoning can conquer. More powerful than Emezi's prose, though, is what it brings to the real world. Eating disorders, cutting, depression, suicide, manic depression — in the popular imagination, all these things are most often seen as the struggles of young, wealthy, white American women. This novel expands the universe of mental illness to include women of color and other ethnicities. Rooting Ada's story in Igbo cosmology forces us to further question our paradigm for what causes mental illness and how it manifests. It causes us to question science and reason.
In the 1990s, a series of private reports and studies found that Roman Catholic nuns were being sexually abused by priests or bishops. But only now is the issue seeing the light of day, after Pope Francis acknowledged the problem this week.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, like Mr. Yang, has argued that the country's approach to antitrust regulation is outmoded. In early 2019, the Federal Trade Commission created a new task force focused on monitoring competition in technology markets, which the foundation celebrated as a step toward modernizing antitrust.
With so much information at our kids' disposal — my kids are now 11 and 9 and fully understand how to use the internet — it's absolutely not the time to abdicate on talking about the uncomfortable truths, whether it's sex and consent, racism, gun violence or suicide.

I stepped forward but he seemed to take a pass on the hug I was offering him and he kept his chin down as we slid off his coat. The head staying low when he sat in the leather chair. I went back of my desk and said,

A Zionist and social activist, Rabbi Eckstein was often described as a bridge builder, an epithet that became the title of an authorized biography published in 2015. He also caused concern among Jews who were wary of the motives of evangelicals, the main source of the contributions.
Yes. I have three major pro-journalism proposals on my website, including federally funding journalists for every congressional district, billions of dollars in grants to help transition local journalism. Matching grants, so you're not like saying, Hey, we're going to do this. But matching grants to help transition them to cooperative models of ownership to nonprofit and philanthropic models.
Each of these systems is navigating the pandemic on its own, meaning the experience of a child in one county can be completely different from the one right next to it. Soon after the pandemic took hold, for instance, Florida's child welfare system began conducting the bulk of the work certifying foster parents and placing children in their homes remotely. In New York, the system ground to a halt. For a long while, the courts here were just not doing anything virtually, said Shantell Lewis, a recruiter with the Wendy's Wonderful Kids program, which focuses on finding placements for older foster youth, at a Brooklyn nonprofit called MercyFirst. Though New York has more recently allowed work to be conducted virtually, the state has a considerable backlog. Many child welfare professionals are also concerned about older youth emancipating from foster care, when local governments are no longer bound to provide financial assistance. This abrupt transition into adulthood, between 18 and 21 depending on the state, in the very best of times represents a significant challenge for roughly 20,000 young people each year. But today, those aging out of foster care are aging in to a country gripped by an ongoing pandemic and crippled economy. When a young person ages out of the system, we have in many ways already failed them, said Rita Soronen, president and chief executive of the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption.
Nice is a word used by many of the nearly 18,000 residents to describe Colonia, one of 10 communities that make up Woodbridge Township in Middlesex County. The solid schools, reasonably priced housing and accessible transportation have made Colonia popular with many buyers leaving New York City or North Jersey over the past year.
Mr. Cuomo has also favored a bill that would close the so-called L.L.C. loophole, which allows corporate interests to funnel almost unlimited amounts of money into campaigns through various anonymous limited liability companies. The loophole has been a bête noire of good government groups for years, but has been utilized by various powerful politicians in the state, including Mr. Cuomo, who has been one of its biggest beneficiaries.
The next day she wrote, I appreciate all you do for me, it shows. And five days later, she wrote, It would be great to see you later and catch up.
That distinction has made Jersey a popular tax haven, but its financial laws have not always kept up with the times: Under its current tax law, introduced in 1928, only the husband in a heterosexual marriage can pay taxes, with his wife's earnings considered part of his income. She has needed his permission to be treated separately or even to discuss her financial affairs with the tax office.
I'm the only one of the halftime performers who actually risks his life, you know? he said. If I fall, I'm probably not getting up.

Our economy is breaking down on all levels. Again, if you are fortunate enough to graduate from college today, you're in the top third of the population, you're graduating with tens of thousands in school loans very, very often, and there's a 40 to 44 percent chance you're going to do a job that does not require your college degree. That's if you're one of the winners in our society today. I spent seven years working with, frankly, some of the top educational products in our country. I saw that even the winners are not winning right now. And so imagine if you're a nonwinner, what this looks like.
And then that was it, I knew I'd lost. Not lost, but won. I'd won the life. Immediately I said, 'Yes.' I was just flooded with peace. The process known as discernment, by which a seminarian determines whether the call to the priesthood is real and lasting, continues until the day of his diaconate ordination, when he makes the promises of celibacy and obedience. On the wall of Dobbins's room is a photograph of his and Bashista's diaconate class four years ago; Dobbins has pasted smiley-face stickers over the heads of the 10 -- out of 42 -- who have left. Some are not actually gone; they're taking pastoral or spiritual years required by their dioceses, or have joined religious orders; others are now married and fathers, including one of Bashista's former roommates. Bashista's views on celibacy have changed. Now he regards it as a crucial aspect of his priesthood, which will not be a job so much as a way of life -- a marriage to the church. (Some priests actually wear wedding rings after their ordinations.) Some days I'll think: What if I was back in the architecture firm? Would I be a partner now? Married? Have kids? he said. But the match has been made. One reason I had thoughts of marriage with this one girl was that connection, that longing to be with this person. And then that feeling was not sustained. It was strong, it was present, but it wasn't deep. And this is deep.
KK: So I assume you're referring to [your] universal basic income plan. Your campaign platform, you have tons and tons of proposals, everything from U.B.I. to universal daylight saving time. Plans don't really mean anything unless you have priorities. What would you do immediately when you enter office? What would be first on your agenda? What would you want to accomplish in the first 100 days?
Alex Kingsbury: Another thing the country's invested in quite a lot is the military, and as commander in chief, you'd be in charge of that. Can you tell me how many aircraft carriers the United States Navy has?
In the '70s or '80s, your labor and overall productivity were more or less in lock step. And we still pretend that if someone wakes up in the morning and says, Hey, I need to put food on the table, he can go out to his main street, he can sell his time for money at some hourly rate, and then he'll be able to make a good enough living so he can feed his family, raise kids and the rest of it. That has become progressively less true over the last 40 years, unfortunately, where wages have stagnated while productivity has gone up and up, and that's going to accelerate because of the convergence of capital and technology now, in unprecedented ways.
But Suzanne Agee and others close to Mr. Agee disputed the Alzheimer's diagnosis and said he was mentally competent. In an Oct. 29 email exchange, Bruce A. Miroglio, a lawyer and friend to the couple, wrote that Ms. Cunningham Agee had retained counsel, to help her get Bill declared incompetent. He wrote, Bill is still competent. Mr. Agee was never declared mentally incompetent by the courts.
On the way out, I told the receptionist I was sorry if I had been rude. I've had a bad morning, I said. It was true: I've had bad mornings for three years.
And then the government would need to have enough auditors to verify everything that was submitted. In 2018, for example, an estimated 4,000 estate tax returns will be filed, with tax owed on 1,900 of them. That's a tenth the number of tax returns that would be filed under Ms. Warren's wealth tax plan.
Mr. Biden's ability to steer and stay the course calmly through turbulence is a testament, say friends and family, to both Mr. Biden's unabashed optimism and his deep belief in the importance of American political norms and traditions. The man who came to Washington at age 30 as one of the youngest senators in history now enters the White House as the oldest president in history, with more experience in government and legislating to guide his path than any leader in decades.
Wow, these questions are really fun. Who's broken my heart?

Mr. Yang's campaign estimates that federally regulating the U.S. online poker market could raise $2.2 billion just in its first year. The campaign also argues that federal regulation would make it easier to combat money laundering.
The numbers. So keep in mind, I didn't just wake up and say, Hey, technology is changing the world. I spent seven years working in Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis, Baltimore and other cities that have been blasted by the waves of automation.
It's been going on far too long, the narrator declares. We can't laugh it off.
What followed was a whirlwind public life for an academic who had built his career in the lab but who soon became one of Britain's best-known scientists, popularizing cutting-edge technology through TV appearances and best-selling books that gave millions of people access to their distant pasts.
Nearly 60 of his voluptuous, perfectionist pen-and-wash drawings (out of some 800) have traveled from the National Library of France for Jean-Jacques Lequeu: Visionary Architect, a bewitching exhibition at the Morgan Library & Museum. (The show follows a larger show at the Petit Palais in Paris; another version was seen last year at the Menil Drawing Institute in Houston.) These painstaking sheets, capricious or perverse, steeped in powder blue and misty rose, are a remarkable achievement of the later Enlightenment — and yet they have much more to offer young architects today than a drawing lesson. When the building contracts dry up, you realize your one true client is desire.

The phenomenon isn't unique to Mr. Morrill and Donut. People with dogs are often perceived to be more approachable, happier and more empathetic, research shows. The presence of a dog can also serve as an indication a man is nurturing and capable of caregiving, said Dr. Helen Fisher, a senior research fellow at the Kinsey Institute and a chief adviser to Match.com. And that, she said, is a powerful mating signal.
ne afternoon last November, I went with Bashista to Arlington, and we visited the two-story suburban house where he grew up and where his parents still live, from which his father, an electrical engineer, commutes to his job at the Naval Research Lab in Washington. Modest and immaculate, with lots of carpeting and an abundance of pink and mauve in the decor, the Bashistas' home veritably thrummed with the quiet, vehement faith of his mother, Aileen, who looks like Bashista only fairer, with pale blue eyes and gold-rimmed glasses. Hefty painted statuettes of Christ and the Virgin Mary stood before a window in the kitchen, and in the living room, near a graduation photo of Bashista smiling over a giant bow tie, there was a small table covered with lace, where holy water, candles and a relic -- a bone of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, the first American-born saint -- were on display. I always prayed that the Lord would take my sons to be His holy priests, Aileen Bashista told me. You know it's nothing you deserve. It's God's gift. Bashista's younger brother, Christopher, a drummer until a car injury left him unable to play, now a senior at George Mason University who lives at home, had a different reaction: relief. Mom got her priest, he said. Aileen Bashista makes weekly visits to Seton High School, where Bashista's younger sister, Mary-Beth, is a senior, to teach rosary making. She is also a lay member of an order of Carmelite nuns.
He acknowledged the high price tag but said the nation could not afford to do anything less. The very health of our nation is at stake, Mr. Biden said, speaking from Delaware. We have to act and we have to act now. Here are some of the highlights of Mr. Biden's so-called American Rescue Plan: The rescue proposal would be financed entirely through increased federal borrowing, and flows from the idea that the virus and the recovery are intertwined.

Mr. Yang, a former technology executive and entrepreneur, has distinguished himself from Senator Sanders and the far left of the Democratic Party in making the case for a more humane capitalist system, what he calls human-centered capitalism.
Well, you're assuming that they didn't fire simultaneously. You don't know that, and we don't know that. You're assuming that he's fired the taser, and then Officer Rolfe shot. Well, nobody knows that, including the district attorney. You don't know when Officer Rolfe decided to squeeze the trigger. We don't know when Mr. Brooks decided to squeeze the trigger. Did they do it at the same time? Did they not? We don't know. We can find that out. So again, you're making an assumption that Brooks fired and then the officer fired. We just don't know that, and I can't make that assumption either.
AK: But one of his priorities has been to get our European allies to spend more money on their own defense. And I wonder if you think that that's a worthwhile goal and how you might go about it, if you agree that that's something that should be a priority for the United States.
Here's what else you need to know today.
Since impeachment, some Republicans have said Kevin McCarthy has not been loyal enough to the president. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California is entering his eighth term in the House. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times BAKERSFIELD, Calif. — Representative Kevin McCarthy of California has been pilloried nationally and throughout the state for being loyal to President Trump to the bitter end — voting to overturn the election results hours after a mob of the president's supporters stormed the Capitol and urging censure of the president instead of impeachment. Democrats and some Republicans called on him to step down. The anti-Trump Lincoln Project released an ad calling him a pathetic enabler and urging his staff to pack up your desk and leave that loser behind. A scathing Sacramento Bee editorial denounced him for having a soulless lack of principle and for abusing his authority to promote big, dangerous lies about the election. But in his home district — one of the most conservative in California — Mr. McCarthy has been under fire for not being loyal enough. The split illustrates the gulf between the national outrage over the violence at the Capitol and the local hold the president still has on conservative parts of the country. Mr. McCarthy's district, which includes the city of Bakersfield and most of Kern and Tulare Counties in the San Joaquin Valley south of Sacramento and north of Los Angeles, is a place where oil, agriculture and MAGA dominate.
Chicago classrooms are reopening Monday, but will most teachers show up? A playground at an elementary school in Chicago, where schools reopen Monday. Credit... Taylor Glascock for The New York Times Across the country, many big cities like New York have struggled to resume even limited in-person instruction, while a number, including Los Angeles, have simply given up on the idea, choosing to stick with all-remote education into the spring. Few places have seen as much acrimony over the issue as Chicago, whose public school system is the nation's third-largest. Now, with 6,000 prekindergarten and special education students preparing to return to the city's public school buildings on Monday for the first time since March, a question looms: How many of their teachers will be there to greet them? Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago has argued that giving parents the option of sending their children to school in person is critical to preventing some of the city's mostly poor and Black and Latino students from falling permanently behind. But the teachers' union has fiercely resisted the plan, arguing that schools are not safe while the coronavirus is surging. Over the past week, fewer than 60 percent of the roughly 2,000 teachers who were expected to return to their buildings to prepare for the arrival of students actually showed up. Janice K. Jackson, the chief executive of the school system that serves about 350,000 students, said on Friday that she was optimistic that most teachers would go to work on Monday.
David Zwick, who was instrumental in writing and securing passage of the Clean Water Act of 1972, and who founded the advocacy group Clean Water Action, died on Feb. 5 in Minneapolis. He was 75.
But jobs in finance and sales didn't pan out. His marriage fell apart, and a contentious divorce kept him from seeing his young daughter and two sons for long periods. Unemployed and homeless, he spent months living out of his Ford Fusion, he said in an interview with U.S.A. Swimming's website in 2018. He kept up his gym membership, he said, only so he would have a place to shower.
Detroit is a city of 680,000 people. Its peak population was 1.7 million. If you look this direction, you can see a thriving neighborhood, and then you turn 90 degrees and you see abandoned buildings as far as the eye can see. If we were adapting, you would see not multidecade low rates of interstate migration, which we have right now. You would not be seeing 80 percent of the country have multidecade low levels of business formation, which we have right now. You would not be seeing historic lows of business formation among young people, which we have right now. You would not see labor force participation at 62.9 percent, a multidecade low which we have right now. You would not see record-high levels of drug overdoses and suicides to the point that America's life expectancy has declined for three years in a row, which we have right now.
We have to be working toward China's second main priority, which is maintaining robust economic growth. So there are two goals. There are two primary goals that are sometimes in tension, of maintaining social order and maintaining robust economic growth. And the best way we can try and contain their behavior in Hong Kong is to say, Look, the economic costs are going to be very, very high. And the best way we can do that is to build global consensus around certain norms and behaviors.
But of course what it really sounds like is this, Abigail says, interrupting. When we then hear it unmusicalized, as clashing lines of dialogue, it's just awful chaos.

The day before, at a taco shop the brothers frequent up to twice a day when they're not on the road, John, 35 and sporting a bushy, red beard with a ball cap over his shaggy mane, joked that Don't Bring the Redneck Out in Me was the first official song we wrote that we thought, yeah, we've got it all figured out.

Her first film with him, and her fourth overall, was Les Cousins in 1959, and many others followed, including Les Biches in 1968, Just Before Nightfall in 1971 and Violette Nozière in 1978.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the federal government commissioned a series of experiments to look at how guaranteed income effects labor participation. Researchers discovered that a program like U.B.I. doesn't have the drastic effect on work that some might predict; households overall reduce their workload by roughly 13 percent, according to a paper in the Canadian Public Policy journal.
Starting in 1979, productivity and pay sharply diverged — productivity rose nearly 70 percent, while typical hourly pay essentially stagnated, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
The House acted on a crisp pre-Christmas Saturday when American politics seemed to be descending into the very cannibalism that Speaker Newt Gingrich had warned of when he was toppled a month ago.
There have always been infertile straight couples in need of donor sperm, but with the legalization of gay marriage and the rise of elective single motherhood, the market has expanded over the last decade. About 20 percent of sperm bank clients are heterosexual couples, 60 percent are gay women, and 20 percent are single moms by choice, the banks said.
In a written statement, McGraw-Hill said the full-page Border Patrol narrative was not included in the California edition because it would not fit beside the literary excerpt. And at the time the Texas edition was produced, six years ago, state standards called for students to analyze both legal and illegal immigration to the United States.
People were looking for something that was more grandfatherly, something that was more wise and trustworthy and less politically slick, said Angi Stalnaker, who was Mr. Bentley's campaign manager. They wanted someone that they could see themselves having Sunday dinner with, and, of the candidates in 2010, Robert Bentley was the one you could see inviting over for fried chicken and cornbread.
In 1990, 12 European countries had some form of a wealth tax, while today only three have kept the policy — Norway, Spain and Switzerland. Reports by the O.E.C.D. and others have found that the tax led to an exodus of the wealthy and didn't raise as much revenue as anticipated.
Conservatives have fought for schools to promote patriotism, highlight the influence of Christianity and celebrate the founding fathers. In a September speech, President Trump warned against a radical left that wants to erase American history, crush religious liberty, indoctrinate our students with left-wing ideology.

They started dating in 2017; by April of that year, they were a couple, splitting their time between his house in Morinville and hers in St. Albert.
Uber is literally advertising to schoolteachers saying, Hey, we've figured out schoolteachers make really good Uber drivers. And if you look at that situation, the headline unemployment rate says, Check, this person is employed. Heck, this person might be employed twice. The headline unemployment rate when Donald Trump was running for president, he castigated it as fake news, and then he got into office and all the sudden it became real news. He was right the first time. The number is almost intentionally designed to obscure any of the difficulties in the labor market. If I drop out of the labor market, I no longer count. I actually help the number.
I lived with both parents as a child, but somehow the earliest memory I have of my father is of calling him one night when I was 7 and he was traveling. We were three time zones apart, but my mother was able to reach him at his hotel room so I could tell him I could not sleep. I was worried about dying, the way other children might be afraid of the dark. I remember him consoling me, and his ability to be there for me — by phone, by any means necessary — grew as I grew.
The younger son of Peter M. Brant, an industrialist, publisher and art collector, and Stephanie Seymour, one of the original supermodels, Mr. Brant grew up around the glitterati of the style and art worlds. He was a familiar presence at fashion shows and international parties at a young age, attending the Met Gala at age 16. Vanity Fair called him a Little Lord Fauntleroy for his unapologetic willingness to enjoy his own good fortune and looks, and New York Magazine once referred to Mr. Brant and his older brother, Peter Brant II, as NYC's Most Beautiful Teenage Brothers; their social omnipresence seemed to invite a certain kind of hyperbole.
In his press conference, the district attorney came out and stated that Officer Brosnan, the second officer on the scene, had turned state witness, and he was going to testify against Officer Rolfe. That ended up not being true. Less than 10 minutes after that statement came out, the attorney for Officer Brosnan said that had never happened. He was not going to testify against the other officer. He never said he would turn state witness. He's never pled guilty to any charges. And he has cooperated with the D.A. — meaning answering questions and stuff — but he's never said that he would be state witness. So the question then becomes, if you're not telling the truth now or you're having inconsistencies, how can we believe your report? Or, did you just do a shoddy investigation? If that's the case, you should have allowed what we consider the professionals — which is an unbiased outside agency from Atlanta, the G.B.I. They're the state organization that does this.
Polls measure changing feelings, not steadfast principle. Polls would have rejected the Ten Commandments. Polls would have embraced slavery and ridiculed women's rights.
The ghost of a dead person must divide into many ghosts--to begin with. It is labor-intensive--to begin with. Because there are many bedrooms to visit, many sleepers to stand over.
Occasionally during class, I would comment that it took courage to have conversations about, for instance, the role that religion played in shaping expectations for appropriate female behavior. The students didn't think of themselves as brave, however; they just enjoyed the conversations. Maybe they didn't think of conversations as brave because for each of them, the decision to study at New York University Abu Dhabi was itself an individually brave, even radical, break with convention.
Ms. Holzer was offering shares not in theater productions but in a Toyota dealership in Indonesia and real estate in Spain. At the time, she insisted that she could have cleared things up if she had been allowed to travel to Indonesia. (Her passport had been taken away.)
The Scream is fading. And tiny samples of paint from the 1910 version of Edvard Munch's famous image of angst have been under the X-ray, the laser beam and even a high-powered electron microscope, as scientists have used cutting-edge technology to try to figure out why portions of the canvas that were a brilliant orangeish-yellow are now an ivory white.
After appearing on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts in 1952, the McGuire Sisters soared to national fame. They were regulars on Mr. Godfrey's morning shows for six years and remained one of the nation's most popular vocal groups into the 1960s, singing on television, in nightclubs and on records that sold millions, even as teenage rebellion, Elvis Presley and rock ′n' roll transformed the music world.
I got three marriage proposals, the problem was all of them were dudes over 60 years old, said Stephen Firth, the pub's manager.

He wrote of his own life in Big Little Man: In Search of My Asian Self. In the book, he addressed many of the stereotypes he had internalized as an Asian-American, having experienced them as a set of suspicions that seemed corroborated by everyday life.
He won that election, and then another in 2014. But Dianne Bentley filed for divorce the next year. Months later, an ousted state official accused Mr. Bentley of having an affair with Rebekah Caldwell Mason, a top aide and former beauty pageant contestant whom he had taught in Sunday school in Tuscaloosa. Lurid audio recordings became public, and on Friday, a special counsel concluded that the governor had committed an array of misdeeds to try to cover up the inappropriate relationship that had led to Mr. Bentley and Ms. Mason leaving their congregation.
The two-part, 20-episode first season of the animated fantasy spoof Disenchantment introduced the story of an unconventional princess nicknamed Bean (voiced by Abbi Jacobson), who'd rather have rowdy drunken adventures than marry some drippy prince. As the second two-part season begins, Bean's wild wanderings around the kingdom have caused major problems for her family, provoking a crisis. The show's creative team (led by The Simpsons and Futurama creator Matt Groening) clearly have fun riffing on the trappings of sword-and-sorcery sagas; but all the while they've been making a pretty good one of their own, with a story that gets more involving with each new batch of episodes.
THE END: INSIDE THE LAST DAYS OF THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE 9 p.m. on CNN and CNN International; also streaming on CNN.com/go. CNN Films follows President Obama and members of his staff from shortly after Election Day through his farewell address, as they define their legacy after eight years and prepare for the transition of power. Among those interviewed are Mr. Obama; Valerie Jarrett, his closest adviser; Cody Keenan, his chief speechwriter; Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary; Jen Psaki, its communications director; and Angella Reid, its chief usher (the head of household staff). To watch this program is to be impressed with the magnitude of what will happen this week, Neil Genzlinger wrote in The New York Times.
Right from the beginning, as their broker gives Alice and her husband, Nate, a tour of the 1940s house in fictional Greenville, Alice feels uneasy. Everything it stands for makes her feel nauseous. All she wants is to be back in her cramped apartment eating takeout. Nate has a different reaction altogether. The house is the logical next step in the narrative he's already written for them: wedding, apartment, suburbs, family. He wins, yes, because, like the other men who populate this book, he walks through the world expecting life would give him whatever he wanted simply because he asked for it. But also because he's the one bankrolling their life now, which sets up a new, prickly dynamic for Alice, making her feel like less of a partner.
In her illustrated story collection Boundless, Jillian Tamaki flips the script: To read the first and last of her kooky and elegant tales, you often must rotate the book 90 degrees. The stories' subjects — an eerie mirror Facebook; a promotional pitch for a skin care product — unfold with a deliciously wry feminist slant.
Dr. Glauber's seminal work addressed an area of research that had been largely ignored in quantum physics. For much of the first half of the 20th century, physicists had concentrated on trying to understand the nature of matter, neglecting the field of optics. That began to change with the development of the laser in 1960. Physicists wanted to understand how it worked vis-à-vis quantum mechanics, the mysterious rules that govern subatomic particles.
Harmful effects of unemployment are felt by men and women, but men are more likely to experience negative health effects including depression and increased risk of suicide.
The violence of the reaction to my naming these groups was significant and extremely interesting, he said 25 years later. In hindsight, I would not change my action. Lindbergh's attitude toward the Jews was matched by an adamantine stubbornness on other matters. These together sometimes cast him in an unfavorable public light. One example of his unwillingness to concede that he might have acted unwisely involved the Service Cross of the German Eagle, a civilian medal that was awarded him in 1938 by Hermann Goering, the Nazi leader, at the direction of Hitler. The presentation, a surprise to Lindbergh, was made at a stag dinner in the home of the American Ambassador to Berlin and was, he was told, in recognition of his services to aviation, especially his 1927 flight. The award was reported briefly in the newspapers and stirred little criticism. However, the night of the award Mrs. Lindbergh told her husband that it was the albatross, and she urged him to return it. Lindbergh took the position then and later that to do so would affront the Ambassador and Goering, as well, who was technically his host in Germany. Although he never wore the medal (he gave it to the Lindbergh collection of the Missouri Historical Society in St. Louis, along with other awards and trophies), it became an issue when he opposed American war involvement.
Ms. Hamoud and Ms. Labaki are entirely deserving of praise. They have made polished films with high production values, which are thoroughly engaging, often caustic and, at times, devastating. But they follow a path blazed by many women before them. Today they have a support system, which their predecessors lacked. The women before them worked away on their own, under much more dangerous conditions (including actual wars) and against much more pushback. But just like these contemporary Arab women directors, their work was acclaimed, welcomed and shown abroad, at leading European film festivals and on international movie screens. The output of the new wave of Arab female filmmakers — and even female writers and artists — should be viewed in the actual context of the history of Arab cinema, literature and art, and not with any misguided idea that these voices are emanating from a vacuum.
Mr. Yang started Venture for America in 2011, shortly after selling his test prep company to Kaplan. He said that he saw, in the wake of the financial crisis, how certain communities were rapidly losing jobs and wanted to create new work opportunities in those underserved areas.
He sang anthems of social lament and timeless wisdom, typically in Shona, Zimbabwe's predominant language, but also in English and Ndebele. His music pulled from traditional Shona rhythms and sounds while incorporating influences from South Africa's more cosmopolitan, jazz-inflected mbaqanga tradition, as well as African-American dance music. What resulted — a kind of soundtrack to Zimbabwean life in the late 20th century — became known as its own idiom, called Tuku music, after Mr. Mtukudzi's nickname.
The title of Joyce Carol Oates's new collection of stories, Beautiful Days, is drawn from Les Beaux Jours, a painting by Balthus of a girl reclining in a chair and examining herself in a hand mirror, while a faceless man tends the fireplace behind her. But it might equally refer to Fleuve Blue or Big Burnt, the first two stories in the book — which are about (among other things) the strange disconnection that separates our romantic lives from the rest of life. Fleuve Blue describes an affair between a prominent small-town lawyer and a younger woman, whom he first sees walking across a bridge. He thinks, I will marry her. That one. Except, of course, he's already married. Later, he offers her a ride when she gets caught wearing high heels in a downpour and they start meeting in the afternoon in a rented room. She told him it would be the inside-out of the rest of her life, her relationship with him. … She meant, what they had together was a counter-world. … 'Because I'm always lying. In that other life. In my real life. I tell people — I tell myself — I live for my children. I adore my children.'  Unsurprisingly, their affair turns out to be susceptible to the same sort of forces that she wants to escape in her real life — boredom and the passage of time.
I sure enough ate my share, said Mr. Hereford, 31, who grew up Charlottesville, Va., before moving to New Orleans in 2008 and working his way from line cook to chef de cuisine at Coquette, a respected contemporary Southern bistro. But it wasn't until I came to this city of po' boys that I began to consider the creative potential of a sandwich.
If Herzl's and Sartre's entirely negative view of the reason for Jewish survival were to persist even as we enter this new era of equality and acceptance, then Judaism would not deserve to endure. If Jewish life cannot thrive in an open environment of opportunity, choice, freethinking, affluence, success, and first-class status--if we really do need tsuris, czars, pogroms, poverty, insularity, closed minds, and anti-Semitism to keep us Jewish--then Jewish life as we know it will not, and should not, survive the first half of the twenty-first century. We have been persecuted long enough. The time has come to welcome the end of our victimization without fear that it will mean the end of our existence as a people. We must no longer pray for the czar's victory out of fear that the end of our collective tsuris and the success of individual Jews will mean the failure of Judaism.
I don't know who the goddess Gaya is, but that's not my God. I was just like, That's it. Click -- stopped the radio. Went over to the closet, pulled out my concert shirts and threw them in the trash can. Pulled out my James Taylor CD's -- dunk. See ya, James. Magat summed it up this way: You have to detach from these things, or you become numb to them. We're trying to live as a sign of contradiction in the world. But living as a sign of contradiction is not the same as retreating from the world altogether, and the seminarians struggle to achieve what they regard as the ideal balance: being in the world but not of it, a phrase they often repeat. They see themselves as witnesses -- testifying through their very presence and clerical attire to the Catholic Church and all that it holds true. Bashista provided an example: in the gym at Mount Saint Mary's, college students sometimes play music whose lyrics he finds objectionable. It's an opportunity, he said. It's a time to evangelize. You don't go up and rip the tape out, but you say: 'Can you share with me some of those words? I'm not sure I'm hearing them right.' A lot of times they don't even know what the words are. It's got to be proposing, not imposing, which is the tougher way. It's our Lord's way. Witnessing is crucial, say the seminarians, because the world is starving for the message they represent.
I want to say we raised maybe $5,000, and I was quite pleased. It was at a lounge.
Last summer, I made peace with my uncle. It was the most difficult experience I have had since I left prison. I called him on the first day of Eid, and I could hear the slightly panicked excitement in his voice as we exchanged greetings. He spoke faster than usual, as if trying to make up for lost time. The weight of the resentment I carried vanished as soon as the conversation turned to kids, marriage, health and the famous feast that my aunt makes every Eid. As I ended our five years of silence, I felt the same sensation of freedom I had experienced when I was released. Soon after, my mom told me that the call had done wonders for his morale and that he had accompanied her on a visit to my father, who remains in prison.
Eleanor Torrey West, who dedicated her life to preserving Ossabaw Island, a 26,000-acre inheritance off the coast of Georgia so large, lush and varied in terrain that visitors could walk among hardwood forests, palm tree stands and salt water marshes, died on Jan. 17 at her home in Savannah. She was 108.
Aisha Harris: Back in September, you actually spoke out on behalf of the comedian Shane Gillis, who had been hired on SNL and then was quickly fired after some racist comments were stirred up that he had made in the past on one of his podcasts. And you said you didn't want to be judged for something you had done 25 years ago. But Gillis's comments were maybe a year ago. So I'm curious as to, in your mind, how long of a period of time should it be before someone faces some sort of consequences for something they've done in the past?
Alex Tizon, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter whose well-received 2014 memoir documented his insecurities and alienation as a Filipino-American, was found dead on March 23 in his home in Eugene, Ore. He was 57.
At the end of the last century, Theodor Herzl called for a new Jewish state. As we approach the close of this cataclysmic century, I believe we need a new Jewish state of mind if we are to define and ensure the Jewish future, not only for our sake but for the sake of all humankind.
KK: I think we have some questions around economics.
gender differences were the result of biology (and thus unlikely to change) or societal norms. More than half of Republicans said biology determined differences in how men and women parented, expressed feelings or spent their free time. About two-thirds of Democrats described society as the primary driver of these differences.
And, boy, does Grand Horizons want to sell itself as comedy. Not witty comedy with its verbal arabesques, nor intellectual comedy with its Paris Review name-checks, nor meta-comedy with its scrambled plotlines — but the vanilla kind that once dominated commercial theater. It's not entirely meant as praise to say that this Second Stage production is a big-laugh, blue-joke, bourgeois lark of the type Neil Simon mastered until the times mastered him and the genre petered out.
The opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn put forward a motion of no confidence in Mrs. May, which Parliament will debate and vote on Wednesday. As things stand, the prime minister must return to Parliament by Monday to present a backup withdrawal plan.
JERUSALEM — Yechiel Eckstein, an Israeli-American rabbi whose organization has raised more than $1.5 billion for Israel by promoting closer ties with evangelical Christians abroad, died on Wednesday at his home in Jerusalem. He was 67.
So, that to me was the biggest missed opportunity in the Obama administration, and it happened very, very early on. I wish that they owned and reflected a little bit on the fact that maybe they could have done some things differently at that stage, because we're still angry. This country is still angry. I was so shocked by what happened in the financial crisis, I quit my job and started a national nonprofit and ran it for seven years. I had — my wife was pregnant. I mean, what happened to this country then is still tearing us apart.
The plan gives billions of dollars in aid to renters struggling to keep up with mounting unpaid liabilities to landlords, and it would give grants to millions of the hardest-hit small businesses.
I felt like I was a holding pattern until I got out of school, in terms of following my personal thread. But then in my last semester, one day I walked into the lunchroom and several people I knew but didn't like were all sitting together at the same table. It was an overwhelming experience to see them there. I couldn't control myself. I went up to painting class and I did a painting that really went beyond painting the model. It was a group of people that had sharp tongues and looked weird; it was not what you were supposed to paint in art school. That was the start of figuring out that I could paint what I wanted to paint, rather than what I was told to paint.
Andrew Yang in the spin room after the Democratic debate in Detroit. Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times
Mr. Yang was asked on CNN's The Van Jones Show about cancel culture and whether Americans have gone too far in the direction of a lack of grace or a lack of forgiveness. He responded: I'm new to politics, but I certainly would hate to be judged by something I did 25 years ago.
Ms. Bosworth does not recount these stories as a striding march through Manhattan and Hollywood. The Men in My Life attends just as fully to loneliness and darkness, to the slivers of dread that prickled her psyche. There is a good deal of talk in this book about what she calls the bereaved creature inside me.
So, she decided to place a personal ad in the Yale Alumni Magazine, inspired by her ties to the school and her upcoming 50th reunion from Bryn Mawr, from which she graduated cum laude. (She would have applied to Yale if women were accepted in 1964).
Whole paragraphs on redlining and restrictive deeds appear only in the California editions of textbooks, partly as a result of different state standards. Texas' social studies guidelines do not mention housing discrimination at all.
On Sunday, the secretary of health and human Services, Alex Azar, told NBC News that the coronavirus was on the verge of becoming an uncontainable crisis in the U.S.
Karamo Brown, the show's culture expert, playfully puts the hat on as Bobby Berk, the interior designer, watches slack-jawed. We're all going to make America great again, Cory says.
Morality clauses may be relatively new to mainstream publishing, but they have a long history. The entertainment industry started drafting them in 1921, when the silent-movie star Fatty Arbuckle, who had just signed a then-astonishing $1 million contract with Paramount Pictures, was accused of the rape and manslaughter of a girl at a party. Mr. Arbuckle was acquitted after two mistrials, but by then the public had soured on him, and the studios wanted out.

Because there is nothing but malice and exorbitant legal fees in the story of the 27-year-old Temur Akhmedov and the divorce of his parents, the Russian billionaire Farkhad Akhmedov and Tatiana Akhmedova. It is a feel-awful yarn for a feel-awful era, offering the unhappy spectacle — livestreamed in December from the Family Division of the High Court of London — of a mother testifying against her son, and vice versa, as she sues him for nearly $100 million in cash and assets.
The outcome of the convert intellectuals' labors was not what they themselves had hoped. Although for three or four generations they were highly influential within the Catholic Church, playing a crucial role in transforming English-language Catholicism, they were powerless to halt or reverse the dominant intellectual trends of their era. The church was certainly unable to resume the central place in Western intellectual life which it had enjoyed prior to the Reformation. While the new Catholics challenged non-Catholic scholars on the vital issues of the era, the non-Catholics rarely deigned even to notice them in return and made little effort to incorporate their insights into their work. For example, William George Ward, a friend of Newman's and a fiery controversialist, converted in 1845 and later became editor of the Dublin Review, one of the leading British Catholic journals. His biographer (and son) describes at length Ward's fifteen-year correspondence with John Stuart Mill, giving the impression that Ward had a large effect on the utilitarian philosopher's outlook. But no biographer of Mill has found evidence of this supposed influence, and it is likely that the Wards indulged in wishful thinking when they came to assess the importance of the correspondence to Mill's own life and work.
My team then had me take the helmet off and then tried to make my hair look good. So that's why I didn't show up with the helmet.
Mr. Trump likes to say that the economy has reached historic highs under his administration. However, life expectancy has been falling and other measures of well-being have declined, including rising rates of depression diagnosis.
Mr. Yang, a former technology executive and entrepreneur, has distinguished himself from Senator Sanders and the far left of the Democratic Party in making the case for a more humane capitalist system, what he calls human-centered capitalism.
Sandwiches are the stars at this 40-seat, no-reservation restaurant with street-front patio seating for 25 more, a former barbecue joint and a wings shop in the Irish Channel neighborhood. Inside, cinder block walls are painted sea-foam green and décor runs to thrift store whimsy. Patrons order at the counter and eat at sundry chrome dinettes off mismatched dishes (including plastic Disney plates), seasoning their food with kitschy vintage salt and pepper shakers.
So if you cannot learn from the experiences of other countries, what can you learn from? We have to take a policy that actually works, and what those countries and every other developed country have determined works, is a value added tax. Because a value added tax is impossible to game your way out of. If you're a trillion-dollar technology company — you know, I was just in New Hampshire campaigning yesterday, and you know what I say to them? I say to everyone around the country, Amazon, a trillion-dollar technology company sucking up $20 billion in business every year, closing 30 percent of your stores and malls, paying zero in taxes, how do you feel about that? You know? And they are angry. They say, how the heck can Amazon be paying zero in taxes? And I was like, I know. And it's up to you, the people of New Hampshire, to change it. So if you look at other countries ——
While most marriage stories are concerned with the first flush of wedded life, Nissen's new novel, set during the 2004 Bush-Kerry election, skips straight to the end. From the moment I saw Lucius Bocelli, the first sentence reads, I wanted to go to bed with him. One problem: The narrator, 50-year-old Phillipa Maakestad, is already married. Since its origins, the novel has been a form well suited to adultery narratives, but despite Phillipa's insistence that she and Lucius are destined for each other — Lucius and I collided like a force of nature — their affair takes up relatively little space in the book and feels curiously secondary. In fact, the driving passion of this novel is not love or desire, but hatred: Phillipa's powerful loathing for her elderly mother-in-law, Bernadette.
The jury is still out on women police. On whether they can take it. Or for how long. On the other hand, maybe it's me: Maybe I'm just another fuckoff. New York PD, for instance, is now fifteen percent female. And all over the country women detectives continue to do outstanding work, celebrated work. But I'm thinking that these must be some very, very exceptional ladies. Many times, when I was in Homicide, I said to myself, Walk away, girl. Ain't nobody stopping you. Just walk away. Murders are men's work. Men commit them, men clean up after them, men solve them, men try them. Because men like violence. Women really don't figure that much, except as victims, and among the bereaved, of course, and as witnesses. Ten or twelve years back, during the arms buildup toward the end of Reagan's first term, when the nuclear thing was on everyone's mind, it seemed to me that the ultimate homicide was coming and one day I'd get the dispatcher's call alerting me to five billion dead: All of them, except you and me. In full consciousness and broad daylight men sat at desks drawing up contingency plans to murder everybody. I kept saying out loud: Where are the women? Where were the women? I'll tell you: They were witnesses. Those straggly chicks in their tents on Greenham Common, England, making the military crazy with their presence and their stares--they were witnesses. Naturally, the nuclear arrangement, the nuclear machine, was strictly men only.
My recollection from watching the video and the —
Crashing is yet another comedy that is less interested in jokes than in wringing laughs out of awkward or humiliating situations, but it feels primitive compared with shows like, say, the FX series Baskets. As for fashioning a TV series out of the stand-up life, it's not nearly as sophisticated as Louie or Seinfeld or most of the others. It's pleasant enough, with enjoyable guest stars, but it comes too late in the evolution of this genre to make much of an impression.
Some members of the Western Shoshone Nation ultimately accepted government cash in an attempt to end the dispute, but the Danns persisted. Representatives of the Western Shoshone Nation have appealed to international bodies, including the United Nations, and they pressed their case with U.S. government officials as recently as the fall of 2019.
The art world is increasingly turning to labs to understand how paintings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries are behaving. Vincent van Gogh's chrome yellows, some of which have started to brown, and his purples, some of which have turned blue, have been widely studied. But less is known about Munch's palette, and scientists, using updated technologies and tools like transmission electron microscopes, are breaking new ground.
Even so, having grown up amid the intolerance of the South, he learned to avoid certain topics at home. One of them was his homosexuality. I doubt Mother knew that it existed in the world, Ms. Begneaud said. I guarantee she had no idea.
Other candidates have taken a different approach to creating a nest egg for low-income youth — Senator Booker, for example, favors baby bonds, which would provide every infant with a savings account that the government would contribute to annually depending on family income.
Not at all. We originated the SAT during World War II as a way to determine which kids we did not want to send to the front lines. Now we treat our kids like every year is wartime. I've talked to parents and teachers around the country, and I've said, we need to de-emphasize these standardized tests. They are a terrible measurement of human value, certainly have nothing to do with character. At this point, as you said, they are more likely to test your parents' socioeconomic status than anything else.
We must recognize that many of the factors which have fueled current assimilation and intermarriage are positive developments for individual Jews: acceptance, wealth, opportunity. Most Jews do not want to impede these developments. Indeed, they want to encourage them. For that reason, we must accept the reality that many Jews will continue to marry non-Jews, but we should not regard it as inevitable that these marriages will necessarily lead to total assimilation. We can take positive steps to stem that tide--but it will take a change in attitude toward mixed marriages, and indeed toward the tribalism that has understandably characterized Jewish attitudes toward outsiders for so much of our history.
SUGIMOTO IS NOT a licensed architect, though he doesn't really care for labels. As he wrote in the chapbook he created about the apartment for his personal collection: Recently, architecture is getting closer to art while art is becoming more architectural; seldom, however, does one hear of them coming together in a beautiful or harmonious manner. Architecture's sense of inferiority to art and art's own jealousy of architecture are inextricably entangled. His first foray into architectural work was restoring the medieval Go'o Shinto Shrine on the island of Naoshima, in 1996. He subsequently opened an architecture practice in Japan under the name New Material Research Laboratory with Tomoyuki Sakakida, a trained architect. New Material has completed a number of noteworthy buildings, including the Enoura Observatory, which is part of the Odawara Art Foundation that Sugimoto founded in 2009 on the coastline of the Kanagawa Prefecture, just south of Tokyo. Enoura's cantilevered main gallery with glass walls is elegantly oriented to glimpse the sun as it rises from the east. The firm's name, however, is cheekily disingenuous; Sugimoto is fond of repurposing ancient materials. In the Manhattan apartment, the dining room floors are planks of Yakusugi — cedar from Yakushima island that is more than a thousand years old. (It is now illegal to harvest the forests of Yakushima; the wood he used had been in storage for some time.) For centuries, the wind ripped across the island, causing the growth rings of the trees to bend and swirl into mesmerizing shapes.
Scrutinizing, looking after it, because I'm just like, What? My hair? Who cares? No one. And then people are like, No, no, and they have to put time in, smooth it out.
Two more charges against Clinton were defeated. An article accusing the President of perjury in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit was rejected, 229 to 205, with 28 Republicans breaking ranks.
It was held at Windsor Castle in the chapel of St. George. The chapel where it was held is actually also the resting place for English kings that literally go back centuries. The couple left afterwards in an open-top carriage. And so you had all of this majesty and pomp. And yet on another level, you had some elements that were strikingly new and different.
The Fun of Flying Afterward, I remember lying in the grass and looking up at the clouds and thinking how much fun it would be to fly up there among those clouds, he recalled in later years, adding: I didn't think of the hazards--I was just interested in getting up there in the clouds. But he was torn for a time by a strong yearning to go to Alaska, a land pictured as wild frontier and the source of mythic Gold Rush tales. For him Alaska was also the scene of Robert W. Service's verse, some of which he memorized so thoroughly that he could recite it faultlessly in old age. Although Lindbergh Sr. led an active and exciting political life as a maverick Republican who battled (and helped to overthrow) the entrenched Establishment in the House, led an assault on the money trust and voted against American entry into World War I, his son was bored by politics and all the speeches. The issue that his father espoused in Congress and later as a Farmer-Laborite supporter of Robert LaFollette failed, so the son said, to make any impressions on him. His mother, too, eschewed political thinking. In World War I, Lindbergh operated the family farm, leaving it in the fall of 1920 to study engineering at the University of Wisconsin.
He remembered learning as a boy that Britain's millions of pet hamsters were descended from a single female caught in the wild, in Syria. In 1990 he contacted the head of the hamster council, who put him in touch with thousands of owners. They gladly sent him samples from their pets' stool, a DNA analysis of which showed that indeed they shared a common ancestor. Professor Sykes was right.
From the United States we can only look on with envy as European opera companies continue their seasons. Even amid the latest lockdown, the Bavarian State Opera in Munich is assembling to stream Dmitri Tcherniakov's new staging of Weber's Der Freischütz. The quintessentially Romantic story, earthy and supernatural, is recast here in the world of organized crime, and limited to a single setting: a penthouse suite where people have gathered to celebrate the marriage of Max (Pavel Cernoch) and Agathe (Golda Schultz), an event only hinted at in the opera's finale. Sounds about right for Tcherniakov, a director who revels in role-playing and psychological drama. JOSHUA BARONE
Stephanie Jones, his daughter, said the cause was congestive heart failure.
About the same time, the trio had an unlikely hit with the kind of material it had avoided: Mr. Seeger's antiwar song Where Have All the Flowers Gone?
I mean, the question is what trade-offs you're willing to make, really. The N.S.A. is going to be able to recruit the tech talent that he can recruit and you want to try and ramp that up. So one thing ——
Lauren Kelley: Mr. Yang, can you say who is on your short list for running mate?
His death, in a nursing home there, was confirmed by former Representative Raymond H. LaHood, another moderate Republican, who was Mr. Railsback's protégé and served as secretary of transportation in the Obama administration.
Huawei has become the focal point of a geopolitical battle between China and the United States as the Trump administration has sought to curtail the country's technological advances. Ms. Meng, who was for years the public face of the company, was detained in Canada in 2018 on an arrest warrant from the United States, where she faces charges of financial fraud related to evading sanctions against Iran.
Polls measure changing feelings, not steadfast principle. Polls would have rejected the Ten Commandments. Polls would have embraced slavery and ridiculed women's rights.
King cited a radio interview Court, 75, gave last May, in which she said it was satanic when children questioned their gender identity.
Her involvement in politics continued after her term as ambassador ended in 1981 with the arrival of the Reagan administration. During the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta she opened up her home for fund-raising. Her outspokenness caused a stir when she said that despite a strong race for the presidential nomination, the Rev. Jesse Jackson was not qualified to be on a national ticket.
I enjoyed it, and thank you.
If I treat someone for major depressive disorder, it doesn't matter to me as a clinician what percentage of their depression might have genetic determinants. I can't change their genes.
Keith Leavitt, an ethics researcher and associate professor at Oregon State University, has found that workplace lies are often related to protecting our identity, whether we define ourselves through our achievements, through the roles in which we serve others, or through belonging to a group. We tend to tell three kinds of lies at work: lies that protect my own accomplishment, lies that protect someone I'm close to, and lies that protect my company, Dr. Leavitt says.
But for recent California editions, publishers wrote thousands of words of new text in response to the FAIR Education Act, a law signed by Governor Brown in 2011. It requires schools to teach the contributions of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and disabled Americans.
The Night begins with a round of the party game, Mafia. The film's central couple Babak (Shahab Hosseini) and Neda (Niousha Jafarian) play along, each wryly accusing the other of hiding secrets, each saying that the other might be the killer. The Persian-language, Los Angeles-set thriller that follows builds tension around the resentments that have accumulated in their marriage. But the stakes never rise past the movie's first game.
I think that he did a lot of great things and he did a lot of what he could, but to the extent that there was a missed opportunity, it was in the wake of the financial crisis. And it's very hard to Monday morning quarterback a team when they literally felt like the economy itself was at stake, but we should have done much more to recapitalize homeowners as opposed to the banks. We could have kept many more people in their homes. We could've kept many of these communities ——
Dr. Sandler, who died on Saturday at 90, was known as the godmother of Title IX. She was central to its development, passage and implementation.
They should be, I mean clearly. Because if you spend time on these campuses, you know where they're going. So one thing you can do that's very, very fast and immediate is you can become much more flexible in terms of compensation and a type of work environment.
When it's over, I want to say: all my life I was a bride married to amazement. I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms. When it's over, I don't want to wonder if I have made of my life something particular, and real. I don't want to find myself sighing and frightened, or full of argument. I don't want to end up simply having visited this world.
In 10 days the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy. No, no, no, no, no. The peaceful transfer of power from one freely-elected President to the next. I committed to President-Elect Trump that my administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as President Bush did for me.
In a vacuum, you're 100 percent correct. But it's failing to account for the fact that we're taking that money, and then some, and putting it directly into the hands of the American consumer.
—— more strong and more whole. There's a saying, I think it was actually, and maybe in this … no, it was an earlier administration, but a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. There was a crisis. There was a massive opportunity to help rebalance our economy, but we instead recapitalized the banks to the tune of $4 trillion. And what I say to Americans around the country, I say, Hey, do you remember voting for the $4 trillion bailout of Wall Street? And it gets this laugh. But then they answer, Wait, we did that? And it's, Of course we didn't vote for that.
My Little Sister, a tender domestic drama from the Swiss writers and directors Stéphanie Chuat and Véronique Reymond, faces terminal illness with a refreshing emotional candor.
Without family near or money to spare, I brought my newborn with me to law school, placing her on my lap during class. Jane's presence may have distracted other students, but it also brought them joy. (Without a dose of humanity, civil procedure can be rather dry.) Jane never cried — neither in class nor as I wrote papers late into the night, waiting for my medical resident husband to come home. Now, my daughter thinks my lawyer job is boring, but her quiet patience made it all possible. — Kate Vaughan
Rebounding from this mortifyingly dumb opening proves less difficult for Stuart than for the movie, directed by Archie Borders. The film is yet another ode to the restorative magic of wine country sunshine, which apparently also has the power to expose the story's egregious midlife-crisis clichés.
The original Queer Eye was like a stealth mission to straight America's vanity cabinets, built on the idea of gay men as arbiters of cool. It had its own political context. The fall after its premiere, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriage legal. In the next year's midterm election, a host of ballot initiatives banning such marriages passed.
In response to announcements about Mr. Trump's planned cuts to State Department funding, retired generals wrote a letter to lawmakers citing Secretary of Defense James Mattis's 2013 comment, If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately.
And so our patterns formed. I took care of the baby. I took care of the house. As my son grew older, I managed everything: food, medical appointments, preschool reconnaissance, after-school activities, birthdays and wardrobe and transportation. We had a second child and we constantly renegotiated the terms of our labor division because neither of us wanted to be stuck in those stereotypical roles. But though my husband had emerged from his depression and I from my tough broad mode, we never got our gender equality groove back despite our efforts.
KK: I think Mara's going to kick you off.
AK: Speaking of allies, should Ukraine be invited to join NATO? I know that Ukraine's received sort of undue influence on this election, but going forward?
ANNE TERESA DE KEERSMAEKER at the Museum of Modern Art (March 29 through April 2). The Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker proposes a question: Can choreography be performed in the form of an exhibition? For Work/Travail/Arbeid, she reimagines her piece Vortex Temporum (2013), set to Gérard Grisey's score, for a museum setting. Originally 60 minutes, the new version is a nine-hour cycle in which each hour features a different iteration of the choreography using seven dancers from Ms. De Keersmaeker's company, Rosas, and seven musicians from the Ictus ensemble. The five-day event, which takes place in the Marron Atrium at MoMA, can be viewed during museum hours. It has appeared before at WIELS in Brussels, at the Centre Pompidou in Paris and at the Tate Modern in London.
Mr. Yang's candidacy has centered on the idea of his Freedom Dividend, essentially universal basic income — which has a long history, drawing support from Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King Jr. and Friedrich von Hayek, but also a controversial one. (Later annotations will look at why.)
The scandal broke on Feb. 23, 2013, when three priests and a former cleric were quoted in the British newspaper The Observer as saying that Cardinal O'Brien had made sexual advances toward them after drinking bouts in the 1980s.
AH: But do you think, I mean, he never truly apologized. He just said, I'm sorry you're offended. And while you may not have felt that way, there were other jokes he made about just Asian-Americans and Asian people in general, and there were other people who were obviously affected by this. So I mean, what kind of consequences do you think someone who makes those kinds of statements and who doesn't show any sort of remorse for it, should they face? If not firing, what should happen? What would the steps be?
The result, according to Grofman, was that white less well-educated voters didn't desert the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party deserted them.
In listening to his conversations, Ms. Higgins Clark wrote, I didn't hear anything that fascinated me.
Some in the media have focused on the possibility that there would be fallout for Amazon from the Bezos divorce, suggesting that Ms. Bezos might seek to control and change the company. I knew them both in the early days of Amazon's history, a history in which Ms. Bezos was quite present and important. While things can change, I would be utterly surprised by either of them indulging in any acrimony that would hurt the company. But we use this as an excuse to stare at their private lives anyway.
Is that different when you're on stage, versus in a TV series?
In 1998, according to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University, there were 47,582 active priests in America -- about 10,000 fewer than in 1975. The average age of a diocesan priest is now 58, and nearly a quarter of all priests are older than 70, the average age of retirement. Perhaps no institution in America faces a more severe personnel crisis than the Catholic Church. And it is likely to get worse. The total number of graduate seminarians in America last year was the lowest on record: 2,622, a drop of almost 70 percent from the 8,159 in 1967-8. This decline comes at a time when the number of Catholics in America, where they represent by far the largest religious denomination, has ballooned from 48.7 million in 1975 to 61.6 million today, largely as a result of Latin American and Asian immigration and population growth. The drop in vocations has been under way since the 1970's, when seminaries emptied precipitously, in part because of a disillusionment with celibacy. Meanwhile, families of Italian, Irish and Central European descent -- the old Catholic ghetto that, earlier in this century, was a major source of American priests -- have shrunk in size and risen to the middle class, broadening opportunities for their sons. More recently, the pedophilia scandals of the late 80's and early 90's have been a public relations catastrophe for the church.
President Franklin Roosevelt tried to advance a court-packing strategy to ensure favorable rulings on New Deal legislation. He wanted to appoint up to six additional justices, one for every justice older than 70 years. The plan was unpopular in Congress and among the Supreme Court's justices.
And virtually immediately he began to plan the details of the trip--getting financial backing, getting a specially designed plane, mapping the route, seeking to eliminate any chance of failure. Ultimately, he persuaded a group of St. Louis businessmen to put up $15,000, which was one reason why the plane was called the Spirit of St. Louis. After many racking incidents, the Ryan Company, with Lindbergh's help, designed and built a craft tailored for him and the Wright Company built an engine of 223 horsepower to accommodate the plane. For several years after the Paris flight, Lindbergh lived in the glare of publicity and popping camera flashbulbs. The public would not let him alone. I recall steeping out of a building on Wall Street, and having almost everyone on the street turn and follow me, he said. He was regarded as a sort of oracle, and his opinion was solicited on every conceivable subject. He was, moreover, linked falsely in the press with a number of girls. His interest, however, was in Anne Spencer Morrow, the beautiful blue-eyed daughter of Dwight Morrow, then Ambassador to Mexico. The couple met in Mexico City at Christmastime in 1927, when Miss Morrow, then a Smith student, went there for the holidays. They were married in a private ceremony in the Morrow home in New Jersey on May 27, 1929. The marriage was union of opposites. Sensitive, retiring, a poet, Mrs. Lindbergh wanted nothing so much as a life of peace and quiet.
Two years later, Uncle Anas was still unable to walk. It had been nearly a year since he had surgery for a spinal fracture he sustained as a result of the attack and his muscles had not recovered. Medical exams revealed a fatal diagnosis: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or A.L.S., a degenerative illness.
It very much is. But if you were to apply resources, you would want to apply resources in ways that don't necessarily advantage the top third of your population by educational attainment exclusively. You would be trying to build more paths with the other two-thirds, which investing in trades and apprenticeships would do, and you would try and provide for the people who are the weakest and most vulnerable in the job market, which are not going to be the people that are attending college.
SURVIVING R. KELLY: PART II: THE RECKONING 8 p.m. on Lifetime. Surviving R. Kelly, the documentary series that explored sexual abuse allegations against the R&B singer, comes to a close with this sequel. The final episode revisits the aftermath of Kelly being taken into federal custody and spotlights the families of two of his live-in girlfriends who largely defended him when the allegations surfaced.
Do I feel — you know, a lot of people ask those questions. And it's hard to answer, because I personally don't ever see race. I never have. I've been in law enforcement for over 30 years. I don't care what's your color, creed, race. It doesn't matter. You're a human being. I will treat you as that until you — and I will act the same way you act towards me. If we're cordial, we're talking, we're going to be cordial and talking. If you're going to fight me, I'm going to defend myself. Do I think these officers decided to shoot Mr. Brooks — because that appears basically what you're asking me — because of his skin color? Absolutely not.
The diplomatic response--but his eyes leveled in.
I think we all make compromises. Certainly, in journalism, social graces force you to adjust. You're at a holiday dinner table, and what you feel is the direct opposite of what this person's saying. Do you open your mouth? Well, maybe. Sometimes restraint is the better part of valor, and you pick and choose when to fight your battles. Howard Beale has been toeing the line for a long, long time. And it got to a point where it became intolerable, and he had a breaking point and then realized, I just don't care anymore. And he decides, to hell with it, I'm going to say exactly what I feel when I feel it. When I think it, I'll say it with no filter. And it has a resonance to Donald Trump's reign in some ways. And in other ways, Howard Beale had a lot more content.
Because of her lyrical style in ballets like Les Sylphides, Ms. Koesun was often cast as a Romantic ballerina. But she could also show dramatic ferocity, as the evil antiheroine Ate in Antony Tudor's Undertow, which depicts a young murderer's development.
Others at the rally were more certain of their support. Carol Madden had made her own sign, scrawling Tonight PA, tomorrow PA Avenue, on a piece of cardboard. I don't like Mike, Ms. Madden said, I love Mike.
I rode the subway maybe six weeks ago or so. It's become much more of a pain in the neck now that I actually get recognized. I confess that that's been the biggest adjustment in running for president. Because I was, No, I'm not going to get recognized on the street. Of course, keep in mind, when I started my run I was completely anonymous. I mean none of you had ever heard of me. And also there is, and this is not to make too much of it, but there's also this invisible Asian man thing. That you feel like all you have to do is just not want to be seen and then you disappear, and that doesn't work anymore.
Most important, Marcel and his mother both loved to laugh--gently, satirically--at the people around them, and in her letters to him she sends up the other guests at a spa or hotel with the same spirit of wickedly close observation and good-natured if prickly fun that was to inspire so many of his best pages.
Cheney facing internal backlash for impeachment vote as Republican rifts deepen over Trump. Representative Liz Cheney had issued a scathing statement the day before the impeachment vote repudiating President Trump. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times A group of President Trump's most strident allies in the House is calling on Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican, to resign from her leadership post after she voted to impeach Mr. Trump, dramatizing the bitter rifts within the party and setting up a messy internal feud that could define its future. Members of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, including the chairman, Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, as well as Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio and Matt Gaetz of Florida, are circulating a petition calling on Ms. Cheney to step down from her role as chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, arguing that her vote to impeach Mr. Trump had brought the conference into disrepute and produced discord. Ms. Cheney was one of 10 Republicans to break with the party on Wednesday and vote to charge the president with incitement of insurrection for his role in urging on a mob that stormed the Capitol. One of those 10 cannot be our leader, Mr. Gaetz said in an interview on Fox News's Hannity on Wednesday evening. It is untenable, unsustainable, and we need to make a leadership change. Ms. Cheney has brushed aside calls to step down, saying that she was not going anywhere and calling her break with Mr. Trump a vote of conscience.

KK: But access to college is still a civil rights issue in this country.
Mr. Biden has decided that instead of bypassing Mr. Norquist and plucking Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy to run the Pentagon until there is a confirmed defense secretary, he will adhere to standard tradition. Under federal law, a confirmed deputy secretary automatically assumes the duties of the secretary during an absence. The decision to keep Mr. Norquist until a defense secretary is confirmed was first reported by Politico. Mr. Kirby, for his part, is a veteran government public affairs officer and a respected figure at the Pentagon. A retired Navy rear admiral, Mr. Kirby made a jump from the Pentagon to the State Department in 2015, and worked closely with Mr. Kerry during the Iran nuclear negotiations and for the last two years of the Obama administration. Mr. Kirby worked with Mr. Austin when they were both on the Joint Staff under Admiral Mullen, during the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. He also spent a year as the Pentagon spokesman under Mr. Hagel, and has been the spokesman for the Navy as well as for retired Admiral Mullen when he was chairman.

Mr. Bezos later told Vogue, I think my wife is resourceful, smart, brainy, and hot, but I had the good fortune of having seen her résumé before I met her, so I knew exactly what her SATs were.
The sisters and other Shoshone ranchers refused to pay grazing fees on traditional Western Shoshone land — nearly 26 million acres in Nevada, roughly two-thirds of the state. The government considers it public land.
Andrew Yang's message is remarkably similar to Elizabeth Warren's and Bernie Sanders's — the American economy is not working for enough Americans, and it's going to require structural change to do better. Where Mr. Yang differs — beyond his almost complete lack of government or political experience — is in his prescriptions, including his signature Freedom Dividend.
I feel that too, I said.
He's right, of course. Women in politics have long been subjected to much closer scrutiny than men; in 1917, the first female member of Congress, Jeannette Rankin, took office and The Washington Post ran an article headlined: Congresswoman Rankin Real Girl; Likes Nice Gowns and Tidy Hair.
Well, it already has. Everything is going to go streaming. The studios know that. The networks know that.

At 14, I never looked at hard-boiled eggs the same way again.
By the time he became a senator in May 1991, appointed after his predecessor was killed in an aircraft accident, Mr. Wofford was already 65. He had been a lawyer, an author, a professor, the president of two colleges, a special assistant to President John F. Kennedy, an adviser to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, the state's secretary of labor and industry, a champion of civil rights and a leading force in America's national and community service movement.
What I'm suggesting is we actually make capitalism's goals align with ours, as human beings, as parents, as Americans. Instead of maximizing these capital efficiency measurements, we should be maximizing our own health and life expectancy, our children's education and success rates, our mental health and freedom from substance abuse, our environmental sustainability. Then we can line up the power of the markets with how we are doing. But the markets do not care one whit about us and our children.
My parents divorced amicably when I was 14, but eventually the turbulence of youth presented its challenges and I found myself passing through rehabs on my way to college. I kept a bag ready to go at any moment, traveling often between people and places, desires and disasters. I was an anxious, world-weary and troubled young man. Perhaps because of this, my father visited me wherever I went, if only to give me grounding.
I've been a registered Democrat since the Clinton years; I was an Obama appointee. I had a fund-raiser for John Kerry. It wasn't a great fund-raiser because I was kind of young; it wasn't one of those fancy ones where you generate tens of thousands.
Her many novels also included Queen of Stones (1982), a feminist retelling of William Golding's Lord of the Flies; Faustine (1991), about a woman in her late 40s who makes a pact with the Devil to return to her 20s; and The Beautiful Child (2010), a ghost story revolving around an unfinished manuscript by Henry James.

Vaidehi is up against a lot: The first scenes of Badrinath remind us comically, but baldly, that baby boys are still considered assets while girls are liabilities. (Instead of the usual note that no animals were hurt during its filming, this movie starts with a disclaimer about the 1961 Dowry Prohibition Act.)
If Created Equal is trying to promote the conservative cause, it does so gently, and blandly.

I see people that have a message that they believe that it's systemic racism in the police departments. And they believe that because of the color of their skin, they're treated a certain way. They're afraid, because of the color of their skin, their children may go out and not come home.

Whether I was at a rehabilitation center in Utah; a military academy in Pennsylvania where I had asked my parents to send me post-9/11 when I was too young to enlist but eager to serve; a stifling hotel room in Miami; an unfurnished condominium in Juneau; or a rundown apartment complex in Savannah, my father would drive or fly to see me, sometimes for only a few short hours.
While representing the prosecutors when the case went to the Supreme Court, Mr. Duncan was serving as what he later called solicitor general of Louisiana, a position that does not exist. He devised the argument that, although the district attorney had withheld evidence in many cases involving innocent men, there was no need to train lawyers in his office because they would have learned about their obligation in law school.
Mike. There's something went on here.
But for them the challenge is not even what's happening internally. The challenge is whether or not they can get developing countries on board with their technology standards to be able to roll them out internationally. So if you're a third party, let's say you're a developing country in Africa or Latin America, then you have a choice essentially between the global standard and the Chinese standard. And if you're the Chinese, you do not want a standard that only you are using over time, because that's going to curb your economic upside to all of the software that you're building. One of the reasons why our tech companies are so successful is that they export it to virtually the entire rest of the world, and China does not want to be in the opposite position.
In the first flush of success, Catholic intellectuals who had been pressing for reforms--an end to censorship and the exclusive reliance on sholasticism--celebrated victory over the bad old days. Enough time has now passed since the Second Vatican Council that we can evaluate the rights and wrongs of this history in a new way, temper the exuberance of the modernizers, and pay at least a guarded tribute to the convert intellectuals and their work. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the Promethean self-confidence of the new sciences had seemed likely to sweep everything before it. Darwinism and the principle of evolutionary development had been applied widely to other phenomena and appeared irresistibly compelling to several generations of scientists, historians, philosophers, and social scientists. Evolutionists had scornfully dismissed the fixed principles and the unchanging universe of scholasticism and regarded it as easy to refute, if they bothered to look at it at all. Marxism, another developmental theory, which enjoyed its greatest vogue in the English-speaking countries between about 1890 and 1950, was no less scornful of Catholic thought, treating it either as an opiate for the oppressed or as the instrument of domination which a master class wielded against its subordinates. By now, however, these rival orthodoxies have, in their turn, worn thin. Evolution is still a central theory in biology but hardly in economics, anthropology, political science, or psychology, where it once ruled imperiously. From evolution sprang eugenics, the science of population manipulation, whose horrific face Hitler displayed to the world.

Her family is ready for the moment. Ms. Harris's niece, Meena Harris, has been sporting a Vice President Aunty T-shirt in the lead-up.

She eventually relented: Mr. Biden was chosen as President Barack Obama's vice president in 2008 after an unsuccessful presidential run. As second lady, she relished the relative anonymity teaching provided, noting in interviews that her students often did not recognize her.

So this is the carrot and the stick. So imagine if you had data standards that were endorsed by the U.S., the E.U., and Japan, and it had certain technology protocols associated with it. Then China said, Hey, I don't want to adhere to that. Because like you said, they like to hoard data, and one of the reasons why they're in position to leapfrog us is they have more data than we do and they have essentially nonexistent privacy rights or regulations. They have complete surveillance. That's one reason why they've banned masks in Hong Kong, so that their surveillance technology can pick up who the protesters are. So China has its own vast hoard of data.
He sang anthems of social lament and timeless wisdom, typically in Shona, Zimbabwe's predominant language, but also in English and Ndebele. His music pulled from traditional Shona rhythms and sounds while incorporating influences from South Africa's more cosmopolitan, jazz-inflected mbaqanga tradition, as well as African-American dance music. What resulted — a kind of soundtrack to Zimbabwean life in the late 20th century — became known as its own idiom, called Tuku music, after Mr. Mtukudzi's nickname.

The fact that our fates are intertwined — something even Malcolm eventually realized — makes me not hopeful, as it once did, but angrier. I feel stuck in a terrible, lopsided marriage. The least I should be able to do in this dysfunctional relationship is to vent my anger, not on paper or newsprint, but in the real world, in real time. That's what a big chunk of Republican America is doing, with zero regrets. I have become envious of that. I want true equality, 2020 style — the right to claim and fully express my own well-earned piece of the American id.
And Howard revealed new details about the encounter.
On Jan. 10, 2011, Emily Rapp Black, a writer and creative writing instructor living in Santa Fe, took her infant son, Ronan, to the eye doctor. At 9 months old, the baby wasn't hitting his developmental milestones and his pediatrician wanted to rule out vision problems. In Albuquerque, the ophthalmologist found cherry red spots on the backs of the baby's retinas, and immediately diagnosed him with Tay-Sachs disease, a very rare, but inevitably fatal, genetic disorder. And the world tilted on its axis.

The other odd thing about this staging, whose set (by Rachel Hauck) is a suburban kitchen, is how little sense it conveys of the natural world beyond.

So Ms. Akhmedova and her lawyers tried a new approach. Temur, the older of the couple's two sons, is a U.K. resident, which makes his holdings eminently seizable. And for a guy who isn't yet 30, he has plenty to seize. His father showered Temur with unimaginable amounts of money, as Temur's own lawyers put it in a court filing.

I got three marriage proposals, the problem was all of them were dudes over 60 years old, said Stephen Firth, the pub's manager.
We need to let our historic allies know that our commitments are good, and that if we want to make a change, we want to do it in a way that's not pulling the rug out from under you but actually consultative. If we want other people to invest more, then we have to try and sit down with them and drive them to do so without questioning our commitment to NATO wholesale. But to me, trying to nickel-and-dime our relationships with our historic allies is not the best way forward. I think it was James Mattis that said that if you invest more in diplomacy, you have to invest less in ammunition, which should be the goal. So we need to make sure our partnerships and alliances are actually strong, stable and secure, and then we can put pressure on Russia and China with more of a global consensus, and maintain the international world order that's benefited us for decades that now is falling apart because Donald Trump is so erratic and unreliable, even with the people we've been allies with for decades.
A bigger issue is that a wealth tax may not be constitutional. The 16th Amendment provides only for an income tax. The estate, gift and generation-skipping taxes pass muster because they're deemed excise taxes on the transfer of wealth, not on the wealth itself.
Bryan Sykes, an Oxford geneticist, made his name as a swashbuckling public intellectual by studying the DNA of an alpine iceman, taking on the ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl's theory about the peopling of Polynesia, and analyzing samples said to come from yetis, almas and sasquatches but which, he showed, actually came from bears, pigs and people — a disappointing result for Bigfoot hunters that didn't keep one of them from naming him cryptozoologist of the year in 2013.

Over the past five years, 90 percent of A.I. start-ups in Silicon Valley were acquired by major companies, according to TechCrunch.
a huge and centuries-long change in Western history, starting from the Middle Ages, was a Civilizing Process in which the ideal of manhood changed from a macho willingness to retaliate violently to an insult to the ability to exert self-control, dignity, reserve, and duty. It's the culture of the gentleman, the man of dignity and quiet strength, the mensch. The romantic 1960s ethic of self-expression and escape from inhibitions weakened that ethic, and the A.P.A. report seems to be trying to administer the coup de grâce.
In Architectural Digest: Autobiography of a Magazine 1920-2010, her 2018 book about her tenure, Ms. Rense made clear her vision. I was not interested in trends, and certainly not in fads, she wrote. I preferred to speak of style, which is really a way of seeing and living creatively in the world.
The week before the Oscar nominations on Jan. 13 was meant to be the most exciting phase of awards season yet: After a glittery Golden Globes ceremony on Sunday, many of the most important industry guilds and groups weighed in with their own nominations during the next two days, helping to clarify the Oscar race and winnow down the ultimate list of contenders.
Seldom coddling her, her husband proved hyperactive, happy as a nomad who was rarely at home for long periods. Yet despite some moments of tension, the marriage was an enduring and affectionate one. For a while Mrs. Lindbergh accompanied her husband on many of his trips--to the Caribbean, where he was laying out air routes; to Europe and to Asia. He had taught her to fly, and she learned to navigate and to operate a Morse Code radio. North to the Orient is her chronicle of one of these flights. Their first child, Charles Augustus 3d, was born June 24, 1930. Twenty months later, when Mrs. Lindbergh was pregnant with her second child, the baby was kidnapped from his nursery crib in his parent's home in Hopewell, N. J. The date was March 1, 1932. On May 12 the baby's body was found in a shallow grave not far from the house. In between, there was a bizarre hunt for the child that included payment of a $50,000 ransom at a cemetery in the Bronx and a cast of characters that ranged from Dr. John F. (Jafsie) Condon, a school principal, to Gaston B. Means, a swindler. There were false leads and sensations galore, through all of which Lindbergh bore himself with great public stoicism. His private emotions were never disclosed, and about the only references that he made in later years to the kidnapping and murder were fleeting mentions of that New Jersey business.
So if you look at other countries, they have a value-added tax and then they take those resources and put them to work toward various social programs in ways to balance out the inequality. Now, another thing I love about the value-added tax is you can either reduce it or exempt things like diapers, toilet paper, eggs, milk, things that Americans consume just to make ends meet, and you can dial it up on things like artificial intelligence, yachts, luxury watches. There are ways that you can make it so that it falls more heavily on people that would barely notice. And we're taking the resources plus an additional hundreds of billions of dollars and putting it directly into the hands of working Americans. This would increase the buying power of literally 90 percent of Americans.
JW: I just wanted to tie together the question — a question from Lauren and a question from Michelle, and ask you about Washington, both with regard to Supreme Court confirmation process and your agenda more generally. You said at the very beginning of our conversation, in response to Katie, that you don't need a — you were talking about various [cross talk].
Debarking at Washington in a civilian's blue serge suit, Lindbergh was glorified by the President, who said that the trans- Atlantic flight was the same story of valor and victory by a son of the people that shines through every page of American history. The panoplied Washington reception, which was topped by an award--the first in the nation's history--of the Distinguished Flying Cross, was followed by an even noisier outpouring in New York, where four million people spilled into the streets. Ticker tape and confetti rained on the Broadway parade, and the day was climaxed by a banquet for 4,000 guest. We measure heroes as we do ships, by their displacement, the bewhiskered Charles Evans Hughes told the multitude. Colonel Lindbergh has displaced everything. And then there were triumphal parades and receptions, seemingly endless, in other cities. Lindbergh eventually flew the Spirit of St. Louis to every state in the Union. Everywhere he went a throng collected. Even a supposedly private visit to Orville Wright, co-inventor of the airplane, was noised about and crowds appeared. Lindbergh, at one point, was so filled up with listening to this hero guff that I was ready to shout murder. What the parades, the pandemonium, the oratory, the hero worship obscured was that Lindbergh's epic flight was a most minutely planned venture by a professional flier with 2,000 air hours amassed over five years. Why shouldn't I fly from New York to Paris? he had asked himself in September, 1926.
One criticism of government subsidized journalism is that it could stifle the media's capacity to serve as a watchdog.
Hughes's book begins with the prehistoric substrata, delving with curiously gripping detail into layers of settlement archaeologists have only recently unearthed. She begins with the discovery of the world's oldest wooden coffin, under the Yenikapi metro station, containing an 8,000-year-old woman whose fellow villagers even left their footprints in the ancient mud. And so, right from the start, we are confronted with a vastly larger sense of time than that in which the city is usually conceived. Moreover, Hughes also establishes just how deep the Greek roots of the settlement called Byzantion went, and how heterogenous the Hellenic frontier town of the seventh century B.C. probably was. She has a fine feel for the complexities and shadings of that distant past.
To your earlier concern, I think we should examine the filibuster. I think that gridlock is bad for anyone trying to get anything done and solve problems. This might be controversial in this room, but I am for the restoration of earmarks, because it helped make legislation possible. That if I was a congressperson in a district, and there was a bill being passed, it's, Hey, at least I can get some pork for my local museum. And that's a very small price to pay for a functional legislature. So, getting past the filibuster to me is one possible necessity, and the restoration of earmarks could be another.
Reading through New York Times corrections is like taking a guided tour of journalism's pitfalls. It's where you discover the Ginsberg-Ginsburg Vortex, a black hole that has devoured many a journalist who has confused the names of the poet and the justice.
Well, what you're describing is similar, in some ways, to what protesters and activists and reformers are asking for — a social worker at a scene instead of a police officer, a therapist at a scene instead of a police officer. I hear you saying that that is at odds with defunding and dismantling police. But help me understand why. If a social worker takes the place of a police officer, if a group of therapists is on call instead of a traditional police officer, then why do you need more money for policing? Don't you need less money for policing?

Zoe Chance, a professor in Yale University's school of management, has shown that even when people do well on a test because they were allowed to cheat, they still see themselves as responsible for their success. People in her experiment who were allowed to cheat on a test in which an answer key was accidentally made visible kept predicting they would do well on future tests that didn't contain an answer key. It took them doing poorly on two more tests before they finally realized they probably weren't going to do so great without the answer key they had on the first test.

We're trying to get creative, because it is rough right now. The intensity has taken an emotional and physical toll on the emergency medical workers, he said. They are stressed, they are overworked. It's been a struggle, no doubt about it. In Habersham County, in the state's northeast, the average number of calls per day for emergency medical service crews has been far higher than usual, said Chad Black, the director for emergency services for the county and the board chairman of the Georgia E.M.S. Association. About every other call is related to Covid, he said, and ambulances have had to wait upward of two hours to unload patients. The county has had staffing problems for years, he said, a complication aggravated when employees contract the virus and must isolate. Some days, ambulances are at 50 percent staffing, Mr. Black said. They know when they come in, in the morning, that there's a great chance they're going to be up for 24 straight hours, Mr. Black said about the ambulance workers. You've got to worry — is there a breaking point? And in the Atlanta area, Mr. Black said, emergency crews are often hospital shopping — calling multiple facilities in the metro area and driving around until one agrees to admit their patient. In Arizona, which has a higher rate of new cases per capita than any other state, according to a New York Times database, E.M.S.
One of Proust's ex-lovers and his most constant friend, Reynaldo Hahn, the composer, recalled that soon after he met Proust they were walking through a garden when suddenly Proust stopped dead before a rosebush. He asked Hahn to continue walking without him. When at last Hahn circled back, after going around the chateau, I found him at the same place, staring at the roses. His head tilting forward, his face very serious, he blinked, his eyebrows slightly furrowed as though from a passionate act of attention, and with his left hand he was obstinately pushing the end of his little black mustache between his lips and nibbling on it.... How many times I've observed Marcel in these mysterious moments in which he was communicating totally with nature, with art, with life, in these `deep minutes' in which his entire being was concentrated.... Typically, Proust also invoked this very scene, but said that inhaling the moment was ineffectual; only the sudden, unprompted awakenings of memory, triggered by something illogical and unforeseen (the madeleine, for example), could invoke the past in its entirety.
The police looked around the body in the bathroom stall, hoping to find telltale details that might lead to the supplier of the drugs that killed him. They examined the little plastic envelope on the floor, emptied in the man's final actions, for any identifying markings.
President Obama referred to education as the civil rights issue of our time, as did former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. Indeed, the gap between education outcomes for black and white students has barely budged in recent decades, according to research from the Brookings Institution.
workers worry about being exposed to the virus, then bringing it home to their families and getting severe symptoms, said Brian Moore, the central region director of the Arizona Ambulance Association. This whole thing has put a lot of fear in folks who are on the front lines, Mr. Moore said. Emergency medical service dilemmas are particularly acute in Los Angeles County, where understaffed hospitals are overwhelmed and a Covid-related death happens every eight minutes. The nation's most populous county has urged ambulance crews not to take people they cannot resuscitate to hospitals. The county's memo on the matter reflected a relatively small change from its previous policy, which already discouraged emergency personnel from transporting most people whose heartbeats could not be restored. But after the memo gained widespread attention, medics felt compelled to post on social media to try to quell anxieties that they believed were unfounded. Kari Dickerson, a paramedic in Kentucky who tweets as @MedicTrommasher, said the memo had particularly alarmed people of color, who have been disproportionately harmed by the pandemic. She said she worried that her fellow workers could face wrenching situations whenever they broke the news that someone had died, perhaps causing families to wonder: Did they do this on purpose, did they not work as hard as they would have for somebody that looks like them? An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the day the United States reported its single-day record for Covid-19 deaths. It was Thursday. Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio and
The Western Shoshone Nation sued the government for failure to honor the treaty, but courts ruled that they were not entitled to compensation. The tribe appealed, and the Indian Claims Commission awarded it $26 million in 1979. But the tribe refused to accept the money in exchange for the land. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that the tribe had lost title to the land when the $26 million was deposited earlier as payment, even though the tribe had not collected the money.

Throughout, Whitaker repeatedly questions whether it's possible to tell one's story without robbing another person of theirs. It makes you both thieves, Sharon's boyfriend insists upon discovering his life is the subject of her new film. She disagrees. That story in there is mine. It belongs to me, she counters. This is what I do and you know it. We don't need your consent. Maybe not, but as the characters in this novel repeatedly learn, the freedom to tell one's own story often comes at a steep price.

In chapters 2, 3, and 4, I develop my thesis that the nature of anti-Semitism is changing in fundamental and important ways: Mainstream anti-Semitism--as traditionally practiced by churches, states, corporations, universities, and other elite institutions--is coming to an end; today's Jew-haters are largely marginalized and powerless. This change means that although anti-Semitism persists and must continue to be monitored, it has far less daily impact on the lives of American Jews than in the past. Thus we must define our Jewish identity in different and more positive ways than we did the past.

Mr. Koster remained oblivious to Ms. Ingraham's crush for more than a year, until she invited him to her house after an off-campus hangout with colleagues. I was like, 'You know what? You should come home with me,' she said. He told her she was drunk and said no, but that invitation set the wheels of romance in motion. After that, I finally got that she had been trying to hang out with me, he said.
Historically, therefore, there has been some descriptive truth to this pendulum view of persecution alternating with assimilation. Jews have retained their Jewish identity, at least in part, because of tsuris. Our enemies herded us into ghettos, created pales of settlement, discriminated against us, excluded us from certain livelihoods while pressing us into others. We stuck together and remained Jews, resisting as best we could the persecution by our enemies.

AY: Yeah. And I will say on a personal level, I spent seven years recruiting some of our top educational products to Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis. So I have seen that essentially the tide has turned in the direction it's gone and we should not be relying upon the government as the primary employer of a lot of this tech talent. We have to face facts and say, at this point, most of the intellectual capital is being attracted to these private firms and we need to instead try and support and work with the private firms.
More religious and less well-educated whites see Donald Trump as one of their own despite his being so obviously a child of privilege. He defends America as a Christian nation. He defends English as our national language. He is unashamed in stating that the loyalty of any government should be to its own citizens — both in terms of how we should deal with noncitizens here and how our foreign policy should be based on the doctrine of America First. He speaks in a language that ordinary people can understand. He makes fun of the elites who look down on his supporters as a basket of deplorables and who think it is a good idea to defund the police who protect them and to prioritize snail darters over jobs. He appoints judges and justices who are true conservatives. He believes more in gun rights than in gay rights. He rejects political correctness and the language-police and woke ideology as un-American. And he promises to reclaim the jobs that previous presidents (of both parties) allowed to be shipped abroad. In sum, he offers a relatively coherent set of beliefs and policies that are attractive to many voters and which he has been better at seeing implemented than any previous Republican president. What Trump supporters who rioted in D.C. share are the beliefs that Trump is their hero, regardless of his flaws, and that defeating Democrats is a holy war to be waged by any means necessary.
It is rare to have consensus on the pre-eminence of any person in the arts. But few would argue that Mr. Mekas, who was often called the godfather or the guru of the New American Cinema — his name for the underground film movement of the 1950s and '60s — was the leading champion of the kind of film that doesn't show at the multiplex.

It should not be supposed that intellectual converts to Catholicism were reliably more liberal in their outlook than born Catholics. The convert who is more punctilious in his new faith than the lifelong communicant is a familiar figure in Catholic lore, and the nineteenth and twentieth centuries provided plentiful examples of such characters. The most notable was Henry Manning, the Anglican archdeacon of Chichester, who converted in 1851 and rose in the next fifteen years to leadership of England's Catholic community, becoming archbishop of Westminster in 1865 (cardinal from 1875). Manning supported papal infallibility, as did Newman's former Oxford colleagues William George Ward and Frederick Faber, and the American convert Augustine Hewit. Subsequent Catholic historians, most of them opposed to the Ultramontane position, have given Manning in particular a bad press and found Newman's antiinfallibilist views much more palatable. But we should remember that to Manning Ultramontanism seemed to be the most liberating position. Like many of the converts, he hated the subordination of the Church of England to the civil state; indeed, he left it in protest over the Gorham case of 1851, in which the state overruled an Anglican bishop and installed as parish priest a man he considered a heretic. Setting up the papacy as a powerful counterweight to the state seemed to Ultramontanists the surest way of assuring themselves of religious and intellectual freedom.

The aviator's crucial assistance to Goddard did not become well known until Goddard's biography was published in 1963, a book for which Lindbergh wrote an introduction. For more than 15 years after the war Lindbergh virtually disappeared from the news. He was a member of Army Ordnance's CHORE project at the University of Chicago; he was consultant to the Secretary of the Air Force; he took part in the reorganization of the Strategic Air Command; and he was a member of scientific ballistic-missile committees of the Air Force and the Defense Department. In 1954, he was commissioned a brigadier general in the Air Force Reserve. Much of the aviator's work in these years dealt with security-classified projects; but it is believed that he was active in rocketry and space flight programs, where his technical expertise was valuable. He enjoyed top-secret clearance, and spoke of his tasks as having to do with security. In this period, Lindbergh completed his autobiographical account of his 1927 flight, which had been written in bits and pieces in various parts of the world over 14 years. The Spirit of St. Louis, published in 1953, won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1954 and was made into a movie three years later, with James Stewart as the lead. The book was intended to supersede We, which, written in haste, had never satisfied the aviator as an accurate account of his flight. Starting sometime after the war, he rejoined Pan American as a consultant for the nominal fee of $600 a month.

Several of the stones placed around the house — one as a decorative end piece to a hallway, another as a step to the tearoom — are from centuries-old Japanese gardens, now vanished.

Beyond the official preparations, a group of Washington community organizations, including the city's Black Lives Matter chapter, called on area hotels to close in the lead-up to the inauguration to signal to Trump supporters that white supremacists are NOT WELCOME in D.C.! And after some of the rioters last week targeted reporters and photographers in the Capitol, the Committee to Protect Journalists advised anyone covering the inauguration to avoid wearing press lanyards and to carry as little equipment as possible. Since the attack on the Capitol, Mr. Trump has begrudgingly and inconsistently pledged a peaceful remainder of the transition period — something he refused to commit to for more than two months after he lost the election.

By the numbers alone, New York City Ballet's Here/Now Festival is mind-blowing. Over the course of four weeks, the company is dancing 43 ballets by 22 choreographers. Even if that accounts for less than a quarter of the 230 works that more than 60 choreographers have made for the troupe since the death of its godlike founding choreographer, George Balanchine, in 1983, it's still an epic-size sample. No other ballet company in the world can approach these numbers.

Why is this book different from other books about the Jewish future? Because its author does not have a religious or political agenda. This book is not a commercial for any particular brand of Judaism or Zionism. It does not begin with a priori assumptions about God, the survival of the Jewish people, the superiority of Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, or Reconstructionist Judaism, or the essential conservativism or liberalism of Judaism. I am neither a rabbi, a Jewish fund-raiser, a member of a Jewish studies faculty, an officer of any Jewish organization, nor an advocate for any particular Israeli party. Though I am essentially a secular Jew, I do belong to Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist congregations. Most of my family members are modern Orthodox, and a few are ultra-Orthodox. Some are completely secular. I have generally positive feelings about all Jewish denominations, as I do about the numerous Jewish political, educational, and philanthropic organizations to which I belong and contribute. I have no personal stake in any particular solution to the problem of Jewish survival. I just want American Jewish life to move from strength to strength. I love my Judaism and I feel passionately about its survival, but I do not believe in survival merely for survival's sake. Judaism should not be seen as a patient about to die a natural death, who is kept alive artificially on a respirator for as long as possible without regard to the quality of life.

Sugimoto also insisted on using as many premodern materials and techniques as possible. The lustrous smoky black square tiles that blanket the hallway are clay, handmade by a ceramist in Nara, near Kyoto, whose ancestors made the tiles for the centuries-old Todaiji temple. They are intended to be used on roofs, but Sugimoto prefers them for the floor because of the particular way they reflect the light. The walls are covered in soft-white Japanese shikkui plaster, which was carefully applied by trained craftsmen — though it is smooth to the touch, their strokes glint unevenly in the natural light. The kitchen cabinets are entirely covered in long metal sheets hammered by hand. Nearly all the apartment floors are clad in splendid planks of unfinished cedar (the notable exception is the master bedroom, whose floors are laid with chestnut, the wood hand-scooped to lend it a dappled effect; Sugimoto calls the sensation of walking on it a free foot massage).
That an intricate discussion of sex and morality was being conducted by 40 men and one woman who have taken vows of celibacy is a stark reminder of a major difficulty facing the Catholic Church in America: how can a celibate clergy persuade sexually active lay people to allow the church to regulate their sex lives? For while American Catholics tend to believe and accept the church's teaching on most doctrinal issues, according to Gallup polls, more than 80 percent of them, in defiance of doctrine, approve of artificial contraception, two-thirds say that premarital sex is morally acceptable (among Catholics under 35, the figure is as high as 9 out of 10), nearly half say that homosexual activity can be morally acceptable and roughly half say that abortion (excluding late-term partial birth abortions) should be legal in many or all cases. In addition, most American Catholics would support a married clergy, and most approve of the notion of female priests. 'Any time Jerry hooked up with some girl in ''Seinfeld,'' we knew they were sleeping together,' Magat says. 'Should I find these things funny? This is the stuff I'm going to be preaching against!'

What makes Mr. Johar's case so much of a piece with this particular moment in India is that while he has been circumspect on his sexual orientation, he has, both in his life and his work, been breathtakingly explicit about sex: In 2013, he gave the Indian screen a smoldering gay kiss in Bombay Talkies; two years later, as roast master in a comic event that millions saw on YouTube, he joked before a live audience, with his mother present, of being the recipient of anal sex; in his new book, that same curious mixture of reticence and candor pervades. Mr. Johar will not use the male pronoun, but he writes openly and often movingly about everything from the pain of unreciprocated love to the aridity of having to pay for sex.

It was the design and building of a tissue-perfusion apparatus at Rockefeller Institute (now University) in New York. He was introduced to the project by Dr. Alexis Carrel, who had won the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1912 for development of blood vessel transplant procedures. The French-born Carrel was interested in the thirties in living organs outside the body, and the problem was to devise an instrument to perfuse these organs and keep them alive. For me, Lindbergh recalled, that began an association with an extraordinarily great man. To me, his true greatness lay in the unlimited penetration, curiosity and scope of his mind, in his fearlessness of opinion, in his deep concerns about the trends of modern civilization and their effect on his fellow man. In addition to perfecting a pump--an important breakthrough in its time--Lindbergh invented a quick way of separating serum from whole blood by means of a centrifuge. The Lindbergh- Carrel friendship lasted for 14 years, until the scientist's death in 1944. A brilliant investigator, Carrel tinkered with philosophy and other matters; and his thoughts in these areas were sometimes quirky. He believed, for example, in extrasensory perception. He also spoke against industrial civilization and suggested that we ought to try to produce a certain number of individuals above the mental stature we observe in the best. He said, moreover, that only the elite make the progress of the masses possible.

MADNESS IS BETTER THAN DEFEAT, by Ned Beauman. (Vintage, $17.) Emboldened by fungal clairvoyance after inhaling mold in an old temple, a C.I.A. agent tells the story of a fateful meeting in the Honduran jungle in 1938. The novel's twists and turns touch on everything from colonialism to conspiracy theories. Our reviewer, Helene Stapinski, called the story a kitchen-sink sendup of spy novels, 1930s Hollywood and screwball newspaper comedies, with a pinch of Pynchon thrown in for fun.
The Catholic Church saw itself as embattled against the rest of the world and tried to recruit its converts as polemicists, but they, more often than not, retained heavy intellectual debts to their Protestant past and could not repudiate their personal and intellectual heritage. Paradoxically, then, Catholicism was both totally different from its rivals and yet, at the same time, remarkably continuous with them. It was a paradox that frequently caused friction between the new and old Catholics.
He hosted a rally at his church to protest the killing of Trayvon Martin. Last year, he wrote a letter to the mayor of St. Louis suggesting that if police practices were not reformed, his denomination could take its annual convention — and the millions of dollars that come with it — elsewhere. And at a gathering of black congressional leaders, his raspy voice grew louder as he declared that black people needed to take charge of our destiny.
JW: Right, but you're talking about expanding the court, too, and if you expand the court, as you say correctly, that it's a federal law, there's nothing in the Constitution about the number of justices. You expand it to 13, the next Republican who comes in, who is furious about women having too many reproductive rights, will expand it to 17 to overturn the rulings you just got. So, how doesn't that just become — doesn't devolve into ——
Nearly 60 of his voluptuous, perfectionist pen-and-wash drawings (out of some 800) have traveled from the National Library of France for Jean-Jacques Lequeu: Visionary Architect, a bewitching exhibition at the Morgan Library & Museum. (The show follows a larger show at the Petit Palais in Paris; another version was seen last year at the Menil Drawing Institute in Houston.) These painstaking sheets, capricious or perverse, steeped in powder blue and misty rose, are a remarkable achievement of the later Enlightenment — and yet they have much more to offer young architects today than a drawing lesson. When the building contracts dry up, you realize your one true client is desire.
I say all this because I am part of the story I am going to tell, and I feel the need to give some idea of where I'm coming from.
We would not have Trump as president if the Democrats had remained the party of the working class. The decline of labor unions proceeded at the same rate when Democrats were president as when Republicans were president; the same is, I believe, true of loss of manufacturing jobs as plants moved overseas.
The first story takes place in 1812, when Napoleon was battling the czar for control of the Pale of Settlement (the western part of czarist Russia), where millions of Jews were forced to live in crowded poverty and under persecution and discrimination as second-class subjects. A victory for Napoleon held the promise of prosperity, first-class citizenship, freedom of movement, and an end to discrimination and persecution. A victory for the czar would keep the Jews impoverished and miserable. The great Hasidic rabbi Shneur Zalman--the founder of the Lubavitch dynasty--stood up in his synagogue on the first day of Rosh Hashanah to offer a prayer to God asking help for the leader whose victory would be good for the Jews. Everyone expected him to pray for Napoleon. But he prayed for the czar to defeat Napoleon. In explaining his counterintuitive choice, he said: Should Bonaparte win, the wealth of the Jews will be increased and their [civic] position will be raised. At the same time their hearts will be estranged from our Heavenly Father. Should however our Czar Alexander win, the Jewish hearts will draw nearer to our Heavenly Father, though the poverty of Israel may become greater and his position lower.
The order was in response to a motion filed by Bryan Kennedy, a lawyer for Mr. Shipp. The idea, Mr. Kennedy said, came from both his client and a murder case in Louisa, Va., where a judge in September ordered a life-size portrait of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee removed from a circuit courtroom at the defendant's request.
Of course, Gerwig isn't the first to change the way Little Women gets told. People have been adapting, and then critiquing, and then adapting, and then critiquing it for decades — each iteration a kind of Rorschach test for how the world feels about women at the time.
My biggest luxury is Sunday school and church, she said. When I miss, I get grumpy.
Darien Monk doesn't wish a broken espresso machine on anybody, but once upon a time she wouldn't have minded if the ones at the Coffee & Tea Exchange in Chicago, where she works, were out of order a little more often.

I love work, and the numbers also clearly show that people need work. Men in particular, without work, they volunteer less than employed men. So think about that for a second. They have higher rates of substance abuse, their health deteriorates, all these social ills accompany. Of course, we need to create jobs in as many communities as possible.
So you're seeing this kind of more conservative aspect of Britain and their view of Markle reflected in the British press.
Yeah, when you're talking about box-office bonuses and what's reported. Yeah, that's all shifted now. So now, negotiations, going into that, would have to be an exceptional upfront money or some other matrix, some other way of —
It's a good question, because thinking back, there are scenarios where, yeah, we weren't needed. And maybe we shouldn't have gotten the call. But unfortunately —
That evening I was alone. My guy Tobe was out of town, attending some kind of computer convention. I hadn't even started on dinner: I was sitting there with my Discuss Group biography open on the couch, next to the ashtray. It was 20:15. I remember the time because I had just been startled out of a nod by the night train, which came through early, as it always does on Sundays. The night train, which shakes the floor I walk on. And keeps my rent way down.
A year later, he was named editor of The Week in Review (now called Sunday Review). He supervised that Sunday section until early 1989, when he was promoted by Max Frankel, the executive editor, to a senior editing position in charge of the newsroom in the evenings as it assembled the next morning's newspaper. He oversaw the paper's coverage in those hours, its newsprint presentation and, after the first edition went to press, follow-up planning for the next day.
In the decades since, El Cap has become one of the most famous climbs in the world. Some professional climbers ascend it without ropes, or climb so rapidly they seem to sprint up the side; the speed record on a route called the Nose, set in 2018 by Tommy Caldwell and Alex Honnold, is just under two hours.
In 2007 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that states direct 14 percent of funds from tobacco taxes and the national settlement toward antismoking campaigns, but most states have funneled it toward other areas, from agriculture to literacy.
Last week, Dr. Biden appointed Rory Brosius, a former Biden campaign adviser, as director for the Joining Forces initiative, a program supporting military families Dr. Biden started with Michelle Obama when she was first lady. Dr. Biden is also expected to push for free community college and raise awareness for breast cancer prevention, aides said.
So the clearest emblem of this is NASA and space travel where we all watched the Apollo 13 movies and we've seen the armies of research scientists helping launch these missions. Now where those research scientists? They're all at Space X and Blue Origin and they're there working for the tech guys who are putting billions into it. It's going to be very, very difficult to somehow reverse essentially decades of talent migration into the private sector. And if you're a talented kid out of Stanford, why would you work for the federal government? It's like if you're working in the private sector, you feel like you're going to go faster, you're certainly going to get paid more. You're going to be working with smarter people and you idolize Elon Musk, like who the heck, you know?
Not long after he wrote that passage, Dickey started teaching poetry at the University of South Carolina. A young Tim Gautreaux was his student, and even the quiet, profound title of Gautreaux's dissertation, Night-Wide River, shows he was listening. Now, nearly 50 years and six books later, Gautreaux's latest story collection, Signals, affirms that he is Dickey's true heir.
Opera is an art form of affliction. It's a genre that has long made a specialty of giving trauma stature and structure.
Scot McCloughan, who signed on as the Redskins' general manager in January 2015, was dismissed a little more than two years into the four-year deal he signed back then, ending weeks of speculation about his future.
At times events in other churches could prompt a new spate of conversions. In the early 1890s, for example, a group of High Church Anglicans led by Lord Halifax raised the question of corporate reunion, the collective readmission of the Church of England into the Catholic Church. Hopes ran high among Anglo-Catholics for a time, but in 1896 Pope Leo XIII made a categorical declaration in the papal bull Apostolicae Curae that Anglican orders were invalid and that, in effect, there was nothing to discuss. In reaction a cluster of Anglican clergymen who had seen themselves as members of the worldwide Catholic communion and had been hoping for a different answer, resigned from their livings and converted to Catholicism. A push came for American Episcopal priests in 1908 when their church decided to inaugurate an open pulpits policy, permitting all varieties of Protestant ministers to preach in Episcopal churches. American Episcopalians who saw themselves as Anglo-Catholics revolted at the prospect, and here too the result was a large handful of conversions.
His son, Sebastian, confirmed the death.
Every time I see my name up there, I can hardly breathe because of the responsibility that goes with it, King said. If I'm going to have my name on anything, I would welcome Margaret, I would welcome Pentecostals, I would welcome whoever. Whether I agree with them or not is not important; I would just be more welcoming. I just feel like she's gotten really derogatory.

It was decades earlier, in the early 1960s, when Spector made the hits that he famously described as little symphonies for the kids, packing brash innovation into three-minute melodramas, treating adolescent romance as a universe of rapture and tragedy.

Reviewing A United Kingdom for The New York Times, Glenn Kenny said the best reason to see the film was Mr. Oyelowo's performance and added, It is remarkable, genuinely riveting work. One scene in particular encapsulates the performance: an open-air meeting at which he must convince his countrymen that he should remain their king and that they should accept his wife. In an interview at The Times, Mr. Oyelowo, who was also a producer of the film, explained how, for this scene, he drew on his own life as well as historical research. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation:
So we need to have better, more holistic ways of measuring how our kids are doing educationally, and we need to empower teachers and let teachers do their jobs. Because if you are a teacher and you're teaching to the test, you end up making decisions in the classroom that you know are not right for the students.
Well, I would suggest that one side has been acting as if it is an arms race. And so, in that environment, it's only appropriate to respond in a way that you think would help move the country and our legal system in the right direction. Can I talk — oh.
And on top of it, Scaletta, their favorite restaurant on the Upper West Side, had just closed.
But I also noticed times when I mistook benevolence for selfishness, times when my motive was all about avoiding a difficult, but necessary, conversation. I struggled greatly to be honest with my husband about how I had developed intense feelings for another man. Once I finally spilled the truth, it opened up a conversation about our very different expectations of marriage — mine turned out to be very high, even though I hadn't fully acknowledged it. We navigated our way around unhelpful emotions like blame and found each other again, ultimately coming out stronger. But I never would have understood who I was inside my marriage without the conversations my honesty forced.
We need to modernize the court. Lifetime appointments might have made sense at one point a long time ago, but when the Constitution was drafted, people did not live as long. And also, people stepped down from the Supreme Court for any of a range of reasons. They did not wait until they were at death's door. This is not a way to run a 21st-century society.
His office also announced that he would create a surgeon general position for the state by executive order. His aides said the governor's first budget would seek to expand Medi-Cal coverage to undocumented youths up to age 26.
Yeah. And I think in some ways, there's some positive lessons to be drawn from that time, because there were some significant accomplishments during that era.
The New York Times sportswriter Red Smith quoted Kuechenberg in 1975 on his strategy for neutralizing defenders, in this case the Chicago Bears tackle Wally Chambers. I just fight him, Kuechenberg said. As long as he's beating on my head and not the quarterback's, it's all right with me.
Mr. Lari, a leading force for historic preservation in Pakistan, died in Karachi, Sindh's capital, on Dec. 5. He was 84. The cause was complications of Covid-19, his family said. His wife, Yasmeen Lari, a prominent architect, contracted Covid-19 in December but recovered.
President Franklin Roosevelt tried to advance a court-packing strategy to ensure favorable rulings on New Deal legislation. He wanted to appoint up to six additional justices, one for every justice older than 70 years. The plan was unpopular in Congress and among the Supreme Court's justices.
The Western Shoshone Nation sued the government for failure to honor the treaty, but courts ruled that they were not entitled to compensation. The tribe appealed, and the Indian Claims Commission awarded it $26 million in 1979. But the tribe refused to accept the money in exchange for the land. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that the tribe had lost title to the land when the $26 million was deposited earlier as payment, even though the tribe had not collected the money.
I often wrote about my experience as a mixed-race young adult for class, but would keep these essays hidden from all but the instructor and my grandmother. In one of my grandma's magazines, I discovered the book Black, White, Other — a seminal text for mixed-race scholars of my generation. It was my first purchase from Amazon, the company my uncle soon left the nest to work for. One cousin was bound for art school, another for music school, and I was bound for nowhere but knew I wanted to write.
After Vatican I, and especially after Pascendi, English and American convert intellectuals tended to stay away from strictly theological questions altogether and work in the safer realms of literature, history, and the social sciences. Like their nineteenth-century predecessors, however, they too aimed to draw more converts into the faith that had won them. A succession of British converts, including Hugh Benson, Ronald Knox, G. K. Chesterton, and others, tried to dazzle their readers with wit, erudition, and ostentatious orthodoxy. Even so the experience of their earlier lives made their view of the outside world different from that of born Catholics and enabled them to make distinctions that sometimes escaped their born-Catholic fellows. These converts usually had relatives still outside the church; their own education outside Catholicism had formed their minds; and they found it difficult to demonize a non-Catholic society with which they were still intimately connected. Their chief line of attack was to criticize the premises of non-Catholic philosophy and science, to demonstrate its epistemological vulnerability, and to expose its links to a callow idealization of progress, sometimes with wry admissions that they too had once been deceived by its charms. They also brought their Catholic insight to bear on the political changes of their era, arguing that without the guidance of faith the world was out of control. The First World War gave their critique of progress a new plausibility.
Common Defense's End the Forever War pledge advocates for an expedient conclusion to the global war on terror and American military involvement in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, and Mr. Yang became the fourth candidate to sign on, in May, following Senators Sanders and Warren (and former Senator Mike Gravel).
How did you think about this scene?
This week, a six-part documentary on Lifetime is taking an expansive look at the allegations against Mr. Kelly, a chart-topping artist whose history has invited extra scrutiny in recent years.
Instead, it creates an either-or dualism from the difference between man and woman. He does most of the partnering (traditionally, all of it). She rises onto point. When he does the same (seldom), the effect is comic. The foot is a relatively tiny part of the body; yet its significance becomes colossal.
I wasn't opposed to A.B. 5. I wanted to amend it and make it more open to people like freelance writers, and drivers and other people who find themselves caught in a situation that's very difficult for them.
Romance novels teach readers that all partners are equal participants in a sexual relationship, said Bea Koch, the 28-year-old co-owner (with her 25-year-old sister, Leah) of the Ripped Bodice, a bookstore in Culver City, Calif., that exclusively sells romance titles. They highlight conversations about consent, birth control and myriad other topics that people generally find difficult to talk about. In some instances, it can be a literal script for how to bring up difficult topics with a partner. They give a road map to people wanting to experiment with their sexuality, or even just get in touch with what they want and need in a sexual relationship.
I guess the most difficult to date was LBJ. I went down to the LBJ library a couple of times and spent countless hours just trying to absorb the sense of him visually, vocally. There's copious amounts of books about him, which were all very helpful and endless. So you could just get completely absorbed, and I did. I got completely absorbed in developing the character that by the time I got to the ART in Harvard to do the out-of-town part of it, I was not prepared for the massive amount of dialogue that I was saying. I was so into developing the character that we did the table read, and I read through it, and I went, oh my god, I haven't started memorizing any of this. And I was panicked. I was really panicked that I wouldn't get it.
For the next ten days, from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur, the Kushners and the country boy hid in the bushes in the pouring rain. Lisa almost gave up, What kind of life is this? she asked. Let them kill us already. Eventually, they found a farmer to take them in. After two days, wagons pulled up. At first, Rae thought it was the Nazis. The men had machine guns. But soon they recognized the Jewish partisans. Tuvia Bielski had heard of their escape and dispatched a group to look for survivors.
AH: I mean, I don't think most people had.
Every now and then during my visit, she sat at her large wooden desk and took out a legal pad. In that space, she seemed to imagine her former self returning, as if a professional atmosphere could reawaken her lost language. I longed to see sentences flow onto the page. But after scribbling two lines in half an hour, she put down her pencil in exhaustion.
This is a father whose daughter marries a billionaire.
Happens. If it can, if it does explain behavior, and if it's a reality.
People of color in political office, women controlling their fertility, L.G.B.T.Q. people getting married, using their bathrooms, and having children go against the state of nature defined by white heteropatriarchy. This is a domain in which men and white men in particular stand at the apex of power, holding their rightful position over women, nonwhites, perhaps non-Christians (in the U.S.), and of course, in their view, sexual deviants such as gay people.
Granted, the back story to their coupledom is unusual, maybe even by the standards of the French, whose current and past leaders have been embroiled in very public romantic dramas.
Mr. Yang's campaign estimates that federally regulating the U.S. online poker market could raise $2.2 billion just in its first year. The campaign also argues that federal regulation would make it easier to combat money laundering.
Almost certainly, yes. And you saw it a little bit with Barack Obama where he tapped Joe Biden in part because Joe had very deep relationships on Capitol Hill. If you had another outsider like me, we'd still be trying to figure out who to call. So, you need to have folks who have deep relationships on Capitol Hill from day one.
Phil Spector died Saturday as an inmate in California, convicted of the 2003 murder of Lana Clarkson. By then, other facts had emerged about his volatile, erratic, gun-toting behavior, notably in Ronnie Spector's 1990 memoir, Be My Baby, which detailed his abuses during their seven-year marriage. Some listeners may well decide that all of his music is poisoned. But it is also inextricable from pop history.
Coming days will determine how far this goes, but for the moment the nation faces, for all intents and purposes, the makings of a civil insurgency. What makes this insurgency unusual in American history is that it is based on Trump's false claim that he, not Joe Biden, won the presidency, that the election was stolen by malefactors in both parties, and that majorities in both branches of Congress no longer represent the true will of the people.
CW: Well, what about when it comes to like the N.S.A. and the technology they have and the surveillance? You don't want Google doing surveillance of people here and abroad?
Proust never refers to his Jewish origins in his fiction, although in the youthful novel he abandoned, Jean Santeuil (first published only in 1952, thirty years after his death), there is a very striking, if buried, reference to Judaism. The autobiographical hero has quarreled with his parents and in his rage deliberately smashed a piece of delicate Venetian glass his mother had given him. When he and his mother are reconciled, he tells her what he has done: He expected that she would scold him, and so revive in his mind the memory of their quarrel. But there was no cloud upon her tenderness. She gave him a kiss, and whispered in his ear: `It shall be, as in the Temple, the symbol of an indestructible union.' This reference to the rite of smashing a glass during the Orthodox Jewish wedding ceremony, in this case sealing the marriage of mother to son, is not only spontaneous but chilling. In an essay about his mother he referred, with characteristic ambiguity, to the beautiful lines of her Jewish face, completely marked with Christian sweetness and Jansenist resignation, turning her into Esther herself--a reference, significantly, to the heroine of the Old Testament (and of Racine's play), who concealed her Jewish identity until she had become the wife of King Ahasuerus and was in a position to save her people. The apparently gentile Proust, who had campaigned for Dreyfus and had been baptized Catholic, was a sort of modern Esther.
But this much is clear: A king's role in Malaysia has little parallel among the world's monarchies.
'THE ARTIFICIAL JUNGLE' at the Clurman Theater at Theater Row (previews start on May 27; opens on June 8). Polly wanna thriller? Theater Breaking Through Barriers revives this Charles Ludlam comedy, a film noir homage to the likes of Raymond Chandler and James M. Cain. The show centers on a pet store owner, his discontented wife and the sultry drifter she falls for (a role once played by the revival's director, Everett Quinton). A parrot also figures.
Honeyland is the first film to be nominated for best documentary and best international feature (the category formerly known as best foreign-language film). It follows Hatidze Muratova, a middle-aged beekeeper whose peaceful life in the Macedonian countryside is disrupted when a chaotic family moves in next door.
Here's another example: Teenagers in both states will learn about the Harlem Renaissance and debates about the movement's impact on African-American life.
These are both thoughtful, textured performances. And if you believe that old quip defining good acting as not bumping into the furniture, then hand them a couple of Tonys.

In each area, Mr. Lau exceeded Ms. Chau's expectations. He proudly identified as a practicing Christian and candidly shared his spiritual journey; he received a bachelor's in economics and a bachelor's in international relations from the University of Pennsylvania. He also received an M.B.A. from the University of California Berkeley, and a master's in computer information systems from Boston University. For Mr. Lau, 35, the couple's shared roots in Hong Kong were also important: It comes with a lot of cultural language, the little ways we talk about things in Cantonese.
KK: O.K. Moving onto a perhaps slightly less serious topic.
Mr. Yang founded Venture for America, a fellowship program for recent college graduates, in 2011, with the goal of creating 100,000 new jobs in the country's most underresourced cities. As of 2019, the nonprofit has created around 3,500 jobs.
That shift may resonate most strongly with those who have known the country as it was.
ALL AMERICAN STORIES 8 p.m. on the CW. The life of the football linebacker Spencer Paysinger was the inspiration for the CW sports drama series All American. Paysinger co-hosts this documentary special, which profiles eight athletes who have overcome extraordinary circumstances in their own lives — including the Paralympic sprinter and long jumper Scout Bassett, the Olympic champion shot-putter Michelle Carter and the Paralympic sprinter David Brown. The special is divided into two hourlong parts (the second airs Feb. 1).
California Texas Takeaway Texas says that white Southerners opposed Reconstruction because of tax increases as well as racial resentment. California instead includes primary-source quotations from black historical figures about white resistance to civil rights. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Growth & Conflict, California, P. 586; McGraw-Hill, United States History to 1877, Texas, P. 555 Both states say that breaches of racial etiquette led to lynchings after Reconstruction. But only California, whose edition was written more recently, makes clear that the perpetrators of lynchings also hoped to discourage black political and economic power. HMH, American History: Reconstruction to the Present, California, P. 245; HMH, The Americans: United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 288
Indeed. As understood by someone who thinks of British history in the most traditional way.
KK: Yeah, that's literally our question.
In this new world, Federico argues, promises of broad-based economic security were replaced by a job market where
Many Jews did convert--some at knifepoint, others to advance themselves. The story about Professor Daniel Chwolson illustrates the latter phenomenon. Chwolson, a Russian intellectual of the nineteenth century, had converted from Judaism to Russian Orthodoxy as a young man, but he continued to fight against anti-Semitism. This led a Jewish friend to ask him why he had converted: Out of conviction, the great man said. What conviction? his Jewish friend inquired. Chwolson responded: Out of a firm conviction that it would be far better to be a professor in St. Petersburg than a Hebrew school teacher in Shklop. Yet despite the material advantages of conversion, most Jews resisted it. Clearly, those Jews--who sacrificed so much--remained Jewish not only in reaction to their enemies. More than our fabled stiff-neckedness was involved. There are substantive principles that Jews have been so stubborn about--that we have been willing to fight and even die for. For Jews who define their Jewishness in theological terms, it is easy to find that principle: It is God's will. For the large number of Jews who are skeptical about being God's chosen people, the principle is more elusive, but it is palpable to most of us, though difficult to articulate. It is a disturbing reality, however, that for a great many Jews, their Jewish identity has been forged and nurtured by our external enemies who have defined us as victims of their persecution.
So, right now, the government is like this flopping appendage behind a lot of this stuff. I mean, honestly. The Office of Technology Assessment was eliminated in 1995. So our legislature is literally 24 years behind the curve on technology, and they don't understand. They're totally outgunned. They don't know what's going on.
On top of that, in the United States.
Episode one details the threats and harassment rained down upon the women who spoke out in the original documentary. The parents of one young woman, Faith Rodgers, said they had to move out of fear for their safety. A Kelly associate threatened to release a compromising video of Ms. Rodgers with Mr. Kelly, and she had a seizure from the stress. Another woman, Jerhonda Pace, said strangers, presumably Mr. Kelly's fans, threatened to beat her up in a parking lot when she was out with her children. She has since moved out of Illinois.
Doris has two things left in life. One is her weekly Skype visit with her American great-niece, Jenny, a married mother of three. The other is the memoir she is writing, prompted by names in the red address book given to her by the father she lost as a child: All the names that come and go. That rip our hearts to pieces and make us shed tears. That become lovers or enemies. The address book may wear a bit thin as a literary device, but each name unlocks a new adventure.
Common Defense's End the Forever War pledge advocates for an expedient conclusion to the global war on terror and American military involvement in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, and Mr. Yang became the fourth candidate to sign on, in May, following Senators Sanders and Warren (and former Senator Mike Gravel).
But moments after arriving with his pregnant wife and three children at the foot of the international bridge, he and his family were stopped by Mexican officials and detained.
Each person who registers is supposed to receive a unique identification number called Huduma Namba — or service number in Swahili. Officials said the number will be required to pay taxes, open bank accounts and get a drivers' license, in addition to accessing health and schooling services.
I woke up this morning and Jennifer was standing at the end of my bed. She was waiting for my eyes to open. I looked, and she was gone.
Well, the labor force participation rate has declined precipitously, so I don't buy that somehow the government started giving people more money over the last number of years. And the headline unemployment rate, and I'm sure you know this, it doesn't measure underemployment, 40 to 44 percent of recent college graduates are now doing a job that does not require a college degree. It does not measure the fact that 94 percent of new jobs in the economy are temp, gig or contract jobs that do not have health care benefits and can disappear at any moment. It doesn't include the fact that you might be doing two or three jobs to make ends meet.
The statistic that 78 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck was reported in a 2017 study by the human capital management firm CareerBuilder. Read the study here.
It has also been interesting to watch in recent years how businesses have worked to scoop up some of the spending around this major global holiday.
The world community, including the United States, has rightly condemned the intentional destruction of cultural heritage for decades. Hitler's Germany, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Islamic State and the Assad regime in Syria intentionally destroyed cultural heritage in the absence of any military necessity. If Mr. Trump carries out this threat, the United States will join the ranks of these destroyers of the world's cultural legacy.
Mr. Cuomo made no mention of the bail reform on Wednesday during his speech, which included quotations from George Washington, Henry David Thoreau and the singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, and an extended nautical theme, with mentions of rocky shores, rough seas, and a political and social superstorm of anger and divisive rhetoric.
The legislation was not published until July, after the mass registration exercise had ended — a move that Justice Nyamweya said was contrary to principles of democratic governance and rule of law.
He did not just get shot because he was in the Wendy's parking lot asleep and he just wanted to go home. No, that's not what happened. He chose to fight the officers. He chose to be a fleeing felon when he hit the officer in the head and gave him a concussion. And then the officers reacted at that point. So you can have the conversation all day whether you agree or not that the shot was right or wrong, and we can wait for the evidence. But what you can't dispute, or you should not be saying, is that a man was killed because all he wanted to do was go home, and he was just sitting in a Wendy's drive-through and he fell asleep. So I don't — you know, words have meaning. So when you say certain words, you have to understand that you need to say what you mean. And to say that our training should keep us from killing a man that just wanted to go home just isn't genuine.
In 1977, Ms. Cole won a supporting-actress Emmy for her portrayal of Matilda, the wife of Chicken George (Ben Vereen), in Roots, the eight-episode ABC mini-series based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1976 book by Alex Haley. The series followed his ancestors' journey from West Africa to the United States as slaves, and many generations beyond.
Some of her politicking was of the shoe-leather, door-to-door variety. In Mr. Carter's 1976 campaign, she was part of the peanut brigade of volunteers that traveled to contested states. She did the same thing in later elections, including 2004, when she was 84, supporting Senator John Kerry's bid to unseat President George W. Bush. She opposed the tax breaks — a substantial one in her case — that Mr. Bush had given rich people like her.
And Mark, how are the British people thinking about all this and thinking about her as they watch this wedding?
A researcher specializing in inherited bone diseases who was drawn into the burgeoning field of ancient DNA in the late 1980s, Dr. Sykes had a hunch that mitochondrial DNA, which passes largely intact from mother to child, could be used to trace the deep origins of human populations. But he needed a way to test his hypothesis.
In her insightful review of Gillian Gill's Virginia Woolf: And the Women Who Shaped Her World (Jan. 12), Claire Jarvis refers to the incestuous advances Woolf suffered at the hands of her half brothers. George Duckworth's actions were not advances. They were repeated, physical, full-on sexual abuse. After their parents married, Duckworth, who was 14 years older than his half sister and then in his 20s, repeatedly entered her bedroom secretly at night and sexually abused her until her older sister, Vanessa, also his victim, reported her own abuse to a family doctor.
I think it's actually unfortunate that I get asked about those sorts of questions, in the sense that I feel like men should leave the room and let women decide what to do with your bodies. I have a feeling I know what you would decide, and then we could come back and say, Hey, what did you decide? I also think that if men got pregnant, this would be a very, very different conversation. And we'd have a completely different approach to these issues. So, I don't have a short list of Supreme Court justice appointees, but safeguarding women's reproductive rights and having an evolving sense of the law would be very important.
Yeah. As far as, OK, the first one that you talked about — that Officer Rolfe's life was never in danger — well, let's not forget, there was a fight ensued. One officer did go to the hospital with a concussion. And I guess it depends on whether you subscribe to that a taser is not a deadly weapon.
In Search of Jewish Identity for the Next Century
Scrutinizing, looking after it, because I'm just like, What? My hair? Who cares? No one. And then people are like, No, no, and they have to put time in, smooth it out.
(Here's the sign-up, if you don't already get California Today by email.)
BA: But just to be clear, it's still not a progressive tax. There's no model that says that you can use these kinds of exclusions and exemptions to make that progressive. You can make it less regressive. You're still fundamentally proposing a nonprogressive means of revenue raising.
KK: Actually, I also want to ask you about your time at Manhattan Prep. Your colleague Kimberly Watkins told City Council in September that she had faced both gender harassment and pay inequity under your leadership there. Could you respond to those allegations?

The 'macro values' of President Trump
[Read our critic's review of Russian Doll.]
Not at all. We originated the SAT during World War II as a way to determine which kids we did not want to send to the front lines. Now we treat our kids like every year is wartime. I've talked to parents and teachers around the country, and I've said, we need to de-emphasize these standardized tests. They are a terrible measurement of human value, certainly have nothing to do with character. At this point, as you said, they are more likely to test your parents' socioeconomic status than anything else.
The Rev. William J. Barber II, a chairman of the Poor People's Campaign, preached and directly challenged Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to pursue a Third Reconstruction, decades after the civil rights era. He urged them to address interlocking injustices of systemic racism, poverty, ecological devastation/denial of health care, the war economy, and the false moral narrative of religious nationalism.
Stern's interest in Karadzic isn't purely academic. As the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, she writes about her deep curiosity about the causes of evil, and of a persistent desire to make creative use of the sequelae of childhood trauma. Ten years ago, she published a memoir, Denial, which recounted in unsparing detail how her grandfather molested her, and how a 15-year-old Stern and her younger sister were raped at gunpoint after a stranger entered their home.
Ms. Wilhelm was one of the few women writing science fiction under their own names in the 1960s, and her books quickly gained a following as well as awards.
At the moment of this confrontation, Aldo tells Vanda only that he's been with another woman, not the more hurtful truth that he's deeply in love with Lidia. We learn years later about his lack of nerve. Several years after this dramatic rupture, Aldo and Vanda come back together — a painful process that takes time; their new equilibrium requires them to hide things from each other. They live together for decades. One day, they return from a beach vacation to find their Rome apartment ransacked.
Among the guild's original-screenplay nominees are three movies that won Golden Globes on Sunday. They are the war film 1917, which took the Globe for best drama; the South Korean sensation Parasite, the Globes' foreign-language film winner; and the divorce dramedy Marriage Story, which netted Laura Dern a supporting-actress Globe. The WGA Award category was filled out by the mystery Knives Out and the acclaimed teen comedy Booksmart.
Phillipa is infuriated by the older woman's refusal to divulge anything about her early life or ancestry, speculating that she is a Nazi in hiding, living in fear of being ushered to the gallows at Nuremberg. Later, over the course of a 60-page dream sequence, she imagines Bernadette as a teenager in occupied France, subjected to graphic sexual brutality by a Nazi soldier. The novel can't seem to decide whether this episode is a parable or a revenge fantasy, revealing something that runs much deeper and darker than mere extramarital passion.
So if you had, for example, a rule that said, Look, the government is allowed to match whatever salary a private sector employee is being offered, then you'd have more success. If you said, Look, you don't need to move to Washington, D.C., and sit in the thing that was built decades ago, that's like solace, and you have this giant parking lot and you just feel miserable being there for like a day, let alone a career.
Lawmakers may have been exposed to the coronavirus while sheltering during the Capitol riot, a doctor says. Members of the House of Representatives leaving the floor on Wednesday. Credit... J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press While sheltering in a secure location as a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday, House lawmakers may have been exposed to someone who was infected with the coronavirus, Congress's Office of the Attending Physician said on Sunday. In an email sent to lawmakers, Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician, said that while the time in this room was several hours for some and briefer for others, during that period, individuals may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infection. He told lawmakers to obtain a P.C.R. test as a precaution and continue taking preventive steps against the spread of the virus. Congress has long struggled to stem the spread of the virus within its ranks, with mixed guidance and a delayed testing regimen. Dozens of lawmakers, staff members and reporters took shelter in the secure room on Wednesday, but a handful of Republicans refused to wear masks, one person there said, even as Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester, Democrat of Delaware, tried to pass out masks.
Murkowski Is Latest G.O.P. Senator to Signal Possible Support for Convicting Trump The timing of the Senate's impeachment trial remains unclear. President-elect Joe Biden unveiled a sweeping economic plan on Thursday that included additional $1,400 stimulus checks. The Secret Service will establish a security green zone in the capital ahead of Inauguration Day.
So you're looking at a nation of high school graduates. And what do high school graduates do for a living? The top five occupational categories are retail and administrative, which includes call center work, retail, food service and food preparation, transportation, primarily truck driving, and attendant supportive jobs and manufacturing still. We all know that we have gutted many of these industries, and their labor bases have shrunk.
And so ballet remains a sexist view of the world — one that privileges the woman, certainly, but on terms that let her shine only by doing what no man can. Should we agree with the choreographer George Balanchine (1904-83) that ballet is woman? Or do we qualify this, as the choreographer Pam Tanowitz (born in 1969) has recently done, by saying that ballet is a man's idea of woman?
So if you look at other countries, they have a value-added tax and then they take those resources and put them to work toward various social programs in ways to balance out the inequality. Now, another thing I love about the value-added tax is you can either reduce it or exempt things like diapers, toilet paper, eggs, milk, things that Americans consume just to make ends meet, and you can dial it up on things like artificial intelligence, yachts, luxury watches. There are ways that you can make it so that it falls more heavily on people that would barely notice. And we're taking the resources plus an additional hundreds of billions of dollars and putting it directly into the hands of working Americans. This would increase the buying power of literally 90 percent of Americans.
American Jewish life is in danger of disappearing, just as most American Jews have achieved everything we ever wanted: acceptance, influence, affluence, equality. As the result of skyrocketing rates of intermarriage and assimilation, as well as the lowest birth rate of any religious or ethnic community in the United States, the era of enormous Jewish influence on American life may soon be coming to an end. Although Jews make up just over 2 percent of the population of the United States--approximately 5.5 million out of 262 million--many Americans mistakenly believe that we constitute a full 20 percent of the American people, because of our disproportionate visibility, influence, and accomplishments. But our numbers may soon be reduced to the point where our impact on American life will necessarily become marginalized. One Harvard study predicts that if current demographic trends continue, the American Jewish community is likely to number less than 1 million and conceivably as few as 10,000 by the time the United States celebrates its tricentennial in 2076. Other projections suggest that early in the next century, American Jewish life as we know it will be a shadow of its current, vibrant self--consisting primarily of isolated pockets of ultra-Orthodox Hasidim.
Well, so this is the part of the story that most people know. The couple spend several months thinking and planning their new life. They talk it over with members of the royal family. Buckingham Palace slow rolls them, tells them to take their time. It has to be thought through. It's complicated. The tabloids, particularly The Sun newspaper, get wind of the fact that they may be leaving the country. And suddenly, they decide to tell the world that they have this plan for a new lifestyle, and all hell breaks loose.
Since the rock duo Twenty One Pilots released its fourth album, Blurryface, in 2015, Josh Dun and Tyler Joseph have become one of music's most surprising success stories: The record opened at No. 1 on the Billboard charts, and it has remained comfortably in the Top 10 since. They are also nominated for several Grammys this year, including record of the year for the hit single Stressed Out. It's not hard to see why Twenty One Pilots has connected with a mainstream audience: With the current pop landscape largely devoid of cutting-edge rock 'n' roll, Twenty One Pilots draws on all sorts of sonic ideas, from pop and pop-punk to hip-hop and reggae. The duo's live show is equally enthralling: In this Friday evening performance, look for Mr. Dun's drum kit to be sent into the crowd, as fans hold him aloft. With Judah and the Lion. KEVIN O'DONNELL
Dobbins prepares publicity material for an anti-abortion march.
The flow of conversions in Britain and America between the mid-1840s and the late 1950s was sufficient to indicate the continuing allure of Catholicism, but it was hardly large enough to throw non-Catholic intellectuals into a panic. Although Newman was widely admired and stimulated other members of the Oxford Movement to follow his example, he was unable to lead his own brother into the Catholic fold, and most of his erstwhile followers, including the other movement leaders, Nathan Pusey and John Keble, remained staunch Anglicans. As in Britain, so in the United States. Orestes Brownson, a member of the Transcendentalist circle, carried his family and a few friends into the embrace of Rome in 1844 but not his twin or his other siblings. Most of his New England cronies, accustomed to Brownson's frequent changes of opinion, treated him as a mercurial spirit who had finally stepped off the edge of the world rather than as a role model. Among them, only Isaac Hecker and the group who later founded the Paulist fathers went with Brownson to Rome.
Mr. Cuomo has also favored a bill that would close the so-called L.L.C. loophole, which allows corporate interests to funnel almost unlimited amounts of money into campaigns through various anonymous limited liability companies. The loophole has been a bête noire of good government groups for years, but has been utilized by various powerful politicians in the state, including Mr. Cuomo, who has been one of its biggest beneficiaries.
But by then the trio was on the verge of being supplanted as the face of folk by a new generation of harder-edged singers like Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs and Joan Baez, and by hipper ones like Peter, Paul and Mary. Then the coming of the British invasion and the rise of rock utterly marginalized the group.

In her 25 years of marriage to Jeff Bezos, MacKenzie Bezos has been a loyal ambassador for Amazon, the company that made her and her husband the richest couple in the world.
I can assure you that Bryan Cranston will never be a Hugh Jackman. He's phenomenal. No, because I don't consider myself a singer. I'm not trained in that area. But I think I've been a moth to the flame on a lot of the things that I've done in my career. Anything that kind of scares me, I'm attracted to. And being on stage and singing is a fearful position to be in.
KK: Think you might be overly optimistic. Maybe we'll move on to foreign policy, if you don't mind?
In a business you can say, Hey, we're going to go this way, and people generally have to do what you're saying. In government it's much more analogous to my role as the founder of a national nonprofit, where you have hundreds or even thousands of stakeholders, and you have to try and generate energy around a vision. Let people see that it's in their self-interest or the self-interest of the people that they represent to get on board with your vision. And that you're willing to compromise and work with them. That is the way I would lead as president.
The evidence will show the complaining witnesses sent dozens and dozens of loving emails to Harvey Weinstein, Mr. Cheronis said, adding that one woman gave Mr. Weinstein her new phone number and another sent an email saying she wanted the producer to meet her mother.
No, no. I'm not a worrier by nature, so I don't focus on any of that. It's just a reality. I'm very proud of Breaking Bad, of course, and it changed the trajectory of my career. And so I'm exceedingly happy that I did it. And what a great series. No, if that is the pinnacle of my career, as far as what the critics and the audiences know, then I'm perfectly happy with it.
Our young people, by and large, are having sex as a result of social pressure, Damares Alves, the minister of human rights, family and women, said recently as she encouraged abstinence. You can go to a party and have lots of fun without having sex.
You're referring to the fact that Rashard Brooks grabbed the officer's taser and shot it twice.
During the busiest stage of his solo career Mr. Parisot performed with the major orchestras of Berlin, London, Paris and Munich, and with conductors including Leopold Stokowski, Pierre Monteux and Leonard Bernstein, winning plaudits for his warm, focused sound; prodigious technique; and a temperament that balanced passion and elegance.
PepsiCo announced on Thursday that it was suspending all donations from its corporate political action committee, adding to the list of dozens of companies that have come out with some sort of halt on political giving since last week's violence at the Capitol. Eileen Sullivan and
The domestic bonds that doom the female characters in the classics of the Western feminist canon — from The Yellow Wallpaper, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, to Wide Sargasso Sea, by Jean Rhys — find echoes in two arresting novels by Asian writers. The Waiting Years, Fumiko Enchi's psychologically astute 1957 novel of stifled emotions, traces the protracted humiliation of Tomo, a 19th-century Japanese wife obliged to procure a series of mistresses for her husband over the course of their marriage.
In a sprawling home in Punjab, the families of Kanan (Suraj Sharma), a 26-year-old aspiring rapper, and his longtime girlfriend, Anu (Mehreen Pirzada), prepare for their wedding. But Kanan has his doubts — he thinks he might be too young for marriage — and to make matters worse, his family insists he first participate in a ceremony marrying him to a tree. (In this way, he is told, the hapless Kanan can avoid the usual fate of a manglik, a person born under a cursed star.)
Mr. Newsom, 51, had been the state's lieutenant governor — largely a ceremonial position — for eight years under Mr. Brown. Before that, he served as mayor of San Francisco, where he positioned himself, for the most part, on the liberal side of the spectrum. He was an early promoter of same-sex marriage and the legalization of recreational marijuana.
leaned into the underlying White nationalist sentiments that had been on the fringe in his campaign for the presidency and made his campaign about re-centering Whiteness as what it actually means to be American and, by implication, delegitimizing claims for greater racial equity, be it in policing or any other important domain of American life.
Diana Athill spent most of her life as an editor, working with titans of literary history. They were mostly male — most anointed titans are — and the challenge of this job was immense enough to warrant a thick memoir, Stet: An Editor's Life. Remarkably, Athill didn't use the pages to complain, an instinct that would have been easy to understand, but instead to sing the praises of the written word and the people who make it their mission to tell stories. What she less overtly advertised, though, was her fiercely independent life. Athill died last week at the age of 101, and her words, at several critical points in this reader's life, provided a lifeline. Perhaps her greatest legacy was her refusal to cede to societal expectations as she carved out a persistently unusual world for herself in which the demands of femininity — marriage and children, specifically — were rethought and redefined.
In the days that followed, I packed my books and clothing in a suitcase and then took them out again. I told myself the right thing to do was to let him go so he could build a cabin near Susquehannock State Park with a woman who kept her word, but I couldn't convince myself to leave. I kept remembering how he brushed his hair back and blinked at the same time. For some reason, this tiny movement is what I loved about him most.
Colonel Tom turned: Pleased to see me. Not even a little frown of inconvenience, like maybe I was going to take the shine off his evening. But the instant he opened the door I could feel my face collapsing. And I knew what he thought. He thought I was back on it. I mean the booze and all.
Throughout, Whitaker repeatedly questions whether it's possible to tell one's story without robbing another person of theirs. It makes you both thieves, Sharon's boyfriend insists upon discovering his life is the subject of her new film. She disagrees. That story in there is mine. It belongs to me, she counters. This is what I do and you know it. We don't need your consent. Maybe not, but as the characters in this novel repeatedly learn, the freedom to tell one's own story often comes at a steep price.
He looks familiar, she said, but meanwhile, she'd had the good luck to be with a new tablemate, Eleanor. Her third marriage, her last, we think. It's an ancient story, the widows providing companionship, one to the other. And protection. Recently, when Lucille started eating Eleanor's cupcake, my mother cried, No, Doodle! That's Doodle's cupcake, not yours. Even though everyone is now Doodle, Eleanor is the significant Doodle. How miraculous, that when so much is lost there is still the possibility of deep friendship; the name is immaterial. The two women have an affinity beyond words, but they also share jokes that sometimes extend for as long as 10 seconds. There is comfort sitting silently side by side, comfort, I'm sure, knowing they are together in the same strange boat.
If you have term limits, it is bipartisan. Because ——

As some Democrats shouted back, You resign, the Louisiana Republican said, I was prepared to lead our narrow majority as Speaker and I believe I had it in me to do a fine job. But I cannot do that job or be the kind of leader that I would like to be under current circumstances. So I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow.
For a 1955 New York Philharmonic appearance under the conductor Walter Hendl, he gave the premiere of Heitor Villa-Lobos's Cello Concerto No. 2, one of many works Mr. Parisot would commission during his career to expand the cello repertory.
While the Senate has so far refused to allow for witnesses, the House impeachment managers brought them to the floor anyway in the form of video clips of current and former officials who have already testified before the House, including former National Security Council official Fiona Hill and European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland.
In this latest book, the scales are even bigger because among other things it's a book about climate change, which is one of the biggest scales. … Yes, the world is ending, but also you wake up in the morning and touch base with your brother over text to make sure he and the baby are doing O.K., and both of those are real and both of those are happening, Jamison continues. One of the challenges of writing about climate change is how to take this thing that is essentially on a larger scale than our minds can hold and how to make it a narrative that our minds can hold. … Climate change isn't quite on a human scale, but narrative is on a human scale, so how do you translate that?

Progressive government by definition must be functional, the governor said, returning to a common theme and citing his father, the former governor, Mario M. Cuomo.
Several Republicans, including some members of the Freedom Caucus, have begun to circle the wagons around her. The entire party would be wise to heed the words of Ronald Reagan: 'The person who agrees with you 80 percent of the time is a friend and an ally, not a 20 percent traitor,' said Representative Michael Burgess, Republican of Texas. Yesterday, Republicans jumped on the calls for unity and healing no matter how they decided to vote. Removing Liz from her leadership position would be divisive and a distraction we cannot afford. Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who also voted to impeach Mr. Trump, said that Ms. Cheney in the last week had gained immeasurable respect, and suggested that it was Republicans like Mr. Jordan who should be shoved aside in the wake of the siege and the impeachment it prompted. Since the discussion is opened, though, we may have to also have a discussion about who in our party fomented this, and their roles as ranking members, he said. The debate over Ms. Cheney's leadership post reflects the deep fractures in the Republican Party over Mr. Trump, who has demanded total loyalty from his party and, up until recently, largely received it. While prominent figures have recoiled from Mr. Trump's incendiary brand of politics in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 riot, worrying that it could spell ruin for their party, a large minority faction — many of them in the House — remains unwilling to abandon him.
So it became a natural focus of Suhail Zaheer Lari, a prominent Pakistani historian and author, who dedicated himself to documenting the history of Sindh Province, in southern Pakistan. He had a passion for photography, and his images of Makli's riches became the basis of several proposals for their conservation.
LK: Speaking of women, I wanted to ask you about reproductive rights as well. You told some of our colleagues in the newsroom that you would consider some executive actions to protect reproductive rights, but I haven't seen any details about what actions you're considering. Do you have any details to share with us about that?
You know how at the root of everything we don't say to each other is slavery? Murray asks.
No, certainly not before the statements had taken place, and in terms of consequences, I would suggest that someone like Shane had probably paid a price in many ways. Like, aside from being fired, there are many circles that, if he shows up in, he'd be labeled very, very negatively. He reached out to me personally, and I had a conversation with him. The conversation with him made me feel more confident that I'd done the right thing. Because I think in many cases we're trying to follow up on a sense of shame and humiliation that the person might already feel.

Do you think there'll be fewer theaters? Obviously, the economics have been hit incredibly hard. Would it be a different experience?
SS: O.K. Again, about your responsibilities as president. One of the heaviest ones would be waging war. When you look back on the conflicts into which recent presidents have put us, would you support this? Is this something you would have done in Syria, in Libya, in Kosovo? Would you have sent troops there?
So we need to have better, more holistic ways of measuring how our kids are doing educationally, and we need to empower teachers and let teachers do their jobs. Because if you are a teacher and you're teaching to the test, you end up making decisions in the classroom that you know are not right for the students.
When people feel pigeonholed by the way they define themselves — to the point that it's the only way they can see themselves — they often use deception to double down on that identity. Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced founder of Theranos, is an extreme example; a less serious example might be the professor who quickly changes the station to NPR before a colleague gets into the car. The challenge, Dr. Leavitt says, is to be able to pivot to another identity when you feel threatened. The star saleswoman who failed to win the contract, for example, could remember that she is also a mentor.
I woke up this morning and Jennifer was standing at the end of my bed. She was waiting for my eyes to open. I looked, and she was gone.
We have to be working toward China's second main priority, which is maintaining robust economic growth. So there are two goals. There are two primary goals that are sometimes in tension, of maintaining social order and maintaining robust economic growth. And the best way we can try and contain their behavior in Hong Kong is to say, Look, the economic costs are going to be very, very high. And the best way we can do that is to build global consensus around certain norms and behaviors.
For Malory and Caleb (Lauren Lapkus and Nick Rutherford), becalmed in a four-year engagement, the thrill has gone — though, honestly, it's hard to imagine one was ever there. Unrelentingly quippy (both actors have backgrounds in sketch comedy and improv), their interactions suggest kooky best pals much more than longtime lovers.
As some Democrats shouted back, You resign, the Louisiana Republican said, I was prepared to lead our narrow majority as Speaker and I believe I had it in me to do a fine job. But I cannot do that job or be the kind of leader that I would like to be under current circumstances. So I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow.

We still haven't gotten over it, and even in this advanced time of always-on, I'm not sure we should. The sweet nothings that Mr. Bezos was sending to one person should not have turned into tweets for the entire world to see and, worse, that most everyone assumed were O.K. to see.
Over the top? Maybe. But the new, alarming truth is that I didn't care. At all.
I want to turn to the visual evidence that prosecutors pointed to in their presentation of Officer Rolfe kicking Brooks's body once he had been shot. And I know that talking about the specifics of this is tricky for you. But you are a longtime officer. You train people. You're a union representative. That feels like a singular moment in all of this. And is that appropriate conduct ever appropriate conduct for an officer?
In a world where people use emojis to represent everything from weddings to poop, the announcement naturally led to much discussion, with an image of a drop of blood becoming a new way to talk about menstruation and a pinching symbol leading to jokes about a certain male body part being very, very small.
In a business you can say, Hey, we're going to go this way, and people generally have to do what you're saying.

In an interview on Dec. 4, it was clear that Mr. Yang has done his homework, traveling across the country and listening closely. He really seemed to have an almost emotional sense of what people have been going through and what the problems are, a board member [Related: What Is an Editorial Board?] said afterward. His portrait of the fundamental economic problems were more moving than Bernie's, and Bernie has been selling this for 30 years.

GARCIA-LEE I don't think I have my full capacity back. I've started dancing again, and it just feels like something is off in my chest.
In government, that's radical. A quick caveat here: Helping governmental agencies treat their constituents like customers they hope to retain should in no way be translated as advocacy for the privatization of those functions (as seems to be the desire of the current administration). Rather, government can benefit from public-private partnerships that bring some private best practices into public sector work. Brooks said: Trust is our share price. We don't have market pressure, but we do have to deliver on our promise to care for veterans. We're trying to measure how we're doing with our customers just as the private sector has been doing, so we can quickly make improvements where people are getting stuck.
In a handwritten letter, filled with anguish and a touch of cruelty, she explained her decision to marry Aristotle Onassis instead.
For the migration authorities, it is a job, said Melvin Gómez, 18, who is from the Mexican state of Chiapas. For Mexicans and Central Americans, immigration is a dream.
Yeah, you said you don't need 80 percent of Congress, you need a majority. And I would push back and say neither of those is correct. You need 60 percent of the Senate currently. The question is, how do you plan to get things done, even if you had a Democratic majority in the Senate? Which I think is right now less than an even chance. How do you propose getting your agenda through Congress when the filibuster is in place?
I started and ran a national nonprofit called Venture for America that recruited enterprising college graduates to help grow businesses in Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, New Orleans, Birmingham, Baltimore, and nine other American cities. We helped create several thousand jobs. I'm very, very proud of that. But I realize that the jobs we were creating were only going to apply for a small slice of the population. And these jobs were pouring water into a bathtub that has a giant hole ripped in the bottom. I'm running for president to let America know that it is not our imagination, the water is rushing out of the bathtub. Immigrants have nothing to do with it. It's the fact that we're going through the greatest economic transformation.
Our economy is breaking down on all levels. Again, if you are fortunate enough to graduate from college today, you're in the top third of the population, you're graduating with tens of thousands in school loans very, very often, and there's a 40 to 44 percent chance you're going to do a job that does not require your college degree. That's if you're one of the winners in our society today. I spent seven years working with, frankly, some of the top educational products in our country. I saw that even the winners are not winning right now. And so imagine if you're a nonwinner, what this looks like.

I'm not sure why there's all this conversation about Tulsi's position right now, he wrote in an email. Her position changed a long time ago. So, I'm not sure why it's coming out now.
Well, thinking of this, you once said Walter White was going to be the first line in your obituary, and I think you're probably right — maybe not, who knows yet. Do you worry about that all? Because you've gone on to do other things, obviously.
(It is customary for family members or friends to pay for a seminarian's gold or silver chalice, the cup in which wine and water are believed to be transformed into Christ's blood, and whose essential role in a priest's life is likened to a doctor's stethoscope.)
Karen Pence, the second lady of the United States, returned to teaching art this week, accepting a part-time position at a private Christian school that does not allow gay students and requires employees to affirm that marriage should only be between a man and a woman.
Saturday's votes were the penultimate step in the most serious conflict between Congress and a President since Richard M. Nixon resigned in the face of impeachment and certain conviction on Aug. 9, 1974.
JW: Right, but you're talking about expanding the court, too, and if you expand the court, as you say correctly, that it's a federal law, there's nothing in the Constitution about the number of justices. You expand it to 13, the next Republican who comes in, who is furious about women having too many reproductive rights, will expand it to 17 to overturn the rulings you just got. So, how doesn't that just become — doesn't devolve into ——
Season 3, Episode 4: 'The Hour and the Day'
So pervasive was this dismissal that I'd chalked it up to a generational divide, and I assumed that my students in Abu Dhabi would also see feminism as old-fashioned and irrelevant. But I have come to reconsider that assumption. I need to be a feminist so I can do general world-saving, said one student, slightly joking about the world-saving but dead serious about the feminism.

BA: But that doesn't make our tax code more progressive.
JI: I actually really quickly want to go back to a question that Binya was asking you. You said, you gave us the example of parents with two kids and you're on food stamps and you're worried about your kids' future. And at the end of that explanation, you said that you are not for curtailing social supports, but isn't your plan such that, that mother, aside from what the kids would get in the future, that mother would have to choose between the food stamps and the actual U.B.I., right? Is that correct?
I say we may be entering this golden age; there are no guarantees. Many Jews believe that the end is near, because increasing rates of assimilation and intermarriage are propelling us toward a demographic Armageddon. A recent apocalyptic article in a Jewish journal concluded that Kaddish time is fast approaching for the American Jewish community. (Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.) But reports of the death of Judaism may be premature--if we can change the way we think, and act, about Jewish survival. If we refuse to change, if we accept the current demographic trends as intractable, then Jewish life in America may indeed be doomed.
The question of whether to prioritize free public college has divided the Democratic candidates. Senators Warren and Sanders say that four-year public colleges should be free, and Senator Cory Booker signed on to legislation that could make it debt-free. Senator Amy Klobuchar previously criticized the idea of free college for all, but then signed on to a version of a free-college proposal. Mr. Yang, though, has said he supports forgiving more student loan debt but thinks the Freedom Dividend is a better solution to inequality than free college.
BA: You've expressed profound distrust of market forces. You just compared the major tech companies to drug dealers, and you want the N.S.A. to outsource national security work to them?
Walking away from her son's elementary school one morning, Lizzie thinks: The problem with Eli's school is it's not on a human scale. The same could be said of writing about climate change: The subject isn't on a human scale. Our minds can reckon with it, but how do we ask our child-size human hearts to hold it — to be productively overwhelmed by it? If I responded more strongly to Dept. of Speculation than to Weather, it might be a testament to the narrative dilemma the new novel is reckoning with: the scale of its ambition, despite its brevity, in its attempt to tell a story about climate change that carries the same visceral force as our private emotional dramas — that is, in fact, inseparable from them. It's quite possible I'm just as much a solipsist as the red-faced man in the novel who listens to a lecture about melting glaciers and then asks, But what's going to happen to the American weather?

The reason I am drawing, in some polls, 10 percent or more of Donald Trump voters to my campaign is that Republicans and conservatives do not hate economic buying power in citizens' hands. What they hate is a giant bureaucracy making everyone's decisions. So you ask what my main priority will be as president, it will be to get the Freedom Dividend across the finish line and get buying power into Americans' hands, which will then lead us to be able to solve many other problems much more quickly.
Though Mr. Kratz loved to paint and write, he lacked the confidence to pursue a career in the creative arts, so he chose public relations. One of Mr. Kratz's first jobs was in the London office of the entertainment public relations firm Rogers & Cowan, where he served as the trans-Atlantic tour guide for Jane Seymour and Zsa Zsa Gabor.
ANNE TERESA DE KEERSMAEKER at the Museum of Modern Art (March 29 through April 2). The Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker proposes a question: Can choreography be performed in the form of an exhibition? For Work/Travail/Arbeid, she reimagines her piece Vortex Temporum (2013), set to Gérard Grisey's score, for a museum setting. Originally 60 minutes, the new version is a nine-hour cycle in which each hour features a different iteration of the choreography using seven dancers from Ms. De Keersmaeker's company, Rosas, and seven musicians from the Ictus ensemble. The five-day event, which takes place in the Marron Atrium at MoMA, can be viewed during museum hours. It has appeared before at WIELS in Brussels, at the Centre Pompidou in Paris and at the Tate Modern in London.

OLIVO I have yet to go to the doctor to check out what my lungs look like, but I know I'm going to have to have someone look. I sang a song for a benefit, and when I went to get it on tape, I was struggling.
The church has been to some degree disengaged, said the Rev. Dr. W. Franklyn Richardson of Grace Baptist Church in Mt. Vernon, N.Y. Churches that have social consciousness are pushed by this anniversary into a place of reflecting on how far we have come or not come, and have we abandoned what he gave his life for?
No, I don't think so. If you look at what's happened, the reason that home viewing has exploded, not just because of COVID —
In an interview on Dec. 4, it was clear that Mr. Yang has done his homework, traveling across the country and listening closely. He really seemed to have an almost emotional sense of what people have been going through and what the problems are, a board member [Related: What Is an Editorial Board?] said afterward. His portrait of the fundamental economic problems were more moving than Bernie's, and Bernie has been selling this for 30 years.
Marcel Proust was born on July 10, 1871, to well-to-do middle-class parents. His mother was Jeanne Weil, a twenty-one-year-old Parisian, daughter of Nathe Weil, a rich stockbroker. Her great-uncle Adolphe Cremieux was a senator and received a state funeral; he was also president of the Universal Israelite Alliance. Her mother, Adele, was (like the Narrator's grandmother in Remembrance of Things past) a cultured woman who loved, above all other literature, the letters of Madame de Sevigne, one of Louis XIV's courtiers and a woman who was almost romantically in love with her own daughter (the one-sided Sevigne mother-daughter relationship inspired Thornton Wilder when he wrote The Bridge of San Luis Rey). This intense intimacy was in fact characteristic of Marcel and his own mother, who were inseparable, who fought frequently (usually over his laziness and lack of willpower) but always fell into each other's arms as soon as they made up. Mother and son shared a love of music and literature; she could speak and read German as well as English. She had a perfect memory and knew long passages from Racine by heart; her dying words were a citation from La Fontaine: If you're not a Roman, at least act worthy of being one. Marcel inherited her taste for memorizing poetry and knew long passages from Victor Hugo, Racine, and Baudelaire.

KK: Do you feel like you need to have a running mate who has operated in Washington before or who has previous government experience?
Now, I watched the district attorney's news conference. And what he said was that at the time that Rashard Brooks was shot twice in the back by Officer Rolfe, he had twice shot the taser in such a way that it was essentially empty and unusable. And that this would be something that an officer like Officer Rolfe would know — having carried a taser, used a taser — that it contained two taser shots. So in that case, does that complicate the point that you're making here?
The cause was a heart attack, said Linda Cooper, the executive secretary of the cremation and burial association that is handling Ms. Cole's arrangements.
Mr. Yang has proposed what he describes as a W.T.O. for data and has argued that data ownership should be made a property right. Some argue that such an organization could enable more partnership among countries in setting standards for artificial intelligence and data.
Let's say I'm on food stamps, and I've got a 15-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. I'm concerned about their future, very, very deeply. And then Andrew Yang becomes president, and I find out that my 15-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month starting at age 18 for the rest of his life, and my 12-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month for the rest of her life. I'm going to say, wow. That's actually the biggest value gain I've ever even heard of in history. My kid will have a financial literacy class in high school, the first semester of their senior year. It is impossible to teach financial literacy to someone who does not have money. So the kids will actually learn about what to do with the money before they start getting the money.
What followed was a whirlwind public life for an academic who had built his career in the lab but who soon became one of Britain's best-known scientists, popularizing cutting-edge technology through TV appearances and best-selling books that gave millions of people access to their distant pasts.
I badged my way through the tunnel of uniforms around the front door, making the landlady as my best witness or last-to-see. There was a fat full moon reflecting the sun on to my back. Not even Italian police are sentimental about full moons. You're looking at a workload increase of twenty-five to thirty-five percent. A full moon on a Friday night and you're talking a two-hour backup in the emergency room and long lines trailing in and out of Trauma.
archived recording As this journey wore on, another human story emerged — [CHEERING] — of a man still wrestling with the legacy of his background, of his birth, and the tragic death of his mother.
In the chaos, the past comes rushing into the present. Out tumbles a box in which Aldo had kept photos of Lidia, and the letter from Vanda that opens the novel. He thinks back to that fraught time, to the day he told his wife he was leaving. I tried to explain that it wasn't a matter of betrayal, that I had enormous respect for her, that real betrayal was when you betrayed your own instinct, your needs, your body, yourself, Aldo recalls, but Vanda, raging and cursing, would have none of it. She shrieked, but then immediately she contained herself so as not to wake the children.
His family said in a statement that the cause was Covid-19.

Her movie career began in 1955 when she played a doomed hitchhiker in Kiss Me Deadly, a hard-boiled detective film based on a novel by Mickey Spillane. She was already a seasoned stage and television actress by then, and throughout the rest of the 1950s and the '60s she appeared in big roles on the small screen — she preceded June Lockhart as the mother in the 1957-58 season of Lassie — and small roles on the big screen, including as a prostitute in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969).
JI: You've proposed legalizing gambling at the federal level, regulating it.
We need to modernize the court. Lifetime appointments might have made sense at one point a long time ago, but when the Constitution was drafted, people did not live as long. And also, people stepped down from the Supreme Court for any of a range of reasons. They did not wait until they were at death's door. This is not a way to run a 21st-century society.
Yet, for all of the Democrats' charges of excessive partisanship today, enough Republicans did pick and choose among articles of impeachment to send only two of the four that had come out of the House Judiciary Committee on to the Senate.
For Malory and Caleb (Lauren Lapkus and Nick Rutherford), becalmed in a four-year engagement, the thrill has gone — though, honestly, it's hard to imagine one was ever there. Unrelentingly quippy (both actors have backgrounds in sketch comedy and improv), their interactions suggest kooky best pals much more than longtime lovers.
With warmest wishes, Mr. Specktor, 54, wrote, and thanks, hope you enjoy.

Ms. Gabbard alluded to her conservative upbringing and her father's work on Thursday in her video, but did not go into detail about her own anti-gay advocacy as a young person. She was the youngest person ever elected to the Hawaii State Legislature.
Top-heavy and buffeted by winds, the chugging old Pinto struggled. My traveling companion — a cat who refused to use the litter box on the back seat — was perched on my headrest, her claws gripping my scalp as eighteen-wheelers barreled past us in the dark. In the cassette player on the passenger seat, Paul Simon was singing Graceland. It is not too much to say that Graceland got me safely over Monteagle Mountain when I was in danger of going over the edge.
Over time, others, including Mr. Dylan and Ms. Baez, have given the group more credit for popularizing folk music and for serving as a bridge to the more adventurous folk, folk-rock and rock of the 1960s.
Ms. Hecht affords Esther pragmatic sympathy. But this is not Esther's play. At one point Solomon tells her, Darling, why don't you leave it to the boys? and The Price treats her with a similar condescension, sidelining her in her pert pink suit while the brothers argue, stranding her with domestic concerns while they debate moral philosophy.
Negotiations over the weekend appeared to offer little hope of an immediate agreement between Democrats and President Trump over his demands for a border wall. Democratic leaders have repeatedly said they would not agree to any funding for the wall. The White House is also digging in, insisting on $5.7 billion in wall funding, even as some Republicans have started to call for an end to the shutdown. Mr. Trump gave little ground. They don't like concrete, so we'll give them steel, he said.
And so ballet remains a sexist view of the world — one that privileges the woman, certainly, but on terms that let her shine only by doing what no man can. Should we agree with the choreographer George Balanchine (1904-83) that ballet is woman? Or do we qualify this, as the choreographer Pam Tanowitz (born in 1969) has recently done, by saying that ballet is a man's idea of woman?
I don't think she will influence society, Ms. Hung said in a telephone interview. I think she's way more influenced by Chinese society, especially the internet world. She just confirmed what the Chinese public expects out of rich kids in China.
Yeah. And I think in some ways, there's some positive lessons to be drawn from that time, because there were some significant accomplishments during that era.
With a sex scandal now consuming one of their own, the House's impeachment debate turned more than ever into a discourse on sin and morality in politics.
Oh, I think the market will work beautifully toward what it's designed to do. The market is designed for maximal capital efficiency, and it is doing a phenomenal job. That's why you see the returns on capital outstripping the returns on labor at historic levels. The market is not designed to maximize human well-being.
Even more intriguing than the support of the civil authorities is the early patronage of Jacob Rauwaert, a rich Amsterdam collector and dealer more than thirty years Cornelis's senior, who had apprenticed with Maarten van Heemskerck, an originator of Knollenstil, before redirecting his energies from making art to buying and selling it. Rauwaert provided the financial underpinnings for the group of Italian-influenced artists that was later termed the Haarlem Academy. The eldest of the three artists at its core was Karel van Mander, a painter who came from Flanders in 1583, having previously spent three years in Rome. He made his mark in Haarlem as a critic and theorist. Goltzius, a draftsman of genius, won fame through his engravings. Cornelis was the ambitious and productive young painter with a gloriously theatrical bent.
NASHVILLE — Brothers Osborne broke an unspoken rule at a recent songwriters round — a show where groups of writers take turns singing their songs in their most unadorned forms, spotlighting the lyrics and melody. But when the duo performed its hit Stay a Little Longer, the singer T.J. Osborne reached the end of the final chorus and tilted his head toward his older brother John, who promptly went into a rhapsodic acoustic guitar solo.
Several banks said that they had a lot of old frozen sperm in storage, but that it could last only so long. The reason I know this at all is simple enough: I am 32 years old, partnered to a woman, stuck at home and in the market for the finest sperm I can get.
Ruth Ann Koesun, a principal dancer in American Ballet Theater who epitomized the company's early eclectic profile by excelling in roles that ranged from Billy the Kid's Mexican sweetheart to the Bluebird pas de deux from The Sleeping Beauty, died on Feb. 1 in Chicago. She was 89.

People do one of three things, Holloway says. Suddenly they get really nice, and they want you to think they're really good people. Somebody my age, they're calling me Sir. The second one is, people get very stony, like they're mad at you. They just glare. The third one is my favorite: you walk in and they do a double take and they look really scared, like, Why is he dressed like that? He knows my secrets! The sight of a Roman collar, the seminarians go on to explain, can have the power to flush profanity from conversations, douse lovers' fights and halt the scolding of children. Airplane rides are notorious for inspiring long queries from seatmates, Catholic and non-Catholic alike, even when the seminarian isn't wearing clerics; the sight of a breviary is often enough to set things off. (Priests regularly hear confessions on airplanes, I'm told, finding two back seats for that purpose whenever possible.) Jerome Magat, a brainy, energetic 26-year-old of Filipino descent, is a second-year seminarian, so he wears clerics off-campus only when attending a formal, ecclesiastical event or when visiting hospitals, homeless shelters, prisons and schools, which is part of the seminary program. It's that supernatural element, Magat says of the reactions his clerics provoke. There's a mystery about the priesthood. Some of that mystery inheres in the very nature of the Catholic priesthood.
(In contemporary Catholicism, the sabbath begins on Saturday night.) Then he stopped at the chapel to pick up our Lord -- that is, the consecrated Hosts, which he carries to Inova Alexandria Hospital in a gold-plated cylinder called a pyx. At the hospital reception desk, Bashista was given a printed list of Catholic patients to whom he would offer Communion. First we headed for intensive care; he had been told there was a parishioner from Blessed Sacrament there. As usual, Bashista wore his clerics and Roman collar; when people he passed in the hospital halls met his eye, he smiled and said hello, and when they avoided his gaze, he let it pass. The woman in intensive care, who appeared to be in her 50's, was attached to a respirator. It hiked up her chest every few seconds and injected air into her lungs with a gasping noise. Her skin was deeply jaundiced everywhere but her hands, which were bright purple. Bashista stood close to the woman and leaned over her. When he spoke her name, her eyelids parted and she looked up at him. Bashista introduced himself and asked how she was feeling, but she couldn't speak; the respirator attachment filled her mouth. He leaned close and took one of her plum-colored hands in his. You've got a good strong grip, he said. A priest had told Bashista that the woman felt close to a guardian angel, whom she had named. Father told me about Emily, Bashista said now. She's a sweet little angel.
The next day she wrote, I appreciate all you do for me, it shows. And five days later, she wrote, It would be great to see you later and catch up.
The conservative views that Lindbergh later articulated, the remarks about Jews that proved so startling when he was opposing American entry into World War II, his adverse opinion of the Soviet Union, his belief in Western civilization--these were all a reflection of a world view prevalent among his friends, which he absorbed over the years. An engineer and aviator of genius, he was, however, not an intellectual, nor a consistent reader, nor a social analyst. The assumption of this elitism accounted for his conviction that America should lead the world in the development of flight, that a conflict between English and German groups of nations would [be] a fratricidal war, that race was a valid judgmental concept and that to accomplish an objective one should deal with the top people. It also accounted for what many people thought was his anti-Semitism. Lindbergh did not regard himself as an anti-Semite. Indeed, he was shocked a couple of years ago when this writer put the question to him. Good God, no, he responded, citing his fondness for Jews he had known or dealt with. Nor did he condone the Nazi treatment of German Jews, much less Hitler's genocidal policies. On the other hand, he accepted as fact that American Jewish groups were among those promoting United States involvement in World War II. He voiced these views in a speech in Des Moines, Iowa, on Sept. 11, 1941.
She has her indulgences: She tends the community garden next door and drinks the occasional glass of white wine.
Hizo falta una pandemia para enseñarnos lo que muchas culturas han sabido desde siempre: que los círculos de amistad pueden darnos vidas más saludables y felices. Dan Buettner, becario y autor de National Geographic, ha estudiado los hábitos de las personas que viven en zonas azules, que son áreas alrededor del mundo donde la gente vive mucho más tiempo que el promedio. Ha descubierto sistemáticamente que las culturas con una larga esperanza de vida valoran los lazos sociales fuertes. En Okinawa, Japón, por ejemplo, donde la esperanza de vida promedio de las mujeres es de alrededor de 90 años, las personas forman una especie de red social durante la infancia llamada moai: un grupo de cinco amigos que ofrecen apoyo social, logístico, emocional e incluso financiero para toda la vida. Los miembros de cada moai también parecen influir en los comportamientos de salud de los demás durante toda la vida.
So when I heard that Shane Gillis had called me Jew chink — I think was the slur — my reaction was the same reaction anyone would have, which was like, who the heck is this guy, and he sounds like a total jackass. Well, my wife actually had heard about it independently and was also like, Who the heck is this guy? And so then I sat down and started to figure out who Shane Gillis was, what he did for a living, and then I sat down and watched some of his comedy to try and get some context.
In response, Ms. Cunningham Agee said she had urged her husband to reconnect to his first family, but couldn't persuade him. Every Christmas, I begged him to do it, she said.
Yeah, it does. It's one reason why I think we need to de-emphasize — excuse me.
It confirms some of the worst suspicions that people had about Meghan Markle as this relationship first began.
So you have a situation where the premise of the story is that a father doesn't like his daughter's boyfriend, and that's it. It's so thin.

It wasn't the kind of sex that anyone paid for. But the police saw a lot of people going in and out of her house and concluded that it could be for only one reason, and so they arrested her in 1962 on prostitution charges.
Some of the names of these convert intellectuals are widely familiar, and among them John Henry Newman, G. K. Chesterton, Isaac Hecker, Orestes Brownson, Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh, Thomas Merton, and Dorothy Day have all been the subject of more than one major biography. Around Newman, Day, and Merton, indeed, academic subfields have formed, and the existence of the Chesterton Review suggests that the memory of this prolific Londoner is also well tended. But no one has yet written a study of the general impact of converts on Catholic intellectual life in this era or the distinctive style of Catholicism they helped to create. Nor has anyone investigated the extensive transatlantic contacts among these English-speaking Catholic writers. Such is the purpose of this book.
No luck. The envelope was clean. The syringe the man had used to inject the drugs was new, the receipt from a nearby pharmacy in his pocket.

PARK CITY, Utah — A runaway bride, wildly rambunctious women and two quietly resolute girls — the Sundance Film Festival is one movie celebration where the so-called second sex consistently comes out on top. Now in its 36th year, the festival has long made room for female filmmakers even when there weren't all that many. In 1985, its inaugural year, it presented 85 movies, 10 from female directors, about half non-Americans like Lina Wertmüller, one of the few such filmmakers on anyone's radar back then. Of this year's 128 features, nearly half are from women. (The festival ends Sunday.)
Publishers are eager to please state policymakers of both parties, during a challenging time for the business. Schools are transitioning to digital materials. And with the ease of internet research, many teachers say they prefer to curate their own primary-source materials online.
Here is my personal ten-card. At the age of eighteen I enrolled for a master's in Criminal Justice at Pete Brown. But what I really wanted was the streets. And I couldn't wait. I took tests for state trooper, for border patrol, and even for state corrections officer. I passed them all. I also took the police test, and I passed that, too. I quit Pete and enrolled at the Academy.
Well, so this is the part of the story that most people know. The couple spend several months thinking and planning their new life. They talk it over with members of the royal family. Buckingham Palace slow rolls them, tells them to take their time. It has to be thought through. It's complicated. The tabloids, particularly The Sun newspaper, get wind of the fact that they may be leaving the country. And suddenly, they decide to tell the world that they have this plan for a new lifestyle, and all hell breaks loose.
Still, accessibility and affordability are helping DNA-based travel take off, according to Sarah Enelow-Snyder, an assistant editor at the travel research company Skift. You can buy one for less than $100, and it's a price that has helped propel the popularity of these trips, she said.
The evidence will show the complaining witnesses sent dozens and dozens of loving emails to Harvey Weinstein, Mr. Cheronis said, adding that one woman gave Mr. Weinstein her new phone number and another sent an email saying she wanted the producer to meet her mother.
Well, the Department of the Attention Economy would likely be based in Silicon Valley, and it'd be run by a guy named Tristan Harris, who's a design ethicist. He started Time Well Spent. So I don't think it's necessarily the case that you need to try and bring everyone into the cubicles in D.C. to get the rules ——
DINARDO We've had a maximum of 12 people auditioning in a room that could, pre-Covid, fit well over 60. It's a little different than we're used to, with all the protocols, but I'm excited. It's a snapshot into our immediate future.
In the press materials for Killing Eve, Ms. Waller-Bridge talks about her desire to subvert the spy-action-thriller genre, and the show is described (in publicist-speak) as the thunder of empowered women working in front of and behind the camera. And it's certainly true that scenes and characterizations play out differently than we're used to. When Eve, freaked out by all the killing, impulsively shatters a bus-stop partition, the mood instantly shifts to comic as she frantically paws at the shards of glass in her hair. A traitor's I had to do it for my family speech sounds pathetic coming from a feckless, overbearing male agent.
Since the most recent version of Ms. Hillauer's book was released, in 2005, a number of younger Arab women have taken up film. In Morocco, Tunisia and Lebanon, women make up about a quarter of all new directors, and most focus largely on aspects of women's lives in the Arab world, according to Roy Armes's 2015 book New Voices in Arab Cinema. Mr. Armes credits the number of female directors to outside influence. Virtually all the women born in the 1960s and 1970s who have made a fictional feature have lived, worked, and/or trained abroad, he writes. There is no single pattern of entry to filmmaking, but it is notable that none of them has had the conventional, sheltered upbringing reserved for so many women in the Arab world. (Ms. Labaki, who has spent her life in Lebanon, is, as Mr. Armes points out, an exception.) This mass of educated and articulate women has changed the way in which a whole array of aspects of Arab society are experienced and depicted.
But that's what we did. That's what you did. You were the change. The answer to people's hopes and, because of you, by almost every measure, America is a better, stronger place than it was when we started.
The editorial board recently called for the Trump administration to break the impasse on funding for the proposed rail tunnel under the Hudson River in an editorial titled: Build the Donald J. Trump Tunnel. The vital infrastructure project has stalled because of political infighting.

The comment about I wouldn't want to be judged for something 25 years ago was about something completely independent. I think I'd seen something where Joe Biden was being called out for something he'd said 25 years ago, when I said I wouldn't want to be called out for some misstatement I'd made 25 years ago. And then I joked, good thing no one cared about what I was doing 25 years ago, because I was at that point a 20-year-old man, and the internet didn't really have full documentation of how I spent those years.
Cynthia Heimel, whose first book, Sex Tips for Girls, established her in the early 1980s as a fearlessly funny writer about men, feminism, female friendships, flirting, birth control and lingerie, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. She was 70.
Kathleen Kingsbury: Wonderful. Thank you. Yeah. So I have a serious question to ask you, but first we wanted to ask, were you wearing a helmet while you were biking here?
Recent Miller productions on Broadway have goosed the plays with counterintuitive casting, like the Mike Nichols Death of a Salesman, with its young Willy and reedy Biff, or radical staging, like the Ivo van Hove productions of The Crucible and A View from the Bridge. Mr. Kinney's quieter, more faithful style emphasizes the fine roles for actors but doesn't make a strong case for the play itself.
CW: Sort of pivoting off of that, you said that Senator Warren's taking sort of a 20th-century antitrust framework to big tech. What does a 21st-century framework look like in that?
I see people that have a message that they believe that it's systemic racism in the police departments. And they believe that because of the color of their skin, they're treated a certain way. They're afraid, because of the color of their skin, their children may go out and not come home.
The couple became engaged in July on a trip to Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay and began to plan their wedding soon after. They considered holding the ceremony in Hong Kong, to make it easier and safer for their families to attend, but chose California instead after Mr. Lau's parents, Yuk-Lai and Margaret Lau, and Ms. Chau's parents, Tak Cheong and Kitty Chau, both assured them that they were happy to make the journey from Hong Kong to the United States despite the difficulties and risk involved during a pandemic.
Mr. Yang's comments, on Mr. Gillis and on judgment more broadly, contribute to a growing conversation among political and cultural figures about the merits and downsides of cancel culture. Former President Obama, for example, spoke out about the prevalence of call-out culture during an interview in October, arguing that criticizing people on social media for not being woke enough is not activism and not bringing about change.
KK: We've called for that, too.
A month after Senator H. John Heinz III, a Republican, died, Gov. Robert P. Casey was still searching for a replacement, having been turned down by Lee Iacocca, the chairman of Chrysler, and others. Whoever accepted would have to run in a special election in November against the United States attorney general, Dick Thornburgh, a popular former two-term governor who had signaled his intention to seek the seat.
I haven't sat down with a lot of sitting senators and congressmen and women, but I've talked to literally thousands of people who supported Donald Trump in the last election who say they are now supporting me. I've talked to many folks who are Republicans who say they are, at least, sympathetic to my message, in large part because they understand the numbers. When I talked to 70 C.E.O.s here in New York City, not that far from here, it was a fancy bank office, most of them were Republicans. I said, How many of you are looking at replacing your back-office clerical workers with artificial intelligence and software? Guess how many hands went up out of 70. All of them. The truth is, you should fire any C.E.O. who was not looking to make that happen, because their incentives are all tied to the bottom-line profitability of their firm. And most of them were Republicans. So they understand the need for what I am proposing.
RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil's far-right government has a message for adolescents as the nation grapples with a stubbornly high teenage pregnancy rate and rising H.I.V. infections: Save sex for marriage.
Is there ever cruelty in your work now?
I think you need to work hard to bring everybody to the table to figure out a way to help workers with health insurance, with education, even with housing.
On a Sunday night in early September 2017, Kara Eileen Cheever called her sister. She had just gotten home from her first date with Fuery Thomas Hocking, after matching with him on the dating app Bumble. What was supposed to be a casual afternoon walk in Central Park with Ms. Cheever's dog, Percy, had lasted into evening.
Ms. Vidaurri retired from the stage in the late 1950s at the insistence of her husband and former booking agent, Hillman Edward Eden. (They later divorced.) She performed rarely until 2001, when Graciela Sánchez, director of the Esperanza Peace and Justice Center in San Antonio, invited her to sing at an 85th birthday celebration for Ms. Mendoza.
If you want to solve the hyperacquisition problem, which is a problem, then you have to go in and say, Look, you have to not acquire businesses that are in your space with these criteria. That would be a legitimate stance to take, because right now the business model in Silicon Valley is not to try and outcompete the behemoth. It's just to get bought by them. If you get to a point where they'll offer you $1 billion and you win, your investors win, you're rich and then these get folded in, and it doesn't even matter what they do with your business at that point.
Tom Rockwell was Squad Supervisor during much of my time in Homicide. That was before he climbed into his personal express elevator and pushed the button marked Penthouse. In the space of ten years he made lieutenant as Shift Commander, then captain in charge of Crimes Against Persons, then full colonel as head of CID. He's brass now: He isn't a police, he's a politician, juggling stats and budgets and PR. He could make Dep Comm for Operations. Christ, he could make Mayor. It's all head-doctoring and kissing ass, he once said to me. You know what I am? I'm not a cop. I'm a communicator. But now Colonel Tom, the communicator, just sat there, very quietly.
To call the Kingston Trio folk singers was kind of stupid in the first place, he said. We never called ourselves folk singers. He added, We did folk-oriented material, but we did it amid all kinds of other stuff.
Yes, that's exactly how I felt that week when I read When Death Comes, one of Ms. Oliver's best-known works. I recall distinctly how at the end of the silent retreat I was so excited not only to be able to speak again — but to talk about the final stanzas of that poem and what they meant to me:
NF: I mean, is there still a role for 20th-century antitrust?
KK: You mean, you would in addition to the nine that we already have?
Our youth, our drive, our diversity and openness, our boundless capacity for risk and reinvention means that the future should be ours. But that potential will only be realized if our democracy works. Only if our politics better reflects the decency of our people. Only if all of us, regardless of party affiliation or particular interests help restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now.
I suppose you do it, only if you're really troubled, if you're having difficulty getting a character to move into you and your soul and your being. That's a hard way to describe it. But basically, for an actor, when you start developing a character, it's outside of yourself. And the more research, the more thought, the more attention you put on that, the more you start to understand how he thinks and feels. And then you're inviting that character into yourself. And then almost like through osmosis, it comes in. And from that point on, you think and feel and act based on the filter of that character. Well, if it's frustrating for you and it's not coming, it's not coming, which happens at times, yeah, I could see you going home and living with it and barking at the dog or whatever.
Midwinter is not what prompted these reflections, although when a freezing wind whips off the East River all thoughts turn to refuge. No, the death in quick succession of two friends was the catalyst. They were older than me. But they were not old enough and not so distant in age that their memento mori feel less than urgent.
Well, it already has. Everything is going to go streaming. The studios know that. The networks know that.
The Government Accountability Office , a nonpartisan federal watchdog agency, signaled that it would look into what role, if any, members of Congress may have played in inciting the mob of Trump supporters who breached metal barricades and shattered windows on Jan. 6, seeking to overturn the results of the election.
Particularly because I think we've become unduly vindictive and punitive toward statements that people find objectionable. A friend of mine said something, he said, If the online universe descends on someone, and they lose their job, the online universe moves on a week later, but that person still does not have a job a week later. That the impact on the individual lasts much, much longer than the rancor. So I shared this.
James Dao: Can I pose a future hypothetical? If the Chinese government were to flood Hong Kong with military troops after you were president and impose a violent crackdown, similar to, say, Tiananmen Square in 1989, what would you do?
In the noisy House chamber, a lone Republican applauded. Five Republicans crossed party lines to vote against impeachment. Five Democrats broke with their party to support it.
How Textbooks are Produced 1 Authors, often academics, write a national version of each text. 2 Publishers customize the books for states and large districts to meet local standards, often without input from the original authors. 3 State or district textbook reviewers go over each book and ask publishers for further changes. 4 Publishers revise their books and sell them to districts and schools.
She writes deliciously, in this memoir, about her sexual awakening, her pursuit of ravishment. After I got a taste of sex, that's all I thought about, she writes. She slept with good guys and she slept with lunks. (I lay there and took a lot of pounding, she says about one unhappy evening.) One lover took her to an orgy, where she may or may not have seen George Plimpton in priest's robes.
She writes with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming, Feld said, concluding that we were to anticipate McCullers's second novel with something like fear, given the standard set by the first.
No, I don't think so. If you look at what's happened, the reason that home viewing has exploded, not just because of COVID —
But while that case spun out from a 1972 break-in at Democratic headquarters in the Watergate complex, this began with a murky land deal in Arkansas in 1978. Through the efforts of Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel, under the law enacted in the wake of Watergate, the investigation spread to examine Clinton's affair with an intern.
As Ms. Harris ascends to this barrier-breaking role, with her loved ones looking on, millions of Americans will see a more expansive version of the American family staring back at them — one that could broaden rigid ideas of politically palatable family dynamics or gender roles.
The differences between state editions can be traced back to several sources: state social studies standards; state laws; and feedback from panels of appointees that huddle, in Sacramento and Austin hotel conference rooms, to review drafts.
The Obama administration named Mr. Yang a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship in 2015 and a Champion of Change in 2012.
We've been waiting for this moment for 20 years, since the Fusion, and we're very excited, said Juan Carlos Aviles, 32, a youth soccer coach, referring to the Miami Fusion, the previous M.L.S. team based here. That club was folded in 2001 after years of poor attendance, the same year that the Tampa Bay Mutiny, another M.L.S. franchise, folded.

But marriage was also a necessity for our relationship's survival. When I moved to Paris with my sons, my lover's Tunisian passport made it nearly impossible for him to spend time with me here. We fixed our problem by flying to California and tying the knot.
—— more strong and more whole. There's a saying, I think it was actually, and maybe in this … no, it was an earlier administration, but a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. There was a crisis. There was a massive opportunity to help rebalance our economy, but we instead recapitalized the banks to the tune of $4 trillion. And what I say to Americans around the country, I say, Hey, do you remember voting for the $4 trillion bailout of Wall Street? And it gets this laugh. But then they answer, Wait, we did that? And it's, Of course we didn't vote for that.
He's been around so long that now that he is going to be the leader of this country, he knows he must conduct himself with presidential composure, said Chuck Hagel, a longtime friend of Mr. Biden's who served as defense secretary in the administration of President Barack Obama and before that as a Republican senator from Nebraska. He knows the only way we'll be able to start to climb out of this hole is for the leader of the country to be seen as fair and open and not dwelling on the negative.
Months after I called it quits on a long-distance relationship that lasted years, my ex came to town and met me for dinner. We ended up spending the next two evenings and nights together. Hopeful that we might actually make it stick, I stayed in touch, even once I figured out that he had already — before his visit — entered another relationship. He wrote me heartfelt, regret-filled emails and assured me that he was working on extricating himself from this Plan B. After connecting on and off for months via email, text and phone, I learned not only that he had entered a relationship but also that it was with an old flame, and that he slipped an engagement ring on her finger well before came to see me. I feel great pain and sympathy for his fiancée, who has been as betrayed and disrespected as I have. We are both victims; he selfishly stole a year of my life and caused me emotional trauma sure to haunt me forever, and she is probably preparing to enter a marriage that will be defined by lies. She just doesn't know it. I want this woman to walk down that aisle with her eyes open; but there's a part of me that wonders whether I am just seeking revenge. How do I tell the difference, and where do I draw the ethical line between assuaging my anger and protecting her future? Name Withheld
JI: Sure. But to Binya's point, it's still a trade-off. So, if I'm on food stamps, I'm getting less of a benefit than, say, Jesse, who's not on food stamps.
SS: O.K. Again, about your responsibilities as president. One of the heaviest ones would be waging war. When you look back on the conflicts into which recent presidents have put us, would you support this? Is this something you would have done in Syria, in Libya, in Kosovo? Would you have sent troops there?
We will forever be saddened that his life was cut short by this devastating disease, his family said in a statement. He achieved a lot in his 24 years, but we will never get the chance to see how much more Harry could have done.
But, likewise, his suggestions about carbon taxes, infrastructure spending and modest tax increases on the wealthy are unlikely to gain much traction with Middle America. The Democrats must figure out a way to address the frustration and anger of those living in small towns where economies have crumbled and a lack of job opportunities has opened the door for a demagogue like Mr. Trump.
Well, thinking of this, you once said Walter White was going to be the first line in your obituary, and I think you're probably right — maybe not, who knows yet. Do you worry about that all? Because you've gone on to do other things, obviously.
I'll bet. I'll bet, actually. I thought you were just going to say, I needed to buy a second home, or something.
It confirms some of the worst suspicions that people had about Meghan Markle as this relationship first began.
Two years later, Uncle Anas was still unable to walk. It had been nearly a year since he had surgery for a spinal fracture he sustained as a result of the attack and his muscles had not recovered. Medical exams revealed a fatal diagnosis: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or A.L.S., a degenerative illness.

Excuse me, sir, is the case being worked? Is Silvera on it? What?
For one year the Lewinsky scandal has preoccupied the capital despite an immense disconnet with public opinion. Since the scandal became public last January, polls have shown the public opposed impeachment and wanted the inquiry brought to an end. Even on Friday night, after a 13-hour debate, a CBS News Poll of 548 persons showed only 38 percent wanted their representative to vote for impeachment; 58 percent wanted a no vote.
The type of climbing had not been done before, Whitmore said in an interview for Merry's obituary in 2019. We had to improvise as we went.
But even as Mr. Graham lobbied his Republican colleagues to vote against convicting Mr. Trump and offered a stream of flattery about the president's success in office, he rejected the suggestion that Mr. Trump should pardon any members of the mob before leaving office. I don't care if you went there and spread flowers on the floor, Mr. Graham said of the rioters. You breached the security of the Capitol. Other Republicans maintained that the House has moved too quickly to impeach. Representative Nancy Mace, a first-term Republican from South Carolina who voted against impeachment, said that the House had every right to impeach the president but that the process should have been more deliberate. The fact that we bypassed Judiciary, we did not open up an investigation, that we bypassed due process, that set a dangerous constitutional precedent for others, she said on NBC's Meet the Press. No matter — even if you think the president is guilty as hell, like many, many do believe, there has to be due process, there has to be an investigation. When asked if she felt the same way as Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas, who revealed last week that he feared his vote against impeachment would ultimately put him on the wrong side of this debate after more facts came to light, Ms. Mace said that she was also concerned. She argued that more Republicans would have backed the effort if more due process had been allowed beforehand.
I forgot what it was like to be in front of an audience, Arestov said.
Mr. Trump canceled a planned news conference at a NATO gathering in December after a video circulated that showed world leaders including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Emmanuel Macron of France in what appeared to be a conversation mocking Mr. Trump.
Decades later, in 2007, Mr. Cannon, a Massachusetts native, wanted to rework the song into a rally ditty for his favorite baseball team, the Boston Red Sox. But, he told The Boston Globe, he received a complaint from Mr. Barris, a Yankee fan, and so Down at Fenway Park ended up being a Cannon original rather than a repurposed Barris.
But at the same time, in order to have someone at that level of relationship, you need to have as much trust as possible and I'm still developing that kind of relationship with some of the other, not just candidates, but also people who could be running mates that are not currently running.
archived recording (paul howard) And once it's fired twice, it presented no danger to him or to any other persons.
Besides showcasing some of the best-known entries in their catalogs, the participants in this songwriters round, a charity event called The First and the Worst, were asked to share some of their greenest, most embarrassing output for the audience's amusement. So the Osbornes offered Don't Bring the Redneck Out in Me, a song that reeled off rowdy, boastful good ol' boy stereotypes. Midway through a line about having three children and a wife, T.J., 33 and lanky with a long face and combed-back hair, paused to wryly point out that at 16, this was what he'd thought country songs were supposed to be like.
Mr. Yang was raised in New York; his parents immigrated from Taiwan.
And why should it matter? In this Trump age of gross unreason, meeting incivility with civility has felt small to me, and futile. More and more, it feels as if the only way to be heard and understood is to give back exactly what I'm getting, not just from bilious Mr. Trump but from his base, otherwise known as my fellow Americans. That fact alone — that we are all Americans — has become infuriating. Watching those outrageous Trump rallies especially puts me on edge, seeing those red faces taunting Mexicans, Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi, in eager unison. The anger that was drawn to the surface in 2016 and stayed there quickly boils over. I feel like a fool for believing in racial harmony, for being taught at an early age that it is fundamental to the American project. I feel — again — that Malcolm X was right, black people are wasting their time trying to win over white people when they so clearly have no interest in being won over.
To call Grand Horizons one of the brightest shows to hit Broadway in years is not to tout its intelligence, which flickers. Rather, I mean that it is blindingly lit, no doubt in deference to the theatrical wisdom that defines comedy as what dies in the dark.
After Vatican I, and especially after Pascendi, English and American convert intellectuals tended to stay away from strictly theological questions altogether and work in the safer realms of literature, history, and the social sciences. Like their nineteenth-century predecessors, however, they too aimed to draw more converts into the faith that had won them. A succession of British converts, including Hugh Benson, Ronald Knox, G. K. Chesterton, and others, tried to dazzle their readers with wit, erudition, and ostentatious orthodoxy. Even so the experience of their earlier lives made their view of the outside world different from that of born Catholics and enabled them to make distinctions that sometimes escaped their born-Catholic fellows. These converts usually had relatives still outside the church; their own education outside Catholicism had formed their minds; and they found it difficult to demonize a non-Catholic society with which they were still intimately connected. Their chief line of attack was to criticize the premises of non-Catholic philosophy and science, to demonstrate its epistemological vulnerability, and to expose its links to a callow idealization of progress, sometimes with wry admissions that they too had once been deceived by its charms. They also brought their Catholic insight to bear on the political changes of their era, arguing that without the guidance of faith the world was out of control. The First World War gave their critique of progress a new plausibility.
In hindsight, this was not an accurate assessment of the next question.
It very much is. But if you were to apply resources, you would want to apply resources in ways that don't necessarily advantage the top third of your population by educational attainment exclusively. You would be trying to build more paths with the other two-thirds, which investing in trades and apprenticeships would do, and you would try and provide for the people who are the weakest and most vulnerable in the job market, which are not going to be the people that are attending college.
The younger son of Peter M. Brant, an industrialist, publisher and art collector, and Stephanie Seymour, one of the original supermodels, Mr. Brant grew up around the glitterati of the style and art worlds. He was a familiar presence at fashion shows and international parties at a young age, attending the Met Gala at age 16. Vanity Fair called him a Little Lord Fauntleroy for his unapologetic willingness to enjoy his own good fortune and looks, and New York Magazine once referred to Mr. Brant and his older brother, Peter Brant II, as NYC's Most Beautiful Teenage Brothers; their social omnipresence seemed to invite a certain kind of hyperbole.
Jesse Wegman: Is the inside of the helmet warm?
Serge Schmemann: Yeah. And staying with relationships and alliances, President Trump has reversed several key policies the United States has had toward Israel. He's moved the embassy to Jerusalem, he's recognized sovereignty over the Golan Heights, et cetera, et cetera. Would you reverse those?
To me, one of the worst things you can do in a relationship is if you have this longstanding understanding or a friendship or partnership, and then you try and change the understanding at a particular point in time and do it unilaterally.
But a gimmick doesn't get you very far if your main character is as drab as Pete. He's without a home because, minutes into the episode, he walks in on his wife, Jess (Lauren Lapkus), while she's in bed with another man (George Basil). End of marriage. (Mr. Holmes, who in reality is a thriving stand-up comic, has said he drew on his own failed marriage in creating the show.)
Here's where things get interesting. For one thing, the couple's relationship continued to flourish after they split: As co-chief executives, they continued to spend every day in each other's presence, doing all of the things that married couples commit to: parenting, splitting finances, meaningfully communicating, confessing, forgiving, even occasionally touching. For another, and here's the really curious part, EO Products took off in unexpected ways. Whereas the usual story line would suggest that a divorce in such a situation would spell professional disaster — Michael Funk says that in his 40-something years he's rarely seen it work — EO not only survived the Blacks' very conscious uncoupling but gathered steam. The line expanded and popped up in retail stores like Walgreens, CVS, Walmart and Target without any compromises made to transparency about its ingredients. What I admire about EO is their commitment to using essential oils in spite of their being more expensive, Ms. Quimby of Burt's Bees said. They're willing to go for that level of quality.
Though golden enough for any nostalgist, Stories by Heart is neither soporific nor cute. For starters, the two stories that Mr. Lithgow recites — Haircut in the first act and P. G. Wodehouse's Uncle Fred Flits By in the second — are superb, outlandish and, in very different ways, hair-raising.
Mr. Booker said Friday that environmental justice will be one of the three top policy issues of his campaign. He has recently signed on to endorse the Green New Deal, a progressive litmus test on the environment pushed by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, that pushes for investments in clean-energy infrastructure and policies to directly address climate change.
Well to me, playing the relative benefit game, I mean of course in any large scale national program, it's you can't calibrate it precisely to everyone's individual situation. To me the test is more, is that person going to be better off tomorrow than they are today?
Tell me about the resonance because there's a lot of prescience in that play, too, of where we are today, where cable has gone and where news has gone. Explain what you meant by close to Donald Trump and yet not.
We should definitely do that, in a very big and dramatic way. And I have proposals to help move us toward a better model of high school education. Only 6 percent of American high school students are in technical, trade or apprenticeship tracks. In Germany, that's 59 percent. Think about that gulf. Meanwhile, there are millions of those trade and middle-scale jobs that are left unfilled. Why is this?
While I agree with Bret Stephens's thesis that the defeat of Donald Trump in the 2020 election is not a given, I disagree with his prescription for a Democratic win. Yes, the more radical ideas of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, which in fact might help Middle America the most, would never pass Congress and will never gain favor with conservative rural Americans.
Jeneen Interlandi: Oh no, go ahead.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the federal government commissioned a series of experiments to look at how guaranteed income effects labor participation. Researchers discovered that a program like U.B.I. doesn't have the drastic effect on work that some might predict; households overall reduce their workload by roughly 13 percent, according to a paper in the Canadian Public Policy journal.
Katherine retraces Stefan's final days and finds herself submerged in a world of nightclubs and narcotics. In this shadowy landscape, Katherine's numbed grief is indistinguishable from a high.
Talking about the year in film, meanwhile, Greta Gerwig, who is nominated for two Oscars at the Academy Awards ceremony this Sunday as the writer and director of Lady Bird, noted the way Mr. Allen's movies, Manhattan among them, have informed me as an artist.
Ms. Heyman, on and off dating sites for a decade, said she let potential matches marinate a couple of days before reaching out to Adam Seth Joseph, whose warm smile on the photo he posted caught her eye.
But for them the challenge is not even what's happening internally. The challenge is whether or not they can get developing countries on board with their technology standards to be able to roll them out internationally. So if you're a third party, let's say you're a developing country in Africa or Latin America, then you have a choice essentially between the global standard and the Chinese standard. And if you're the Chinese, you do not want a standard that only you are using over time, because that's going to curb your economic upside to all of the software that you're building. One of the reasons why our tech companies are so successful is that they export it to virtually the entire rest of the world, and China does not want to be in the opposite position.
At the last debate, I proposed a world data organization, because to me, China's in position to leapfrog us in artificial intelligence. They're investing tens of billions in a way that our government is not. It's a national effort. And they've now separated their technology ecosystem from the West's and they're trying to sell their software and operating systems to other countries with very limited success right now, but this parallel tech universe, to me, is something that we can actually use to bring China back to the table.

In addition to her daughter Rose, she is survived by her husband, Tim Owens; a son, the writer Matthew Yorke; another daughter, Daisy Cockburn; a sister, Catherine Tennant; a brother, Toby; and three grandchildren.
Every tearoom that Sugimoto creates is formally named, and the one in this apartment is called Ukitsubo, which means floating inner garden, a reference to the 11th-century novel The Tale of Genji, which is set within the wealthy, refined Heian court. One of Sugimoto's original ideas was to create an indoor garden. But that was impossible in a tower, and so instead, he chose to place the two bonsai trees in a rectangular garden in the dining room, a 10½-foot-long slab of Komatsu stone between them. If the windows offer a lightness, a moment to pause in time and drift into infinity, then the two bonsai, whose dense, visible surface roots (nebari, which are considered a balance to the tree's sinuous branches) return you to earth.
Keller rebounded to deliver one of the signature moments of those Games, holding off the Australian star Ian Thorpe over the final 100 meters of their anchor legs to clinch the gold for the United States in the 4x200 freestyle relay. It was his second medal of the Olympics, and the fourth of five he would eventually claim in his decorated international career.
A recent poll found that roughly 50 percent of the Ukrainian population favors joining NATO, though Hungary's foreign minister recently said his country would block Ukrainian membership unless Ukraine changed a policy restricting its citizens' use of minority languages.
They pulled it off. Not without a lot of heartache, and a lot of pain, and a lot of controversy. But in the end, by acting as precipitously as they did, they managed to force the palace to deal with something that it really would have preferred to put off indefinitely. So they really forced the issue successfully.
And the newspapers pointed out that taking these private jet flights left an enormous carbon footprint. Also, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle embarked on a very expensive renovation of the cottage that they were gifted by Queen Elizabeth on the grounds of Windsor Castle. This is known as Frogmore Cottage. And the couple authorized a $3 million renovation that was paid for by taxpayer money.
Reflexionar sobre lo que lograste en 2020 —y lo que no viviste o perdiste— también es un camino más saludable para mejorar que el típico propósito de año nuevo. Los estudios muestran de manera consistente que esos propósitos no funcionan. Para febrero, la mayoría de la gente los ha abandonado.
But judgment — delicious, shameful judgment — that we got from beginning to end. Judgment was the series' métier and its medium. Guilt — the guilt laid upon parents and especially mothers — was its true subject. Its strength was in how it let its audience indulge in judgment while the show itself suspended it.
I think that he did a lot of great things and he did a lot of what he could, but to the extent that there was a missed opportunity, it was in the wake of the financial crisis. And it's very hard to Monday morning quarterback a team when they literally felt like the economy itself was at stake, but we should have done much more to recapitalize homeowners as opposed to the banks. We could have kept many more people in their homes. We could've kept many of these communities ——
You had an African-American bishop —
Wow, so telling the world, in what sounds a little bit like a cry for help, I am not doing O.K.
There's a sense that Prince Harry and Meghan exploited the goodwill of the queen. They blindsided Buckingham Palace by putting out their announcement the way they did, and also that they kind of want to have it both ways.
No. I'd have to look at the facts at the time that that decision was being made.
Pearson said in a written statement that the differences between the books could be attributed mostly to the fact that the California book was published several years later, and that concerns over coastal flooding have become more heightened in recent years.
Disneyland, which draws tourists from around the world, unsurprisingly, goes big. But one story about Lunar New Year at South Coast Plaza, the luxury retail palace in Costa Mesa, has stuck with me since the days I covered Orange County.
But her friends see hardened attitudes — reinforced since the election — toward the poor. Some of them are scared, she said. Some of them are worried that they'll wind up back on the street.
However, he said, some of the incentives that were offered to the four states to improve ties with Israel merited a hard look. Among them are benefits that defy international norms, such as recognizing Morocco's sovereignty over the Western Sahara.
So Ms. Akhmedova and her lawyers tried a new approach. Temur, the older of the couple's two sons, is a U.K. resident, which makes his holdings eminently seizable. And for a guy who isn't yet 30, he has plenty to seize. His father showered Temur with unimaginable amounts of money, as Temur's own lawyers put it in a court filing.
Charlie Warzel: You were talking about data and that's a good segue into some of the — I mean, you're probably the candidate who sort of runs on understanding the internet better than anyone right now. And I'm curious first about this worldwide data organization. For someone like China, wouldn't it actually be better for them to sort of hoard that data and hoard that information and keep that closed system?
Appearing in the fourth episode of Bridgerton, the first series produced by Shonda Rhimes as part of her powerhouse Netflix deal, this conversation between the show's main Black characters is the first explicit mention of race in a story that revolves around the duke, a Black man named Simon Basset (Regé-Jean Page), and his passionate courtship of Daphne (Phoebe Dynevor), the eldest daughter in the wealthy, white and titled Bridgerton family.
A billionaire would have a return that would be literally three feet high, he added. Our $100 million clients own multiple closely held businesses. All of them would require an expert valuation and five-year financials.
Set and shot amid the Lebanese civil war, Ms. Saab's feature debut, A Suspended Life (1984), follows Samar, an independent-minded young girl reveling in the freedom afforded by warfare chaos. She thinks herself — and proclaims herself — free and able to do whatever I want, but the cost of her spirited wandering is a hymen-restoring operation imposed by her family.
I think it's too soon for us to have a black president, but even if it weren't, I don't think he should be it, she told Vanity Fair. He's sleazy. The nomination went to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, who lost to Vice President George Bush.
CW: Going back though, my question is, there's an issue of power here. I mean, sure. You might not want to. You might not be able to address the problems of Facebook if you break it up from Instagram, and I understand that, and there's still going to be addictive products, but there's an issue of the consolidation of actual power, the ability to buy those companies, to make those acquisitions. Just simply the leverage that Mark Zuckerberg can use to have a meeting with Donald Trump that they won't tell us about, I mean, how do you — if you don't break them up, how do you get rid of that conglomeration of power?
Mr. Bernstein's politics — he called himself a secular, self-loving Jew of a leftist persuasion — influenced both his life and his art.
Erica Ingraham had her eye on Adam Koster from the moment they started working together in 2015 in the town of Bon Accord, in Alberta, Canada. This was not an easy thing to do, given the setting.
Reflexionando sobre las lecciones del año pasado, podemos apilar y construir con base en los buenos hábitos que empezamos en 2020. Tal vez eso implicó descubrir nuevas formas de hacer ejercicio cuando los gimnasios estaban cerrados, fortalecer las amistades forjadas a través de nuestras burbujas sociales, organizar nuestros hogares para vivir y aprender las 24 horas del día, aprender a cocinar comidas más saludables o hacernos responsables del cuidado de los demás.
Feelings seem to register on her face before her thoughts have a chance to catch up with them, so that we know when she's hurting or happy almost before she does. A New York writer who grew up in rural Illinois, Lucy Barton is surely someone we can trust to speak plain. What a relief to be in the company, for once, of a thoroughly reliable narrator.
Tennis Australia broke that silence on Friday with the announcement of an initiative called #Open4All which would indirectly address Court's vitriol by highlighting the sport's tolerance.
Season 2, Episode 8: 'The Kingmaker'
In Connecticut, we had four-acre zoning, lots of wildlife, no neighbors, Ms. Maly said. We would have to drive somewhere to go trick-or-treating. And we would come to Balboa Island for eight weeks every summer, where the kids would have so much freedom.
Mr. Tree, a violist, founded the Guarneri in 1964 with two friends he had studied with at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, the violinists Arnold Steinhardt and John Dalley, along with the cellist David Soyer.
After watching his comedy, I felt that he wasn't a malignant racist and that his slur toward me was just very, very bad comedy run amok. Which did not strike me as a fireable offense, and I realized that if I was the individual who was actually directly slurred, and I did not feel that he should lose his job over it, then I should probably share that sentiment with other people.
Just as the government would not charge a crime victim for investigating a crime, it should not charge women for bringing them back home, said Alison Gardner, an assistant professor of sociology who studies modern slavery at the University of Nottingham. She said a $1,000 debt could be devastating for a young woman whose family has tried to force her to marry and could disown her if she escaped.
Except for the cheating part, Ms. Dunn said, Owen bears many resemblances to her husband, the writer and editor Peter Stevenson, who is also the model for the husband in American Housewife. The two live in Garrison, N.Y. with their young children, one of whom is autistic and is the inspiration for the son in The Arrangement.
Federal officials said last week that they would accelerate the start of a program in which some 40,000 pharmacy locations will give vaccines to people in high-risk groups, such as the elderly and frontline workers. Only a few thousand will be involved at the start, though. A lot of senior citizens aren't going to want to go to a stadium to get an inoculation, Dr. Gottlieb said. They're going to want to go to a local pharmacy or doctor's office. So we need to provide more opportunity for people to get vaccinated where they're comfortable getting it.
BA: But just to be clear, it's still not a progressive tax. There's no model that says that you can use these kinds of exclusions and exemptions to make that progressive. You can make it less regressive. You're still fundamentally proposing a nonprogressive means of revenue raising.
You had, for example, a gospel choir —
If you were a person in that town in Missouri and you wanted to start a bakery, before the dividend, it's a dumb idea. Post-dividend, it might be a great idea. You can hire someone to help staff the bakery, you know if the bakery fails, you're going to survive because you have this income that you can rely upon. This is the most stable and secure way to create jobs that actually reflect our community's needs and values. What are the other alternatives? For the government to come in and say, Hey, we're going to designate five people to clean up this park forever. We're going to designate 10 people to make our people stronger forever, regardless of whether or not they're ——

My father served in the Morsi government; I was imprisoned for my activism; my uncle was a police officer under successive regimes; many other family members were army generals or politicians under the government of the former president, Hosni Mubarak. Is my family unique? In many ways, not at all. Most Egyptian families are similarly split across the country's political divides.
LOVE AND RUIN, by Paula McLain. (Ballantine, $17.) McLain's latest novel, about the marriage between the journalist Martha Gellhorn and Ernest Hemingway, takes up the question that vexed (and probably doomed) their relationship: Why must a woman choose between her career and what her husband wants her to be? McLain drew on primary sources to develop her fiery protagonist.
KK: O.K. Moving onto a perhaps slightly less serious topic.

Well, the Department of the Attention Economy would likely be based in Silicon Valley, and it'd be run by a guy named Tristan Harris, who's a design ethicist. He started Time Well Spent. So I don't think it's necessarily the case that you need to try and bring everyone into the cubicles in D.C. to get the rules ——
— and they bring along a television journalist who they're close to, Tom Bradby, who's making a documentary about this trip. And he has what turns out to be a remarkably revealing interview with each of them during the course of the trip.
The Night begins with a round of the party game, Mafia. The film's central couple Babak (Shahab Hosseini) and Neda (Niousha Jafarian) play along, each wryly accusing the other of hiding secrets, each saying that the other might be the killer. The Persian-language, Los Angeles-set thriller that follows builds tension around the resentments that have accumulated in their marriage. But the stakes never rise past the movie's first game.
Twitter temporarily suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene's personal account. Twitter has temporarily suspended the personal account of Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican and supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory, citing multiple violations of the company's civic integrity policy. The move, confirmed by a company spokesperson on Sunday, came days after the platform banned President Trump over concerns that his continued use of the platform could incite more episodes of violence like the attack on the Capitol this month. A news release issued by Ms. Greene's congressional campaign, including what appeared to be screenshots of her account, said the suspension would last 12 hours. Her account's last tweet included a video in which Ms. Greene repeated baseless claims of voter fraud, blaming elected leaders in Georgia for failing to act ahead of the Senate runoff races that resulted in Republicans losing their majority. Below the video, Twitter posted a warning that the claim of election fraud was disputed. The company also disabled replies, retweets and likes due to risk of violence, an alert that also appears on other tweets by Ms. Greene. Ms. Greene's election to Congress last year signaled a major victory for QAnon, the once-fringe pro-Trump movement that the F.B.I. has warned poses a domestic terrorism threat. In the statement, Ms. Greene criticized the borderline monopolistic stranglehold of a few big tech companies over American political discourse and urged Congress to stop what she called censorship.
Toggling between Los Angeles and Mexico, English and Spanish, this sophomore feature by Catalina Aguilar Mastretta asks Clara to choose between naughty and nice. The setup is commonplace, but the scenery is delicious, the dialogue refreshingly tart and the keen supporting cast frisky or affecting, as the occasion demands.

While he repeated his pledge to support the Democratic nominee regardless of who it may be, Mr. Bloomberg also framed the numbers from Iowa as a clear opportunity. The results from Iowa underscore that we need a campaign that can build a coalition broad enough to unite the party and strong enough to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump — and beat him, Mr. Bloomberg said, going on to joke about what he called the elephant in the room.

Great souls resemble the elements in their immensity. They absorb everything — pain, injustice, insult, folly — and give back decency and kindness. They are not born of a piece. They come into being through unflinching confrontation with life's spears. They reach quiet. Discipline is the backbone of graciousness. Stoicism is the other face of wounds. In the most beautiful smile, painful knowledge hovers.

What the conversations are becoming are more of, more of digging down in our personal being to decide is, did we do this job for the right reason or the wrong reason?

Still, it was Livingston today who called for Clinton's resignation from the House floor. Charging that Clinton had undermined the rule of law and damaged the nation, Livingston said, I say that you have the power to terminate that damage and heal the wounds that you have created. You, sir, may resign your post.
Yes. All of this is a prelude to say that, should some of the tech companies be asked to divest parts of their businesses? One hundred percent yes. Like Amazon should not be selling its own house brand to its advantage to other goods. These companies do have excessive power and influence. At this point you could argue they control our democracy.
Joyce met Proust once and they exchanged scarcely a word, even though they shared a cab together (neither had read the other). Beckett wrote a small critical book about Proust; Woolf admired Proust so intensely that she felt swamped by his genius. Gide's bitterest regret was that as a founder of a fledgling but already prestigious publishing house, he turned down Swann's Way, the first volume of Proust's masterpiece (he thought of Proust as a superficial snob and a mere reporter of high-society events). Genet began to write his first novel, Our Lady of the Flowers, after reading the opening pages of Proust's Within a Budding Grove. Genet was in prison and he arrived late in the exercise yard for the weekly book exchange; as a result he was forced to take the one book all the other prisoners had rejected. And yet once he'd read the opening pages of Proust he shut the book, wanting to savor every paragraph over as long a period as possible. He said to himself; Now, I'm tranquil, I know I'm going to go from marvel to marvel. His reading inspired him to write; he hoped to become the Proust of the underclass.
While he repeated his pledge to support the Democratic nominee regardless of who it may be, Mr. Bloomberg also framed the numbers from Iowa as a clear opportunity.

The Pop artists took for their subject matter images and objects from the mass media and popular culture, including advertising, comic books and consumer products. They also employed techniques that until then had been associated primarily with commercial and industrial methods of production, like silk screening or, in Mr. Rosenquist's case, billboard painting.
The friendship/hateship between Susan and Ro, the ways in which each experiences the mere existence of the other as both a reproach and a criticism, is one of the great delights of this lyrical and beautifully observed reflection on women's lives. Ro cannot stop thinking of Susan's offhand remark that you don't truly become an adult until you have kids. Susan is preoccupied with the thought of Ro's questioning her reasons for changing her surname: How come nobody's allowed to criticize a woman's decision to give up her name for a man's name? Just because it's her choice? I can think of some other bad choices that—. Both women keep lists: Ro's is a self-flagellating inventory of reasons it's a bad idea for an unwed 42-year-old to raise a child; Susan's is a lengthy accounting of the unrelenting and grindingly dull routine of raising children: Herd crumbs into palm. Spray table. Wipe down table. Rinse cups and bowls, and on and on. Susan's resentment of Ro's rich intellectual life means the exhausted mother can't empathize with the single teacher's loneliness. But Ro's corresponding resentment of Susan's full family life means she can't empathize, either, with her friend's boredom and despair. These carefully chosen details feel urgent in our present moment, when women are constantly encouraged to compete with one another to attain an unattainable ideal of our gender.
WWII's Elite Airmen and the Epic Battle to Become the Master of the Sky
Gautreaux's stories all begin in the relatively humble territory of realistic fiction. He describes his method, simply, as follows: I try to imagine a normal, average man, with a old boring job, and give him a problem. Gautreaux has been called the cartographer of the Louisiana back roads, but he also loves machines more than anyone I've read: gas stoves, trains, typewriters, sewing machines, pipes, pianos, church bells. It's one of the chief pleasures of his work — finding out how things function and how to fix them. (Or not: A reader's heart breaks with Gautreaux's when something is declared past fixin'.)
So if you cannot learn from the experiences of other countries, what can you learn from? We have to take a policy that actually works, and what those countries and every other developed country have determined works, is a value added tax. Because a value added tax is impossible to game your way out of. If you're a trillion-dollar technology company — you know, I was just in New Hampshire campaigning yesterday, and you know what I say to them? I say to everyone around the country, Amazon, a trillion-dollar technology company sucking up $20 billion in business every year, closing 30 percent of your stores and malls, paying zero in taxes, how do you feel about that? You know? And they are angry. They say, how the heck can Amazon be paying zero in taxes? And I was like, I know. And it's up to you, the people of New Hampshire, to change it. So if you look at other countries ——
This is a new line of argument for Mr. Prager, who spent much of his career focusing on those micro values. He is a longtime opponent of same-sex marriage, which he considers an effort to destroy the foundation of our Judeo-Christian civilization. An episode in his Same Sex Issues collection is titled, Love Is Not Enough.
If the Tsuris Theory of Jewish identity, survival, and unity is true, then Jews are doomed to live precariously on a pendulum perennially swinging in a wide arc between the extremes of persecution and assimilation. As the pendulum swings away from the Scylla of persecution, it inevitably moves toward the Charybdis of assimilation. In this reactive view, Jews have little power over their ultimate destiny. Our enemies always call the shots, either by persecuting us, in which case we fight back and remain Jewish, or by leaving us alone, in which case we assimilate. The only other alternative--the one proposed by Herzl--is for all Jews to move to Israel, where they control their own destiny. But most Jews will continue to ignore that option, certainly if our hosts continue to leave us in peace in our adopted homelands. In this respect, aliyah (emigration) to Israel has also been largely determined by our external enemies, since most Jews who have moved to the Jewish homeland have done so in reaction to anti-Semitism and persecution in their native countries.
The website of the school, Immanuel Christian School, which enrolls kindergartners through eighth graders at its campus in Springfield, Va., details its religious beliefs and expectations of both students and their parents, as well as those who wish to work there. The school's employment application requires candidates to describe their faith in Jesus Christ, affirm that they are a born-again Christian and vow to adhere to specific standards in their personal and professional lives.
My husband and I fought (again) today about something that happened eight years ago, when we were newly married. He was devastated that I tried to have a cordial relationship with his ex-wife (who wronged him). He felt betrayed that I didn't mirror his feelings toward her, and abandoned by my attempts to create a workable relationship for their children. Frankly, I can no more apologize and have a hand-holding cry with him than fly to the moon. I am emotionally detached, and he is wildly demonstrative. How to bridge this gap?
Between South Carolina, where we had just finished graduate school, and Tennessee, where we would start our new teaching jobs, lay the Appalachian Mountains. Getting over them in one piece would be the first real test of our lives as fully employed adults.
I didn't understand why, it was just an awful feeling I had being in that church, that there was something wrong with me, he said. He winced recalling his mother's reaction when she learned he was gay.
KK: I want to ask you, you were the C.E.O. of Manhattan Prep. How does test prep — doesn't that contribute to income inequality in the United States?
Even the most contemplative graphic novels offer a kinetic sense of play guaranteed to hook your colleagues' interest. Why not launch your feminist exploration with an illustrated book set in a place that may be unfamiliar to all of you? Marguerite Abouet's six-volume Aya comics series, set in Ivory Coast in the 1970s (illustrated by Abouet's husband, Clément Oubrerie, and translated by Helge Dascher), follows the lives of its ambitious but dutiful namesake protagonist and her more freewheeling friends, Bintou and Adjoua. In Aya: Love in Yop City — which encompasses the last three chapters in the series — Aya, now a medical student, is sexually assaulted by her biology professor. The shame she feels in the wake of her attack shifts over the course of the book as she plans a fiery revenge.
So you're looking at a nation of high school graduates. And what do high school graduates do for a living? The top five occupational categories are retail and administrative, which includes call center work, retail, food service and food preparation, transportation, primarily truck driving, and attendant supportive jobs and manufacturing still. We all know that we have gutted many of these industries, and their labor bases have shrunk.
JI: Sure. But to Binya's point, it's still a trade-off. So, if I'm on food stamps, I'm getting less of a benefit than, say, Jesse, who's not on food stamps.
The day before, at a taco shop the brothers frequent up to twice a day when they're not on the road, John, 35 and sporting a bushy, red beard with a ball cap over his shaggy mane, joked that Don't Bring the Redneck Out in Me was the first official song we wrote that we thought, yeah, we've got it all figured out.
The six episodes, each an hour long, cover the long history of allegations against Mr. Kelly. They feature women who described being controlled or abused by him, often when they were teenagers, as well as associates and relatives of the singer.
The train of conversions continued during and after the war. Men and women disabused of their faith in progress as a force immanent in history found consolation in Catholicism. In the interwar years a distinguished group of British novelists converted to Catholicism, including Compton Mackenzie, Graham Greene, and Evelyn Waugh, and began to make lasting contributions to the canon of English literature. In the 1850s Newman had lamented that the great classics of English literature were Protestant to the core and that English was in effect a Protestant language. Now for the first time since the Reformation, English literature enjoyed a significant Catholic leavening. Convert writers took turns touring the United States, teaching at Georgetown, Fordham, and Notre Dame and trying to encourage a Catholic literary revival across the sea. They were joined by another group of gifted and prolific controversialists, including Shane Leslie, Arnold Lunn, and Christopher Hollis, who took up the mantle of Chesterton and tried to carry on his message that Catholicism was synonymous with urbanity, erudition, and wit. Aptly enough, the first holder of the Stillman Chair in Catholic Studies at Harvard Divinity School was the English convert Christopher Dawson.
Chicago classrooms are reopening Monday, but will most teachers show up? A playground at an elementary school in Chicago, where schools reopen Monday. Credit... Taylor Glascock for The New York Times Across the country, many big cities like New York have struggled to resume even limited in-person instruction, while a number, including Los Angeles, have simply given up on the idea, choosing to stick with all-remote education into the spring. Few places have seen as much acrimony over the issue as Chicago, whose public school system is the nation's third-largest. Now, with 6,000 prekindergarten and special education students preparing to return to the city's public school buildings on Monday for the first time since March, a question looms: How many of their teachers will be there to greet them? Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago has argued that giving parents the option of sending their children to school in person is critical to preventing some of the city's mostly poor and Black and Latino students from falling permanently behind. But the teachers' union has fiercely resisted the plan, arguing that schools are not safe while the coronavirus is surging. Over the past week, fewer than 60 percent of the roughly 2,000 teachers who were expected to return to their buildings to prepare for the arrival of students actually showed up. Janice K. Jackson, the chief executive of the school system that serves about 350,000 students, said on Friday that she was optimistic that most teachers would go to work on Monday.
Mr. Yang's argument that he is pulling 10 percent or more of Trump supporters was not rated favorably on PolitiFact — the 10 percent figure comes from a July YouGov poll, and subsequent polls found the number to be lower.
At points we would take each other's phone, she said, and swiped right for each other while sitting by the fireplace in the duplex Ms. Heyman shared with another friend on the Upper West Side. It was easily a night of 50 to 100 swipes. Not that I'm liking all of them.
The greatest adverse shock to the psychosocial welfare of U.S. men has not stemmed from dysfunctional notions of masculinity (not that these are above reproach) nor from #MeToo (which was long overdue) but from deep secular labor market forces — both technological and trade-induced — that have over nearly four decades reduced the demand for skilled blue collar work.
Some of these notions rubbed off on Lindbergh and were reflected in his little-known book, Of Flight and Life, in which he inveighed against scientific materialism. In this 1948 book, he said, I believe the values we are creating and the standards we are now following will lead to the end of our civilization, and that if we do not control our science by a higher moral force, it will destroy us with its materialistic values. In his plea for the recognition of metaphysical values, Lindbergh wrote: To progress, even to survive, we must learn to apply the truth of God to the actions and relationships of men, to the direction of our science. We must learn from the sermons of Christ, the wisdom of Laotzu, the teachings of Buddha. But Lindbergh, in this book, also espoused a doctrine of American superiority in the world. For Americans, the doctrine of universal equality is a doctrine of death, he wrote. If we ever become an equal people among other peoples of the world, our civilization will fall. When Lindbergh went abroad to live, first in Britain and then in France, he was 33 years old. He was immediately treated with courtesy and respect--and given the privacy he so much desired. His new friends were in the upper reaches of British society and Tory politics. Moreover, as a distinguished aviator, he was invited to visit airplane factories in France by the French Air Ministry.
CW: Yeah. Rather than, you know, a big exit or something like that. Sexy start-up.
Republicans are scrambling to determine the political consequences of doing so, and whether they would pay a steeper political price for breaking with the president or for failing to. Senate Republicans are facing just such a dilemma as they contemplate how to vote in an impeachment trial that could start as early as next week. Both Representatives Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the minority whip, voted against impeaching Mr. Trump, though Mr. McCarthy said the president bore responsibility for the siege and deserved a censure. Ms. Cheney, by contrast, had issued a scathing statement the day before the impeachment vote in which she said: There has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution. But she chose not to speak during debate on the House floor. Many Democrats — who have long reviled her and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney — quoted her approvingly in their own speeches.
Instead, the media and the international community should listen to L.G.B.T.Q. Bermudians and elevate their priorities, not set their own misguided agendas.
KK: I want to ask you, you were the C.E.O. of Manhattan Prep. How does test prep — doesn't that contribute to income inequality in the United States?
Alas, I didn't encounter the likes of Roald Dahl. The locals were still obsessed with the Great Train Robbery. Like Plimmer and countless other youthful reporters, we were assigned the birth, marriage and death columns before we could rise to features. All a necessary grounding before Fleet Street.
No. I'd have to look at the facts at the time that that decision was being made.
Charlie Warzel: You were talking about data and that's a good segue into some of the — I mean, you're probably the candidate who sort of runs on understanding the internet better than anyone right now. And I'm curious first about this worldwide data organization. For someone like China, wouldn't it actually be better for them to sort of hoard that data and hoard that information and keep that closed system?
Mr. Gómez had just tried crossing for the fourth time the day before.
And so this idea, that suddenly this brilliant young couple — this shining symbol of the future of the monarchy — would wind up turning their backs on it, and leave Britain, comes at a particularly vulnerable moment for the British people. And as it turns out, the people who are hardest on Meghan Markle are also generally the people who voted for Brexit. And it's one of the great paradoxes of this story. That their resistance to Meghan Markle — their complicity in making her life miserable — has led to this outcome that has convulsed the royal family, has threatened an institution that these people care so deeply about. So I think that's the importance here. It's not just a debate that breaks down along generational lines. It's a debate that breaks down very much along Brexit lines. Did you vote for staying in the European Union or for leaving? How you voted in that case weighs very much in how you feel about Harry and Meghan.
Mr. Yang is not the first to label this period the fourth industrial revolution — the term was made popular by Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, at its annual meeting in Davos in 2016. Mr. Schwab's book of the same name argues that the fourth industrial revolution is transforming every sector of the economy and industry through new technologies that merge the physical, digital and biological realms.
The newly minted baroness turned her hand to property development. She built the mansion on the Rue du Faubourg St.-Honoré that is now the American Embassy. On returning to New Orleans in the 1840s, she oversaw the design and construction of the Pontalba Buildings, two red-brick rowhouse complexes flanking the Place d'Armes, which was renamed Jackson Square after Andrew Jackson at her instigation. One of the chief features of the French Quarter, the rowhouses established the fashion for iron railings throughout the old city.
Then, two years ago, my husband took a job in Luxembourg, where the lingua franca is French. He's fluent in French, whereas on a good day, I speak it like a 5-year-old. Suddenly, the entire dynamic between us changed.
Judgment was issued by the characters and upon them. The members of the school community, interviewed about the killing that the show was keeping from us, were a catty Greek chorus. About Madeline (Reese Witherspoon), one of them said: She grew up wanting to be Betty Grable. Ended up Betty Crocker.
Mr. Yang argues that the automation of manufacturing jobs — especially in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri and Iowa — helped breed the discontent and economic desperation that led to Mr. Trump's election.
A Jew today can live in any neighborhood, even those that were formerly restricted. Jews live alongside white Anglo-Saxon Protestants in the most exclusive neighborhoods throughout the country--Grosse Pointe, Greenwich, Fifth Avenue, Beacon Hill. And they have been welcomed into the best families, including the Roosevelts, Kennedys, Cuomos, and Rockefellers. Economically, socially, and politically, we have become the new WASPs, as a perusal of the sponsor list of any major charitable or cultural event will show. Indeed, terms such as J.A.S.P. (Jewish Anglo-Saxon Protestant) and W.A.S.H. (White Anglo-Saxon Hebrew) have become current in some circles to denote the full social acceptance that Jews increasingly enjoy.
My husband had to confront the alienation of his Tunisian family, who refused to acknowledge my existence, even after our wedding. Yes, we had fallen deeply in love, but choosing to marry was also an act of rebellion for each of us, a rejection of what society and friends and family expected. It felt like setting out into uncharted territory. It was exhilarating.
If you run an organization, imagine having an organization that has the wrong measurements. How is that organization going to fare over time? That is where we are in the United States of America right now. We're riding a century-old measurement off a cliff, while our way of life deteriorates underneath our feet. If you looked at levels of anxiety, stress, mental health, depression, suicides, drug overdoses, you would see that we're in a mental health recession or depression, we're in a wellness or life expectancy recession or depression, and the corporate profits are going to keep on going up, because in the 21st-century economy, companies can do very, very well while not hiring a lot of people, not treating them as full-time employees, and they don't need to care what happens in their own backyard because they sell everywhere.
Finally getting the nerve to ask Mandy what it was like to be in 'The Princess Bride' was one of the greatest moments of my life, he said. It took me six years to finally ask, I was so nervous.
Margo St. James was an artist working as a waitress and living the Beat life in San Francisco in the 1960s when her home became a counterculture hangout. As she told The Windy City Times of Chicago in 2011, there was a lot of pot-smoking and sex and, you know, whatever.
DUVERNAY The majority of that voting body has not changed. It's still 84 percent white and 68 percent male. From a voting perspective, even doubling the number of women and people of color doesn't really tip the scales.

So the Shane Gillis opinion was not based upon the timeline, it was just based upon my reaction as a person, and the person that was directly named. I certainly think there should be consequences for one's statements and actions, and I certainly think that obviously he made the statements within the year, and that if you did have some sort of time frame when you would want to overlook something, it would be much longer than a year.

The man, Robert Sanford, is charged with assaulting a law enforcement officer engaged in the performance of official duties and civil disorder among other crimes. Mr. Sanford went to the Capitol following the president's instructions, a complaining witness told the F.B.I. Another man was charged on Thursday after law enforcement officials identified him as the person seen repeatedly striking an officer with a flagpole on the stairs of the Capitol in a video posted on Twitter. That man, Peter Stager of Arkansas, was charged with obstructing law enforcement, according to the criminal complaint. The complaint also identified Mr. Stager as saying in another video posted on Twitter that everyone in the Capitol is a treasonous traitor and that death is the only remedy for what's in that building.

The woman, Christine Priola, was traced through an anonymous tip to the F.B.I. after she was recognized in photographs posted to Twitter, according to court documents. Photos from last Wednesday showed Ms. Priola inside the Capitol and holding a sign that read, The children cry out for justice, which law enforcement later recovered from her home.
Historically, we've endorsed a two-state solution, which has always struck me as the best way forward, and I think it's really unfortunate that Donald Trump has moved us away from that to the extent that he has. I would try to move us back in that direction.

We talked about the concept of systemic racism in policing, and you said that you didn't think police officers are operating with racist assumptions. Do you think police officers operate with unconscious bias? Police officers, as you know, they have enormous discretion and power. They carry guns. They can end lives. And I think what people who are protesting and demonstrating now are talking about are decisions that don't feel conscious. They may not be intentional. But they are baked into how people operate and how they police.

But at the same time, in order to have someone at that level of relationship, you need to have as much trust as possible and I'm still developing that kind of relationship with some of the other, not just candidates, but also people who could be running mates that are not currently running.
The Texas edition goes further to highlight criticism of federal efforts to subsidize the green energy industry: Republicans accuse the government of wasting taxpayers' money, for example by supporting the failed solar manufacturer Solyndra. The Solyndra controversy was a fixation for conservatives in 2011, when the company went bankrupt after accepting half a billion dollars in federally guaranteed loans.
Almost certainly, yes. And you saw it a little bit with Barack Obama where he tapped Joe Biden in part because Joe had very deep relationships on Capitol Hill. If you had another outsider like me, we'd still be trying to figure out who to call. So, you need to have folks who have deep relationships on Capitol Hill from day one.

The first enslaved Africans brought to this country came through Virginia's shores 400 years ago. The commonwealth passed Jim Crow era laws to prevent interracial marriage. Rather than following the Supreme Court's order to send white and black children to the same schools in the 1950s, some counties in the state closed school doors. And just two years ago, white supremacists marched in Charlottesville to violently protest the removal of a Confederate statue.
Yeah, it does. It's one reason why I think we need to de-emphasize — excuse me.

Judge Sonia Sotomayor has fought for the voices of the people ever since her first case voting against corporations in Citizens United, Ms. Harris wrote on Twitter in 2019. As a critical voice on the bench, she's showing all our children what's possible. Justice Sotomayor, who was confirmed to the Supreme Court in 2009, swore in Joseph R. Biden Jr. for his second term as vice president in January 2013 (first in a private ceremony and again in public the next day because of a quirk of the calendar).
Unlike universal basic income, a system that would provide some cash to every person regardless of income level, a negative income tax system would give cash to people below a certain income threshold.

Adrien Proust was originally intended for the priesthood and he brought a nearly religious zeal to his work as a doctor. It was he who made famous--and effective--the idea of a cordon sanitaire, a sanitary zone circling Europe in order to keep out cholera. In order to put his principles to work Dr. Proust traveled to Russia, Turkey, and Persia in 1869 and figured out the routes by which cholera in previous epidemics had entered Russia and thereby Europe. For this successful investigation and the resulting efficacious sanitation and quarantine campaign Dr. Proust was awarded the Legion of Honor. He became one of the most celebrated professors of medicine and practicing physicians of his day. Whereas Marcel would be willowy, artistic, asthmatic, and obsessed with titled ladies, his father was the very model of the solid upper-middle-class citizen, fleshy, bearded, solemn, and, thanks to his wife's fortune, rich. He was also, unbeknownst to his son, an inveterate ladies' man. His extramarital adventures were never noticed by Marcel's mother--or if she did know something about them, she was too discreet to mention it.

Here are the highlights of Biden's $1.9 trillion 'American Rescue Plan.' Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:34 - 0:00 transcript Biden Outlines $1.9 Trillion Economic Rescue Package President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday proposed a spending package to combat the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. The plan includes $1,400 direct payments to individuals and more generous unemployment benefits. During this pandemic, millions of Americans, through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck. Millions of Americans never thought they'd be out of work — many of them never even envisioned the idea — are facing eviction, waiting for hours in their cars to feed their families as they drive up to a food bank. A growing chorus of top economists agree that the moment of crisis — in this moment of crisis, with interest rates at historic lows, we cannot afford inaction. Our rescue plan also includes immediate relief to Americans hardest hit and most in need. We will finish the job of getting a total of $2,000 in cash relief to people who need it the most. The $600 already appropriated is simply not enough. One in seven households in America, more than one in five Black and Latino households in America, report they don't have enough food to eat. So we're going to extend emergency nutritional assistance for 30 — for 43 million children and their families enrolled in the SNAP program through the rest of this year.

Because a lot of your characters turn dark rather fast and then out of it, into charm.
Mr. Gerdes was OK with that arrangement until the coronavirus pandemic hit. When quarantine started, I just had this feeling that I wanted to protect Darien, to make her feel safe, he said.

Iran and its populations have thousands of years of history in the region. That doesn't get rooted out with assassinations and missile strikes.

Countercultural is not a word one would readily pin to the amiable, clean-cut young men who are enjoying a rare night out at the diner for ice cream and cheesecake. And yet in America today, a man whose personal heroes are martyr-saints, who invokes God often in conversation, who worries intensely about the poor and believes that contraception and masturbation are always morally wrong is, to put it mildly, outside the mainstream. He stands apart. Sometimes it's hard to talk about Jesus Christ, says Damien Cook, 25, a friendly, Falstaffian-looking deacon from Omaha. I remember in high school, you feel odd bringing Him up. You're told by the culture that Christianity oppresses people. Like all counterculturalists, seminarians and priests can provoke suspicion, even hostility, from a society whose values they seem, by their very presence, to challenge. Seminarians say they're frequently approached by strangers who disagree with the church's position on women's ordination or, more often, celibacy. They go: 'Father, you can't get married, right? Well, I don't agree with that,' Brian Bashista, who is 34 and from Arlington, Va., recounts. You try to explain, but some of them don't want to hear it. Maybe I took offense the first couple of times, but it happens so much that I say, Lord, you must be doing something. Maybe this is an opportunity to try to help teach. Seminarians often confront the suggestion that a high proportion of them are homosexual.

In 1990, 12 European countries had some form of a wealth tax, while today only three have kept the policy — Norway, Spain and Switzerland. Reports by the O.E.C.D. and others have found that the tax led to an exodus of the wealthy and didn't raise as much revenue as anticipated.

And yet mystery — truly unfathomable and utterly ordinary — is at the center of this deceptively modest Manhattan Theater Club production, which originated in London and is directed with quiet care by Richard Eyre.

Blythe Connor is reluctant to become a parent — understandably so. Her own mother abandoned her when she was 11, after years of cruelty. Her grandmother, also abusive, departed in a more gruesome way: by hanging herself from a tree in the front yard. Blythe is primed, perhaps even genetically programmed, for maternal struggle. I think the baby hates me, she says just days after giving birth to her first child, a daughter named Violet. Their relationship goes downhill from there.

Texas policymakers feel strongly about giving students a positive view of the American economy; since 1995, state law has required that high school economics courses offer an emphasis on the free enterprise system and its benefits.

These insults, many of them handed out by people who on alternate days adored Proust, were neutralized by an issue of La Nouvelle Revue Francaise, France's best literary magazine at the time, that was entirely dedicated to Proust. It came out in 1923, just a year after Proust's death, and contained photos of the dead master, previously unpublished snippets from his pen, and evaluations from critics, French but also from nations all over the world. Most touching were the many personal testimonies. The poet Anna de Noailles, herself a monument to egotism, praised Proust for his ... modesty. (The duc de Gramont, one of Proust's highest-born friends, once remarked that aristocrats invited Proust for country weekends not because of his art but because he and Anna de Noailles were the two funniest people in Paris.)
The film, shot in black-and-white for $2.5 million, was a hit, earning more than $30 million. But when Tatum O'Neal was nominated for an Oscar and her father wasn't, it created tension.

(O'Neal declined to comment for this article.)
To those who say that Jewish education is the key to Jewish survival, I say, You are undoubtedly right. Whatever the essence or essences of Judaism may be, they are in large part, at least, to be discovered and rediscovered in our books, in our history, and in our approach to learning. But we cannot count on all Jews, so many of whom are busy with their successful careers, to become Jewishly educated, especially since Jewish education today is controlled almost entirely by the religious component of Jewish life and has been one of the great failures of the American Jewish community.
The pandemic has reshaped a heated market for sperm donations. Yael Helin, a biological analyst at the Seattle Sperm Bank, returning sperm samples to deep storage after preparing some for shipment. Credit... Grant Hindsley for The New York Times Sperm banks are running low on supplies because of an overwhelming demand for pandemic babies, so women are trying something unconventional: joining unregulated Facebook groups to find donors. People are fed up with sperm banks, said Kyle Gordy, 29, who lives in Malibu, Calif. He invests in real estate but spends most of his time donating his sperm, free (except for the cost of travel), to women. He also runs a nearly 11,000-member private Facebook group, Sperm Donation USA, which helps women connect with a roster of hundreds of approved donors. His donor sperm has sired 35 children, with five more on the way, he said. There have always been infertile straight couples in need of donor sperm, but with the legalization of gay marriage and the rise of elective single motherhood, the market has expanded over the last decade. About 20 percent of sperm bank clients are heterosexual couples, 60 percent are gay women, and 20 percent are single moms by choice, the banks said. To meet this demand, men provided sperm at a steady rate for years, some banks said. But the coronavirus changed things. Existing donors were scared to go in. New donor sign-ups stopped for months during lockdown and never really bounced back at some banks.

And while you may not have felt that way, there were other jokes he made about just Asian-Americans and Asian people in general, and there were other people who were obviously affected by this. So I mean, what kind of consequences do you think someone who makes those kinds of statements and who doesn't show any sort of remorse for it, should they face? If not firing, what should happen? What would the steps be?

This book is a call to action for all who refuse to accept our demographic demise as inevitable. It is a demand for a new Jewish state of mind capable of challenging the conventional wisdom that Judaism is more adaptive to persecution and discrimination than it is to an open, free, and welcoming society--that Jews paradoxically need enemies in order to survive, that anti-Semitism is what has kept Judaism alive. This age-old perspective on Jewish survival is illustrated by two tragic stories involving respected rabbinical leaders.
The comment about I wouldn't want to be judged for something 25 years ago was about something completely independent. I think I'd seen something where Joe Biden was being called out for something he'd said 25 years ago, when I said I wouldn't want to be called out for some misstatement I'd made 25 years ago. And then I joked, good thing no one cared about what I was doing 25 years ago, because I was at that point a 20-year-old man, and the internet didn't really have full documentation of how I spent those years.

In Lind's account, Caldwell's story about the advance of social liberalism through bureaucratic and judicial power is just a subsidiary of the more important story, the post-1970s consolidation of economic power by a managerial upper class. The liberalism of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama isn't an ideology of white disempowerment, in his account, so much as a solvent that weakens any institution — from churches and families to union shops and local industries — that might grant real power to groups outside the gilded city, the Silicon Valley bubble, the Ivy League gate. And together with its center-right partner in crime, Reagan-Thatcher libertarianism, this liberalism's policy choices — economic and social permissiveness, effectively conjoined — created a new class divide, between thriving meritocratic hubs and a declining and demoralized heartland, that explains both the frequency of populist irruptions and their consistent futility.

She's with you, too. You're not suffering alone, O.K.? We're suffering with you. The woman watched him desperately over her bucking chest. She could not take Communion because of the respirator, so Bashista offered her a spiritual communion instead. He placed the heel of his palm against her forehead and spread his fingers to encompass the front of her skull. As he prayed aloud, she closed her eyes. Watching this, I remembered something Bashista told me once: If the church is your bride, intimacy is what you have caring for the sick. You're giving of yourself, and it's being received. There is nothing more gratifying. When the prayer was done, the woman relaxed into her pillow, as if some tension inside her had been set free. After some minutes, Bashista gently extricated his hand from hers. I'll be back in two weeks, he told her. You'll probably be home by then. I'll come find you. Afterward, he told me: If this life were all there was, I couldn't do that. Suffering and pain are senseless if there's not an afterlife. This woman might see Jesus face to face tonight, and don't get me wrong -- he chuckled -- life is wonderful, it's a gift from God. But we're pilgrims here. This is not our home.

So I'm curious as to, in your mind, how long of a period of time should it be before someone faces some sort of consequences for something they've done in the past?
KK: Do you feel like President Obama achieved the change that he had promised in the 2008 campaign?
KARACHI, Pakistan — A court in the northern city of Lahore in Pakistan has abolished so-called virginity tests, which women are subjected to in sexual assault cases, setting a precedent for the practice to be potentially outlawed nationwide.
Cranston's character has to decide, does he stand by his principles and send his child to certain death in prison, or does he abuse this position of power to save his son? Bryan Cranston, welcome.
Anthony Rendon, the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly, said in an interview Monday morning that while he supported some of Mr. Newsom's initiatives, he had strong reservations about raising taxes to pay for them, as Mr. Newsom's aides have suggested.
The thesis of this book is that the long epoch of Jewish persecution is finally coming to an end and that a new age of internal dangers to the Jewish people is on the horizon. Institutional anti-Semitism is on its last legs as governments, churches, universities, and businesses embrace Jews. No Jew today needs to convert in order to become a professor, a banker, or a corporate CEO. Although anti-Semitism persists in many quarters, today's overt anti-Semites--the skinheads, militias, Holocaust deniers, and Farrakhan followers--have become marginalized. They continue to constitute a nuisance and pose a potential threat, but they do not have a significant day-to-day impact on the lives of most Jews, as anti-Semites in previous generations did. Today's marginalized anti-Semites do not decide which jobs we can hold, which universities we can attend, which neighborhoods we can live in, which clubs we can join, or even whom we can date and marry. We no longer look up to anti-Semites as the elites in our society who determine our fate. We look down on anti-Semites as the dregs of our society who make lots of noise but little difference.
SS: Concretely, would you have sent troops, say, to Syria?
Mr. Rodgers was a regular presence on the pop, country, R&B and easy listening charts for a decade after Honeycomb, with records that included Oh-Oh, I'm Falling in Love Again (1958) and Child of Clay (1967), both of which were nominated for Grammy Awards.
People on terrorism watch list are said to have been part of crowd in Washington on the day of Capitol riot. A mob of Trump supporters overtake the Capitol last week. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times Several people on a terrorist watch list were in Washington last week for pro-Trump events that ultimately devolved into the assault on the Capitol, according to a government official briefed on the Justice Department investigation into the riot. Most are suspected white supremacists, according to The Washington Post, which first reported on their status on the list. It was not clear how many people on the watch list were part of the mob that stormed the Capitol. But their presence in Washington last week adds to the urgent questions about security preparations for the events of Jan. 6, ahead of which thousands of supporters of President Trump had vowed to travel to Washington to disrupt, even violently, the congressional certification of the Electoral College results of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s win. The people were listed on the government's main terrorism watch list, the Terrorism Screening Database, one of several databases of people that law enforcement and intelligence officials have deemed to be known or suspected terrorists. The tool has undergone explosive growth in the era following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. As the lists were rapidly growing over a decade ago, the F.B.I.
Recalling the pants' entrance into pandemic life is difficult because this particular pair of pants — priced at $98, made of an Italian wool trademarked as GoWeave — is supposed to transcend any one season. What this means is that it is not right for any season. They are too hot in summer, too flimsy in the winter, easily soaked by spring showers and … well, they are OK in the fall.
n a sunny Saturday, I rode with Bashista from Mount Saint Mary's to Blessed Sacrament, the parish in Arlington where he served last summer and now spends two weekends each month. We drove in the low-slung gold Honda Civic that he purchased during his architecture days, and I asked Bashista what has become of that old egotistical, materialistic version of himself. It's there, but it's been transformed, he said. St. Paul said, I'm a new creation. The old self is dead. And in a sense that's true. Now, Bashista said, the energy he once spent serving his own interests is directed toward other people who need his help, both in prayer and in deed; like most seminarians, he keeps lists of people who have asked him to pray for them, or else he prays for them in the moment of promising to do so. According to the Pope's theology of the body, the passionate intensity of sexual love is also the model for celibate love -- the total self-donation of a priest to his people. The needs of the sick and the poor are a particular focus; there is perhaps no setting in America -- neither the halls of government nor the campuses of elite colleges anymore -- where you hear the poor evoked more often, and more sympathetically, than in a Catholic seminary. At Blessed Sacrament, Bashista checked in with the pastor and made some last-minute adjustments to his homily, which he would deliver at Mass that evening.
What does it mean to grieve someone who is alive, but who walks, talks, thinks, acts and looks different from before? The experts call this kind of loss ambiguous grief or unconventional grief. People with loved ones who fall prey to Alzheimer's may experience this, as may parents whose children become alcoholics or drug addicts.
Given the wide range of student experiences, I wasn't sure how the students would receive a course on women writers. In the United States, when I've taught similar courses, discussions often veered into the territory of I'm not a feminist, but … Students were sure that there should be equity between the sexes but feminists, in their minds, were angry man-haters who did nothing but complain.
Sounds like you've been having pretty long days, so we appreciate you.
MR. DAWSON Did it help you against the dive bombers? Or the U-boats?
I think he meets just about every conventional definition of dictator. Yes.
Nevertheless, Kerry Green, a high school social studies teacher in Sunnyvale, Tex., a small town east of Dallas, said she discussed redlining with her 11th graders, adding it as a counterpoint to lessons about postwar prosperity — the optimistic story of consumerism, television and the Baby Boom that is emphasized by her state's standards.
A progressive tax is one in which the rate increases with income, while a regressive tax increases inversely with income.
But her friends see hardened attitudes — reinforced since the election — toward the poor. Some of them are scared, she said. Some of them are worried that they'll wind up back on the street.
And it's not just the leading edge N.S.A.-type stuff. If you look around congressional offices or the I.R.S., they're all using technology from the '90s or whatever it is. I had a whiz kid who said he got yelled at for writing a script in a congressional office that automated a task. They were like, No, we just wanted you to do it manually forever. So there needs to be a massive modernization effort. Not just in terms of how we recruit tech talent at the highest levels, but how we function even in the basics.
Analysis: The idea of the border wall, which advisers to Mr. Trump said they initially created to remind Mr. Trump to talk tough on immigration during his campaign, has boxed in the president. He's now struggling to find a way to please both his core supporters and conservative skeptics who see the wall as ineffective.
OK, he showed a picture. That's a picture. Now, we all know a picture is worth 1,000 words. We know what it appears from the picture. We don't know what led up to that, where exactly in time that was. But with all that being said, you are correct. There's no reason to kick a suspect. And we don't train to do that. We're not allowed to do that. That's normally not the course of business. So that part of the question, I would agree and answer that no, it shouldn't be done. However, do I take Paul Howard's word that that's what that picture meant? No, sir, I do not. But that's why we have investigations. And even though it's been numerous times the media has jumped out and swore that that officer was wrong, but after all the evidence and the videos were looked at properly and in context, almost all of those have been turned over — or they haven't been found guilty. But yet, the video started out looking bad. And if we're going to get to a society where mayors and district attorneys can look at video and go, that looks bad, I don't like it, so I'm going to terminate you and charge you with murder — that's a bad precedent to start.
Maybe you don't find morality clauses alarming under any circumstances. If what you're selling me is your reputation, if that's what I'm paying you for, then I should not have to pay you if your reputation tanks, said Rick Kurnit, a partner in Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz, a firm specializing in art and entertainment law.
His son, William, said Mr. Borders' body was discovered on Thursday. He said an autopsy would be performed.
And Mark, how are the British people thinking about all this and thinking about her as they watch this wedding?
The real strategic question in the next election is which platform — moderate or progressive — will resonate with the greatest number of voters in the battleground states. It is clear that Bret Stephens prefers the moderate — a candidate focused on infrastructure spending, a carbon tax and modest increases in taxes on the wealthy matched to the promise of a balanced budget.
So we need to have better, more holistic ways of measuring how our kids are doing educationally, and we need to empower teachers and let teachers do their jobs. Because if you are a teacher and you're teaching to the test, you end up making decisions in the classroom that you know are not right for the students.
The sisters and other Shoshone ranchers refused to pay grazing fees on traditional Western Shoshone land — nearly 26 million acres in Nevada, roughly two-thirds of the state. The government considers it public land.
Our founding fathers created a system of government of men, not of angels, Gephardt said, his face reddening with emotion as he spoke.No one standing in this House today can pass a puritanical test of purity that some are demanding that our elected leaders take. If we demand that mere mortals live up to this standard, we will see our seats of government lay empty and we will see the best, most able people unfairly cast out of public service.
Karen Pence, the second lady of the United States, returned to teaching art this week, accepting a part-time position at a private Christian school that does not allow gay students and requires employees to affirm that marriage should only be between a man and a woman.
I loved that play. It was a great play.
Mr. Booker said Friday that environmental justice will be one of the three top policy issues of his campaign. He has recently signed on to endorse the Green New Deal, a progressive litmus test on the environment pushed by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, that pushes for investments in clean-energy infrastructure and policies to directly address climate change.
To a certain extent, yeah. Yeah, I do think so.
Not at all. We originated the SAT during World War II as a way to determine which kids we did not want to send to the front lines. Now we treat our kids like every year is wartime. I've talked to parents and teachers around the country, and I've said, we need to de-emphasize these standardized tests. They are a terrible measurement of human value, certainly have nothing to do with character. At this point, as you said, they are more likely to test your parents' socioeconomic status than anything else.
And that is very much the way it's interpreted. And I think also, it's the way that Meghan Markle intended for it to be interpreted. She knew she was going to be asked that question. I don't think there was anything accidental about the reply, nor do I think anyone misinterpreted who she meant when she said not many people have asked if I'm O.K. By that she meant members of the royal family. But it doesn't end there.
The Obama administration named Mr. Yang a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship in 2015 and a Champion of Change in 2012.
Details: In 1994, a multiyear, 23-nation survey found that the sexual abuse of nuns by priests or bishops was especially rampant in some African countries. In 1998, another report confirmed those findings and discovered that even rape of sisters was common. Another found that 29 nuns in one order alone had become pregnant.
The couple were also devoted to their sheep, which are prized possessions in his celebrated novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the basis for the film Blade Runner.
The result, Federico notes, is that group consciousness is likely to emerge on the basis of education and training and when those with less education see themselves as being culturally very different from an educated stratum of the population that is more socially liberal and cosmopolitan, then the sense of group conflict is deepened.
Back then, the Osbornes naïvely assumed that copying country's familiar templates might get them somewhere. Later, they concluded it was far more important, and satisfying, to commit to a musical identity they could inhabit convincingly. The one they chose — a groove-driven, occasionally jammy singing-and-shredding duo — has made for a rather exotic presence in contemporary country over the last half-decade. Guitar heroes have receded from the spotlight, and even in Nashville, once nicknamed Guitar Town, studio production is frequently powered by drum machines, programming and synthesizers these days.
Yeah, very prescient. The story was very good. Scott Burns wrote a really terrific script, so that got high marks. The character itself wasn't as high a mark for me. But then the fourth category, the director, was very high, Steven Soderbergh. So all of a sudden, the collective, cumulative score was very high.
Yes, terrible. And I visited my mom, and she was saying, Do you want some coffee? I go, No. You sure you don't want coffee? I said, No. You know, I snapped at her. And they stopped the tape, and they said, no, no, no, you shouldn't do that. You're good. You're nice. I go, yeah, but he just broke up. Snapping at someone you love is real and honest.
A year later, Kevin Hart released a special, Irresponsible, in which he also discussed cheating on his wife. He was more oblique, briefer in his contrition, and the special cut away from him after a joke to show the crowd laughing. Whereas Burnham kept the audience out of it, Irresponsible took a more ingratiating route, with a shot that indicated it was OK to laugh before keeping things moving.
And that's probably a generous response. Some of the responses would be worse than that. So if you get the boot off people's throats, then you can start making progress on our health, on our educational outcomes, on our political polarization.
If you were a person in that town in Missouri and you wanted to start a bakery, before the dividend, it's a dumb idea. Post-dividend, it might be a great idea. You can hire someone to help staff the bakery, you know if the bakery fails, you're going to survive because you have this income that you can rely upon. This is the most stable and secure way to create jobs that actually reflect our community's needs and values. What are the other alternatives? For the government to come in and say, Hey, we're going to designate five people to clean up this park forever. We're going to designate 10 people to make our people stronger forever, regardless of whether or not they're ——
Binyamin Appelbaum: Yes. After every invention basically since the plow, people have found new uses for the time saved by new technologies. You've argued that this time, this won't happen quickly enough. Why will this time be different? What gives you the confidence that we're confronting something new in all of human history?
After studying an account of the trip — in a medieval Latin text written many years later titled Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis or The Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot — Mr. Severin assembled a team of designers and craftsmen and set about building a vessel — a 36-foot-long, two-masted boat of oak and ash covered in oxhide a quarter-inch thick.
I do. I give everything a numerical rating. So I actually transfer my emotions into a kind of mathematical equation, which helps me look at it from a more objective viewpoint. Because if you stay subjective to it and emotional to it, it's hard to make a decision because you might be swayed by the emotions.
Rita Vidaurri, who became famous across Latin America as a ranchera singer in the 1940s and '50s and stopped performing at the height of her renown, only to rekindle her career when she was nearing 80, died on Jan. 16 in San Antonio. She was 94.
URSULA EAGLY at Chocolate Factory (March 29 through April 1, 8 p.m.). In her new Piece with gaps for each other, Ms. Eagly works in collaboration with the Mexican artist Martín Lanz Landázuri and the Japanese composer Kohji Setoh. Anchored by themes of tragedy and protest, Ms. Eagly's latest work is inspired by the disappearance of 43 students from an all-male teachers college in Mexico — they were on their way to a protest before they were stopped by the police and turned over to a criminal organization — and the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. Ultimately, Piece with gaps is not so much a political work as it is one that explores the paired ideas of difference and coexistence. For it, the collaborators will be joined by Madeline Best, Jamie Boyle, Mina Nishimura and Kathy Westwater.
Did you come up for this?
The lure of the smugglers in Reynosa is not limited to Central Americans. Mexicans, too, employ their services, although the cost is lower — the prices charged seem to depend on just how bad the situation is in a migrant's home country.
When Rock confessed his mistakes, Burnham moved into a rare close-up. And he stayed on the star's face, with no cutaway shots, as Rock talked about cheating on his wife. When the crowd chuckled, Rock looked grave, emphasizing that he wasn't proud. He said he knew what people were thinking: What is wrong with men?
So it was with some apparent humility — and then plenty of residual swagger — that Mr. Biden, days off a fourth-place debacle in Iowa, opened Friday night's debate with an unusual prediction: He would probably do some more losing next week.
The long overlooked sexual abuse of nuns
CW: Going back though, my question is, there's an issue of power here. I mean, sure. You might not want to. You might not be able to address the problems of Facebook if you break it up from Instagram, and I understand that, and there's still going to be addictive products, but there's an issue of the consolidation of actual power, the ability to buy those companies, to make those acquisitions. Just simply the leverage that Mark Zuckerberg can use to have a meeting with Donald Trump that they won't tell us about, I mean, how do you — if you don't break them up, how do you get rid of that conglomeration of power?
Like TB and cancer before it, autism can accumulate moral weight. In Louise Erdrich's Four Souls (2004), a white settler who has despoiled the Minnesota pine forests and cheated its Ojibwe inhabitants subsequently endures the immolation of his business empire as well as the birth of a son with vacant eyes, the very picture of idiocy, who makes hideous sounds and cannot be soothed out of his gross repetition. Here is the transfiguration of a neurobiological disease into one that lays waste to the mind, taking along with it all the qualities that make us human. In Lake Success, the protagonist eventually returns home to his son, and — just as Little Eva's beautiful tubercular fade in Uncle Tom's Cabin spurs her father to promise to free his slaves — in Shteyngart's novel, autism becomes a vehicle for the father's spiritual growth.
Mr. Yang has been the most vocal of all candidates about privacy issues. Tristan Harris, whom he has alluded to in discussing the Department of the Attention Economy, spent three years as a Google design ethicist. He left to found the Center for Humane Technology, a nonprofit that seeks to address the digital attention crisis.
The cause was respiratory failure, her son Richard Wilhelm said.
Early on the morning of Nov. 12, 1958, George Whitmore, Warren Harding and Wayne Merry accomplished something many climbers considered unthinkable: They reached the top of El Capitan.
Throughout, Aldrich has been supported by Pauline (Alison Wright, who plays Martha on The Americans), his right-hand lady (as she calls herself), script-reader and assistant, cheerleader and troubleshooter. In the second side arc in the episode, Pauline rises to the forefront, speaking the first line after the credits sequence when she compliments the editor on his seamless job piecing together the beach scene in Baby Jane. Pauline has a secret. She has written a script for Crawford and wants to direct it. In this risky pioneering pursuit, she recruits Crawford's right-hand lady, Mamacita, asking for advice on how to approach the star. Mamacita's reaction to such an unorthodox idea is unexpected, leading to a hugely entertaining scene in which she lectures Pauline on census information in the United States. Women will someday outnumber men, Mamacita informs an astonished Pauline, and Hollywood will have to respond by catering to that majority.
KIDS' WORKSHOP: 'MODEL BUILDERS' at the Bard Graduate Center (Jan. 21, noon to 3 p.m.). When the architect and decorator Charles Percier (1764-1838) designed for Napoleon, he used materials like marble, bronze and gilded wood. The participants in this workshop for ages 6 through 12 will deal with cardboard, foam and corrugated paper, but they'll still emulate the classical forms that he did: domes, arches, columns and pediments. Linked to the center's exhibition Charles Percier: Architecture and Design in an Age of Revolutions, the program will begin with a tour of the show and end with the creation of model buildings.
That's probably a good assessment. I think that's probably right. And then, as you said, people will forget, and they'll come back in. And then they will demand more weighty storytelling.
In that world, President Trump sent Speaker Nancy Pelosi a letter telling her that he was postponing her trip with a congressional delegation to visit American troops in Afghanistan. The president's salvo came 24 hours after Ms. Pelosi informed Mr. Trump that because of the shutdown, she was rescinding her invitation to him to deliver a State of the Union address in the House chamber.
Murkowski signals she is open to convicting Trump as the timing of the Senate impeachment trial remains unclear. Senator Lisa Murkowski speaks at a news conference in the Capitol building. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said on Thursday that the House had acted appropriately in impeaching President Trump, signaling possible support for convicting him at a Senate trial in a statement that called his actions unlawful and said that they warranted consequences. Ms. Murkowski said the second impeachment of Mr. Trump stood in stark contrast to the first, which she and virtually every other Republican opposed. She said Mr. Trump had perpetuated false rhetoric that the election was stolen and rigged and launched a pressure campaign against his own vice president, urging him to take actions that he had no authority to do. And though Ms. Murkowski did not commit to finding the president guilty, saying she would listen carefully to the arguments on both sides, she strongly suggested that she was inclined to do so. On the day of the riots, President Trump's words incited violence, which led to the injury and deaths of Americans — including a Capitol Police officer — the desecration of the Capitol, and briefly interfered with the government's ability to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, Ms. Murkowski said.
Mr. Yang has frequently said that automation contributed heavily to Mr. Trump's win, because voters feel disaffected and worry that the futures of their jobs and industries are in jeopardy.
JW: Are you concerned that you wouldn't be triggering a sort of a war of — a back and forth between Republicans and Democrats, who were continuing to add justices to the bench with each new administration to satisfy their own policy priorities?
But the proceedings grew increasingly serious as the night went on. Michelle Williams, accepting the Globe for best actress in a limited series for FX's Fosse/Verdon, pleaded with women to vote. When it's time to vote, please do so in your own self-interest, Williams said. It's what men have been doing for years, which is why the world looks so much like them.
BEIJING — The number of babies born in China last year fell to a nearly six-decade low, exacerbating a looming demographic crisis that is set to reshape the world's most populous nation and threaten its economic vitality.
— they only know 911. Nobody knows the seven-digit number or the 10-digit number to call anyone else, so —
In both novels, Offill's fragmentary structure evokes an unbearable emotional intensity: something at the core of the story that cannot be narrated directly, by straight chronology, because to do so would be like looking at the sun. In Dept. of Speculation, that white-hot core was the heartbreak of domestic collapse. In Weather, the collapse exists on a scale at once broader and more abstract: the end of the world itself. The thing that cannot be stared at directly is not the sun, but our own doomed planet.
I have more than four years of aviation behind me. I've barnstormed over half of the 48 states. I've flown my mail through the worst of nights. There had been two previous Atlantic flights--both in 1919, the first when one of three Navy craft flew from Newfoundland to the Azores; and the second when John Alcock and Arthur Brown made it from Newfoundland to Ireland. But no one had made the crossing alone, or from continent to continent. Once he conceived the notion of the flight, Lindbergh, with characteristic energy, began to elaborate the details. He helped design the plane to his specifications, calculating every ounce that went into it. He laid out his route. Every foreseeable circumstance was checked out. Two elements could not be figured: the weather and his ability to stay awake. With the weather he took a calculated risk. Fighting off sleep proved a problem, and only his indomitable determination overcame that, although he conceded there were moments of touch-and-go. One of the attractions for the Paris flight was a $25,000 prize, for which there were several competitors, among them Clarence Chamberlin and Adm. Richard E. Byrd. Lindbergh, though, was confident he could be first and be successful. He was motivated, he told this writer in later years, by a desire to improve his standing as a pilot as well as by an eagerness to win the prize.
If you gaze at the many portraits of half-Japanese, half-Dutch subjects photographed by Mr. Miyazaki, you can see the searching in their faces, the puzzling out of what hapa means. But you can also gain the sense that there are deep currents, forces old and powerful, in opposition to wall-building and racial hunkering.
The Covenant Regime is based on the idea that our current formula is a conspiracy to make people unhappy. Love is realistically a stronger force than self-interest. Detached calculation in such matters is self-strangulating. The deepest joy sneaks in the back door when you are surrendering to some sacred promise.
As Jews and Israel become more secure against external threats, the internal threats are beginning to grow, as graphically illustrated by the recent assassination of an Israeli prime minister by a Jew, the growing conflict between fundamentalist Jews and more acculturated Jews, the increasing trends toward intermarriage and assimilation, and the decline of Jewish literacy.
I understand that the term 'marriage' has only one meaning; the uniting of one man and one woman, it reads, adding that certain moral misconduct would be disqualifying, such as heterosexual activity outside of marriage (e.g., premarital sex, cohabitation, extramarital sex), homosexual or lesbian sexual activity, polygamy, transgender identity, any other violation of the unique roles of male and female.
I went in and closed the door behind me.
People say, write what you know, but it's really, write about what obsesses you, she said. Write about what you're thinking about all the time.
I had to get shot by the good guys and fall off a horse, which I did successfully, and that established me as having enough talent to do stunts, he recalled in an oral history recorded in 2006 for the Archive of American Television, so when there was a speaking role and a stunt associated with that speaking role, they'd hire me, because you got two for the price of one.
What I'm suggesting is we actually make capitalism's goals align with ours, as human beings, as parents, as Americans. Instead of maximizing these capital efficiency measurements, we should be maximizing our own health and life expectancy, our children's education and success rates, our mental health and freedom from substance abuse, our environmental sustainability. Then we can line up the power of the markets with how we are doing. But the markets do not care one whit about us and our children.
I was wearing a helmet. I have a staffer with the helmet as proof.
KK: So I assume you're referring to [your] universal basic income plan. Your campaign platform, you have tons and tons of proposals, everything from U.B.I. to universal daylight saving time. Plans don't really mean anything unless you have priorities. What would you do immediately when you enter office? What would be first on your agenda? What would you want to accomplish in the first 100 days?
A sprawling, populous complex that serves 3,600 families and runs an elementary school, Blessed Sacrament has a pastor, three associate priests and Bashista, reflecting a bounty of vocations in and around Arlington that is out of keeping with the general trend. Bashista assumed at first that he would join a diocese in greater need of priests, he said, but in that process, some doors open, other doors close. The match seemed to be in Arlington. Bashista may spend as many as 15 years as an associate pastor, whereas in priest-starved dioceses like Denver, where Crisman will be ordained, a new priest might be placed in charge of a parish as soon as two years after ordination -- thrown into a vast organizational and fiscal job (parishes are financially independent, though they may borrow money from their dioceses) that can put a great deal of pressure on an inexperienced priest. After the Mass, parishioners gathered around Bashista and the other priests outside the church. Several complimented Bashista on his homily. One woman had a little boy with her who was afraid to make his first confession; would Bashista talk with him? A young drummer with an Army band thought he might have a vocation; Bashista promised to send him some information. A number of people asked him to pray for them, and he always assented -- and asked them to pray for him, too. (Later, he recorded the names of new parishioners he had met in a small book to help him remember them.)
Starting in 1979, productivity and pay sharply diverged — productivity rose nearly 70 percent, while typical hourly pay essentially stagnated, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
When a Black man appears in a Virginia courtroom this month to stand trial on charges of eluding the police, assaulting an officer and other crimes, he will face a scene that defendants in that room have not experienced in decades: The portraits of white judges will no longer line the walls.
I found him to be a very sympathetic character, which I did not expect. I think that's the part I was surprised by because he's such a cartoon character of kind of a bully, but he really isn't, in a lot of ways.
We've been around a long time, and we're seeing what's happening with all the other candidates, said Mr. Trachtenburg, who said he'd previously supported Mr. Biden. They're eliminating themselves.
A year ago when Wuhan shut down, it offered the world a forewarning about the dangers of the virus. Now, it heralds a post-pandemic world where the relief at unmasked faces, joyous get-togethers and daily commutes conceals the emotional aftershocks.
Uber is literally advertising to schoolteachers saying, Hey, we've figured out schoolteachers make really good Uber drivers. And if you look at that situation, the headline unemployment rate says, Check, this person is employed. Heck, this person might be employed twice. The headline unemployment rate when Donald Trump was running for president, he castigated it as fake news, and then he got into office and all the sudden it became real news. He was right the first time. The number is almost intentionally designed to obscure any of the difficulties in the labor market. If I drop out of the labor market, I no longer count. I actually help the number.
Between South Carolina, where we had just finished graduate school, and Tennessee, where we would start our new teaching jobs, lay the Appalachian Mountains. Getting over them in one piece would be the first real test of our lives as fully employed adults.
When it's over, I want to say: all my life I was a bride married to amazement. I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms. When it's over, I don't want to wonder if I have made of my life something particular, and real. I don't want to find myself sighing and frightened, or full of argument. I don't want to end up simply having visited this world.
This, to me, is an emblem of what's gone wrong in American life. Where the market is all knowing and all powerful, and if the market decides that local journalism has zero value, then it has zero value. And that is not the way forward for us. We need to make our own independent determination of our own value as people, of the value of local journalism, of the value of arts, of the value of volunteering, of caregiving, of — like all the most important things in American life. And so you, in many ways, you're like the guardians of this incredible journalistic tradition, and it's like a unique privilege because the people who've pursued the same vocation in other parts of the country are just seeing it disappear.
PragerU has expanded Dennis Prager's reach, but it has not fundamentally changed his days.
I started and ran a national nonprofit called Venture for America that recruited enterprising college graduates to help grow businesses in Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, New Orleans, Birmingham, Baltimore, and nine other American cities. We helped create several thousand jobs. I'm very, very proud of that. But I realize that the jobs we were creating were only going to apply for a small slice of the population. And these jobs were pouring water into a bathtub that has a giant hole ripped in the bottom. I'm running for president to let America know that it is not our imagination, the water is rushing out of the bathtub. Immigrants have nothing to do with it. It's the fact that we're going through the greatest economic transformation.

Six women will be called to testify about their allegations that Mr. Weinstein sexually assaulted them. Four of those incidents happened too long ago to be prosecuted as separate crimes, but prosecutors hope their testimony will show a pattern of predatory behavior.
And the House overwhelmingly rejected, 285 to 148, an accusation of abuse of power stemming from Clinton's legalistic answers to 81 questions put to him by the House Judiciary Committee. Eighty-one Republicans defected from their party. Only one Democrat deserted his.

Mr. Rosenquist himself drew on his experience painting immense movie billboards above Times Square and a Hebrew National sign in Brooklyn.
But for Ms. Amadou, who married at 16, simply having a husband was not enough. She never wanted to depend on a man in the first place. So, on a busy morning in Maradi, Niger, she sat in front of a judge at a crowded Islamic court on the sidewalk and asked for what young women across the region are seeking like never before: a divorce.
That's what I am. I had a very profound experience watching it. It was mostly because everyone was asleep, and I didn't want to make noise. I watched your other one on the big screen in my home, which was great, and with a great sound system.
Some sleepers--maybe just two or three--the dead will never leave.
A major development since the end of the Great Compression of the 30 years or so after World War II, when there was less inequality and relatively greater job security, at least for white male workers, is that the differential rate of return on education and training is now much higher.
In 1954, not long after Mr. Hefner founded Playboy in Chicago, he met Mr. Lownes, a dapper and sophisticated man-about-Chicago, Frank Brady wrote in the 1974 biography Hefner.
Listening to the tape, we have no idea what this means.
Not long after he wrote that passage, Dickey started teaching poetry at the University of South Carolina. A young Tim Gautreaux was his student, and even the quiet, profound title of Gautreaux's dissertation, Night-Wide River, shows he was listening. Now, nearly 50 years and six books later, Gautreaux's latest story collection, Signals, affirms that he is Dickey's true heir.
But it was Foolish Pleasure who brought Mr. Jolley his first measure of track immortality.
A third abrupt check for adventurous Catholic intellectuals came in 1907 when Pope Pius X's decree Lamentabili (1907) and the encyclical Pascendi (1907) sweepingly condemned modernism in theology; in response, one English convert, George Tyrrell, S.J., courted excommunication. In the following years seminaries and Catholic colleges in Britain and America were purged of all traces of modernism. Outsiders regarded these episodes as further evidence that Catholic intellectuals were hamstrung by intrusive, censorious, and often ignorant authorities. This was the age in which Andrew Dickson White, first president of Cornell University, wrote his influential History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom (1896), casting the scientists as truth-loving heroes through the ages and the Catholic Church as an antiintellectual villain trying to squeeze the life out of them. White made enormous capital out of the famous Galileo case and treated it as typical of Catholicism at all times. Converts who remained committed to contemporary intellectual principles found themselves walking a tightrope between the guardians of orthodoxy on their right and their former friends and colleagues to their left.

She's three years older than Prince Harry. She's divorced. She's self-supporting. She's a professional woman. But really above all, she is biracial. She has a white father and an African-American mother. And that, more than anything else made her a very different, very radical new member of a family that really hasn't changed much for centuries.
Kathleen Kingsbury: Wonderful. Thank you. Yeah. So I have a serious question to ask you, but first we wanted to ask, were you wearing a helmet while you were biking here?
A third issue is logistical. A wealth tax would be like an estate tax levied every year. Figuring out the tax owed on large estates is complicated, costly and time-consuming. The Internal Revenue Service gives estates a year to file a return, but even then, executors often have to file extensions. And on the other end, auditors go through the returns, which can take years before an estate is settled.
To Mr. Biden's friends and family, his success at winning the White House is proof that there is something fundamentally reassuring about his character — his loyalty, his empathy and his experience — that Americans want after four years of an unpredictable and chaotic administration. Even when he misspeaks, they argue, it underscores his authenticity, the journey of a man who moved through the darkness of the losses of his young wife, baby daughter and adult son to remain optimistic about politics, the country and his own destiny.
At the end of the last century, Theodor Herzl called for a new Jewish state. As we approach the close of this cataclysmic century, I believe we need a new Jewish state of mind if we are to define and ensure the Jewish future, not only for our sake but for the sake of all humankind.
I walked into this job, my son has walked into this job for what it's for: to protect and serve. As cliché as that sounds, that's why we do this. We don't get holidays and weekends off. We know that going in. We know that the pay is not the best. We know that going in. We know we could get hurt or killed. We know that going in. So you look at yourself, and you go, why are you doing the job? And that's been the conversation. Is the job getting to where it's not what you thought it was? It's not maybe for you, you know, now? Are you becoming the dinosaur officer that needs to go? And everybody says things aren't done like they used to. Well, that's true. They're not. So you've got to learn to conform and make these changes. And if you don't think you can, maybe it's time for you to move on.
Modernity and the Holocaust was a work of theory and synthesis. He collected no data and had no methodology to speak of. That didn't make it any less of a powerful contribution.
BS: Any more than they already are.
Many lines of conflict mutually reinforce each other rather than crosscut: Less educated whites tend to be more Evangelical and more racist, and they live in geographical spaces with less economic momentum.
His son, Jeffrey, confirmed the death. He said his father had entered Newton Wellesley Hospital that morning having difficulty breathing. No specific cause was given.

In 2017, Mr. Booker announced his support for the Medicare for All Act drafted by Senator Bernie Sanders, and reiterated his support in an interview after he announced his candidacy Friday, saying I signed up and am a big believer in Medicare for all. But as a senator from New Jersey who had received millions in campaign contributions from the pharmaceutical industry, Mr. Booker had been reluctant to focus regulatory efforts on the industry, voting against a measure in 2017 that would have greatly reduced drug prices by allowing imports from Canada. He has since reversed course, announcing his support this year for Mr. Sanders's bill to rein in prescription drug costs.

She is most widely remembered as having become a symbol of Spain's progress toward gender equality when she was named defense minister in what was the first female-dominated cabinet in Spanish politics, under Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero.
I grew up in an entirely secular household. My parents did not talk about God in the house, but I had this instinctive belief in a higher power. I had many Christian relatives. I went to church over holidays growing up quite often. And then I married my wife, Evelyn, who's Christian. And so, we're raising our kids in a Christian church. I go to church when I'm home, which is not very often unfortunately nowadays. I enjoy it. My faith is still very much a journey, but I'm unreservedly thrilled about the impact it has on my wife, my boys, my family, my community.
Yes. I have three major pro-journalism proposals on my website, including federally funding journalists for every congressional district, billions of dollars in grants to help transition local journalism. Matching grants, so you're not like saying, Hey, we're going to do this. But matching grants to help transition them to cooperative models of ownership to nonprofit and philanthropic models.

JI: Yes. Regulating it heavily and using the revenue to treat gambling addiction. Can you talk through that? You say on your website that you think gambling addiction doesn't get nearly enough attention, and it is a really important issue. How does legalizing gambling, even if you use the revenue, not make that problem worse?
I badged my way through the tunnel of uniforms around the front door, making the landlady as my best witness or last-to-see. There was a fat full moon reflecting the sun on to my back. Not even Italian police are sentimental about full moons. You're looking at a workload increase of twenty-five to thirty-five percent. A full moon on a Friday night and you're talking a two-hour backup in the emergency room and long lines trailing in and out of Trauma.
Well, the labor force participation rate has declined precipitously, so I don't buy that somehow the government started giving people more money over the last number of years. And the headline unemployment rate, and I'm sure you know this, it doesn't measure underemployment, 40 to 44 percent of recent college graduates are now doing a job that does not require a college degree. It does not measure the fact that 94 percent of new jobs in the economy are temp, gig or contract jobs that do not have health care benefits and can disappear at any moment. It doesn't include the fact that you might be doing two or three jobs to make ends meet.
In opera, the drumbeat of time is written on — and in — the body. Vocal cords grow brittle; high notes start to quaver; low tones hollow out. Singers have to retire the roles of their youth, and eventually retire altogether.
The outcome of the convert intellectuals' labors was not what they themselves had hoped. Although for three or four generations they were highly influential within the Catholic Church, playing a crucial role in transforming English-language Catholicism, they were powerless to halt or reverse the dominant intellectual trends of their era. The church was certainly unable to resume the central place in Western intellectual life which it had enjoyed prior to the Reformation. While the new Catholics challenged non-Catholic scholars on the vital issues of the era, the non-Catholics rarely deigned even to notice them in return and made little effort to incorporate their insights into their work. For example, William George Ward, a friend of Newman's and a fiery controversialist, converted in 1845 and later became editor of the Dublin Review, one of the leading British Catholic journals. His biographer (and son) describes at length Ward's fifteen-year correspondence with John Stuart Mill, giving the impression that Ward had a large effect on the utilitarian philosopher's outlook. But no biographer of Mill has found evidence of this supposed influence, and it is likely that the Wards indulged in wishful thinking when they came to assess the importance of the correspondence to Mill's own life and work.

President Obama referred to education as the civil rights issue of our time, as did former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. Indeed, the gap between education outcomes for black and white students has barely budged in recent decades, according to research from the Brookings Institution.
I'm amazed that Eddie Rickenbacker and Charles Lindbergh, who appear in Race of Aces, are stalwarts of my own aviation-heavy cultural literacy — yet the flying ace Dick Bong, the all-American hero at its heart, is new to me, and I suspect he will be to other readers, too. In his new book, John R. Bruning corrects this oversight. Whether he's putting you in the middle of an intense air battle in searing heat and mosquito clouds, or taking you to watch a young aviator gamely repeat his marriage vows four times in a single day to accommodate the hungry media and an adoring public, Bruning celebrates a handful of larger-than-life World War II fighter pilots and brings them to our attention once again.

Hadn't he winked at the crowd a bit? Everyone takes him too seriously.
The question of whether to prioritize free public college has divided the Democratic candidates. Senators Warren and Sanders say that four-year public colleges should be free, and Senator Cory Booker signed on to legislation that could make it debt-free. Senator Amy Klobuchar previously criticized the idea of free college for all, but then signed on to a version of a free-college proposal. Mr. Yang, though, has said he supports forgiving more student loan debt but thinks the Freedom Dividend is a better solution to inequality than free college.

The N.S.A. is installing a Trump loyalist as its general counsel days before Biden's inauguration. Allies of Michael Ellis, a Trump loyalist, had pushed for him to be installed as the National Security Agency's top lawyer before President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is inaugurated. Credit... Saul Loeb/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The National Security Agency is moving forward with hiring a Trump administration loyalist, the agency said Sunday, after the acting defense secretary ordered he be made the spy agency's top lawyer. Acting Defense Secretary Christopher C. Miller had ordered the agency's director, Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, to install Michael Ellis as its general counsel, giving him a 6 p.m. Saturday deadline. The deadline came and went with the National Security Agency remaining silent. But the agency said in a statement on Sunday that Mr. Ellis accepted his final job offer yesterday afternoon. N.S.A. is moving forward with his employment. Mr. Ellis has not been formally sworn in, and it is not clear when that would happen. Mr. Ellis has been accused of having a hand in one of the more contentious legal decisions the Trump administration made: the attempt to stop John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, from publishing a damning book about the president. Mr. Ellis's allies had pushed for him to be installed before President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is inaugurated. While it will be difficult to fire Mr. Ellis under Civil Service rules, the Biden administration could easily reassign him to another, less important post.
The fabric feels cheap, though. I hate the fabric. I hate the fit. They squeeze my thighs when I pull them up to my natural waist and flatten my butt when they fall to my hips. They are bulky without keeping me warm, and there is no shirt that can make the awkward length — too long to be short pants, too short to cover my ankles — work at all. And yet, beginning in September, I have been wearing them at least three times a week.
Kuechenberg joined the Dolphins as a free agent in 1970, the future Hall of Fame coach Don Shula's first season, and played for them until 1983. He was part of a daunting offensive line that included guard Larry Little and center Jim Langer, both enshrined in the Hall of Fame.
Actually, there isn't much about sex in Sex and the Constitution, either, until well into the book, let alone sex and the Constitution together. The first half is a mad dash through history, starting with the Greeks and ending with Senator Joseph McCarthy, the Stonewall uprising and Anita Bryant. This history proceeds in a seesaw manner, with periods of prudery in reaction to periods of license followed by more prudery, followed by license. But since Stone has made it clear that he thinks the general direction life has taken is toward more freedom, he generally approves of the way things have gone.
After Mr. Gillis was fired, Mr. Yang tweeted that the comedian had reached out to him. Looks like we will be sitting down together soon, Mr. Yang wrote. Neither the comedian nor the candidate appears to have spoken publicly about the content of the meeting.
Many of Mr. Yang's supporters say they are drawn to his perspective as a political outsider; in The Wall Street Journal, some say they previously supported Senator Sanders but now look for a candidate who offers an even fresher non-Washington perspective.
It very much is. But if you were to apply resources, you would want to apply resources in ways that don't necessarily advantage the top third of your population by educational attainment exclusively. You would be trying to build more paths with the other two-thirds, which investing in trades and apprenticeships would do, and you would try and provide for the people who are the weakest and most vulnerable in the job market, which are not going to be the people that are attending college.
Mr. Yang's comments, on Mr. Gillis and on judgment more broadly, contribute to a growing conversation among political and cultural figures about the merits and downsides of cancel culture. Former President Obama, for example, spoke out about the prevalence of call-out culture during an interview in October, arguing that criticizing people on social media for not being woke enough is not activism and not bringing about change.
What makes Mr. Johar's case so much of a piece with this particular moment in India is that while he has been circumspect on his sexual orientation, he has, both in his life and his work, been breathtakingly explicit about sex: In 2013, he gave the Indian screen a smoldering gay kiss in Bombay Talkies; two years later, as roast master in a comic event that millions saw on YouTube, he joked before a live audience, with his mother present, of being the recipient of anal sex; in his new book, that same curious mixture of reticence and candor pervades. Mr. Johar will not use the male pronoun, but he writes openly and often movingly about everything from the pain of unreciprocated love to the aridity of having to pay for sex.
A maid in Stockholm at 13, a fashion model in 1930s Paris, unemployed and poverty-stricken in New York, torpedoed in World War II: Doris struggles like Job. But help always pops up in the nick of time. A fellow Swede on a New York bus offers a home; a sailor on a dark pier provides a disguise and a job on a ship to Europe; unexpected funds arrive in the mail. There is a slightly breezy overlooking of travel logistics and the realities of war, but the story is a colorful page-turner.
It's tainted money, she said. I don't want it.
I don't care what people say, because I know what I'm doing, and what I'm doing is to make life better for people. If everyone loves you, you're not doing anything. I have a strong center.
Conquering El Capitan, a 2,900-foot-tall sheer granite wall that looms over Yosemite National Park in California, seemed practically impossible given the limited tools and techniques available to alpinists of the day. The effort took the climbers 45 days, spread out over about a year and a half.
I want to turn to the visual evidence that prosecutors pointed to in their presentation of Officer Rolfe kicking Brooks's body once he had been shot. And I know that talking about the specifics of this is tricky for you. But you are a longtime officer. You train people. You're a union representative. That feels like a singular moment in all of this. And is that appropriate conduct ever appropriate conduct for an officer?

Well, for example, The Express covered a very similar incident, which is both women talking about their love of avocados. And the two headlines tell the tale. In the first headline about Kate, it says, Kate's Morning Sickness Cure. Prince William Gifted with an Avocado for Pregnant Duchess. Same story, same newspaper about Meghan Markle, and the headline is Meghan Markle's Beloved Avocado Linked to Human Rights Abuse and Drought. Millennial Shame.

Mr. Zwick was a second-year law student at Harvard when Ralph Nader, an alumnus, came to the campus in the late 1960s recruiting Nader's raiders to work on his citizen-advocacy projects. Mr. Zwick expressed interest, but Mr. Nader thought he was too immersed in school to be an immediate candidate.
KK: I want to ask you, you were the C.E.O. of Manhattan Prep. How does test prep — doesn't that contribute to income inequality in the United States?
JI: In that system, a lot of that money didn't actually go to treating tobacco-related health problems. A lot of it went to shoring up state budgets, and some of them even went to the tobacco industry actually, so I don't know if that's the best model.
None of the voters at his rallies in Iowa brought it up when I asked them what drew them to Buttigieg. They mostly raved about his intelligence.
The director Peter Bogdanovich had cast the girl, an acting novice, opposite her father, Ryan O'Neal, with whom he worked on the 1972 farce What's Up, Doc? At the time, O'Neal said he hoped the new movie would bring him closer to his restless daughter, who was estranged from her mother, the actress Joanna Moore. This was the first opportunity to try to channel her energy and mind into something constructive, he told People in 1974. And give her what she never had enough of — love.
Matthew Azimi, 36, had overdosed, not in an abandoned house or a dank basement, but in a faculty restroom at a special education high school in the Bronx. He taught there. His students, some of them severely disabled, had just been dismissed for the day.
Mr. Zhao, whose wife is Mr. Yuan's cousin, was portrayed by the defense as a well-adjusted and law-abiding man who had been provoked by an indecent proposal from Mr. Yuan asking to marry his daughter. Mr. Zhao did not have murderous intent, his lawyer said, despite the crime's violent aftermath, and so was guilty of manslaughter, not murder.
Yeah, sure. Sure, I can understand that. And I understand what you were saying. But we can do this all day long, but that's not helping anything. What we need to do is fix why it is the way that it is, and why people feel that way. Because if we try to prove and try to change that and make it better to where it's not that way, isn't it the same, whether it's a perception or reality?
She and her husband bought a three-bedroom, two-bath cottage on Diamond Street for $580,000. Like so many homes on Balboa Island, where candy-colored houses are packed tightly on streets named for gemstones, and pedestrians stroll in via a bridge or ride in on the ferry, it was small but charming, with easy access to Marine Avenue and the community's long, paved boardwalk. It became the family's summer home.
Racism is the key construct here in understanding why this sort of violence is possible. The other explanations would be the pathways through which racism creates these conditions. An individual experiences their standing in society as relative and comparative, so sometimes the gains of other groups feel like losses to Whites. Whites in the last 60 years have seen minoritized folks gain more political power, economic and educational opportunity. Even though these gains are grossly exaggerated, Whites experience them as a loss in group status.
Ms. Cunningham Agee attributes his erratic behavior to dementia. She said doctors had diagnosed Alzheimer's in 2014. His health deteriorated, and in mid-October she put him in an assisted living facility. She said that her husband was very conflicted and paranoid and that he had used the divorce filing — which would've divided up the couple's assets and allowed Mr. Agee to alter his estate planning — as a good tool to get out of assisted living. (The divorce was never finalized, which means the proceeding would be legally nullified.)
THE JOFFREY BALLET at the David H. Koch Theater (March 29, 7:30 p.m.; March 30, 7 p.m.; through April 2). In 1995 the Joffrey Ballet, formed in 1956 by Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino in New York, relocated to Chicago. The Joyce Theater Foundation welcomes the company, now under the artistic direction of Ashley Wheater, back to town with performances of two programs, Wednesday through April 2. Gracing one is an updated Romeo & Juliet by Krzysztof Pastor; the other, part of a gala on Thursday, is a mixed bill featuring Yuri Possokhov's Bells, Christopher Wheeldon's Fool's Paradise and Myles Thatcher's Body of Your Dreams. In Mr. Pastor's Romeo & Juliet, the feuding Capulets and Montagues come to life across three decades, from the 1930s to the '90s.

My father was married twice before I was born, once to a woman I met much later and once to my mother. When he asked me to speak in August at the reception of his third wedding, I believed it something I was incapable of doing: What could a son say about marriage to a father who had divorced twice, seeming to treat love as though it were seasonal?

Some of her politicking was of the shoe-leather, door-to-door variety. In Mr. Carter's 1976 campaign, she was part of the peanut brigade of volunteers that traveled to contested states. She did the same thing in later elections, including 2004, when she was 84, supporting Senator John Kerry's bid to unseat President George W. Bush. She opposed the tax breaks — a substantial one in her case — that Mr. Bush had given rich people like her.
His longtime partner, Ruth Kirchmeier, confirmed the death, at Martha's Vineyard Hospital. He lived on the Vineyard, in West Tisbury.
Mr. Yang's argument that he is pulling 10 percent or more of Trump supporters was not rated favorably on PolitiFact — the 10 percent figure comes from a July YouGov poll, and subsequent polls found the number to be lower.
And this is where Caldwell's account becomes unpersuasive in its turn. He depicts federal economic policymaking after the civil rights era as a hugely expensive attempt at integrating Americans by race and sex, a project paid for after Ronald Reagan by deficits rather than transfers. But as Wesley Yang points out in a review of The Age of Entitlement for The Washington Examiner, there's little evidence that American public policy actually transfers lots of money from whites to minorities; the spending that Reagan's deficits funded was for the military and old-age entitlements, both of which flowed far more into white pocketbooks than black ones. Nor were the economic policies that have arguably harmed working class whites the most somehow a necessary extension of civil rights legislation: China's entry into the World Trade Organization, to choose one signal example, was not somehow foreordained when L.B.J. set pen to paper.
Growing up on the prairies, I formed a vision of the American South based almost exclusively on James Dickey's Deliverance — first the 1970 novel and later the 1972 movie, Burt Reynolds heading deep into rural Georgia with three buddies to battle a landscape so bloody and beautiful it seemed an honor just to be there even as they tried desperately to escape. But it was another Dickey book, the sweet love letter to literature Metaphor as Pure Adventure, that taught me the pleasures of writing. One begins with the sensible world, which in its entirety is a gift, and a gift also in each of its parts, he proclaims. But there is a second gift that you give yourself, based on the world's great gift. . . . those pictures of the world inside one's head; pictures made of the real world but pictures that one owns, that one infuses with one's own personality. They are fragments of the world that live not with the world's life but with ours.
Did you come up for this?
There were hurdles, of course. At 8, Mr. Ratelle moved with his mother to Miami and, eventually, to Houston, where church attendance remained central to his life. He bridled at the rituals. I would say, 'No, I don't feel like washing that person's feet during communion.'
The children grow up. We learn how their parents' breakup has shaped their adult selves. But in Ties, no one has the last word. All the different truths are set before us, each given its due, each character fully realized, with the empathy and insight of a gifted novelist. Starnone's prose here is highly skilled without calling attention to itself. In this novel, unlike some of his others, the cleverness doesn't obstruct the emotional impact.
He has had a habit of saying outrageous things and then saying he was being sarcastic, he was kidding, that people shouldn't take him literally — and in fact, if you do, what an idiot you are, said Gwenda Blair, a biographer of the Trump family. It's both deniability for himself, but it's also deniability for his followers. He gives them something to hold onto so that they can then continue to believe in him.
The forced togetherness brought on by the pandemic has caused many relationships to become strained. However, others have found that time in lockdown has strengthened bonds.

The challenge is to move the Jewish state of mind beyond its past obsession with victimization, pain, and problems and point it in a new, more positive direction, capable of thriving in an open society. For unless we do, we may become the generation that witnesses the beginning of the end of one of the most influential civilizations in the history of our planet--a unique source of so much goodness, compassion, morality, creativity, and intelligence over the past several millennia. The demise of Jewish life as we have come to know it would be a tragedy not only for the Jewish people collectively, but also for most of us individually--and for the world at large.
By the numbers alone, New York City Ballet's Here/Now Festival is mind-blowing. Over the course of four weeks, the company is dancing 43 ballets by 22 choreographers. Even if that accounts for less than a quarter of the 230 works that more than 60 choreographers have made for the troupe since the death of its godlike founding choreographer, George Balanchine, in 1983, it's still an epic-size sample. No other ballet company in the world can approach these numbers.
When I voted against the war in Iraq, 80 percent of the people of California were really mad at me. But I knew it was the right thing. When I voted against the Defense of Marriage Act, people said, Oh my god, you're in so much trouble. Of course, everyone loves to be loved by everybody, especially in public life. It's not possible, if you're doing something.
A little vig, a little taste?
At times events in other churches could prompt a new spate of conversions. In the early 1890s, for example, a group of High Church Anglicans led by Lord Halifax raised the question of corporate reunion, the collective readmission of the Church of England into the Catholic Church. Hopes ran high among Anglo-Catholics for a time, but in 1896 Pope Leo XIII made a categorical declaration in the papal bull Apostolicae Curae that Anglican orders were invalid and that, in effect, there was nothing to discuss. In reaction a cluster of Anglican clergymen who had seen themselves as members of the worldwide Catholic communion and had been hoping for a different answer, resigned from their livings and converted to Catholicism. A push came for American Episcopal priests in 1908 when their church decided to inaugurate an open pulpits policy, permitting all varieties of Protestant ministers to preach in Episcopal churches. American Episcopalians who saw themselves as Anglo-Catholics revolted at the prospect, and here too the result was a large handful of conversions.
In Boerum Hill, the paper ghosts were not the only unwanted visitors to the Bergen Street townhouse. During the final walk-through of the property, Mr. Burns noticed that items that had been neatly stored in the basement had been tossed around. The frame of the door to the garden entrance looked damaged. Mr. Burns found his own shopping cart, which he had been using to ferry supplies from a nearby paint store to the house, was filled with someone else's personal items — potato chips, clothes, books and other odds and ends. Then he found luggage.
His wife, who now lives in Italy, did not respond to repeated attempts to reach her.
The president's allies have collected tens of thousands of dollars from people seeking pardons. The brisk market for pardons reflects the access peddling that has defined the Trump presidency as well as President Trump's unorthodox approach to exercising unchecked presidential clemency powers. Credit... Samuel Corum for The New York Times As President Trump prepares to leave office in days, a lucrative market for pardons is coming to a head, with some of his allies collecting fees from wealthy felons or their associates to push the White House for clemency, according to documents and interviews with more than three dozen lobbyists and lawyers. One lobbyist, Brett Tolman, a former federal prosecutor who has been advising the White House on pardons and commutations, has monetized his clemency work, collecting tens of thousands of dollars, and possibly more, in recent weeks to lobby the White House for clemency for the son of a former Arkansas senator; the founder of the notorious online drug marketplace Silk Road; and a Manhattan socialite who pleaded guilty in a fraud scheme. Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer John M. Dowd has marketed himself to convicted felons as someone who could secure pardons because of his close relationship with the president, accepting tens of thousands of dollars from a wealthy felon and advising him and other potential clients to leverage Mr. Trump's grievances about the justice system. A onetime top adviser to the Trump campaign was paid $50,000 to help seek a pardon for John Kiriakou, a former C.I.A.
Our economy is breaking down on all levels. Again, if you are fortunate enough to graduate from college today, you're in the top third of the population, you're graduating with tens of thousands in school loans very, very often, and there's a 40 to 44 percent chance you're going to do a job that does not require your college degree. That's if you're one of the winners in our society today. I spent seven years working with, frankly, some of the top educational products in our country. I saw that even the winners are not winning right now. And so imagine if you're a nonwinner, what this looks like.
He brought dozens of musicians and singers into the studio to perform together, doubling parts for heft and impact and pushing mixes to the brink of distortion, to create his Wall of Sound. He gathered songwriters who could convincingly capture female longing and desire for his girl groups to deliver. And he found singers — many of them ambitious Black teenagers — who would supercharge those songs with gospel spirit.

August 27, 1974 OBITUARY Daring Lindbergh Attained the Unattainable With Historic Flight Across Atlantic By ALDEN WHITMAN In Paris at 10:22 P.M. on May 21, 1927, Charles Augustus Lindbergh, a one-time Central Minnesota farm boy, became an international celebrity. A fame enveloped the 25-year-old American that was to last him for the remainder of his life, transforming him in a frenzied instant from an obscure aviator into a historical figure. The consequences of this fame were to exhilarate him, to involve him in profound grief, to engage him in fierce controversy, to turn him into an embittered fugitive from the public, to accentuate his individualism to the point where he became a loner, to give him a special sense of his own importance, to allow him to play an enormous role in the growth of commercial aviation as well as to be a figure in missile and space technology, to give him influence in military affairs, and to raise a significant voice for conservation, a concern that marked his older years. All these things were touched off when a former stunt flier and airmail pilot touched down the wheels of his small and delicate monoplane, the Spirit of St. Louis, on the tarmac of LeBourget 33 1/2 hours after having lifted the craft off Roosevelt Field on Long Island.
Although some genetic experts question the accuracy of such tests to pinpoint geographical ancestry, the molecular genealogist Diahan Southard said that the results are usually on the mark, save for some exceptions. The ethnicity breakdown you receive from a testing company relies heavily on the people the company is comparing you against, she said. If you are from France, but your company hasn't tested very many French people, they aren't going to do a very good job with your breakdown.
Below: an incomplete account of the material trappings of Undine's costly lifestyle, in which several experts estimate, to the best of their abilities, how much various items may have cost. Though there are a number of clues in The Custom of the Country as to the precise years in which the novel takes place, we settled on 1908 as our point of comparison, which was the year Edith Wharton began writing the novel in earnest.
In response to announcements about Mr. Trump's planned cuts to State Department funding, retired generals wrote a letter to lawmakers citing Secretary of Defense James Mattis's 2013 comment, If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately.

After the rampage at the Capitol, Twitter updated its civic integrity policy to aggressively increase our enforcement action on misleading and false claims about the presidential election, the platform said. Several days after the riot, Twitter said it had suspended more than 70,000 accounts — though in many of those instances one person operated multiple accounts — that promoted QAnon-associated content and were primarily dedicated to spreading the conspiracy theory. After the Capitol riot, other platforms also moved to cut off Mr. Trump and others making false claims about the election. Facebook blocked the president from its platforms through at least the end of his term.
Federal authorities are said to be looking into Bitcoin donations made to people who breached the Capitol last week. Supporters of President Trump were forced off the Capitol grounds after a mob breached the building on Jan. 6. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times Federal authorities are investigating several Bitcoin donations made to right-wing figures ahead of the assault on the Capitol last week, according to a person briefed on the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly about it. A single donor from France appears to have sent around $500,000 in Bitcoin in early December to several figures involved in far right activist circles, according to an investigation published Thursday by the cryptocurrency data firm Chainalysis. Authorities are looking into whether the donations were linked to the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. The existence of the investigation was first reported by Yahoo News. The single largest donation that Chainalysis found, which was worth around $250,000 at the time, went to a Bitcoin wallet owned by Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist who was at the Capital building on Jan. 6 and who called for violence before the event. Mr. Fuentes has previously mocked journalists on Twitter who asked him about his involvement in the event. Other donations went to the right-wing social media network Gab and the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, Chainalysis said. By Jan. 6, the value of the donations had grown because of the soaring price of Bitcoin.
We've been waiting for this moment for 20 years, since the Fusion, and we're very excited, said Juan Carlos Aviles, 32, a youth soccer coach, referring to the Miami Fusion, the previous M.L.S. team based here. That club was folded in 2001 after years of poor attendance, the same year that the Tampa Bay Mutiny, another M.L.S. franchise, folded.
Unlike universal basic income, a system that would provide some cash to every person regardless of income level, a negative income tax system would give cash to people below a certain income threshold. Milton Friedman made the case for the tax as a poverty alleviation tool in his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom.
In this latest book, the scales are even bigger because among other things it's a book about climate change, which is one of the biggest scales. … Yes, the world is ending, but also you wake up in the morning and touch base with your brother over text to make sure he and the baby are doing O.K., and both of those are real and both of those are happening, Jamison continues. One of the challenges of writing about climate change is how to take this thing that is essentially on a larger scale than our minds can hold and how to make it a narrative that our minds can hold. … Climate change isn't quite on a human scale, but narrative is on a human scale, so how do you translate that?
We have to be working toward China's second main priority, which is maintaining robust economic growth. So there are two goals. There are two primary goals that are sometimes in tension, of maintaining social order and maintaining robust economic growth. And the best way we can try and contain their behavior in Hong Kong is to say, Look, the economic costs are going to be very, very high. And the best way we can do that is to build global consensus around certain norms and behaviors.

I've been asked, 'Have you been to a bunch of parties? Do you feel like you have a fever? When was the last time you made out with someone? How many people have you been hanging out with?' she said. You want to date someone who has asked these questions and has gone ahead and gotten a test for you. It's so related to what you want in a person.

In Lind's account, Caldwell's story about the advance of social liberalism through bureaucratic and judicial power is just a subsidiary of the more important story, the post-1970s consolidation of economic power by a managerial upper class. The liberalism of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama isn't an ideology of white disempowerment, in his account, so much as a solvent that weakens any institution — from churches and families to union shops and local industries — that might grant real power to groups outside the gilded city, the Silicon Valley bubble, the Ivy League gate. And together with its center-right partner in crime, Reagan-Thatcher libertarianism, this liberalism's policy choices — economic and social permissiveness, effectively conjoined — created a new class divide, between thriving meritocratic hubs and a declining and demoralized heartland, that explains both the frequency of populist irruptions and their consistent futility.
As my colleagues have reported, for much of the encounter, Brooks cooperated with police.
We should have 18-year term limits, increase the number of justices, make it so it's predictable that you lose an election, the other party might get one or two justices, and then we don't need to literally be monitoring the health of our justices. Or, the most ridiculous thing is you're literally looking at the age of the person you're appointing being, Ooh, this person will be there for 30, 40 years. What kind of system do you want where you're having a society decide 30 years ago what women's rights are today? Doesn't make any sense.
KK: Think you might be overly optimistic. Maybe we'll move on to foreign policy, if you don't mind?
It's obviously much harder. I'm all about trying to maximize the possible. And so, if we don't get a majority — I expect the Democrats will win a slight majority in the Senate. I'm very optimistic that way, but we're going to get done what we can get done with the branch of the government we have control of. And I will say too, I believe that we can get some things done that are traditionally bipartisan, regardless of who has control of the Senate. To me, I cannot believe that we did not get infrastructure done during the first couple of years of the Trump administration. I thought at least he would build some bridges and roads, and I was even willing to accept the Trump name on those bridges and roads if it got some bridges and roads built. I was, At least we're going to get this.
MICHEL PICCOLI at Film Forum (March 16-22). It's a tad cute to ascribe symmetry to the career of the French star Michel Piccoli, but one can draw a line from his work in Contempt (on Saturday) — the 1964 Jean-Luc Godard masterpiece in which he plays a screenwriter whose marriage disintegrates during a production of The Odyssey — to I'm Going Home (on Thursday), Manoel de Oliveira's 2002 portrait of a grieving theater actor near the end of his life, vexed after being abruptly cast in a film production of James Joyce's Ulysses. Film Forum's retrospective goes heavy on marquee directors: It features Mr. Piccoli's collaborations with Luis Buñuel (Diary of a Chambermaid, showing on Tuesday), Jacques Demy (Une Chambre en Ville, on Sunday, and The Young Girls of Rochefort, on Sunday and Tuesday) and Marco Ferreri (Dillinger Is Dead, on Wednesday and March 23, and La Grande Bouffe, from Saturday to Monday and on Thursday), plus another chance to catch the recent revival of Jacques Rivette's great La Belle Noiseuse (on Monday).
The artist Georgia O'Keeffe said, Nobody sees a flower — really — it is so small it takes time — we haven't time — and to see takes time, like to have a friend takes time. What most people want from marriage is an intimate friend. The key to lasting love is taking time to understand and respond.

Though I care deeply about the survival of the Jewish people, I do not believe that survival is assured by any biblical imperative or divine promise. I approach the issue of Jewish survival as I would any other important empirical challenge: with an open mind ready and willing to accept any pragmatic solution, or combination of solutions, that will work. I am committed to doing whatever is in my power to help ensure the Jewish future. I know that many Jews feel the same way.
Gene Reynolds, an Emmy-winning producer and director who was a force behind two of the most acclaimed television series of the 1970s and early '80s, M*A*S*H and Lou Grant, died on Monday in Burbank, Calif. He was 96.
I have said that I am used to being around dead bodies. But I took a full hot flush when I saw Jennifer Rockwell, glazed naked on the chair, her mouth open, her eyes still moist, wearing an expression of childish surprise. The surprise light not heavy, as if she had come across something she'd lost and no longer expected to find. And not quite naked. Oh my. She'd done it with a towel turbaned around her head, like you do to dry your hair. But now of course the towel was wet through and solid red and looked as though it weighed more than any living woman could carry.
An ocean of innuendo has always surrounded Mr. Johar's sexuality. He has done more than anybody to introduce the idea of homosexuality into the Indian home. It would seem no closet door was better primed to spring open than his. And yet when he tries the latch, he finds it sticks. The only time I'm tight-lipped is when I'm asked about my sexuality, he writes in his recently published memoir, An Unsuitable Boy. It's the only part of me I feel I've caged.
Everybody knows that the easiest way to boost the sales of a book is to put a particular familiar word in its title. That word, of course, is Constitution. Geoffrey R. Stone is a professor and former dean at the University of Chicago, and his title is a bit of a tease. There is virtually nothing about the Constitution in this book until Page 263, and even then, it is only to say, Don't get too excited yet. Until the 1950s, Stone reports, the Supreme Court had little to say about the possible relevance of the Constitution to laws dealing with such issues as obscenity, contraception, abortion and homosexuality. Stone concedes, though he might not regard it as a concession, that the general assumption was that government could legitimately — and constitutionally — forbid behavior that the majority deemed immoral.

This is a much more structural, long-term crisis, Mr. Fink writes in the letter. He said he had come to that conclusion after talking with business leaders and scientists and having BlackRock model the economic effects of climate change.
JW: Right, but you're talking about expanding the court, too, and if you expand the court, as you say correctly, that it's a federal law, there's nothing in the Constitution about the number of justices. You expand it to 13, the next Republican who comes in, who is furious about women having too many reproductive rights, will expand it to 17 to overturn the rulings you just got.

One night, after one of these songs ended, I found myself writing a story about our story's end. I wrote it on an empty envelope that had been addressed to us as I sat by our records and the map on the wall. As I was cutting a pizza, I wondered idly who would get the pizza slicer. I thought about how I would make eggs only for one. As I wrote, I felt as if I were on the outside looking in, making a decision without being a part of it. Being on the inside would have hurt too much.
I mean, the question is what trade-offs you're willing to make, really. The N.S.A. is going to be able to recruit the tech talent that he can recruit and you want to try and ramp that up. So one thing ——

Ms. Tennant found her footing in the early 1970s after discovering writers whose anti-realist qualities dovetailed with her own love of myth, magic and dream. In 1980 she told the reference work World Authors:
As for hormones and menopause, I have treated many women in their 70s and 80s whose sex lives were more active and satisfying than those of women in their 30s and 40s. If problems arise, topics including sexual desire, frequency, pornography, a lack of desire and open marriage need to be discussed openly and honestly.
This was November 2018, and the Camp Fire, the most destructive wildfire in California history, was making swift and smoky headway through the Sierra Nevada foothills. It took fewer than four hours to rip through this town of 26,000 residents, reducing schools, businesses, and 11,000 homes into piles of smoldering ash. When Mr. Singer got the evacuation order, he believed it was another false alarm. But he peeled out of his driveway as flames licked his yard, making it out of town with minutes to spare.

At the end of the tunnel, connected by a belt to Lisa and Rae, Naum Kushner faltered. I told my children: 'You are young, go save yourself, leave me here,'  he was quoted in Nechama Tec's Defiance as saying. One of my daughters had an onion and an apple. She smeared the onion over my face and I felt better.8 The sting woke him up. He kept moving. Chanon Kushner was not so lucky. He and the other leaders of the escape became disoriented when they exited the tunnel in the driving rain. There was delirium in being free, out beyond the ghetto walls. The boys became confused and started to run in different directions. The next day, the enraged Nazis found Chanon and the others, and shot them. This was the second time the Nazis had shot Chanon and left him for dead. This time, he did not survive.
Freshwater builds slowly, but that only crystallizes how fractured Ada and her personalities are. As the voices in her head get louder and grow hungrier, the story gains momentum. Only when Ada looks to her roots is there hope that she will wrest back control from her tormentors. For both the reader and Ada, that comes as a revelation, if not quite a relief.
And, boy, does Grand Horizons want to sell itself as comedy. Not witty comedy with its verbal arabesques, nor intellectual comedy with its Paris Review name-checks, nor meta-comedy with its scrambled plotlines — but the vanilla kind that once dominated commercial theater. It's not entirely meant as praise to say that this Second Stage production is a big-laugh, blue-joke, bourgeois lark of the type Neil Simon mastered until the times mastered him and the genre petered out.

KK: Oh, sorry, I just wanted to ask you, you know, there are some people who would suggest that a better use of money, instead of giving a Freedom Dividend, would be to dramatically overhaul America's high schools and start teaching people different skills instead of trying to continue the race against A.I. Why isn't that a path? Why couldn't we instead change how we do education in this country?

Maybe you're asking: Why should anyone get away with being a racist or sexist jerk? What gives Mr. Alexie, accused of hitting on women who saw him as a mentor, and Mr. Díaz, accused of forcibly kissing someone, the right to have their books published? Or even: Why should opinion writers be allowed to gratuitously insult duly elected officials? If a loudmouth suffers from a backlash, this reasoning goes, he probably deserves it.
I am a police. That may sound like an unusual statement--or an unusual construction. But it's a parlance we have.

I am a police and my name is Detective Mike Hoolihan. And I am a woman, also.

Bob was so out there, recalled Susan Weil, a native Manhattanite who met him in Paris as an art student at the Académie Julian in the summer after she finished high school. He was 22 and studying on the G.I. Bill. In the fall, he followed her to Black Mountain College. They married in 1950 and moved to West 95th Street, into a cramped studio apartment. The MoMA show will open with their collaborations — namely, the so-called blueprints, life-size photograms in which their bodies appear as white silhouettes bathed against a Prussian blue background.
If you look at our proposals, we have a tax on financial transactions, which would obviously end up falling most heavily on the wealthiest Americans and the wealthiest companies. We have a carbon tax, which tends to fall most heavily on the wealthiest industries, which are emitting a lot. The value-added tax would obviously be enormously generative from people who benefit from society and consume the most. I'm for trying to restore our income tax levels to previous levels to be more progressive.
Young couples, thankfully, did not heed that panicky call to preserve issei purity. As Professor Williams told me, Japanese-Americans marry out far more than other Asian-Americans. In the 2010 census, more than 460,000 of 1.3 million Japanese-Americans identified themselves as multiracial. The trend puts Japanese-Americans on the brink of becoming the first Asian-American group that is mostly racially mixed.
So that's what we mean when we say America is exceptional. Not that our nation has been flawless from the start, but that we have shown the capacity to change, and make life better for those who follow.

Fans who find their way back will be rewarded with another elaborate story line, across 12 episodes, tied to the tortured relationship between Ciro (Marco D'Amore) and Genny (Salvatore Esposito), whose bond endures even though Ciro pumped Genny full of lead at the end of Season 1. They join forces once again and find themselves being den mothers to a hungry young gang at the bottom of the criminal pecking order in Naples, a circumstance that jibes with the show's penchants for junk-strewn locations and ragged formations of motorcycles.
As the anniversary of the world's first coronavirus lockdown nears, China scrubs the history of any mistakes. Visitors attend the museum at Wuhan Parlor Convention Center Dec. 31, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Credit... Tingshu Wang/Reuters At a museum in Wuhan, China, a sprawling exhibition paints a stirring tale of how the city's sacrifices in a brutal 76-day lockdown led to triumph over the coronavirus and, ultimately, rebirth. But the exhibition may be most striking for what is not included about the experiences of the city where the virus first came to the world's attention. For example, visitors are invited to lay a virtual chrysanthemum at a wall of martyrs that includes Li Wenliang, the ophthalmologist at a Wuhan hospital whose death from the virus led to nationwide mourning. But missing from his brief biography is a crucial fact: that Dr. Li was reprimanded by the government for warning colleagues about the virus. China has spent much of the past year trying to spin a narrative of the coronavirus pandemic as an undisputed victory led by the ruling Communist Party. As life in the city, and most of the country, has returned to normal, the state-run news media has largely ignored the government's missteps.
This simplest of smoothies, fairly thick, deliciously tart-sweet and fragrant, makes no claims of enhancing your immune system, ridding your face of wrinkles or saving your marriage. Made with high-quality Alphonso mangoes and Ronnybrook Farm yogurt, this new mango lassi is made by Monsieur Singh — a company founded by Karan Gera, an entrepreneur — with Ronnybrook. Previously, Mr. Gera produced and sold frozen lassi in pints. The new drink is satisfying enough to tide you over when breakfast or lunch are given short shrift. You could sip it alongside a meal, or pour some like an affogato over mango sorbet for dessert. The eight-ounce serving has 160 calories.

No matter what the age of its author, 'The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter' would be a remarkable book, Feld started. When one reads that Carson McCullers is a girl of 22 it becomes more than that. Maturity does not cover the quality of her work. It is something beyond that, something more akin to the vocation of pain to which a great poet is born.
In contrast, Fidler begins his story more conventionally, with the Romans and, to be more precise, with his son, Joe, in Rome's Capitoline Museum, admiring the colossal head of Constantine, the man who made Constantinople both the capital of the Roman Empire and a Christian metropolis. While Hughes's tone is both scholarly and rich in visual detail, Fidler entertains us with novelistic vignettes and cut-and-paste erudition, though he wobbles a little here and there. In a timeline that precedes the main narrative we are informed, for example, that the city was renamed Istanbul in 1453. In fact, the Ottomans kept the name Kostantiniyye in official usage until the dissolution of their empire in 1923, and the two names were used in parallel fashion by court officials. Istanbul, in any case, comes from the common Greek expression eis tin polin, into the city, and was a word used by both Turks and Greeks long before Mehmet's conquest. As always with this great hybrid city, the continuities have as much force as the momentous changes. That said, Fidler displays great charm in the telling of his tale, spicing it with delicious gossip.

Our economy is breaking down on all levels. Again, if you are fortunate enough to graduate from college today, you're in the top third of the population, you're graduating with tens of thousands in school loans very, very often, and there's a 40 to 44 percent chance you're going to do a job that does not require your college degree. That's if you're one of the winners in our society today. I spent seven years working with, frankly, some of the top educational products in our country. I saw that even the winners are not winning right now. And so imagine if you're a nonwinner, what this looks like.

At the reception, guests were all given a copy of the puzzle at their seats, but Will Shortz also let me borrow one of the big whiteboards he uses at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament for the event. As guests completed their grids, I invited them to come up and fill something in, because doesn't every recreational solver want to feel like a finalist at a crossword tournament, even if just for a moment?
In hindsight, this was not an accurate assessment of the next question.
Well, it sounds like you've been there.
In opera, the drumbeat of time is written on — and in — the body. Vocal cords grow brittle; high notes start to quaver; low tones hollow out. Singers have to retire the roles of their youth, and eventually retire altogether.
For decades in this chaparral-covered ecosystem, it's been a ritual: after the burn comes the rebuild. But as the nation's most populous state stares down a seething climate crisis, one that cranked temperatures into triple digits last fall and set off a series of infernos that exploded, into bone dry air, the rebuilding process is beginning to look different.
It was tough to fight those battles.
Another elusive yet important issue for a project of this kind is the question of the relationship between truth and intellectual respectability. The convert intellectuals were aware, in many cases, that what they believed to be true was not regarded by non-Catholics as plausible or reasonable or, indeed, respectable. On some points both groups could agree, of course, and the convert writers' intention was to make a closer fit between Catholic truth and intellectual respectability. At any given moment in the era from about 1825 to 1962, Catholic intellectuals knew that a range of ideas was considered respectable in the two nations. They also knew that some Catholic ideas sat comfortably inside this area and others remained well beyond its boundaries. Their job, as they saw it, was to drag the recalcitrant Catholics into the realm of the respectable, while trying to shift the zone of respectable ideas in the society at large, in order that Catholic truth and respectable ideas might coincide more fully. They wanted to convince Protestant and atheist contemporaries that much of their work was in error or based on fallacious premises, encouraging them to become more Catholic and more intellectually respectable.
As part of a plea deal, she acknowledged guilt on one count of larceny and was sentenced to four to eight years. She served four (1990-94).
AH: But do you think, I mean, he never truly apologized. He just said, I'm sorry you're offended. And while you may not have felt that way, there were other jokes he made about just Asian-Americans and Asian people in general, and there were other people who were obviously affected by this. So I mean, what kind of consequences do you think someone who makes those kinds of statements and who doesn't show any sort of remorse for it, should they face? If not firing, what should happen? What would the steps be?
Mr. Kelly's brothers discuss their childhood in Chicago, including how Mr. Kelly was sexually abused by a family member and a family acquaintance.
Taryn Cornick was 19 when her sister, Beatrice, was murdered, and her rage and grief over that loss have shaped her life: her distance from her famous-actor father, her marriage to a wealthy older man, and her strange, brief intimacy with a Canadian wilderness guide she calls the Muleskinner. Several years later, Taryn is the successful author of a book called The Feverish Library, about the dangers faced by collections of books over centuries. It includes anecdotes about the Firestarter: a locked scroll box that is said to have survived no fewer than five fires in famous libraries.
It was a year unlike any other, as the coronavirus brought most of the world to a standstill in 2020. While the wedding industry suffered immensely, life went on, and people still fell in love, proposed and got married no matter.

East Wind is what its 72 residents call an intentional community, a modern descendant of the utopian colonies and communes of centuries past where individuals share everything from meals, chores and living space to work, income, domestic responsibilities and the burden of self-governance. The term intentional community dates to the late 1940s, when the Inter-Community Exchange — an organization formed in Yellow Springs, Ohio, in the wake of World War II to help promote peaceful, cooperative living arrangements (in the hope of eradicating war altogether) — changed its name to the Fellowship of Intentional Communities; the founders felt the new title better conveyed the deliberateness with which these groups were assembling. The members of East Wind, for example, range in age from infancy to 76: Some have lived here for more than three decades, but around half of the population is part of a new wave, people in their late 20s and early 30s who joined in the last four years. These newer residents moved to East Wind to wean themselves off fossil fuels, grow their own food, have a greater say in how their society is run and live in less precarious financial circumstances.
According to a 2018 defense motion, the woman who told the authorities that Mr. Weinstein had raped her in March 2013, who has not been identified, sent him an email on April 11, 2013 saying: I hope to see you sooner rather than later.
The SAT was first administered in 1926 and evolved out of a test used for admission to Princeton University and Cooper Union. It was inspired by military experiments with I.Q. testing.
They fetched their coats and we drove downtown. Miriam stayed in the car with Johnny Mac. Colonel Tom made the ID leaning on a freezer door in the ME's office on Battery and Jeff.
Now he is having second thoughts.
That an intricate discussion of sex and morality was being conducted by 40 men and one woman who have taken vows of celibacy is a stark reminder of a major difficulty facing the Catholic Church in America: how can a celibate clergy persuade sexually active lay people to allow the church to regulate their sex lives? For while American Catholics tend to believe and accept the church's teaching on most doctrinal issues, according to Gallup polls, more than 80 percent of them, in defiance of doctrine, approve of artificial contraception, two-thirds say that premarital sex is morally acceptable (among Catholics under 35, the figure is as high as 9 out of 10), nearly half say that homosexual activity can be morally acceptable and roughly half say that abortion (excluding late-term partial birth abortions) should be legal in many or all cases. In addition, most American Catholics would support a married clergy, and most approve of the notion of female priests. 'Any time Jerry hooked up with some girl in ''Seinfeld,'' we knew they were sleeping together,' Magat says. 'Should I find these things funny? This is the stuff I'm going to be preaching against!' Magat stopped watching 'Seinfeld,' but kept track of what was happening to the very end from nonseminary friends.
In New York during the 1970s one popular T-shirt, using the Yiddish word for a female gossip, brandished the slogan Proust Is a Yenta!
Howard said that Officer Rolfe's life was never in danger.
Well to me, playing the relative benefit game, I mean of course in any large scale national program, it's you can't calibrate it precisely to everyone's individual situation. To me the test is more, is that person going to be better off tomorrow than they are today?
The cause was complications of pneumonia, his company, All American Racers, said in a statement.
JI: Sure. But to Binya's point, it's still a trade-off. So, if I'm on food stamps, I'm getting less of a benefit than, say, Jesse, who's not on food stamps.
Mr. Trump canceled a planned news conference at a NATO gathering in December after a video circulated that showed world leaders including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Emmanuel Macron of France in what appeared to be a conversation mocking Mr. Trump.
How were Mr. Bezos's texts released into the wild? Was his phone hacked? If so, why was he not using encryption? If he did protect his online selfies, did someone somehow get screenshots of them and send them around until one of the recipients dropped a dime to The Enquirer? If so, is anyone safe?
Yeah, they lean into it, as opposed to distance themselves.
I have a feeling people will forget that and then be right back there after a while, once everyone's vaccinated and the pandemic has ended or is close to ending.
The SAT was first administered in 1926 and evolved out of a test used for admission to Princeton University and Cooper Union. It was inspired by military experiments with I.Q. testing.
Still, life is what we have. To give less than everything to it is dereliction. In the end its wonder is unimaginable without the presence of death. As the dew dispels, the mist dissolves, and the sap rises on a morning such as the one that did not quite win over Beckett, the force of life is unmistakable. That is what put us here in the first place.
Carme Chacón, Spain's first female defense minister and a leading Socialist politician, was found dead on Sunday at her home in Madrid. She was 46.
In early January, the one serving Jacksonville was closed for a few hours, causing delays and flight cancellations. Last month, the center that serves the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport closed for several hours after an employee tested positive. The F.A.A. declared a ground stop, halting all departing flights. The closure caused ripples of delays and diverted flights across the country.
Well, it sounds like you've been there.
When detectives approached her on East 43rd Street to make the arrest, she ran and had to be caught and pinned on a car hood to be handcuffed. She thought the three detectives were muggers, she said later.

I need the attention. I wake up every day and say, 'Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the baddest bounty hunter of them all?,' he said, with a conspiratorial arched eyebrow before turning serious: I need love.
In the first chapter of this book, I focus on what is probably the most whispered-about subject among American Jews today: intermarriage and how to cope with this growing reality. I try to bring this controversial subject out of the closet in all its dimensions. I do not moan and groan and wring my hands. I do not present a religious agenda. I explore the issue from both a demographic and a personal perspective, in an effort to understand it and deal with it instructively and realistically. My analysis and conclusions will be controversial and will, I hope, stimulate a debate within the Jewish community and beyond. My goal is to ask all the hard questions, and to provide a wide variety of responses in addition to my own. I know that many readers will disagree with me, but I hope they will not be able to ignore the challenges I pose.
MR. DAWSON Did you have a gun?
Ms. Zang quickly made her way to Kitchen Zinc's fancier sister restaurant, and spotted Ms. Reville waiting. The mistake didn't damper their chemistry — after introducing themselves, they fell into an easy banter, debating the merits of professional sports and talking about Ms. Zang's summer working at the Maryland Attorney General's Office.
The flow of conversions in Britain and America between the mid-1840s and the late 1950s was sufficient to indicate the continuing allure of Catholicism, but it was hardly large enough to throw non-Catholic intellectuals into a panic. Although Newman was widely admired and stimulated other members of the Oxford Movement to follow his example, he was unable to lead his own brother into the Catholic fold, and most of his erstwhile followers, including the other movement leaders, Nathan Pusey and John Keble, remained staunch Anglicans. As in Britain, so in the United States. Orestes Brownson, a member of the Transcendentalist circle, carried his family and a few friends into the embrace of Rome in 1844 but not his twin or his other siblings. Most of his New England cronies, accustomed to Brownson's frequent changes of opinion, treated him as a mercurial spirit who had finally stepped off the edge of the world rather than as a role model. Among them, only Isaac Hecker and the group who later founded the Paulist fathers went with Brownson to Rome.

Charlie Warzel: You were talking about data and that's a good segue into some of the — I mean, you're probably the candidate who sort of runs on understanding the internet better than anyone right now. And I'm curious first about this worldwide data organization. For someone like China, wouldn't it actually be better for them to sort of hoard that data and hoard that information and keep that closed system?
Ms. Culp, 38, a Los Angeles-based freelance writer and producer, recalled suffering from jet lag that day as she had flown home two days earlier from Shanghai, where she spent a decade living and working as a journalist, art curator and consultant. She wrote for The South China Morning Post, and served as a consultant for cultural projects and institutions. I read his book and thought, 'Wow, this guy is an amazing writer,' said Ms. Culp, who graduated from Yale.
Mm-hmm. And I agree with that.
Throughout, Aldrich has been supported by Pauline (Alison Wright, who plays Martha on The Americans), his right-hand lady (as she calls herself), script-reader and assistant, cheerleader and troubleshooter. In the second side arc in the episode, Pauline rises to the forefront, speaking the first line after the credits sequence when she compliments the editor on his seamless job piecing together the beach scene in Baby Jane. Pauline has a secret. She has written a script for Crawford and wants to direct it. In this risky pioneering pursuit, she recruits Crawford's right-hand lady, Mamacita, asking for advice on how to approach the star. Mamacita's reaction to such an unorthodox idea is unexpected, leading to a hugely entertaining scene in which she lectures Pauline on census information in the United States. Women will someday outnumber men, Mamacita informs an astonished Pauline, and Hollywood will have to respond by catering to that majority.
That, too, was new to me, as I started to use not only my eyes, but my ears and even my nose, to pay attention: to see, to hear and to smell the world around me.

Uber is literally advertising to schoolteachers saying, Hey, we've figured out schoolteachers make really good Uber drivers. And if you look at that situation, the headline unemployment rate says, Check, this person is employed. Heck, this person might be employed twice. The headline unemployment rate when Donald Trump was running for president, he castigated it as fake news, and then he got into office and all the sudden it became real news. He was right the first time. The number is almost intentionally designed to obscure any of the difficulties in the labor market. If I drop out of the labor market, I no longer count. I actually help the number.
JI: In that system, a lot of that money didn't actually go to treating tobacco-related health problems. A lot of it went to shoring up state budgets, and some of them even went to the tobacco industry actually, so I don't know if that's the best model.
Walking away from her son's elementary school one morning, Lizzie thinks: The problem with Eli's school is it's not on a human scale. The same could be said of writing about climate change: The subject isn't on a human scale. Our minds can reckon with it, but how do we ask our child-size human hearts to hold it — to be productively overwhelmed by it? If I responded more strongly to Dept. of Speculation than to Weather, it might be a testament to the narrative dilemma the new novel is reckoning with: the scale of its ambition, despite its brevity, in its attempt to tell a story about climate change that carries the same visceral force as our private emotional dramas — that is, in fact, inseparable from them. It's quite possible I'm just as much a solipsist as the red-faced man in the novel who listens to a lecture about melting glaciers and then asks, But what's going to happen to the American weather?
A report released by PEN America in November found that more than 1,800 local print outlets have closed since 2004, and at least 200 counties have no newspaper.
In a country that cannot come to a consensus on fundamental questions — how restricted capitalism should be, whether immigrants are a burden or a boon, to what extent the legacy of slavery continues to shape American life — textbook publishers are caught in the middle. On these questions and others, classroom materials are not only shaded by politics, but are also helping to shape a generation of future voters.

The judge overseeing the trial, Justice James M. Burke, told Mr. Weinstein's defense lawyers that they could talk about the emails during opening statements but could not show copies of them to the jury.
That's why something like world data organization is so vital. When they had to join the W.T.O. [World Trade Organization], they realized this was going to be vital to their economic growth, so they're going to have to make some decisions and compromises in order to join the world order. We can create an analogous situation for data and technology and then use that to try and curb some of their worst abuses and behaviors. Now, is this going to happen in time to help Hong Kong? I certainly hope so. I mean, I certainly hope that they don't flood the streets of Hong Kong with troops any time in the next number of days or weeks.
OK, I know. I know. I feel terrible. I know, to the mobster.
'We're a Package Deal at This Point'
These forces have dramatically eroded the earnings power, employment stability, social stature, and marriage market value of non-college men. The ensuing dysfunction touches not just in earnings and employment but also male idleness, dysfunctional and destructive behavior (e.g., drug and alcohol abuse), and the erosion of two-parent families, which, research suggests, facilitate children in becoming successful adults.

Tell us about the last great book you read.
I am reminded of the story of the two Jews reading their newspapers over a cup of coffee in a late-nineteenth-century Viennese cafe. Kurt is reading the liberal Yiddish-language newspaper and shaking his head from side to side, uttering soft moans of Oy vey and Vey is meir. Shmulie is reading the right-wing, anti-Semitic German-language tabloid and smiling. Kurt, noticing what Shmulie is reading, shouts at his friend, Why are you reading that garbage? Shmulie responds, When I used to take your newspaper, all I would ever read about was Dreyfus being falsely accused, the Jews of Russia being subjected to pogroms, anti-Semitic laws being enacted all over Europe, and the grinding poverty of the Jews in the Holy Land. Now, ever since I take this paper, I read about how the Jews control the banks, the press, the arts; how Jews hold all political power behind the scenes; and how we will soon take over the world. Wouldn't you rather read such good news than such bad news?
In our conflict-averse culture we don't necessarily think of these skills as part of romance. But I've seen how the best marriages involve people who can deal with strong negative emotions — and who are cleareyed about how hard it can be. They don't avoid anger, but they don't indulge it. They tackle hard issues without shutting down. They apologize for their own bad behavior.
archived recording — that somebody who's made her life in those sorts of films, been married before, comes over and has to become an active member of a very, very traditional family. I, I think that could be quite difficult.
workers worry about being exposed to the virus, then bringing it home to their families and getting severe symptoms, said Brian Moore, the central region director of the Arizona Ambulance Association. This whole thing has put a lot of fear in folks who are on the front lines, Mr. Moore said. Emergency medical service dilemmas are particularly acute in Los Angeles County, where understaffed hospitals are overwhelmed and a Covid-related death happens every eight minutes. The nation's most populous county has urged ambulance crews not to take people they cannot resuscitate to hospitals. The county's memo on the matter reflected a relatively small change from its previous policy, which already discouraged emergency personnel from transporting most people whose heartbeats could not be restored. But after the memo gained widespread attention, medics felt compelled to post on social media to try to quell anxieties that they believed were unfounded. Kari Dickerson, a paramedic in Kentucky who tweets as @MedicTrommasher, said the memo had particularly alarmed people of color, who have been disproportionately harmed by the pandemic. She said she worried that her fellow workers could face wrenching situations whenever they broke the news that someone had died, perhaps causing families to wonder: Did they do this on purpose, did they not work as hard as they would have for somebody that looks like them? An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the day the United States reported its single-day record for Covid-19 deaths. It was Thursday. Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio and
Described in a 2014 Esquire profile as a human Energizer bunny, Mr. Bernstein was writing, teaching and generating screenplay ideas well into his 90s. Until recently, he had several projects in development. He created the BBC mystery mini-series Hidden in 2011, and he was an adjunct instructor of dramatic writing at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts until he retired in 2017. They'll carry me off writing, he told Variety.
Though Derek McLane's set boasts a view out over the roofs of Manhattan, hinting at something symbolic and substantial, the play never quite escapes the room, narrowing to a quarrel about personal choices made in the past. Miller maintained he wrote The Price as a response to the war in Vietnam and that it was not based on his own relationship with his brother, who dropped out of college to shore up the imperiled family business. Neither assertion seems especially credible.
There are only two kinds of people, the ones who like sleeping next to the wall, and those who like sleeping next to the people who push them off the bed. — Etgar Keret, The Bus Driver Who Wanted to Be God
If these are your measurements, then of course you're going to think things are going in one direction, while your way of life disintegrates. Even the inventor of G.D.P., Simon Kuznets, said 100 years ago, this is a terrible measurement of national well-being, and we should never use it as that.
We need to let our historic allies know that our commitments are good, and that if we want to make a change, we want to do it in a way that's not pulling the rug out from under you but actually consultative. If we want other people to invest more, then we have to try and sit down with them and drive them to do so without questioning our commitment to NATO wholesale. But to me, trying to nickel-and-dime our relationships with our historic allies is not the best way forward. I think it was James Mattis that said that if you invest more in diplomacy, you have to invest less in ammunition, which should be the goal. So we need to make sure our partnerships and alliances are actually strong, stable and secure, and then we can put pressure on Russia and China with more of a global consensus, and maintain the international world order that's benefited us for decades that now is falling apart because Donald Trump is so erratic and unreliable, even with the people we've been allies with for decades.
The tone and milieu of this book put me in mind of two excellent earlier memoirs, Anatole Broyard's Kafka Was the Rage (1993), about bohemian Greenwich Village in the late 1940s, and Joyce Johnson's Minor Characters (1983), about the women among the Beat writers, as well as Sylvia Plath's novel, The Bell Jar (1963).
Allegra Lynch, a member of the Travel Leaders Network who lives in Santa Rosa, Calif., said that she sold $1.5 million worth of such trips in 2018, primarily to Europe, compared with $800,000 in 2017. The rise is 100 percent because of people wanting to go on trips after taking at-home DNA tests, she said.

Ms. Leachman entered the spotlight as a Miss America contestant in 1946 and was still in the public eye more than 74 years later, portraying offbeat grandmothers on television and film and competing with celebrities less than half her age on Dancing With the Stars. In between, she won admiring reviews for her stage, film and television work, as well as Emmy Awards for performances in both dramas and comedies.
In a business you can say, Hey, we're going to go this way, and people generally have to do what you're saying. In government it's much more analogous to my role as the founder of a national nonprofit, where you have hundreds or even thousands of stakeholders, and you have to try and generate energy around a vision. Let people see that it's in their self-interest or the self-interest of the people that they represent to get on board with your vision. And that you're willing to compromise and work with them. That is the way I would lead as president.
Jimmie Rodgers, whose smooth voice straddled the line between pop and country and brought him a string of hits — none bigger than his first record, Honeycomb, in 1957 — died on Jan. 18 in Palm Desert, Calif. He was 87.
Critical language about nonwhite cultural movements also appears in a Texas book from McGraw-Hill. It is partly a result of debates, in 2010, between conservative and liberal members of the Texas Board of Education over whether state standards should mention cultural movements like hip-hop and country music. Their compromise was to ask teachers and textbook publishers to address both the positive and negative impacts of artistic movements.
As a writer, I understand the absurdity of trying to place restrictions on what can and can't be written about. Keats defined negative capability as an artist's ability to transmute an experience or idea into art even if she hasn't experienced it herself; without it, we'd have no historical fiction, no Madame Bovary, no Martian Chronicles.
The bureau closed for six weeks at the start of the pandemic, but since reopening in late April, it has churned out licenses from 8 a.m. to midnight, seven days a week, including holidays. That license is the ticket to a legally valid marriage at one of the city's dozens of chapels, which offer fast, budget-conscious services in themed settings ranging from elegant to rococo.
Skydiving is for people who sort of want to stay alive, but also sort of don't.
ne afternoon last November, I went with Bashista to Arlington, and we visited the two-story suburban house where he grew up and where his parents still live, from which his father, an electrical engineer, commutes to his job at the Naval Research Lab in Washington. Modest and immaculate, with lots of carpeting and an abundance of pink and mauve in the decor, the Bashistas' home veritably thrummed with the quiet, vehement faith of his mother, Aileen, who looks like Bashista only fairer, with pale blue eyes and gold-rimmed glasses. Hefty painted statuettes of Christ and the Virgin Mary stood before a window in the kitchen, and in the living room, near a graduation photo of Bashista smiling over a giant bow tie, there was a small table covered with lace, where holy water, candles and a relic -- a bone of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, the first American-born saint -- were on display. I always prayed that the Lord would take my sons to be His holy priests, Aileen Bashista told me. You know it's nothing you deserve. It's God's gift. Bashista's younger brother, Christopher, a drummer until a car injury left him unable to play, now a senior at George Mason University who lives at home, had a different reaction: relief. Mom got her priest, he said. Aileen Bashista makes weekly visits to Seton High School, where Bashista's younger sister, Mary-Beth, is a senior, to teach rosary making. She is also a lay member of an order of Carmelite nuns.
A recent poll found that roughly 50 percent of the Ukrainian population favors joining NATO, though Hungary's foreign minister recently said his country would block Ukrainian membership unless Ukraine changed a policy restricting its citizens' use of minority languages.
He had such apt observations of the strange beauty of our shared hometown, and also a similarly oblique connection to Hollywood that I do, growing up within it and seeing both its magic and its flaws, she said. It was exciting to discover a new writer whose work I really loved.
What am I doing here? Has this made any difference to anybody? And if I ever come to that, I'm going to open the folder on that day. And if I get to the end of my life without ever having opened it, that'd be awesome.
She writes about motherhood and marriage and things that can get lumped under that general umbrella term 'domesticity,' but she brings them to life in these incredibly razor-sharp ways, Jamison says. And there shouldn't even be a 'but' conjunction in that sentence, right — like, why are those states of being not razor sharp, somehow? But sometimes they can get seen as soft or sentimental. And she brings both a very different form and a very different tone to how she writes about them and how she does justice to their emotional extremity.
During the busiest stage of his solo career Mr. Parisot performed with the major orchestras of Berlin, London, Paris and Munich, and with conductors including Leopold Stokowski, Pierre Monteux and Leonard Bernstein, winning plaudits for his warm, focused sound; prodigious technique; and a temperament that balanced passion and elegance.
As the voices of women, people of color, and other traditionally marginalized communities grow louder the frame of reference from which we tell the story of American is expanding. The white male story is not irrelevant but it's insufficient, and when you have a group of people that are accustomed to the spotlight see the camera lens pan away, it's a threat to their sense of self. It's not surprising that QAnon support started to soar in the weeks after B.L.M. QAnon offers a way for white evangelicals to place blame on (fictional) bad people instead of a broken system. It's an organization that validates the source of Q-Anoners insecurity — irrelevance — and in its place offers a steady source of self-righteousness and acceptance.
Why is this book different from other books about the Jewish future? Because its author does not have a religious or political agenda. This book is not a commercial for any particular brand of Judaism or Zionism. It does not begin with a priori assumptions about God, the survival of the Jewish people, the superiority of Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, or Reconstructionist Judaism, or the essential conservativism or liberalism of Judaism. I am neither a rabbi, a Jewish fund-raiser, a member of a Jewish studies faculty, an officer of any Jewish organization, nor an advocate for any particular Israeli party. Though I am essentially a secular Jew, I do belong to Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist congregations. Most of my family members are modern Orthodox, and a few are ultra-Orthodox. Some are completely secular. I have generally positive feelings about all Jewish denominations, as I do about the numerous Jewish political, educational, and philanthropic organizations to which I belong and contribute. I have no personal stake in any particular solution to the problem of Jewish survival. I just want American Jewish life to move from strength to strength. I love my Judaism and I feel passionately about its survival, but I do not believe in survival merely for survival's sake. Judaism should not be seen as a patient about to die a natural death, who is kept alive artificially on a respirator for as long as possible without regard to the quality of life.
White resistance to black progress is covered differently in the two states. McGraw-Hill, United States History & Geography: Continuity and Change, California, P. 505 California notes the suburban dream of the 1950s was inaccessible to many African-Americans. McGraw-Hill, United States History Since 1877, Texas, P. 436 Texas does not.
In a Jan. 7 National Review article, Grown Men Are the Solution, Not the Problem, David French, one of the most outspoken critics of the A.P.A. guidelines, wrote We are in the middle of an intense culture war focused around men.
The conservative views that Lindbergh later articulated, the remarks about Jews that proved so startling when he was opposing American entry into World War II, his adverse opinion of the Soviet Union, his belief in Western civilization--these were all a reflection of a world view prevalent among his friends, which he absorbed over the years. An engineer and aviator of genius, he was, however, not an intellectual, nor a consistent reader, nor a social analyst. The assumption of this elitism accounted for his conviction that America should lead the world in the development of flight, that a conflict between English and German groups of nations would [be] a fratricidal war, that race was a valid judgmental concept and that to accomplish an objective one should deal with the top people. It also accounted for what many people thought was his anti-Semitism. Lindbergh did not regard himself as an anti-Semite. Indeed, he was shocked a couple of years ago when this writer put the question to him. Good God, no, he responded, citing his fondness for Jews he had known or dealt with. Nor did he condone the Nazi treatment of German Jews, much less Hitler's genocidal policies. On the other hand, he accepted as fact that American Jewish groups were among those promoting United States involvement in World War II. He voiced these views in a speech in Des Moines, Iowa, on Sept. 11, 1941.
I knew the second I saw her that she's the one, said Mr. Desai, 50, who goes by Dash. I just knew I was going to be with her.
Before a gay pride parade in 1978 in San Francisco, Harvey Milk, a city supervisor and gay rights leader who was assassinated that year, joined others in asking Mr. Baker to create an emblem to represent the movement.
The trial, which took more than two years and attracted news media attention in China as well as Canada, underlined how Vancouver has become a global sanctuary for foreign money moving from Asia to North America. Mr. Yuan was a millionaire who had gamed the Canadian immigration system, building a business and acquiring Canadian real estate worth millions of dollars.
Research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology showed that when adults don't give children the whole truth, children work to fill in the gaps — and are then less likely to trust the adult. Victoria Talwar, a psychology professor at McGill University, has found that as children grow, they develop increasing confusion around truth and lies, especially when parents tell them lying is wrong, but then proceed to lie in front of them.
In addition to the nine we already have. I believe that — so if you look at the Constitution, there is nothing there that stipulates the number of Supreme Court justices. We've had fewer than nine, we've had more than nine. I think that appointing new justices would be helpful on several levels. It would help depoliticize the process, at least marginally, because if you have 17 justices and one steps down, then it's not as much of an earthquake. Well, right now we we're hinging our laws on the health of an octogenarian. It would literally be rational for us to all just to follow Ruth Bader Ginsburg around and just scrub any door knob she touches. You know what I mean?
Tiley announced that King had been named Australian Open Woman of the Year, and spoke of her legacy as a pioneer as she sat beside him at the podium.
As Australia's most successful female tennis player, she has 64 majors titles across singles, doubles and mixed doubles categories. She is a 24-time Grand Slam singles winner, a record that no male or female player has been able to beat. Serena Williams is next in line, one Grand Slam title away.
In May 1976, Mr. Severin left Ireland on his most audacious voyage: following in the wake of St. Brendan, a sixth-century monk, who, with a party of other monks, is said to have made a spectacular journey from Ireland across the Atlantic to North America — the Promised Land — in a leather-wrapped boat.
At the door to Jennifer's apartment I was met by Silvera. Silvera. He and myself have worked many cases. We have stood together, like this, in many a stricken home. But not quite like this.

The SAT was first administered in 1926 and evolved out of a test used for admission to Princeton University and Cooper Union. It was inspired by military experiments with I.Q. testing.
In addition to her daughter Rose, she is survived by her husband, Tim Owens; a son, the writer Matthew Yorke; another daughter, Daisy Cockburn; a sister, Catherine Tennant; a brother, Toby; and three grandchildren.
the implication that the goal is to eliminate male characteristics. The real implication is that rigid adherence to extreme expression of a few select masculine norms is related to poorer health outcomes.
AK: But one of his priorities has been to get our European allies to spend more money on their own defense. And I wonder if you think that that's a worthwhile goal and how you might go about it, if you agree that that's something that should be a priority for the United States.
If these three words have acquired the force of absolution, it is because Karan Johar is by miles the most famous Indian ever to almost be openly gay. Since he burst onto the scene in the late 1990s, this 44-year-old director-producer has reached vast audiences with his movies. His name is a byword for family entertainment, his films by his own admission synonymous with popcorn, bubble gum and frivolity. All the stars are his friends, and the brightest of them appear on his immensely popular talk show Koffee With Karan. He has some 10 million followers on Twitter and almost three million on Instagram.
Most American laborers work in the services sector, according to Pew Research — in July 2019, 107.8 million people worked in private service-providing industries including trade, transportation and utilities.
—— more strong and more whole. There's a saying, I think it was actually, and maybe in this … no, it was an earlier administration, but a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. There was a crisis. There was a massive opportunity to help rebalance our economy, but we instead recapitalized the banks to the tune of $4 trillion. And what I say to Americans around the country, I say, Hey, do you remember voting for the $4 trillion bailout of Wall Street? And it gets this laugh. But then they answer, Wait, we did that? And it's, Of course we didn't vote for that.
They had insisted on higher standards and more rigorous research, had declined to demonize the outside world, but had never meant to break down the fortress walls of what was to them the one, true Catholic faith.
MR. DAWSON Not just us. The call went out — we won't be the only ones to answer.
I commented to one of my team members, I feel like running for president is at least a glimpse into what it's like to be a professional woman because I feel like I care about my appearance more now than I ever did. And there are people that are always like looking after ——
I explained all that as we sat knee to knee, relishing our newfound voices, and then read Ms. Oliver's lines out loud, especially focusing on the last one: I don't want to end up simply having visited this world.
Here's where things get interesting. For one thing, the couple's relationship continued to flourish after they split: As co-chief executives, they continued to spend every day in each other's presence, doing all of the things that married couples commit to: parenting, splitting finances, meaningfully communicating, confessing, forgiving, even occasionally touching. For another, and here's the really curious part, EO Products took off in unexpected ways. Whereas the usual story line would suggest that a divorce in such a situation would spell professional disaster — Michael Funk says that in his 40-something years he's rarely seen it work — EO not only survived the Blacks' very conscious uncoupling but gathered steam. The line expanded and popped up in retail stores like Walgreens, CVS, Walmart and Target without any compromises made to transparency about its ingredients. What I admire about EO is their commitment to using essential oils in spite of their being more expensive, Ms. Quimby of Burt's Bees said. They're willing to go for that level of quality.
The juicy final episode of HBO's Big Little Lies revealed, as promised, who died and who done it. The murder mystery (if that death can be ruled a murder) was the least of the reasons to watch this mini-series — more on that later — but it did deliver on the minimal promise of the genre. At the end, we got a verdict.
Mr. Yang is not the first to label this period the fourth industrial revolution — the term was made popular by Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, at its annual meeting in Davos in 2016. Mr. Schwab's book of the same name argues that the fourth industrial revolution is transforming every sector of the economy and industry through new technologies that merge the physical, digital and biological realms.
Sure, but Brooks was 18 feet away, I believe, at the time that he was twice shot. And he was moving away from the police.
The Days of Abandonment is told from the perspective of Olga, a woman whose husband, Mario, has just left her and their young son and daughter for another woman. The story unfolds in often excruciating psychological detail, as Olga falls apart and then pulls herself together again. We have little access to Mario's inner life. Ties puts the same plot elements through a kaleidoscope, telling the tale from three different perspectives, first that of the wife, Vanda, then of the husband, Aldo, and eventually that of their grown children, jumping backward and forward in time over an arc of decades.
In the adapted-screenplay race, the guild singled out some of this awards season's heaviest hitters, like The Irishman and Joker, as well as Jojo Rabbit, Little Women and the Mister Rogers drama A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.
If there is a criticism to be made of this highly absorbing novel, it is that it feels perhaps a shade too contemporary, and never quite reveals the horrors that would surely follow if the pre-Roe v. Wade days were to repeat themselves. The one disaster that has occurred — to Mattie's friend Yasmine — is elided from the action of the novel, and rendered soft-focus and ambiguous. The reader is left to wonder what it would be like to be a pregnant teenager of color under these new laws. Mattie's journey to try to terminate her pregnancy is far less demeaning and terrifying than the hardships endured by some women living in states with few legal, safe abortion clinics. Gin stands trial, but it's clear from early on that the forces conspiring against her would have seen her accused of a crime with or without the new laws. Having read one's Paley, one feels while reading Zumas's book that yes, this imagined dystopia is terrible, but the reality would be far worse.
Their sexuality may seem boundary pushing or deviant. Every advance in cybersex has met with cultural resistance before it became normalized, Dr. McArthur said.
Wright is touching in her portrayal of a woman stepping out into the unknown. But Pauline hasn't yet played a large enough role in the series to warrant this much time, especially when there are such tantalizing glimpses of Bette and Joan, alternately freaking out and relishing the experience of being in a hit again. The script (by Tim Minear and Gina Welch) sometimes veers toward pandering in Pauline's scenes. (Pauline tells Mamacita that her own mother wasted her life in marriage and child rearing, and then adds, Not that there's anything wrong with domestic work.) The points made about women and power in Hollywood are important ones, but they are more effective circling in the electrically charged orbit of Davis-Crawford.
Mr. Yang was the C.E.O. of a boutique test prep company that was purchased by Kaplan in 2009. The company flourished during the 2008 financial collapse, becoming the country's foremost preparatory company for the GMAT as more people flocked to business school.
Age, as fantasists have long told us, is just a number. But patterns of numbers have meaning. If 50-year-old leading men routinely win the hearts of 30-year-old actresses in Hollywood films (as demonstrated by a totally nonscientific survey of movies watched on a recent cross-country flight), what happens to 50-year-old women? Who knows if this invisibility also pertains to writers? In any event, your friend is living in never-never land: It takes about three minutes to learn anyone's age these days.
We should definitely do that, in a very big and dramatic way. And I have proposals to help move us toward a better model of high school education. Only 6 percent of American high school students are in technical, trade or apprenticeship tracks. In Germany, that's 59 percent. Think about that gulf. Meanwhile, there are millions of those trade and middle-scale jobs that are left unfilled. Why is this?
I believe your reporters then talked to maybe half a dozen or more of Kim's contemporaries at the organization and found out that those allegations were completely groundless, which they were.
A few words about my appearance. The physique I inherited from my mother. Way ahead of her time, she had the look now associated with highly politicized feminists. Ma could have played the male villain in a postnuclear road movie. I copped her voice, too: It has been further deepened by three decades of nicotine abuse. My features I inherited from my father. They are rural rather than urban--flat, undecided. The hair is dyed blonde. I was born and raised in this city, out in Moon Park. But all that went to pieces, when I was ten, and thereafter I was raised by the state. I don't know where my parents are. I'm five-ten and I go 180.
Campaign staff members for Mr. Bloomberg before the rally at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on Tuesday.
I was in Daytona Beach at the Daytona Playhouse. I walked in because I had some extra time. I was traveling at the time. And I was on a motorcycle, and I had to stay for the winter. So I walked in and said, do you need some help backstage — assistant stage manager or props or something? And the person said, Well, have you acted before? I said, Yeah. And he goes, OK, you're in the show. Apparently, the Kralahome in The King and I had just dropped out, and I was instantly cast as the king's right-hand man. And I had body paint on me every day, and I had this purple eye shadow that stretched the eyes, very politically incorrect. So a friend of mine said, you could put a little thin layer of Vaseline on your eyelids before the makeup, and then the makeup comes off easy. Otherwise, you're left with a pink tint, and you're walking around town all day with pink eyeshadow. And so I said, oh, OK. So I put a layer of Vaseline on, but I didn't know how much. Apparently, I put on too much. So near the end of the play, just as the king is dying — spoiler alert for anybody who didn't see King and I — just as the king is dying and the Kralahome, my character, is hunched over him and distraught about his king dying, I couldn't help it anymore.
Serge Schmemann: Yeah. And staying with relationships and alliances, President Trump has reversed several key policies the United States has had toward Israel. He's moved the embassy to Jerusalem, he's recognized sovereignty over the Golan Heights, et cetera, et cetera. Would you reverse those?
Uber is literally advertising to schoolteachers saying, Hey, we've figured out schoolteachers make really good Uber drivers. And if you look at that situation, the headline unemployment rate says, Check, this person is employed. Heck, this person might be employed twice. The headline unemployment rate when Donald Trump was running for president, he castigated it as fake news, and then he got into office and all the sudden it became real news. He was right the first time. The number is almost intentionally designed to obscure any of the difficulties in the labor market. If I drop out of the labor market, I no longer count. I actually help the number.
She prays that Mary-Beth will become a nun too, though she admitted that the possibility seemed remote for her lively, sociable daughter, who is chairman of her prom committee. He seldom knocks us off a horse like he did Paul, Aileen reflected. If we're always listening to rock music or doing homework and busy with worldly things, you seldom get to hear our Lord. Enough, said Mary-Beth. Brian Bashista's upbringing was not intensely religious, and he and his older brother, John, now married and a father, attended public schools. My mom and dad were not always so strong in their faith, Bashista explained. John and I were never altar boys. When he was in junior high school, his mother plunged more deeply into Catholicism and pressed her son Brian to do the same. In her fervor, it wasn't necessarily an invitation, he said. It was: 'You need to do this. It will help you.' John and I were teen-agers, and we both resisted. 'Say the family rosary, Mom, are you kidding? I'm going out with friends.' These memories may partly explain Bashista's scrupulous effort never to sound overbearing or judgmental. Propose, not impose, is a phrase he often repeats. Lead them to the truth, don't slam them with it. That's not the way Jesus did it. Bashista is more judgmental when describing his own life before he entered the seminary. Our Lord gave me everything I ever wanted, he recalled.
It's Trader, he said. It has to be Trader.

KK: I thought you were going to say it's a lot harder to ride the subway now because of the breakdowns of New York infrastructure.
I still could not bring myself to call my uncle, but as I watched my mother grieve, I began to rethink. I came to realize that in my self-righteous pursuit of justice, I had committed injustice against myself and my loved ones. My resentment blinded me to what was truly important: my empathy and humanity. I had dehumanized one of my most beloved, just as he had dehumanized me. I was angry at him for abandoning me while I was in prison, yet when he became a prisoner of his own body, I was ready to abandon him.
With some of today's older Jews, it is exactly the opposite: they refuse to read the good news, even when it is demonstrably true. They insist on focusing on the oys rather than the joys of Judaism, as Rabbi Moshe Waldoks put it. This is understandable, in light of the long history of persecution. Like an individual victim of a violent crime who sees his assailant around every corner, the Jewish people have been traumatized by our unrelenting victimization at the hands of Jew-haters. It is impossible for anyone who did not personally experience the Holocaust, or the other repeated assaults on Jewish life throughout our history, to comprehend what it must have been like to be victimized by unrelenting persecution based on primitive Jew-hating. We continue to see anti-Semitism even where it has ceased to exist, or we exaggerate it where it continues to exist in marginalized form. Indeed, some Jewish newspapers refuse to print, and some Jewish organizations refuse to acknowledge, the good news, lest they risk alienating their readerships or losing their membership. For example, in November of 1996 I saw a fundraising letter from a Jewish organization which claimed that anti-Semitism ... appears to be growing more robust, more strident, more vicious--and more `respectable.' Well-intentioned as this organization is, it seeks support by exaggerating the threats we currently face and by comparing them to those we faced during the Holocaust.
Particularly because I think we've become unduly vindictive and punitive toward statements that people find objectionable. A friend of mine said something, he said, If the online universe descends on someone, and they lose their job, the online universe moves on a week later, but that person still does not have a job a week later. That the impact on the individual lasts much, much longer than the rancor. So I shared this.
SAVAGE I'm so hopeful of Broadway's return that I've not gone to pick up my things from the theater. It's all just sitting there.
Yes. I have three major pro-journalism proposals on my website, including federally funding journalists for every congressional district, billions of dollars in grants to help transition local journalism. Matching grants, so you're not like saying, Hey, we're going to do this. But matching grants to help transition them to cooperative models of ownership to nonprofit and philanthropic models.
McALLEN, Tex. — President Trump traveled to the Rio Grande Valley earlier this month and made his case for building a wall on the Southern border — needed, he said, to keep America safe from a variety of dangers that are continuing to make their way across the frontier from Mexico.
But a gimmick doesn't get you very far if your main character is as drab as Pete. He's without a home because, minutes into the episode, he walks in on his wife, Jess (Lauren Lapkus), while she's in bed with another man (George Basil). End of marriage. (Mr. Holmes, who in reality is a thriving stand-up comic, has said he drew on his own failed marriage in creating the show.)
When a neighbor hands Alice a bundle of unsent letters written by Nellie to Nellie's mother, the mystery begins in earnest, and it turns out Nellie has a lot more to teach Alice about being a wife and a woman than how to bake a good batch of cookies. The most important? Take those trappings you resent so much — cooking, gardening, bearing children — embrace them, then wield them like weapons.
BA: So a Republican would say that alternative is to let markets work. Is that what makes you a Democrat — you don't think the market will create enough jobs for Americans?
Mike? he said. I'm going to have to call in a big one.

Biden plans to roll out dozens of executive orders in his first 10 days as president. Credit... Amr Alfiky/The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., inheriting a collection of crises unlike any in generations, plans to start his administration with dozens of executive directives on top of expansive legislative proposals in a 10-day blitz meant to signal a turning point for a nation reeling from disease, economic turmoil, racial strife and now the aftermath of the assault on the Capitol. Mr. Biden's team has developed a raft of decrees that he can issue on his own authority after the inauguration on Wednesday to begin reversing some of President Trump's most hotly disputed policies. Advisers hope the flurry of action, without waiting for Congress, will establish a sense of momentum for the new president even as the Senate puts his predecessor on trial. On his first day in office alone, Mr. Biden intends a flurry of executive orders that will be partly substantive and partly symbolic. They include rescinding the travel ban on several predominantly Muslim countries; rejoining the Paris climate change accord; extending pandemic-related limits on evictions and student loan payments; issuing a mask mandate for federal property and interstate travel; and ordering agencies to figure out how to reunite children separated from their families after crossing the border, according to a memo circulated on Saturday by Ron Klain, his incoming White House chief of staff, and obtained by The New York Times.
To the millions of you just looking for a fighting chance in this economy, I promise you, we will not forget you. We understand what you're going through. We will never, ever give up. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday proposed a spending package to combat the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. The plan includes $1,400 direct payments to individuals and more generous unemployment benefits. Credit Credit... Amr Alfiky/The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday proposed a $1.9 trillion rescue package to combat the economic downturn and the Covid-19 crisis, outlining the type of sweeping aid that Democrats have demanded for months and signaling the shift in the federal government's pandemic response as Mr. Biden prepares to take office next week. The package includes more than $400 billion to combat the pandemic directly, including money to accelerate vaccine deployment and to safely reopen most schools within 100 days. An additional $350 billion would help state and local governments bridge budget shortfalls, while the plan would also include $1,400 direct payments to individuals, more generous unemployment benefits, federally mandated paid leave for workers and large subsidies for child care costs. During this pandemic, millions of Americans, through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck, Mr. Biden said in a speech to the nation on Tuesday evening. There is real pain overwhelming the real economy.
I don't care what people say, because I know what I'm doing, and what I'm doing is to make life better for people. If everyone loves you, you're not doing anything. I have a strong center.
Yet despite these enormous gains, many older Jews do not seem to be able to give up their anachronistic status as victims. A recent book on the American Jewish community notes: [A]bout a third [of affiliated Jews in San Francisco said] that Jewish candidates could not be elected to Congress from San Francisco. Yet three out of four Congressional representatives ... were, in fact, well identified Jews at the time the poll was conducted. And they had been elected by a population that was about 95 percent non-Jewish.
Mr. Barris might have earned a brief mention in the obituary pages with one of his earliest accomplishments: He wrote the pop song Palisades Park, which became a hit for Freddy Cannon in 1962 and an emblem of that period of good-time rock 'n' roll just before the genre's harder, louder side emerged.
Created as a brainchild of Senator Elizabeth Warren as part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, the consumer bureau was made largely ineffectual after Mr. Trump appointed Mick Mulvaney to run it as interim chair. He pledged to run the agency with humility and prudence and requested no funding from the Federal Reserve. Kathy Kraninger, who took over as director of the agency in 2018, has been lambasted by Democrats for undermining the bureau, which they have accused of denying consumers of millions of dollars in relief. Democrats have been pressuring Ms. Kraninger to resign or face being fired. In June, the Supreme Court ruled the president has the power to remove the C.F.P.B. director before his or her five-year term is up. Matthew Goldstein, Lauren Hirsch and
But marry, it seems, they must. Shashank Khaitan builds his romantic comedy Badrinath Ki Dulhania (Badrinath's Bride) around a self-possessed heroine — Vaidehi (Alia Bhatt), whose dreams may be ill-defined but don't necessarily include marriage.
The book ends by suggesting three alternatives for the future: an America which becomes increasingly degenerate, an America which becomes increasingly over-controlled with science assisting the state in keeping sex in its place, and a more endearing picture of an America which will profit by our new careless freedom, use our new understandings of the working of body and mind and will achieve a sexual code that will be free without being careless.
Rory is not a huge dog person, but when Rilke passed away, she was there for me, said Ms. Carryer (left), 32, a teen librarian for the San Leandro Public Library in California.
Thanks to their compatibility and common frame of reference, Ms. Chau and Mr. Lau were able to transition easily into dating during the pandemic shutdown even though they had only known each other for a short time. They visited each other's homes, watched TV shows in English and Cantonese, cooked together and attended online church services and Bible study groups conducted by the San Francisco Chinese Alliance Church. Almost all of our dates have been very domestic, Ms. Chau, 30, said. We've had a lot of time to talk and get to know each other very well.
Reliable numbers are tough to find in Sperm World. Researchers cite data collected in the 1980s to estimate the number of children born by donor sperm in the United States at anywhere from 30,000 to 60,000 a year, though advocates push back even on that range, saying there are no dependable figures because there is no regulation. Sperm banking itself was about a $4 billion industry in 2018.
Mr. Biden's priorities reflect values that progressive faith leaders have pushed for, and that motivated many to speak out for him during the campaign, said Derrick Harkins, who led interfaith outreach for the Democratic National Committee this past cycle. There is a sense of moral synergy on the left, among not only progressive Christians but also humanists, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs and the spectrum of faith traditions, he said.
Not to be outdone by my now husband who proposed to me via a New York Times crossword, this cruciverbalist bride wanted to make her own special puzzle for the wedding. I immediately came up with the AB POSITIVE theme based on our first initials.
Dr. Winell was raised by missionary parents in Taiwan whose religion, she says, taught her that she was never good enough as a child. She struggled for years to figure out how to enjoy life, whose pleasures she had been made to feel guilty about.
In A United Kingdom, David Oyelowo plays Seretse Khama, the real-life king of Botswana (then a British protectorate known as Bechuanaland) who set off an international crisis in 1948, when he married Ruth Williams, a white British clerk. South Africa, which was instituting apartheid at the time, objected to an interracial couple's leading a neighboring country; Britain opposed the marriage because resource-rich South Africa did; and Botswanans were angry that their leader had chosen a queen not of their race or tribe.
Freshwater is a poetic and disturbing depiction of mental illness as it haunts the protagonist from birth to adulthood: the brief insanities that are in you, not just the ones that blossomed as you grew taller … but the ones you were born with, tucked behind your liver. It is an unflinching account of the way mental illness can grow, transform and destroy not just relationships, but one's sense of self as well. Unlike many depictions of dissociative identity disorder in fiction, Emezi steers clears of hysteria and fear-driven drama. The voices in Ada's mind build creatively on a consistent belief about madness: that in the height of suffering, sufferers are not themselves; they become possessed by different spirits. As Sylvia Plath famously wrote in 1962, I am terrified by this dark thing that sleeps in me.
KK: Actually, I also want to ask you about your time at Manhattan Prep. Your colleague Kimberly Watkins told City Council in September that she had faced both gender harassment and pay inequity under your leadership there. Could you respond to those allegations?
Hm. And Mark, where in your mind does this story begin?
The 'macro values' of President Trump
The new governor also said he would propose in his new budget, due out later this week, mandating that all Californians obtain health care insurance, in direct response to the Republican tax bill last year that removed the mandate from the Affordable Care Act. Such a mandate in California would require approval of the Legislature, which is far from assured.
The Times has strict policies on corrections: If it's wrong, even if just for a few minutes online or in one edition of the print newspaper, it is supposed to get a correction. It is this dedication to accuracy that earns the trust of our readers.
KK: Oh, sorry, I just wanted to ask you, you know, there are some people who would suggest that a better use of money, instead of giving a Freedom Dividend, would be to dramatically overhaul America's high schools and start teaching people different skills instead of trying to continue the race against A.I. Why isn't that a path? Why couldn't we instead change how we do education in this country?
Objectification doesn't exist just in porn, of course. So many men cannot get their heads around the idea that women are not first and foremost sexual objects, the novelist Jenny Crusie told me. You don't get that from porn; you get that from a persistent worldview modeled by the men around you that you've been taught to admire.
Yes, sir. We are a national union. We are all over the U.S. But all around, we're probably — just the officers alone, we're at about 15,000 plus.
He also retained Henry Breckinridge, a conservative Wall Street lawyer, to help handle his affairs. Many of his new associates held conservative views, which his father, a neo-Populist Republican, spent 20 years fighting. Lindbergh was not conceived of then as a possible political figure, but rather as a nice young man, perhaps a little unpolished socially, who deserved the best that could be provided. His new friends were considerate of his strong individualism. They did not impose flattery, they were respectful and, above all, helpful. The income from We and from his flight articles in The New York Times made him a millionaire--a considerable eminence for a man accustomed to thinking hard before he spent $5. His friends helped him invest his fortune. And after Lindbergh made his goodwill flights around the country and to Latin America in the Spirit of St. Louis, his friends saw to it that he got a job in keeping with his interest in aviation and his status. The position was as an adviser in both Pan American World Airways and the predecessor of Trans World Airlines in laying out transatlantic, transcontinental and Caribbean air routes for the commercial aviation that his Paris flight had done so much to popularize.
So if that's your problem and you break Facebook into Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, does that somehow make the kids stronger or healthier? No. If anything, it actually ratchets up the incentives to try and further their engagement.

Mr. Trump likes to say that the economy has reached historic highs under his administration. However, life expectancy has been falling and other measures of well-being have declined, including rising rates of depression diagnosis.
Binyamin Appelbaum: Yes. After every invention basically since the plow, people have found new uses for the time saved by new technologies. You've argued that this time, this won't happen quickly enough. Why will this time be different? What gives you the confidence that we're confronting something new in all of human history?
Buttigieg has campaigned frequently with his husband, embracing him onstage, and has mentioned his marriage in debates. And he doesn't shy away from questions about his sexual orientation, which he didn't publicly acknowledge until the age of 33, shortly before his election to a second term as mayor of South Bend, Ind.
Marcel Proust was born on July 10, 1871, to well-to-do middle-class parents. His mother was Jeanne Weil, a twenty-one-year-old Parisian, daughter of Nathe Weil, a rich stockbroker. Her great-uncle Adolphe Cremieux was a senator and received a state funeral; he was also president of the Universal Israelite Alliance. Her mother, Adele, was (like the Narrator's grandmother in Remembrance of Things past) a cultured woman who loved, above all other literature, the letters of Madame de Sevigne, one of Louis XIV's courtiers and a woman who was almost romantically in love with her own daughter (the one-sided Sevigne mother-daughter relationship inspired Thornton Wilder when he wrote The Bridge of San Luis Rey). This intense intimacy was in fact characteristic of Marcel and his own mother, who were inseparable, who fought frequently (usually over his laziness and lack of willpower) but always fell into each other's arms as soon as they made up. Mother and son shared a love of music and literature; she could speak and read German as well as English. She had a perfect memory and knew long passages from Racine by heart; her dying words were a citation from La Fontaine: If you're not a Roman, at least act worthy of being one. Marcel inherited her taste for memorizing poetry and knew long passages from Victor Hugo, Racine, and Baudelaire.
For nearly 40 years, they had almost no contact with their father and blame Ms. Cunningham Agee's controlling nature for the estrangement. Suzanne Agee said she believed that her father had a lot of remorse over not keeping in close contact with his first family but that he couldn't do so without breaking ties with Mary.
Scrutinizing, looking after it, because I'm just like, What? My hair? Who cares? No one. And then people are like, No, no, and they have to put time in, smooth it out.
She changed her surname to Bosworth from Crum after her father told her, If you become an actress and you get a bad review, critics will say, 'Crummy performance by Patricia Crum,' so take your mother's maiden name.
Marcel Proust was the son of a Christian father and a Jewish mother. He himself was baptized (on August 5, 1871, at the church of Saint-Louis d'Antin) and later confirmed as a Catholic, but he never practiced that faith and as an adult could best be described as a mystical atheist, someone imbued with spirituality who nonetheless did not believe in a personal God, much less in a savior. Although Jews trace their religion through their mothers, Proust never considered himself Jewish and even became vexed when a newspaper article listed him as a Jewish author. His father once warned him not to stay in a certain hotel since there were too many Jewish guests there, and, to be sure, in Remembrance of Things Past there are unflattering caricatures of the members of one Jewish family, the Blochs. Jews were still considered exotic, even oriental, in France; in 1872 there were only eighty-six thousand Jews in the whole country. In a typically offensive passage Proust writes that in a French drawing room a Jew making his entry as though he were emerging from the desert, his body crouching like a hyena's, his neck thrust forward, offering profound `salaams,' completely satisfies a certain taste for the oriental.
Instead, the media and the international community should listen to L.G.B.T.Q. Bermudians and elevate their priorities, not set their own misguided agendas.
Yeah, you said you don't need 80 percent of Congress, you need a majority. And I would push back and say neither of those is correct. You need 60 percent of the Senate currently. The question is, how do you plan to get things done, even if you had a Democratic majority in the Senate? Which I think is right now less than an even chance. How do you propose getting your agenda through Congress when the filibuster is in place?
Almost certainly, yes. And you saw it a little bit with Barack Obama where he tapped Joe Biden in part because Joe had very deep relationships on Capitol Hill. If you had another outsider like me, we'd still be trying to figure out who to call. So, you need to have folks who have deep relationships on Capitol Hill from day one.
— where he announced that Officer Brosnan was being charged with aggravated assault.
BA: But that just brings us to the other side of it, where what you're proposing is not to give as much more money to the people who need it the most. You're saying, if you get food stamps, the amount by which your government benefits increase will be less than for me or you.
Modernity and the Holocaust was a work of theory and synthesis. He collected no data and had no methodology to speak of. That didn't make it any less of a powerful contribution.
Serge Schmemann: Yeah. And staying with relationships and alliances, President Trump has reversed several key policies the United States has had toward Israel. He's moved the embassy to Jerusalem, he's recognized sovereignty over the Golan Heights, et cetera, et cetera. Would you reverse those?
Generally speaking, I think we have become overly aggressive and optimistic about what we can accomplish in various foreign theaters. I've signed a pledge to end the forever wars because I don't believe it's the will of the American people for us to be in a constant state of armed conflict in foreign theaters for years and even decades at a time. Our Constitution says that it's in Congress's hands to declare war, but Congress has completely ceded this authority through the A.U.M.F. [Authorization for Use of Military Force] and then just said, Hey, executive branch, you can do what you want. And now they want nothing to do with it, and that is not the will of the American people, and it's not the will of the Constitution. So we should repeal the A.U.M.F. and say, Look, Congress, if we want to authorize armed conflict, it should be on you and it should be the will of the people.
This new orientation was reflected in The Time of the Crack and the two novels that followed, The Last of the Country House Murders (1974) and Hotel de Dream (1976).
Mr. Yang was the C.E.O. of a boutique test prep company that was purchased by Kaplan in 2009. The company flourished during the 2008 financial collapse, becoming the country's foremost preparatory company for the GMAT as more people flocked to business school.
What is less clear is whether what works in a primary will be harmful in the general election and whether the cascade of apologies risks making Democrats look like the hypersensitive, politically correct crowd Republicans make them out to be — especially when compared with President Trump, who often insults and offends people and almost never apologizes for anything.
He acknowledged the high price tag but said the nation could not afford to do anything less. The very health of our nation is at stake, Mr. Biden said, speaking from Delaware. We have to act and we have to act now. Here are some of the highlights of Mr. Biden's so-called American Rescue Plan: The rescue proposal would be financed entirely through increased federal borrowing, and flows from the idea that the virus and the recovery are intertwined.
Mr. Brady described Mr. Lownes as a swashbuckler who, it was said, discovered Brooks Brothers when he was still in diapers.
Ms. Bezos, 48, is a novelist. But Amazon has defined her public image almost wholly. The announcement this week that she and her husband would be getting a divorce may soon change that. A statement signed Jeff & MacKenzie, which was first posted to Mr. Bezos's Twitter account, read: After a period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends.
Some of the names of these convert intellectuals are widely familiar, and among them John Henry Newman, G. K. Chesterton, Isaac Hecker, Orestes Brownson, Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh, Thomas Merton, and Dorothy Day have all been the subject of more than one major biography. Around Newman, Day, and Merton, indeed, academic subfields have formed, and the existence of the Chesterton Review suggests that the memory of this prolific Londoner is also well tended. But no one has yet written a study of the general impact of converts on Catholic intellectual life in this era or the distinctive style of Catholicism they helped to create. Nor has anyone investigated the extensive transatlantic contacts among these English-speaking Catholic writers. Such is the purpose of this book.
What am I doing here? Has this made any difference to anybody? And if I ever come to that, I'm going to open the folder on that day. And if I get to the end of my life without ever having opened it, that'd be awesome.
Thomas recounts the major moments in an undeniably eventful life. He supported the black power movement in the '60s and '70s and voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980; his conservative turn, he says, was the inevitable reaction to liberal hypocrisy. Clips of Anita Hill testifying at Thomas's confirmation hearings in 1991 appear in the second half of the film, after the filmmakers have taken care not to disturb their admiring portrait of Thomas as a faithful Christian and doting family man. Hill's recollections of sexual harassment get predictably cast as part of a feminist smear campaign designed to destroy him.
We'll be right back. Here's what else you need to know today.
The comment about I wouldn't want to be judged for something 25 years ago was about something completely independent. I think I'd seen something where Joe Biden was being called out for something he'd said 25 years ago, when I said I wouldn't want to be called out for some misstatement I'd made 25 years ago. And then I joked, good thing no one cared about what I was doing 25 years ago, because I was at that point a 20-year-old man, and the internet didn't really have full documentation of how I spent those years.
From the mangroves of the Yucatán watching for green-winged teals to the grand ballet of fly-fishing on the Salmon River in Nova Scotia, Mr. Bryant's often-poetic, first-person accounts took readers to many places, but perhaps none more so than the mythical past, when boys went fishing with their fathers, watched rainbow trout hover above the pebbles in a brook and learned that patience, cultivated during hours in a duck blind, was more than a needlepoint virtue. His insights appealed to many readers who had never set foot in woods or a stream.
As of today--April second--I consider the case Solved. It's closed. It's made. It's down. But yet the solution only points toward further complexity. I have taken a good firm knot and reduced it to a mess of loose ends. This evening I meet with Paulie No. I will ask him two questions. He will give me two answers. And then it's a wrap. This case is the worst case. I wonder: Is it just me? But I know I'm right. It's all true. It's the case. It's the case. Paulie No, as we say, is a state cutter. He cuts for the state. He dissects people's bodies and tells you how come they died.

archived recording (paul howard) We've charged it based upon the facts. And I'm hoping that the people in this country will get away from the little criticisms and understand the broad picture. This is a 27-year-old man who's dead. He didn't have to die. These shootings are continuing to happen all over our country. And I think what those protesters and all over the country, they're not demonstrating because they thought Paul Howard did something political. They're demonstrating because citizens in our country continue to die, and a high number of those citizens are African Americans.
But judgment — delicious, shameful judgment — that we got from beginning to end. Judgment was the series' métier and its medium. Guilt — the guilt laid upon parents and especially mothers — was its true subject. Its strength was in how it let its audience indulge in judgment while the show itself suspended it.

'APPLYING IT LIBERALLY' at Abrons Arts Center, Underground Theater (April 8, 4:45 p.m.). Keisha Zollar and Andrew Kimler are an interracial married couple who both skew liberal when it comes to their politics, but that doesn't mean their viewpoints always gel cohesively — their banter on the podcast they produce together can attest to that. As part of this year's NYC PodFest, they're hosting a live taping, and Abbi Crutchfield and Allison Kilkenny are joining them, for what they describe in part as a candid autopsy of a modern American marriage.
Ms. Vidaurri, who was nicknamed La Calandria, or the Lark, belted out songs with a powerful voice, often making risqué wisecracks during her performances. Based in San Antonio, she sang in Mexico, Cuba and other parts of Latin America, performing with artists like Nat King Cole, Eydie Gorme & Los Panchos and Celia Cruz. By the 1950s she was mentioned alongside such famous Tejana entertainers as Eva Garza and Lydia Mendoza.
A member of the Arizona House of Representatives filed a formal ethics complaint against another member who participated in the protest last Wednesday. Representative César Chávez, a Democrat, called on the House Ethics Committee to investigate Representative Mark Finchem, a Republican, and to recommend Mr. Finchem's expulsion should it find that he supported the violent overthrow of our government.
Right now we have three flagship numbers we're beating the American people over the head with, telling them that things are going great. No. 1, the headline unemployment rate. No. 2, gross domestic product, which is obviously putting up record highs even as our life expectancy is declining. And No. 3, corporate profits and shareholder value. Stock market prices correspond to the fortunes of the top 20 percent of Americans, many of the people, obviously, who live here in Manhattan. The bottom 80 percent of Americans own 8 percent of stock market value. The bottom 50 percent own essentially zero.
You only do all this if you've set up a framework in which exit is not an easy option, in which you're assured the other person's love is not going away, and in which the only way to survive the crises is to go deeper into the relationship itself.

What explains the king's term limit?
Oh, you might not want to push the money to the states and then have them determine how to use it in their budgets. You could empower a national program or an agency to help administer it at the federal level, if you didn't trust the states to actually use it in the right way.
He also called the Abraham Accords — agreements that the Trump administration helped broker for Israel to warm relations with Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates — a good thing.
Others in the party, led by Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, were pushing back hard against a conviction, warning it would harm the party and the country, as federal authorities cautioned about continued violent threats from pro-Trump extremists. With Mr. McConnell sending mixed signals about where he would come down, Republican strategists and seniors aides on Capitol Hill believed he could ultimately swing the result one way or another. If all senators voted, it would take 17 Republicans joining all Democrats to convict Mr. Trump. If they did, it would only take a vote by a simple majority of senators to disqualify Mr. Trump from ever holding office again.
His wife, Gloria Loomis, said the cause was pneumonia.

Some Republicans said Mr. McCarthy, the son of an assistant chief with the Bakersfield Fire Department, has done too much for conservative voters in the region for them to abandon him. They believe his delicate navigation of the events in Washington in recent days — speaking out against impeachment but saying the president bears responsibility for the attack on Congress by rioters — would not hurt him significantly in his district as he eyes becoming speaker of the House in two years. Mr. McCarthy, now entering his eighth term in the House, has become a kingmaker of sorts in Kern County, helping his allies climb the political ranks, and enjoys a reservoir of good will among Republicans. But the events of this month in Washington have brought Mr. McCarthy, 55, more criticism than he is accustomed to in his hometown. Manny Fernandez and

When Bernice Sandler was a schoolgirl in the 1930s and '40s, she was annoyed that she was not allowed to do things that boys could do, like be a crossing guard, fill the inkwells or operate the slide projector.
The show's creators — the accomplished and ambitious playwright and screenwriter Moira Buffini and the actress Alison Newman — set an unflagging pace in the two episodes available for review, with dialogue that's sufficiently crisp and performances that are entertaining enough to keep you interested, even if the story feels a little hollow at the core.

Far from a fantasy, but not quite a nightmare, State Like Sleep is a thriller without thrills, where every setting that was once familiar has become loaded with a sense of dread. It pauses before turning any corner, anticipating horrors that never satisfyingly arrive.

NO TIME TO SPARE: Thinking About What Matters, by Ursula K. Le Guin. (Mariner, $14.99.) Long revered as a master of fantasy writing, Le Guin turned to blogging late in life, writing about everything from feminism to aging to breakfast. This collection brings together some of her best blog posts. There's a lot that will delight fans of Le Guin, who died last year: The pages sparkle with lines that make a reader glance up, searching for an available ear with which to share them, our reviewer, Melissa Febos, wrote.
In the annihilated aftermath of her third divorce, the words return, and Ditlevsen publishes, in 1968, her great novel, The Faces. Republished in Britain this year, it captures the dissociated mental state of a children's author, Lise, who hallucinates voices and faces, the latter — disembodied, floating, often those of children — inspiring the book's singular prose. Some of them, especially girls, had had to live out their mother's childhood while their own lay hidden in a secret drawer, Lise explains. Their voices would break out of them like pus from a sore, and the sound would frighten them, just like when they discovered that someone had been reading their diary, even though it was locked up among the junk and old toys from the time they had worn the discarded face of a 4-year-old. That face would stare up at them from among the tops and crippled dolls with innocent, astonished glass eyes.
The President of the United States has committed a serious transgression, said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader.Among other things, he took an oath to God to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, and then he failed to do so, not once, but several times. To ignore this, he said, is to undermine the rule of law. [Excerpts from the debate, pages 31-32.]
For his part, Dr. Glauber became intrigued by an experiment, performed in 1956 by the British astronomers Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss, to measure the apparent angular diameter of visible stars. (The angular size of a star is essentially how large the dot of light appears in the night sky.) The two scientists had set up two detectors, which received photons and sent them to a central device for measurements.

ABC, which broadcasts the Oscars, said last week that the ceremony, viewed by roughly 30 million people in the United States, would not have a host for the second year in a row. Hosting is a thankless job that many celebrities turn down; fully vetting a host (scrubbing their social media accounts for potentially offensive comments) is time-consuming and far from foolproof; and last year's host-free show stopped the ratings free-fall.
By the 1950s some converts had persuaded themselves that their highbrow evangelizing effort was gaining ever more ground and that a demoralized secularist enemy was on the verge of capitulation, ready to throw itself into the arms of the pope. Not for the first time they were indulging in wishful thinking. Even as they made their hopeful prophecies, the long Catholic rear guard against modernity began to collapse from within. Catholic academics, priests and laity alike, began to question the adequacy of a scholastic and natural law approach to all issues. The church reformed itself at the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), abandoning its intransigence toward the outside world and looking with a new sympathy both on the Catholic innovations of recent decades and on the non-Catholic branches of Christianity. It belatedly opened itself to scientific and philosophical systems that for a century it had repudiated, and at the same time it surrendered some of the characteristics that had made its outlook distinctive. By the 1970s many of the special qualities of Catholic scholarship were disappearing, or else were confined to the angry handful of traditionalists who refused to forsake the ways of a lifetime. Ironically some of the intransigents were intellectuals who had converted to get away from modernism in its many guises, only to find that their church too was now negotiating with modernist teachings on all sides. It only compounded the irony that converts had done much to pave the way for these changes.

Gov. Gavin Newsom of California on Thursday authorized the deployment of 1,000 National Guard troops and surrounded the state Capitol grounds in Sacramento with a six-foot, covered chain-link fence to prepare for and respond to credible threats.
Yet, as The Unicorn begins, their inability to pull the marriage trigger is presented as a mystery, especially to Malory's sexually outré parents, who remain so mutually besotted they renew their vows every year. And when, at their 25th anniversary party, their secret is revealed as a fondness for threesomes, Malory and Caleb decide that, hey, maybe an extra pair of hands — a so-called unicorn — would be just the thing to invigorate their own close encounters.

Ms. Cunningham Agee said that until those final weeks, her marriage had been blissful, but people close to the family said the couple had been living in separate wings of their St. Helena home, comparing the arrangement to the 1989 movie War of the Roses. Ms. Cunningham Agee confirmed that they lived on different floors, but said it was because Mr. Agee, whose illness had taken its toll, walked with a cane and couldn't climb stairs.
Mr. Brown and Mr. Gomes both create stage worlds that contain same-sex partnering as well as conventionally heterosexual duets; both allow for those same-sex relationships to be interpreted in sexual terms. Although Mr. Brown is much the least experienced dance-maker of this program's three, he's the one with the strongest sense of structural suspense. One group of four (one woman, three men) is juxtaposed with another of six (three male-female couples); and what he does with each group keeps you wondering what will happen next. A sustained duet for two men looks natural: a study of intimate cooperation.
Mr. Mawhinney, in a long white T-shirt and khaki-colored pants, did not speak during the hearing in State Superior Court. He was ordered held on a $2 million bond.

While reading the best scholarly history of Alexander the Great and his father Philip II, By the Spear, by Ian Worthington, I learned the word cynic derived from the Greek for doglike because Diogenes and the Cynics lived on the streets, urinating, defecating and sleeping like dogs … When Alexander visited Diogenes he asked if he could do anything for him. Diogenes replied Yes, get out of my sunlight. A very sensible hint as to how we should treat celebrities and politicians.

Ms. Yao is the youngest of three children of Ren Zhengfei, the hard-charging leader of Huawei, who has been compared to Steve Jobs for his role in building a company prized in China for its ability to compete with big multinational telecommunications companies like Cisco, Nokia and Ericsson.
As a little boy Marcel could not go to sleep without his mother's kiss; this necessity would become a major theme of Combray, the first section of Remembrance of Things Past. Quite understandably she was worried by these signs of her son's total dependence on her and would attempt to cure him by refusing to indulge him in his whims, but he would become so hysterical if denied a kiss or his mother's tenth good night visit to his bedroom that usually she gave in--or her less rigorous husband would urge her to do so. Not only did Proust not outgrow his dependence; it became the template for his adult loves, since for Proust passion was a nagging need that became only more demanding the more it was denied. Indeed, Proust would drive away all his lovers (in his fiction as in his life) through his unreasonable demands.
Well, among young people, there was just a jolt of excitement. You had this vision of a young person coming into the royal family, which just by itself was exciting. The queen, after all, is in her 90s. Prince Charles, the next king, is in his 70s. And then there was the nature of this person coming into the family.
Jews have faced dangers in the past, but this time we may be unprepared to confront the newest threat to our survival as a people, because its principal cause is our own success as individuals. Our long history of victimization has prepared us to defend against those who would destroy us out of hatred; indeed, our history has forged a Jewish identity far too dependent on persecution and victimization by our enemies. But today's most serious threats come not from those who would persecute us, but from those who would, without any malice, kill us with kindness--by assimilating us, marrying us, and merging with us out of respect, admiration, and even love. The continuity of the most influential Jewish community in history is at imminent risk, unless we do something dramatic now to confront the quickly changing dangers.
Near the end of the novel, Lizzie reads about a group of cloistered monks who say, We have died and we are in love with everything. Weather understands that we can still be in love with what happens on a dying planet, and that life is always many things at once — full of love, full of despair, full of slobber frogs and melting glaciers and babies who won't nap; that what happens on one scale doesn't negate the others. But democratizing these scales can also become an alibi for complacency — for allowing us to shift back into the daily, the private, the emotional, as crutch or buffer. Weather suggests the comfort and peril of that retreat by narrating the life of a woman for whom retreat is becoming impossible. What happens when the horror of climate change gets lodged so deep under our skin we can't escape it any longer? What happens when an author manages to translate this horror from an abstraction to a gripping tale of immediate particulars?
But it has also held up a mirror to our society, reflecting in its deadly wake, resource gaps and medical disparities, the inequality we've allowed to calcify. Science at its core is a social phenomenon. It is a reflection of people, of our relationships and of our institutions. When we provide inputs to the algorithm, when we program the device, when we design, test and research, we are making human choices, choices that bring our social world to bear in a new and powerful way. It matters who makes these choices. The science behind climate change is not a hoax. The science behind the virus is not partisan. The same laws apply. The same evidence holds true regardless of whether or not you accept them. And President-elect Biden and I will not only listen to science, we will invest in it. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris introduced key members of their White House science team on Saturday. Credit Credit... Amr Alfiky/The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Saturday that he was always going to lead with science and truth as he announced top science and technology officials on his White House staff, reaffirming trust in the kind of expert research that the Trump administration often ignored or disdained. Extolling what he called some of the most brilliant minds in the world, Mr. Biden said his new team's mission would be to ask: How can we make the impossible possible?

If public attention glared on Lindbergh during the hunt for his son, it positively poured down on him with the arrest and trial of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a Bronx carpenter, in 1934. The trial, which Lindbergh attended daily, was reported with diligence and sensationalism. Lindbergh received up to 100,000 letters a week, and the Hopewell estate, which he had long since left, was overrun with curiosity seekers, one of whom dug up and lugged off the earth where the baby was found buried. A Move to England After a six-week trial, in which a web of circumstantial evidence was women about Hauptmann, he was found guilty and executed. Although there were doubts (Hauptmann, the German-born father of a son about the age of Lindbergh's son, denied he was guilty), Lindbergh was satisfied that Hauptmann did the thing. Meantime, there were new threats to kidnap Lindbergh's second son, Jon, and the family was living an abnormal existence. Lindbergh was telling friends that Americans exhibited a morbid curiosity over crimes and murder trials and lacked respect for law, or the rights of others. Against this background, Lindbergh took his family to England to seek a safe, secluded residence away from the tremendous public hysteria that surrounded him in the United States. One result of the case was passage of the so-called Lindbergh law, which made kidnapping a Federal crime. Part of the statute was ruled unconstitutional in 1967. Before departing, Lindbergh completed a scientific project on which he had been working with dedication and enthusiasm since 1930.
That too. I mean, it's rough. But I mean, New York's going through — I just want to bring some things to you from experience. Like yeah, the infrastructure breaking down. I mean, we're coasting on the investments made decades ago and they're starting to fall apart. But also what you all do in terms of journalism — I've been campaigning around the country and over 1,200 local papers have gone out of business because the local establishments that used to advertise are gone. All of their classified revenue went off to Craigslist and democracy works much less if you don't have local journalism.
As for your hurt feelings, they seem reasonable. Personally, I would be less hurt by her assessment of my looks (until I inspected her cosmetic surgery, anyway) than by her shame at associating with me. Still, you have shared your honest feelings, and she rejected them. If you are committed to this friendship, I would never dissuade you from trying again. But as my (brutally efficient) nana used to say: No use watering dead flowers. And don't out her as 50-something. Two wrongs. …
No, let me just get through this, because I think it's important. That concept, it may be very well-intentioned — I don't see race. But the thinking is that it's actually dangerous, because if a person says, I don't see race, then what you may actually be saying is that you don't see Black people as different from white people, or as treated differently. And then, therefore, you don't see racism. And it means that no measures will be put in place to acknowledge that the reality of being a Black person is different than the lived reality of being a white person, right? So the point being, it's actually important to see race. It's important to see race in order to change policing. I mean, what do you think of that?
In addition to The Fall of Lucifer, which, considering the execution time required, was probably commissioned, Rauwaert owned at least 15 paintings by Cornelis, including two other major canvases: Two Followers of Cadmus Devoured by a Dragon (1588) and Hercules and Achelous (1590). The Dragon — which occasioned a magnificent engraving based on its design by Goltzius, his first collaboration with Cornelis, dedicated to their patron — portrays the dreadful beast sinking its teeth into the face of one chap and its claws into the meaty, decapitated body of another. It doesn't look like he's being devoured, said Aaron Hyman, assistant professor of art history at Johns Hopkins University, when I remarked on the painting's sadistic relish. It's more like he's being tortured. In Rauwaert's third important Cornelis painting, Hercules and Achelous, the hero is seen grasping the horn of a river god that has taken the form of a bull.
BA: I want to ask you about the — Oh, sorry, go ahead.
Harmful effects of unemployment are felt by men and women, but men are more likely to experience negative health effects including depression and increased risk of suicide.
For Anna (Maggie Siff), the 44-year-old star of a popular, long-running television series in Los Angeles, burnout is imminent. Weakened by an autoimmune disease and weary of her brittle character, she abandons the series and returns to New York City to reconnect with the friends and collaborators who helped spark her career. But a lot can happen in two decades, and Anna is about to learn that the bits of ourselves we leave behind can't always be reclaimed.
KK: I want to move on to some other questions, but I actually have one last for you, which is why run as a Democratic versus a Republican if you have such bipartisan issues?
All the while, the Dann sisters — who spent most of their lives on what had been their fathers' 800-acre ranch — continued living in a manner reminiscent of their ancestors. As late as 2002, when Carrie Dann was approaching 70 and Mary was nearly 80, they were still breaking in horses and mending fences. They eschewed electricity, hot water and even furnaces, The New York Times reported.

Mm-hm! Neumann says, the brightness of his tone betraying that he has no idea.
Mr. Biden has decided that instead of bypassing Mr. Norquist and plucking Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy to run the Pentagon until there is a confirmed defense secretary, he will adhere to standard tradition. Under federal law, a confirmed deputy secretary automatically assumes the duties of the secretary during an absence. The decision to keep Mr. Norquist until a defense secretary is confirmed was first reported by Politico. Mr. Kirby, for his part, is a veteran government public affairs officer and a respected figure at the Pentagon. A retired Navy rear admiral, Mr. Kirby made a jump from the Pentagon to the State Department in 2015, and worked closely with Mr. Kerry during the Iran nuclear negotiations and for the last two years of the Obama administration. Mr. Kirby worked with Mr. Austin when they were both on the Joint Staff under Admiral Mullen, during the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. He also spent a year as the Pentagon spokesman under Mr. Hagel, and has been the spokesman for the Navy as well as for retired Admiral Mullen when he was chairman.
Today the clauses are widespread in sports, television and advertising. Religious publishers have used them for at least 15 years, which seems fair enough. You can't condemn a Christian publisher that cancels publication of a book called The Ridiculously Good Marriage after the author is accused of having sexually assaulted an underage girl when he was a youth pastor. (He apologized for a sexual incident.) Children's publishers have been including the clauses for a decade or more, and they, too, have a case. It would be challenging to sell a children's book written by a pedophile.
Ms. Court is scheduled to be awarded the Companion of the Order of Australia on Tuesday, Australia Day, for her service as a tennis player and as a mentor to young athletes. The honor falls under the Order of Australia, which confers public recognition for outstanding achievement and service.
In his press conference, the district attorney came out and stated that Officer Brosnan, the second officer on the scene, had turned state witness, and he was going to testify against Officer Rolfe. That ended up not being true. Less than 10 minutes after that statement came out, the attorney for Officer Brosnan said that had never happened. He was not going to testify against the other officer. He never said he would turn state witness. He's never pled guilty to any charges. And he has cooperated with the D.A. — meaning answering questions and stuff — but he's never said that he would be state witness. So the question then becomes, if you're not telling the truth now or you're having inconsistencies, how can we believe your report? Or, did you just do a shoddy investigation? If that's the case, you should have allowed what we consider the professionals — which is an unbiased outside agency from Atlanta, the G.B.I. They're the state organization that does this.
The director Peter Bogdanovich had cast the girl, an acting novice, opposite her father, Ryan O'Neal, with whom he worked on the 1972 farce What's Up, Doc? At the time, O'Neal said he hoped the new movie would bring him closer to his restless daughter, who was estranged from her mother, the actress Joanna Moore. This was the first opportunity to try to channel her energy and mind into something constructive, he told People in 1974. And give her what she never had enough of — love.
The world premiere of The New Englanders by Jeff Augustin (Little Children Dream of God), about a mixed-race family searching for happiness in a quiet New England town, will follow, in an Off Broadway run at City Center Stage II, also as part of Manhattan Theater Club's new season.
With rampant state violence and the absence of any semblance of justice, Egyptian society is beyond polarized — it is broken. The targeting and dehumanization has extended beyond Islamists. Now anyone who dares to challenge the status quo is demonized. Families remain strained, political differences seem existential, dinner tables still have empty seats. Many weddings, birthdays and funerals are missed because of imprisonment, exile or exclusion. The hate, anger and vengeance have somehow overrun human decency.
The other way is that many of these competitive markets end up very quickly accelerating toward one or two winners and saying, I'm going to break you up. Does not solve that problem. I joke that it would be cruel and unusual punishment to say you have to use the fourth-best navigation app. Like what is that? Apple Maps. We all hate Apple Maps, right? If you use that thing, you're like, Oh. You curse the gods until you figure out how to get Google Maps going. So going up and saying, Look, you're the winner in the space. We're going to break you up, it doesn't revive Main Street businesses, and it doesn't actually end up solving the competition problem.
No creo que nos hayamos dado suficiente crédito, dijo Kelly McGonigal, psicóloga de la salud y profesora de la Universidad de Stanford y autora de The Willpower Instinct. No creo que hayamos tenido el aprecio emocional que necesitamos y merecemos por el tipo de año que mucha gente ha tenido, dijo McGonigal. La reflexión que se necesita es una mirada real, honesta y autocompasiva sobre lo que se ha perdido, quién se ha perdido y qué es lo que se quiere elegir para recordar el año 2020. La reflexión es una manera de estar listo para avanzar hacia el nuevo año. Digo eso todos los años, pero creo que es especialmente cierto para este 2021.
It's been interesting, to say the least.
Democrats and progressives will be so thrilled to have defeated Donald Trump, they will love the fact that we're going to put buying power into families' hands, make children stronger and healthier. But here's the great thing: The Republicans will look up and say, Wait a minute, do I hate the Freedom Dividend? And they look up, and they notice only one state's had a dividend for almost 40 years, and it's Alaska, a deep red conservative state, that was passed by a Republican governor.
We'll be right back. So Mark, what does happen next in this story?
The meanings that flow from ballet are not only about gender. Yet the use of pointwork places the woman on a different level of being.
In 1995, she convinced her family to stay on her beloved island during a visit to California. They rented a small house on Garnet Avenue, and it took only a few days of watching the electric Duffy boats on the harbor and strolling along the shops on Marine Avenue, Balboa Island's main drag, for Ms. Maly to make up her mind.
Running a successful arts nonprofit is difficult, even in a boom economy.
Particularly because I think we've become unduly vindictive and punitive toward statements that people find objectionable. A friend of mine said something, he said, If the online universe descends on someone, and they lose their job, the online universe moves on a week later, but that person still does not have a job a week later. That the impact on the individual lasts much, much longer than the rancor. So I shared this.
How Two Pioneering Sisters Brought Medicine to Women and Women to Medicine
His parents were Christian fundamentalists who went to church two times every Sunday. Rauschenberg had ample opportunity to hear about the torments of hell, which piqued his imagination. In 1958, in an application for a Guggenheim grant, he proposed that he illustrate Dante's Inferno in 34 drawings, one for each canto.
The vaccination rate picked up considerably last week, after the holiday period ended, and a number of governors announced plans to allow a broader swath of citizens to get shots. But states that expand the availability of the inoculations — announcing that people over 70, for example, can now get the vaccine — are finding demand so intense that online registration portals quickly overload and crash, call lines get flooded and available supply is exhausted in a matter of hours. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced Friday that he would release almost all available vaccine immediately after taking office on Jan. 20, rather than conserving half of it to ensure everyone who gets a first dose will also get a second a few weeks later. Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican, said on Sunday that whether doses should be conserved was a really interesting debate, because of concerns over whether production can be stepped up to get second shots to people in time. I just want to make sure we get as many out as fast as possible, without endangering people with regard to the second dose, he said on CNN's State of the Union. The Biden team is to announce this week a plan for ramping up the vaccination rate, including setting up vaccination sites run by the federal government in places like sports stadiums and high school gymnasiums. But Dr. Gottlieb said pharmacies, too, needed to quickly start offering the vaccine to their customers.
Between network, cable and streaming, the modern television landscape is a vast one. Here are some of the shows, specials and movies coming to TV this week, Jan. 11-Jan. 17. Details and times are subject to change.
DINARDO We've had a maximum of 12 people auditioning in a room that could, pre-Covid, fit well over 60. It's a little different than we're used to, with all the protocols, but I'm excited. It's a snapshot into our immediate future.
Colonel Tom, you know I love you and I'd never lie to you. But it seems your baby girl took her own life, sir. Yes she did. Yes she did.
Besides showcasing some of the best-known entries in their catalogs, the participants in this songwriters round, a charity event called The First and the Worst, were asked to share some of their greenest, most embarrassing output for the audience's amusement. So the Osbornes offered Don't Bring the Redneck Out in Me, a song that reeled off rowdy, boastful good ol' boy stereotypes. Midway through a line about having three children and a wife, T.J., 33 and lanky with a long face and combed-back hair, paused to wryly point out that at 16, this was what he'd thought country songs were supposed to be like.
RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil's far-right government has a message for adolescents as the nation grapples with a stubbornly high teenage pregnancy rate and rising H.I.V. infections: Save sex for marriage.
And the newspapers pointed out that taking these private jet flights left an enormous carbon footprint. Also, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle embarked on a very expensive renovation of the cottage that they were gifted by Queen Elizabeth on the grounds of Windsor Castle. This is known as Frogmore Cottage. And the couple authorized a $3 million renovation that was paid for by taxpayer money.
There are the Complete Disaster videos, where laundry, dirty dishes, grime and clutter have overwhelmed what would normally be an attractive house and the influencer restores order, sometimes in a video condensing two or three days of cleaning into 45 minutes.

Meg Wolitzer's new novel, The Female Persuasion, seems uncannily timely, a prescient marriage of subject and moment that addresses a great question of the day: how feminism passes down, or not, from one generation to the next.
Diane is problematic, though. Ms. George (The (Curious Case of the) Watson Intelligence) describes her in a stage direction as a butch charm factory, and charisma is as vital to the success of Diane's mission as it is to the success of the play. She needs to get the women in her thrall and seduce the audience as well.
Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip, who had helped make Livingston the Speaker-designate and has been one of the fiercest critics of Clinton, choked back tears as he praised Livingston. He said his friend understood what this debate was all about.
Decades later, in 2007, Mr. Cannon, a Massachusetts native, wanted to rework the song into a rally ditty for his favorite baseball team, the Boston Red Sox. But, he told The Boston Globe, he received a complaint from Mr. Barris, a Yankee fan, and so Down at Fenway Park ended up being a Cannon original rather than a repurposed Barris.
Here are other developments in the fallout from the Capitol siege: A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a bill in the House on Thursday to award Eugene Goodman, a Capitol Police officer, the Congressional Gold Medal because of his efforts to keep the violent mob of Trump supporters from accessing the Senate last week. Mr. Goodman was captured on video running up the stairs in the Capitol. The F.B.I. has warned police departments across the country to be on high alert for extremist activity and violence in their communities ahead of the inauguration next week. It also cautioned law enforcement agencies to look for armed militias and extremists who want to trigger a race war.
Does Dante count as one of Rauschenberg's collaborators? Probably more than Charles Atlas, a video artist prized for his work with choreographers. Now 68, Mr. Atlas is still lanky and boyish, with sideburns that are dyed psychedelic orange. Someone had the good idea to hire me, he said with a chuckle when we met recently at MoMA. It's the first time they have hired an artist to do anything like this. Mr. Atlas is designing the video portion of the show, including a nine-channel installation to commemorate 9 Evenings, a series of quixotic performances that Rauschenberg spearheaded in 1966 with his engineer-friend Billy Kluver, in the hope of forming a brave new alliance between art and technology.
Wow, I love this question. There are many causes of poverty, and the fact that we're not able to put food into people's houses and on their tables is a structural problem. My campaign's based upon the premise that we're going through this profound economic transformation, the fourth industrial revolution. And one of the major problems is that we still pretend we're in the economy of the '70s or '80s.
Zoe Zaharakis, a freshman at Temple University, had heard about the event from a friend in Bethlehem, Pa., and brought along two of her roommates as she said she was weighing a choice between Mr. Bloomberg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

Well, I would suggest that one side has been acting as if it is an arms race. And so, in that environment, it's only appropriate to respond in a way that you think would help move the country and our legal system in the right direction. Can I talk — oh.
President Trump has threatened retaliation against Iran by striking Iranian sites including some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture. If carried out, this threat would constitute a war crime under international instruments such as the 1954 Hague Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, which the United States has joined. The American military has a proud history of avoiding intentional damage to and destruction of cultural sites, which began with President Abraham Lincoln's law of war manual, known as the Lieber Code.
The Regime of Covenants acknowledges the fact that we don't really choose our most important attachments the way you choose a toaster. In the flux of life you meet some breathtakingly amazing people, usually in the swirl of complex circumstances. There is a sense of being blown around by currents more astounding than you can predict and control. Mostly you're bumblingly trying to figure out the right response to the moments you're in.
Gene Reynolds, an Emmy-winning producer and director who was a force behind two of the most acclaimed television series of the 1970s and early '80s, M*A*S*H and Lou Grant, died on Monday in Burbank, Calif. He was 96.
Yeah, so that was by design. As far as working on stage compared to film, the work itself is very different. In a play, you go through a beginning, middle, and end every single performance. Whereas in film and television, you do bits and pieces. You might have a day where it's emotional, and then the next seven days, it's not. So it's much more tiring for me to do a play on a long run than it is to do film. You have moments when you can shut down and relax and rest.
Before the mob breached the Capitol, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, overseeing the certification of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory and debate over a Republican effort to subvert those results in certain states, admonished Republicans for having too many people on the floor and for some objectors refusing to wear masks as they spoke. As the 117th Congress reconvened a week ago, multiple lawmakers tested positive for the coronavirus after taking their oath. Late Wednesday, one Republican, Representative Jake LaTurner of Kansas, received positive test results after voting on the House floor to overturn Arizona's results and did not return for a second vote early Thursday. It was unclear where Mr. LaTurner was sheltering in place as the mob tried to break into the House chamber, but in a statement issued shortly before 3 a.m. on Thursday, his office said he was not experiencing symptoms. Because lawmakers qualified for early access to the coronavirus vaccine, many have received at least one shot of a two-dose vaccine, with some receiving both doses. Some congressional aides have been authorized to receive the two-dose vaccine.
On some days, the line at the city's famed Marriage License Bureau — where the engaged need nothing more than photo IDs and a $77 fee — wraps around the block.
Well, in this case, what's interesting is it's up to the employer, and it was NBC and Saturday Night Live. Even as I made the statement saying I didn't think he should be fired, I thought he probably would be fired. Because if you're NBC and SNL, you look up and say, what is my upside for keeping this guy? He's not exactly a huge moneymaker, he hasn't worked a day on the set. Like, that's not a really powerful set of incentives. And so I thought they probably would fire him. I'd suggest that the extent there are consequences for people's misstatements, they should be somewhere commensurate to the level of power and influence they have and the harm that they're doing. In Shane Gillis's case, he was a comedian. I'd never heard of the guy before.
Wright is touching in her portrayal of a woman stepping out into the unknown. But Pauline hasn't yet played a large enough role in the series to warrant this much time, especially when there are such tantalizing glimpses of Bette and Joan, alternately freaking out and relishing the experience of being in a hit again. The script (by Tim Minear and Gina Welch) sometimes veers toward pandering in Pauline's scenes. (Pauline tells Mamacita that her own mother wasted her life in marriage and child rearing, and then adds, Not that there's anything wrong with domestic work.) The points made about women and power in Hollywood are important ones, but they are more effective circling in the electrically charged orbit of Davis-Crawford.
These are some of the thousands of people who have been immunized against the coronavirus at hospitals affiliated with Columbia University, New York University, Harvard and Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, even as millions of frontline workers and older Americans are waiting their turns. Some of the institutions were among the first recipients of the limited supplies in the United States. The C.D.C. never intended to include workers who don't interact with patients, like administrators and graduate students, in the first tier of priority vaccinations, said Dr. Stanley Perlman, an immunologist at the University of Iowa and a member of the committee that issued the recommendations. This all got so confusing, he said. In retrospect, I think it probably needed to be a little more exact on what we were thinking, because we were never thinking about hospital administrators.
Jenny Offill's third novel, Weather, balances concerns about the slow apocalypse of climate change with the daily texture of the narrator's life as a Brooklyn wife and mother who works as a university librarian. Leslie Jamison reviews it on the cover of this week's Book Review, and visits the podcast to talk about the novel and Offill's work in general.
Because that narrowing list has begun to exclude not just some of the most exciting performances and films of the season, but also many of the movies directed by women or featuring people of color. And though the academy, which is due to release its nominations next week, has taken great pains to diversify itself since the years of #OscarsSoWhite, this past week suggests that other awards bodies still have a lot of soul-searching to do, and that this issue may require a total shift in what's considered weighty and worthy.
KK: We've called for that, too.
A few days later, Jodi has completed her quest and fulfilled her decades-old promise to Paula. Except the abused boy, Ricky, is now a troubled and troubling adult, rescued but not always grateful to his savior. Along the way Jodi has also found a new locus of desire, Miranda — a beautiful, impulsive young woman with an addictive personality and three young children from her broken marriage to a faded country music star. Jodi and Miranda's complex relationship, with its tough and delicate moments of attraction and then romance, shapes one of the book's strongest movements.
We'll be right back. On June 12, less than three weeks after George Floyd's killing in Minneapolis, a police officer in Atlanta responded to a 911 call from a Wendy's employee, who reported that a man had fallen asleep in the drive-through lane. That man was 27-year-old Rashard Brooks.
archived recording (bryan cranston) The boy you hit this morning is Jimmy Baxter's son. That's who you killed. Jimmy Baxter is the head of the most vicious crime family in the history of this city. Do you understand what that means?
I don't know who the goddess Gaya is, but that's not my God. I was just like, That's it. Click -- stopped the radio. Went over to the closet, pulled out my concert shirts and threw them in the trash can. Pulled out my James Taylor CD's -- dunk. See ya, James. Magat summed it up this way: You have to detach from these things, or you become numb to them. We're trying to live as a sign of contradiction in the world. But living as a sign of contradiction is not the same as retreating from the world altogether, and the seminarians struggle to achieve what they regard as the ideal balance: being in the world but not of it, a phrase they often repeat. They see themselves as witnesses -- testifying through their very presence and clerical attire to the Catholic Church and all that it holds true. Bashista provided an example: in the gym at Mount Saint Mary's, college students sometimes play music whose lyrics he finds objectionable. It's an opportunity, he said. It's a time to evangelize. You don't go up and rip the tape out, but you say: 'Can you share with me some of those words? I'm not sure I'm hearing them right.' A lot of times they don't even know what the words are. It's got to be proposing, not imposing, which is the tougher way. It's our Lord's way. Witnessing is crucial, say the seminarians, because the world is starving for the message they represent.
I would do the same thing.
Mark, what has been the reaction inside Britain to this seismic disruption to the royal family?
What are the true threats of the 21st century? Climate change is number one, and then cybersecurity and A.I., loose nuclear material, military drones in the hands of nonstate actors. It's very hard to secure a location from something the size of a flying vacuum cleaner. That's very, very difficult. So we're entering an era where it's going to be much easier to be offensive than defensive, and you don't need massive levels of resources to cause significant levels of damage. To me, a new aircraft carrier does not make our elections any more secure from Russian hacking, which is the most direct threat to our democracy upcoming in this cycle. We're spending money on the threats of the 20th century, and we need to try and modernize our approach as quickly as possible.
CARTER The 2020 nominations are shameful. I love Scarlett Johansson [nominated for both Marriage Story and Jojo Rabbit]. If she had played two very different characters in the same film the way that Lupita Nyong'o did in Us, might that have been deemed worthy of a nomination?
But Texas students will read that some critics dismissed the quality of literature produced.

Every subsequent culture-war battle, in Caldwell's account — the debates over feminism and gay marriage, transgender rights and immigration — follows the lines of this constitutional division. The new constitutionalists are constantly discovering new rights and empowering courts and bureaucracies to enforce them; the old constitutionalists object, win a few elections on the objection and then find themselves defeated nonetheless. And this pattern of defeat is responsible, he implies, for the Trumpian turn: After so many failures to defend the old Constitution, Trump-era conservatives are embracing the logic of the new one, choosing white-identity politics because in the new constitutional dispensation that began in 1964, group identities are the only ones that count.
Stern's interest in Karadzic isn't purely academic. As the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, she writes about her deep curiosity about the causes of evil, and of a persistent desire to make creative use of the sequelae of childhood trauma. Ten years ago, she published a memoir, Denial, which recounted in unsparing detail how her grandfather molested her, and how a 15-year-old Stern and her younger sister were raped at gunpoint after a stranger entered their home.
But it isn't just scale. The numbers tell a story. Only eight works from the 1980s and '90s are being revived, in effect conceding that that era was, as it is now generally remembered, a gloomy mourning period of anxiety, short on pathbreaking inspiration. Five of those eight are by Peter Martins, who has led City Ballet since Balanchine's death, and who, despite considerable skill, didn't turn out to be his equal as a genius choreographer.

Throughout Billions, we've witnessed Bobby Axelrod, a fearsome hedge-fund billionaire, trying to leverage his way into New York's powerful elite, but to only limited success. Nothing makes him happier than bullying an old-money family off their turf, as he did when he snapped up the naming rights to a performing arts building in the first season. But more often, that same aggression and lust for power and credibility makes him seem gauche, a nouveau riche sleaze who may know how to work the angles on Wall Street, but who doesn't speak the language of high society. For all his diabolical brilliance, he often comes across as a Beverly Hillbilly in designer slacks.
Yes. I would say probably so. Could somebody, because of their upbringing and how they've lived their life and everything, subconsciously do that? Yeah. And the main reason that I would have to say yes is, when you're in a stressful situation, technically, you don't think. Your subconscious takes over, and you react. When a law enforcement officer has their training that they go through, you know, you try to just train that if you're going to be in a stressful situation, that your training is going to take over — not your thought process. So with that being said, your subconscious — if you've trained yourself over your years of living a certain way, and maybe you've, I don't know, suppressed those because it's not societally acceptable, and you're trying to be a good person in society, that under a stressful situation, could that bias come out, unstbeknowingly? I mean, that only would make common sense, since scientifically, it actually, it works. In training in and in other stuff. So yeah, I could see that that could be a true statement.
Ms. Macron first met Mr. Macron when he was 15 and she was his teacher, married with three children, at a high school in Amiens, France. The two became close after Mr. Macron asked her to help him rewrite sections of a play. Before Mr. Macron moved to Paris to continue his schooling, he declared, at age 17, that he would one day marry his teacher. He did, in 2007.
Studying him, of course, can have a disastrous effect on a young writer, who either comes under the influence of Proust's dangerously idiosyncratic and contagious style or who feels that Proust has already done everything possible in the novel form. Even Walter Benjamin, who became Proust's German translator, wrote the philosopher Theodor Adorno that he did not want to read one more word by Proust than was actually necessary for him to translate because otherwise he would become addictively dependent, which would be an obstacle to his own production.
KK: O.K. Moving onto a perhaps slightly less serious topic.
The Gendys, who live in Fresh Meadows, Queens, base their volunteerism at St. Mary and St. Antonios Coptic Orthodox Church in Ridgewood, where they have been members for more than 30 years. Membership at the church increased significantly after the fall of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in 2011. The subsequent rise of the Muslim Brotherhood prompted many Copts — members of the country's Orthodox Christian minority — to flee for the United States.
Yeah, that I've heard, too. That apparently I am racist because I say I don't see color.
Well, that's your assumption that Brooks wouldn't stop and turn around and come back. It was evident that he was running, yes. But if he decided to stop and come back, it could have been used.
In the 1970s, as a member of the band Wagon Wheels, he played alongside the singer Thomas Mapfumo, who would become the only other Zimbabwean musician with a reputation to rival his. Mr. Mapfumo left the country in the 1990s and became well known in the West. Mr. Mtukudzi stayed, and cemented his status as the country's most renowned musician.
Mike, I want you to go notify Colonel Tom. And Miriam. This hour.
Oh, I think the market will work beautifully toward what it's designed to do. The market is designed for maximal capital efficiency, and it is doing a phenomenal job. That's why you see the returns on capital outstripping the returns on labor at historic levels. The market is not designed to maximize human well-being.
Nick Fox: Can I clarify one point on taxation? Are you proposing any new or increased taxes on the wealthiest Americans or corporations, or is it strictly the VAT?
Because of an editing error, a picture caption with an article on Sunday about a new rule that will allow federal agencies to disregard climate change when assessing the environmental impact of infrastructure projects misidentified a pipeline in Walsh County, N.D. While the pipeline in the photo is part of the Keystone system, it is not a part of the Keystone XL phase.
To me, the economic imbalances are causing many of our other problems. If you look up and down the line, health problems, poor educational attainment and results, even political polarization, they stem from the fact that we have this pervasive financial insecurity where 78 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Almost half can't afford an unexpected $400 or $500 bill. If you can't pay next month's rent, it's very hard to worry about climate change. I come and talk to you and say, Hey, we need to fight climate change. And you look up and say like, I'm worried about next month. Next year, next decade has to wait in line.

No matter what the age of its author, 'The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter' would be a remarkable book, Feld started. When one reads that Carson McCullers is a girl of 22 it becomes more than that. Maturity does not cover the quality of her work. It is something beyond that, something more akin to the vocation of pain to which a great poet is born.
Reviewing A United Kingdom for The New York Times, Glenn Kenny said the best reason to see the film was Mr. Oyelowo's performance and added, It is remarkable, genuinely riveting work. One scene in particular encapsulates the performance: an open-air meeting at which he must convince his countrymen that he should remain their king and that they should accept his wife. In an interview at The Times, Mr. Oyelowo, who was also a producer of the film, explained how, for this scene, he drew on his own life as well as historical research. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation:
In 1947, the concern was Communism, and morality clauses gave studios a way to blacklist the Hollywood 10, a group of directors and screenwriters who denounced the House Un-American Activities Committee as illegitimate and refused to say whether they'd ever been Communists. All 10 went to jail, and all but one, who decided to cooperate with the committee, became unemployable until the 1960s, though some continued to write under pseudonyms.
Nick Fox: Can I clarify one point on taxation? Are you proposing any new or increased taxes on the wealthiest Americans or corporations, or is it strictly the VAT?
It's like literally the polar opposite take on the exact same piece of fruit.
A bigger issue is that a wealth tax may not be constitutional. The 16th Amendment provides only for an income tax. The estate, gift and generation-skipping taxes pass muster because they're deemed excise taxes on the transfer of wealth, not on the wealth itself.
Instead, it creates an either-or dualism from the difference between man and woman. He does most of the partnering (traditionally, all of it). She rises onto point. When he does the same (seldom), the effect is comic. The foot is a relatively tiny part of the body; yet its significance becomes colossal.

At the door to Jennifer's apartment I was met by Silvera. Silvera. He and myself have worked many cases. We have stood together, like this, in many a stricken home. But not quite like this.
He looks familiar, she said, but meanwhile, she'd had the good luck to be with a new tablemate, Eleanor. Her third marriage, her last, we think. It's an ancient story, the widows providing companionship, one to the other. And protection. Recently, when Lucille started eating Eleanor's cupcake, my mother cried, No, Doodle! That's Doodle's cupcake, not yours. Even though everyone is now Doodle, Eleanor is the significant Doodle. How miraculous, that when so much is lost there is still the possibility of deep friendship; the name is immaterial. The two women have an affinity beyond words, but they also share jokes that sometimes extend for as long as 10 seconds. There is comfort sitting silently side by side, comfort, I'm sure, knowing they are together in the same strange boat.
I enjoyed it, and thank you.
As the gay rights movement spread from San Francisco and New York in the 1970s, Mr. Baker was often asked by friends aware of his creative talents to make banners for protests and marches. His creations, like others during that time, often included the pink triangle, which protesters had claimed as an icon after its initial use by the Nazis to identify gay men in concentration camps during World War II.
Democrats and progressives will be so thrilled to have defeated Donald Trump, they will love the fact that we're going to put buying power into families' hands, make children stronger and healthier. But here's the great thing: The Republicans will look up and say, Wait a minute, do I hate the Freedom Dividend? And they look up, and they notice only one state's had a dividend for almost 40 years, and it's Alaska, a deep red conservative state, that was passed by a Republican governor.

DESSAU, Germany — Tourists in this sleepy town would be hard-pressed to find any trace of Kurt Weill, the composer of The Threepenny Opera and other acclaimed concert and stage works, who grew up here. The synagogue where his father worked as a cantor was destroyed during Kristallnacht in 1938; the theater that employed Weill as a conductor burned down and was replaced with a Nazi-designed one christened by Hitler; and much of the urban landscape as Weill knew it was leveled by air raids in World War II.
CW: I'm curious, then, focusing on the U.S., a couple of months ago the general counsel for the N.S.A. wrote an Op-Ed for us and was worried about this big challenge of the government not being able to acquire the tech talent. That Silicon Valley is actually so much more attractive, so much more interesting there. And that when you're looking at 5G technology, quantum computing, technology, A.I., not having engineers in that space and sort of outsourcing that to the private sector is potentially incredibly dangerous. Like how do you actually make people want to come and bring that engineering talent to the federal government, rather than ——

Mr. Gillis issued what some saw as a non-apology, writing on Twitter that he is a comedian who pushes boundaries and his intention is never to hurt. He added, I'm happy to apologize to anyone who's actually offended by anything I've said.
La Wilson, an enigmatic assemblage artist who took ordinary objects — from dice, plastic forks and alphabet blocks to bullet casings, fake guns and jewelry — and arranged them in boxes, giving them enthralling new life, died on March 30 in Hudson, Ohio, a suburb of Akron. She was 93.
Mentioning the attack in Baghdad only briefly, the president spent his hourlong speech at Ministerio Internacional El Rey Jesús, a church with a predominantly Hispanic congregation, alternating between his familiar mocking jabs at Democrats, who he repeatedly called anti-religious, and boasting about his own faith-based policies. Saying he would renew the importance of religion and family, Mr. Trump vowed that he would toughen restrictions on abortion and would take action to safeguard students and teachers' First Amendment rights to pray in our schools.
Indonesian immigration officials detained the woman, Kristen Gray, 28, overnight Tuesday and said she was being deported for spreading information that could unsettle the public. They also accused her of carrying out dangerous activities and endangering public order by not obeying rules and laws.

Since 1982, Alaska has been giving every resident an annual check from its $66.3 billion permanent fund, which gets at least 25 percent of the state's mineral royalties every year. The results of the experiment have been mixed — crippling poverty is low, but unemployment rates are among the highest in the country, and the fund's value fluctuates with oil prices.

It was the design and building of a tissue-perfusion apparatus at Rockefeller Institute (now University) in New York. He was introduced to the project by Dr. Alexis Carrel, who had won the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1912 for development of blood vessel transplant procedures. The French-born Carrel was interested in the thirties in living organs outside the body, and the problem was to devise an instrument to perfuse these organs and keep them alive. For me, Lindbergh recalled, that began an association with an extraordinarily great man. To me, his true greatness lay in the unlimited penetration, curiosity and scope of his mind, in his fearlessness of opinion, in his deep concerns about the trends of modern civilization and their effect on his fellow man. In addition to perfecting a pump--an important breakthrough in its time--Lindbergh invented a quick way of separating serum from whole blood by means of a centrifuge. The Lindbergh- Carrel friendship lasted for 14 years, until the scientist's death in 1944. A brilliant investigator, Carrel tinkered with philosophy and other matters; and his thoughts in these areas were sometimes quirky. He believed, for example, in extrasensory perception. He also spoke against industrial civilization and suggested that we ought to try to produce a certain number of individuals above the mental stature we observe in the best. He said, moreover, that only the elite make the progress of the masses possible.
In The Interestings, Jules Jacobson poses a broad question, asking herself what the boys (now men) and girls (now women) she has lionized since her teens, and emulated throughout her adult life, have lost through their persistent, rarely rewarded efforts to opt in. She wonders if all of them have inaccurately defined success, believing they would only matter if they were extraordinary.

Our goal should be a self-sustaining Judaism that can thrive in the kind of open society in which most Jews want to spend their lives. I strongly believe that it is essential--both for Jews and for America--that the mainstream American Jewish community flourish. It would be a tragedy if the only forms of Judaism the made it past the twenty-first century were insular, ultra-Orthodox Judaism and Israeli Zionism. I hope that they, too, will continue to prosper, but I believe that a more diverse Jewish life has even more to contribute. If I have a bias, it is in favor of an eclectic, tolerant many-branched menorah that is inclusive of all who wish to safeguard and share the future of the Jewish people.

Especially for people who are at the lower end of the skills ladder, which is most Americans. Only 33 percent of Americans will graduate from college, 42 percent if you include two-year degrees.
The German critic Theodor Adorno dismissed Weill's American music as the work of a tunesmith and sellout, and much German thought followed in that vein. For decades, Germans performed almost solely a small fraction of his pre-1933 works, his collaborations with the brash poet and playwright Bertolt Brecht. In the United States, though, his early symphonic and stage works remained largely unknown.
And it's not just the leading edge N.S.A.-type stuff. If you look around congressional offices or the I.R.S., they're all using technology from the '90s or whatever it is. I had a whiz kid who said he got yelled at for writing a script in a congressional office that automated a task. They were like, No, we just wanted you to do it manually forever. So there needs to be a massive modernization effort. Not just in terms of how we recruit tech talent at the highest levels, but how we function even in the basics.
Chuck Barris, the Gong Show creator, songwriter and novelist who sought to add to his already eclectic résumé with a made-up — or was it? — story about being an assassin for the C.I.A., died on Tuesday at his home in Palisades, N.Y. He was 87.

Ms. Sabbag, who died in 2008, was equally provocative. Her early films include Sand Screens (1991), a drama centering on a woman determined to lead an uninhibited life in a deeply conservative society, and the sarcastically titled A Civilized People (1999), which touches on such discomfiting topics as homosexuality, the ill treatment of immigrant house servants and religious acrimony in Lebanese society. (The Lebanese government banned the film.)
A hundred years ago, Theodor Herzl identified the Jewish question of the twentieth century as the literal survival of Jews in the face of external enemies committed to our physical annihilation--Jew-haters in every nation where Jews lived as a minority. His solution--the creation of a secular Jewish state--was to change the nature of Jewish life in dramatic and unanticipated ways. A hundred years later, the Jewish question of the twenty-first century is survival in the face of our internal challenges. Herzl also anticipated that this new Jewish question might arise if and when our Christian hosts were to leave us in peace. This is now coming to pass. The solution to this Jewish question also requires the creation of yet another Jewish state: a new Jewish state of mind!
Still, a fundamental question remained: How did a former public relations executive known primarily for working with blue-chip financial companies become such a well-connected art-world player? And if Mr. Kratz, the academy's president since 2009, has given the place a new currency, as Mr. Fischl asserted, may something bigger be in store for him and the board chairwoman, Ms. Guggenheim?
Well, I'm all about trying to improve the reality on the ground, to the extent that we can actually put resources and funds to work in communities to make sure that women have access to reproductive rights in clinics. Certainly any way we can make sure that there aren't any obstacles to the funding of Planned Parenthood clinics around the country. I would take those actions immediately. A lot of the legislative actions, you need a bit more time and a bit more buy-in from Congress, but at the Supreme Court level, I would consider appointing more justices if it was necessary to safeguard women's reproductive rights.
We have to be working toward China's second main priority, which is maintaining robust economic growth. So there are two goals. There are two primary goals that are sometimes in tension, of maintaining social order and maintaining robust economic growth. And the best way we can try and contain their behavior in Hong Kong is to say, Look, the economic costs are going to be very, very high. And the best way we can do that is to build global consensus around certain norms and behaviors.

What do you make of the homicidal misogyny of Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), in which Martin Landau murders his inconvenient mistress, played by Anjelica Huston? (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers does the same to Scarlett Johansson more than 15 years later in Match Point.) Does the philosophical despair that surrounds it offer an explanation or an excuse for amorality? Whose? What about the almost-romance between Mr. Allen's character in Husbands and Wives and a 21-year-old college student, the failure of which causes the man to regret ruining his marriage to a woman played by Ms. Farrow? Is the regret a pre-emptive attempt at apology? An act of denial? Completely irrelevant?

At his inauguration on Tuesday, the Denver Gay Men's Chorus warmed up with True Colors (Cyndi Lauper, who first recorded it, was booked for the inaugural ball that night) before remarks from local grandees and faith leaders and the new officials were sworn in. Mr. Polis sat with Mr. Reis and their children behind a pane of bulletproof glass, a precaution one veteran Colorado reporter noted he hadn't seen in five previous inaugurations. But when Mr. Polis got up to speak — after a quick selfie with the crowd — he addressed divisiveness and diversity only briefly.
The movie follows Katherine (Katherine Waterston), the wife of Stefan Delvoe (Michiel Huisman), a rising Belgian film star who died in an apparent suicide. Their marriage was a rocky one, shaken by revelations about Stefan's drug use and the possibility that he was unfaithful. It was Katherine who found Stefan's body with a bullet lodged in his temple.
Following the repeal of marriage equality in Bermuda, where same-sex couples are now limited to domestic partnership, many in the United States and Western Europe are calling for a boycott (#BoycottBermuda). The demand for this boycott is not coming from grass-roots organizations in Bermuda, and in fact such a boycott stands to harm and not help L.G.B.T.Q. Bermudians.
Mr. Zhao, whose wife is Mr. Yuan's cousin, was portrayed by the defense as a well-adjusted and law-abiding man who had been provoked by an indecent proposal from Mr. Yuan asking to marry his daughter. Mr. Zhao did not have murderous intent, his lawyer said, despite the crime's violent aftermath, and so was guilty of manslaughter, not murder.
Whether it's reacting against patriarchy, pixelation, or the oppressive austerities of midcentury Minimalism, the use of crafty patterns in contemporary visual art has always had a political charge. But several of the 26 artists in this exhibition — jointly organized by El Museo del Barrio, the Hostos Center for the Arts & Culture and the Bronx Council on the Arts — make those politics even more explicit by combining decorative motifs with images of the body.

In November 2012, Linda Zang was on her way to her first date with Patricia Marie Reville at Kitchen Zinc, a pizza restaurant in New Haven, Conn. They had matched on the dating website OkCupid, and Ms. Zang, who was a law student at Yale at the time, picked out the restaurant for their first date. There was only one problem — Ms. Reville, who goes by Tricia, had just let her know that she was at the wrong restaurant.

And then that was it, I knew I'd lost. Not lost, but won. I'd won the life. Immediately I said, 'Yes.' I was just flooded with peace. The process known as discernment, by which a seminarian determines whether the call to the priesthood is real and lasting, continues until the day of his diaconate ordination, when he makes the promises of celibacy and obedience. On the wall of Dobbins's room is a photograph of his and Bashista's diaconate class four years ago; Dobbins has pasted smiley-face stickers over the heads of the 10 -- out of 42 -- who have left. Some are not actually gone; they're taking pastoral or spiritual years required by their dioceses, or have joined religious orders; others are now married and fathers, including one of Bashista's former roommates. Bashista's views on celibacy have changed. Now he regards it as a crucial aspect of his priesthood, which will not be a job so much as a way of life -- a marriage to the church. (Some priests actually wear wedding rings after their ordinations.) Some days I'll think: What if I was back in the architecture firm? Would I be a partner now? Married? Have kids? he said. But the match has been made. One reason I had thoughts of marriage with this one girl was that connection, that longing to be with this person. And then that feeling was not sustained. It was strong, it was present, but it wasn't deep. And this is deep.
The two spent some time together, and a couple of months later, they saw each other again at the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association world conference in Bangkok. While they felt a strong attraction at both gatherings, Ms. Hartman was up front with Ms. Michels about already having a partner, though that relationship was rocky. Their budding friendship remained platonic.
But the display at the president's Jan. 10 round table, it turns out, had little to do with what happens along unfortified reaches of the border. An examination of the seized items suggests that a border wall would not have stopped most of the items from entering the United States, or, in the case of several weapons displayed in front of the president, from leaving the United States for Mexico.
The American cities with the highest number of high-net-worth individuals are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington. California has the most number of people on the Forbes list of wealthiest Americans.
Mr. Trump likes to say that the economy has reached historic highs under his administration. However, life expectancy has been falling and other measures of well-being have declined, including rising rates of depression diagnosis.
That's a fun exercise, too. I haven't gotten into the judicial appointment shortlist yet, but safeguarding women's reproductive rights would be one clear criteria. Because women's reproductive rights are fundamental human rights in my mind.
So if you look at other countries, they have a value-added tax and then they take those resources and put them to work toward various social programs in ways to balance out the inequality. Now, another thing I love about the value-added tax is you can either reduce it or exempt things like diapers, toilet paper, eggs, milk, things that Americans consume just to make ends meet, and you can dial it up on things like artificial intelligence, yachts, luxury watches. There are ways that you can make it so that it falls more heavily on people that would barely notice. And we're taking the resources plus an additional hundreds of billions of dollars and putting it directly into the hands of working Americans. This would increase the buying power of literally 90 percent of Americans.

The show is forthright, sometimes surprisingly so, about the, uh, ins and outs of bodies and partnerships, but in a mostly sweet and sincere way.
Kothari's novel plays out a dark fantasy. The narrator, Simeen, has a husband who is terminally ill. When an old friend moves in with the couple to help out, a flame is rekindled between wife and friend. In the hands of another novelist, the husband's illness could function as a simple narrative device, moving him offstage at the convenient moment and allowing Simeen's romance with their friend, Zayaan, to proceed blamelessly. But Kothari takes the story in an unexpected direction, forcing her characters to contemplate the idea of sustained romantic commitment outside the boundaries of monogamous love instead.
The Gong Show was just one of Mr. Barris's hit game show creations. In the 1960s he came up with The Dating Game and The Newlywed Game, making a spectacle of his contestants' romantic yearnings in the first case and their honeymoon-period bliss, adjustments and foibles in the second.

In American Men in Paris I Did Not Love, the story's very structure is defined by its male characters. The narrator has forgotten how to be around other women and instead moves through a series of relationships — some sexual, some not — in which she is almost comically uninvested. These men are insufferable: They smirk, they lecture, they play jokes they think are funny, they push boundaries. They use her, to paraphrase Virginia Woolf, as a mirror, enjoying the way she distorts their reflection in pleasant ways. She silently judges them, she dodges their moves. But only rarely does a radical impulse rise up: And for once I don't care whether the professor likes me, if I'm pleasant or easy to teach, whether my work is any good. But the impulse quickly fades. I am not beautiful, but I am pretty enough, she remarks. That year, and for years after, I hold on to the pretty parts, to the appearance of being open. If only I had allowed myself to look mean in those photos.
The allure of hooking up has not been quashed by the pandemic. A couple in Barcelona. At a time when social norms around physical touch and closeness have been altered, those looking to hook up are having to rewrite the rules. Credit... Nacho Doce/Reuters If you're in a relationship (or haven't been out much since March), it may be news to you that despite a raging pandemic, people are meeting up, cuddling, making out and having sex with new partners, often weighing their emotional and physical needs against safety concerns. Some have gone about their private lives quietly, out of fear that those in their social circles — especially established couples — would judge their choices. Others have been more conspicuous when hooking up. In November, New York sheriffs broke up an 80-person party at a sex club in Queens. That same month, a swingers' convention in New Orleans led to 41 people testing positive for the coronavirus. Going on dates has involved a mental calculus not unlike the kind applied to other social interactions in the Covid-19 era: Will I feel safe? What is the likelihood of infection? How many people could this hurt? But hookups have been viewed with particular scrutiny. Even pre-pandemic, there was a lot of stigma around sexuality and sex in general, said Dr. Oni Blackstock, the former assistant commissioner at the New York City Department of Health's Bureau of H.I.V. With the pandemic, there's another layer of expectations and judgment.
She writes about motherhood and marriage and things that can get lumped under that general umbrella term 'domesticity,' but she brings them to life in these incredibly razor-sharp ways, Jamison says. And there shouldn't even be a 'but' conjunction in that sentence, right — like, why are those states of being not razor sharp, somehow? But sometimes they can get seen as soft or sentimental. And she brings both a very different form and a very different tone to how she writes about them and how she does justice to their emotional extremity.
Her grandmother supported them by taking in laundry from detectives, police officers and businessmen, washing their white shirts in a black three-legged pot and hanging them on a line. We never went without anything, Anna said. Knowing what I know now, I know it was hard.
Mrs. West was a pioneer of mainstream environmental conservation, embracing it well before most Americans. In the 1960s, for instance, though struggling with the financial burden of maintaining Ossabaw Island, which her parents bought in 1924, she rebuffed lucrative offers from developers and instead sold the island to the State of Georgia for $8 million, half of the island's appraised value.
Two more charges against Clinton were defeated. An article accusing the President of perjury in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit was rejected, 229 to 205, with 28 Republicans breaking ranks.
The unfortunate part is, it's totally opposite of the defunding of law enforcement. It comes down to the politicians. And I really hate to be that way, but it does. And instead of building parks that make no sense, putting flowers up and down the roads that probably are going to die and you're going to have to replace or something, why can't we take that budget money and move it over to there? I'll stand next to the community and fight for that every day.
AH: I mean, I don't think most people had.
Feelings seem to register on her face before her thoughts have a chance to catch up with them, so that we know when she's hurting or happy almost before she does. A New York writer who grew up in rural Illinois, Lucy Barton is surely someone we can trust to speak plain. What a relief to be in the company, for once, of a thoroughly reliable narrator.
Well, I'm all about trying to improve the reality on the ground, to the extent that we can actually put resources and funds to work in communities to make sure that women have access to reproductive rights in clinics. Certainly any way we can make sure that there aren't any obstacles to the funding of Planned Parenthood clinics around the country. I would take those actions immediately. A lot of the legislative actions, you need a bit more time and a bit more buy-in from Congress, but at the Supreme Court level, I would consider appointing more justices if it was necessary to safeguard women's reproductive rights.
At the last debate, I proposed a world data organization, because to me, China's in position to leapfrog us in artificial intelligence. They're investing tens of billions in a way that our government is not. It's a national effort. And they've now separated their technology ecosystem from the West's and they're trying to sell their software and operating systems to other countries with very limited success right now, but this parallel tech universe, to me, is something that we can actually use to bring China back to the table.
Jenny Offill's third novel, Weather, balances concerns about the slow apocalypse of climate change with the daily texture of the narrator's life as a Brooklyn wife and mother who works as a university librarian. Leslie Jamison reviews it on the cover of this week's Book Review, and visits the podcast to talk about the novel and Offill's work in general.
The subversions of Killing Eve (through seven episodes) mostly consist of gender switching rather than fundamental rethinking, though. Watching the series, you're just as conscious of its congruences with standard examples of the genre (like Berlin Station on Epix) as you are of the differences. And while Ms. Waller-Bridge's comic style is distinctive, her characters are not entirely new — we've seen aspects of them in La Femme Nikita, Covert Affairs, Homeland and any number of stories about female mutual obsession.
The power-sharing arrangement was developed when Malaysia became independent from Britain in 1957 and the sultans — who had previously ruled independently, with support from the British colonial authorities — needed to nominate a figurehead to rule over a newly federalized nation.
But even as he acknowledges the faults of populism, Lind treats the class-war aspect of polarization as a potentially positive development, because he hopes that it will create a real political coalition for the losers of neoliberal era — a socially conservative, economically left-leaning constituency that's numerous but often homeless. Making such a coalition constructive rather than just disruptive may be impossible, but it's the only way he sees to escape neoliberal oligarchy and bring our class war to an end with a negotiated peace.
But charities that support survivors of forced marriages said the policy had ignored the unusually risky position those women were in. They often had to ask family members for help cobbling together the money, forcing them to turn to some of the same people who had coerced them into the marriages in the first place.
'THE CONVENT' at A.R.T./New York Theaters (in previews; opens on Jan. 24). A girls' trip with monastic overtones, Jessica Dickey's new play goes on retreat with a group of women trying to live like medieval nuns (though likely practicing better personal hygiene). Daniel Talbott directs the all-female cast, which includes Lisa Ramirez and Samantha Soule, as they recede from modernity.
A member of the Arizona House of Representatives filed a formal ethics complaint against another member who participated in the protest last Wednesday. Representative César Chávez, a Democrat, called on the House Ethics Committee to investigate Representative Mark Finchem, a Republican, and to recommend Mr. Finchem's expulsion should it find that he supported the violent overthrow of our government.
AY: Yeah. And I will say on a personal level, I spent seven years recruiting some of our top educational products to Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis. So I have seen that essentially the tide has turned in the direction it's gone and we should not be relying upon the government as the primary employer of a lot of this tech talent. We have to face facts and say, at this point, most of the intellectual capital is being attracted to these private firms and we need to instead try and support and work with the private firms.
Olivia Cole, an actress best known for her Emmy Award-winning role in the acclaimed mini-series Roots, died on Jan. 19 at her home in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. She was 75.
He was passed over for the grant, but he did complete the series of drawings, as the MoMA show will attest. They're among his best works, combining freely sketched passages with images from newspapers and magazines; they translate a 14th-century epic into a language of his own devising. The Inferno drawings represent, among other things, a triumph over Rauschenberg's dyslexia, signaling his love of literature. I had a book of Botticelli's wonderful illustrations of the 'Inferno,' Mr. Johns noted recently, referring to the years when he lived a flight below Rauschenberg in a loft building on Front Street. I believe that Bob's looking at that triggered his own.
Mr. Yang confirmed this summer that he would like his running mate to be a woman.
In May 1976, Mr. Severin left Ireland on his most audacious voyage: following in the wake of St. Brendan, a sixth-century monk, who, with a party of other monks, is said to have made a spectacular journey from Ireland across the Atlantic to North America — the Promised Land — in a leather-wrapped boat.
And how did Mr. Patinkin react? He loved it.
Freddie, there are two kinds of people in this world, and you ain't one of them. — Dolly Parton, in Rhinestone
In the '70s or '80s, your labor and overall productivity were more or less in lock step. And we still pretend that if someone wakes up in the morning and says, Hey, I need to put food on the table, he can go out to his main street, he can sell his time for money at some hourly rate, and then he'll be able to make a good enough living so he can feed his family, raise kids and the rest of it. That has become progressively less true over the last 40 years, unfortunately, where wages have stagnated while productivity has gone up and up, and that's going to accelerate because of the convergence of capital and technology now, in unprecedented ways.
So the clearest emblem of this is NASA and space travel where we all watched the Apollo 13 movies and we've seen the armies of research scientists helping launch these missions. Now where those research scientists? They're all at Space X and Blue Origin and they're there working for the tech guys who are putting billions into it. It's going to be very, very difficult to somehow reverse essentially decades of talent migration into the private sector. And if you're a talented kid out of Stanford, why would you work for the federal government? It's like if you're working in the private sector, you feel like you're going to go faster, you're certainly going to get paid more. You're going to be working with smarter people and you idolize Elon Musk, like who the heck, you know?
We were in my college apartment after several weeks of hooking up when he said, You feel good. Is this good? Yeah, I said. This is good. I feel good. And he said, I'm happy. And I said, I'm happy. And he said, I like this. And I said, I like you. That was it — not in a that was it, they fell in love kind of way, but in a that was it, he saw the possibility of connection beyond the confines of my bed and got scared and ran away type of way. — Sarah Marlin
In her latest starring role, Sharon Stone plays Senna, a woman who has found herself spiritually comfortable, but romantically, financially, and professionally at sea. Senna's career as a fashion buyer is at a standstill, and her dreams of becoming a designer seem out of reach. Marriage, she thinks, doesn't suit her. But thanks to the meddling of her friend Darla (Liza Lapira), she meets cute with Adam (Tony Goldwyn), a lawyer with a heart of gold. Susan Walter's All I Wish checks in with Senna over the course of several birthdays thereafter, and we watch as this free spirit changes her ways, locking down a bridegroom to go with her business.
The world is divided into two classes — invalids and nurses. — James McNeill Whistler
He's right, of course. Women in politics have long been subjected to much closer scrutiny than men; in 1917, the first female member of Congress, Jeannette Rankin, took office and The Washington Post ran an article headlined: Congresswoman Rankin Real Girl; Likes Nice Gowns and Tidy Hair.
—— more strong and more whole. There's a saying, I think it was actually, and maybe in this … no, it was an earlier administration, but a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. There was a crisis. There was a massive opportunity to help rebalance our economy, but we instead recapitalized the banks to the tune of $4 trillion. And what I say to Americans around the country, I say, Hey, do you remember voting for the $4 trillion bailout of Wall Street? And it gets this laugh. But then they answer, Wait, we did that? And it's, Of course we didn't vote for that.

Any American who wants to gamble online on a poker site can do so from any state in the country right now. If it's illegal in your state, you just end up using an offshore betting site, which is shady, has problems, but it's not going to ease your gambling addiction at all. So the question is, do we want Americans, in the vast majority of the country, on offshore betting sites, dealing with shady characters and generating no revenue and still being addicted? Or would we prefer that they do business with American firms, where we do have better regulations, we know they're not getting cheated, we know they're not getting exploited, and you generate tax revenue that you can use to treat gambling addiction.
Now, back in West Virginia with her collection of fugitives, Jodi holds to her prison vision of living simply on the land, an old and deeply American dream that is hard to let go. She finds that her grandmother's farm has been sold, but that doesn't deter her from moving her group into the cabin anyway for a brief cigarette-and-whiskey outlaw idyll. Instead of peace and hope and love, however, they find they're under constant threat in an Appalachian community gutted by meth and opioids, by fracking creeping so close that a neighbor can set his tap water on fire, and, as always, by limitations on upward mobility for the underprivileged that have been baked into American culture from its beginning.
In a country that cannot come to a consensus on fundamental questions — how restricted capitalism should be, whether immigrants are a burden or a boon, to what extent the legacy of slavery continues to shape American life — textbook publishers are caught in the middle. On these questions and others, classroom materials are not only shaded by politics, but are also helping to shape a generation of future voters.
Last summer, I made peace with my uncle. It was the most difficult experience I have had since I left prison. I called him on the first day of Eid, and I could hear the slightly panicked excitement in his voice as we exchanged greetings. He spoke faster than usual, as if trying to make up for lost time. The weight of the resentment I carried vanished as soon as the conversation turned to kids, marriage, health and the famous feast that my aunt makes every Eid. As I ended our five years of silence, I felt the same sensation of freedom I had experienced when I was released. Soon after, my mom told me that the call had done wonders for his morale and that he had accompanied her on a visit to my father, who remains in prison.
The other odd thing about this staging, whose set (by Rachel Hauck) is a suburban kitchen, is how little sense it conveys of the natural world beyond. Ms. Silverman doesn't ask enough of the lighting (by Jen Schriever), but leans hard on the excellent sound design (by Bray Poor), which is particularly vivid when a new storm comes.
It hasn't been difficult for Germany to neglect one of its most significant and innovative composers: Weill, born in 1900, left the country in 1933 and vehemently rejected the idea of returning. He had a full life and career after settling in the United States, becoming an ambitious Broadway composer until his death in 1950.
If these three words have acquired the force of absolution, it is because Karan Johar is by miles the most famous Indian ever to almost be openly gay. Since he burst onto the scene in the late 1990s, this 44-year-old director-producer has reached vast audiences with his movies. His name is a byword for family entertainment, his films by his own admission synonymous with popcorn, bubble gum and frivolity. All the stars are his friends, and the brightest of them appear on his immensely popular talk show Koffee With Karan. He has some 10 million followers on Twitter and almost three million on Instagram.
The difficulty that white people and people of color have in talking about race together is the knot that this Advanced Beginner Group production picks at, fumblingly — a snarl as sensitive as nerve endings, and as American as our nation's history.
But the most important contrast is in the comic's discussion of his own infidelity. Until Tamborine, Rock was known as a social commentator who mostly kept his private life at a distance. But addressing his divorce and his responsibility for the failure of his marriage, Rock made the most vulnerable, introspective comedy of his career. Burnham was clearly drawn to this aspect of the set and focused on it. This material, including jokes about marriage, divorce and sex, takes up about half of the special, as opposed to around a third of the extended version.
Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart, he said. Yet hear me clearly — disagreement must not lead to disunion.
In addition to making his own movies and writing prolifically about the movies of others, Mr. Mekas was the founder or a co-founder of institutions that support and promote independent filmmakers, including, in New York, the influential journal Film Culture, published quarterly from 1955 to 1996; Film-Makers Cooperative, a distribution network; and Anthology Film Archives, the leading library and museum for experimental film. (The critic Andrew Sarris published his influential essay on the auteur theory in Film Culture.)
Right. He's portrayed as such a good guy, and you begin by liking him. But I have to say, I already dislike him because some of the corners you're cutting and how quickly he went right into criminality, really, just so easily — and sloppily, by the way.
It's obviously much harder. I'm all about trying to maximize the possible. And so, if we don't get a majority — I expect the Democrats will win a slight majority in the Senate. I'm very optimistic that way, but we're going to get done what we can get done with the branch of the government we have control of. And I will say too, I believe that we can get some things done that are traditionally bipartisan, regardless of who has control of the Senate. To me, I cannot believe that we did not get infrastructure done during the first couple of years of the Trump administration. I thought at least he would build some bridges and roads, and I was even willing to accept the Trump name on those bridges and roads if it got some bridges and roads built. I was, At least we're going to get this.
James Dao: Can I pose a future hypothetical? If the Chinese government were to flood Hong Kong with military troops after you were president and impose a violent crackdown, similar to, say, Tiananmen Square in 1989, what would you do?
Mr. Brandt made a career of trying to catch whatever wave was cresting on the pop-culture scene. With the Electric Circus, which he opened in 1967 on St. Marks Place in the East Village, it was psychedelia. With the Ritz, opened in 1980 a few blocks away, it was the exploding music scene of the MTV decade, with the shows he staged there — Parliament-Funkadelic, U2, Tina Turner, Ozzy Osbourne, Frank Zappa and countless others — reflecting the exploratory energy of the time.
Sugimoto also insisted on using as many premodern materials and techniques as possible. The lustrous smoky black square tiles that blanket the hallway are clay, handmade by a ceramist in Nara, near Kyoto, whose ancestors made the tiles for the centuries-old Todaiji temple. They are intended to be used on roofs, but Sugimoto prefers them for the floor because of the particular way they reflect the light. The walls are covered in soft-white Japanese shikkui plaster, which was carefully applied by trained craftsmen — though it is smooth to the touch, their strokes glint unevenly in the natural light. The kitchen cabinets are entirely covered in long metal sheets hammered by hand. Nearly all the apartment floors are clad in splendid planks of unfinished cedar (the notable exception is the master bedroom, whose floors are laid with chestnut, the wood hand-scooped to lend it a dappled effect; Sugimoto calls the sensation of walking on it a free foot massage).
My team then had me take the helmet off and then tried to make my hair look good. So that's why I didn't show up with the helmet.
When I say I don't see race, that means I treat everybody as the same. But it doesn't mean that I don't see the struggles that other people have. And that is, that's the difference. And if that offends somebody, I apologize to that. But what I mean is, they're a human being. But it's not that I don't see that there's racism. I'm not saying that there isn't. What I said to you is, I don't see it as far as I don't do it. Me, as my person — me, as Vince Champion — I do not subscribe to that type of stuff. And you know, it's interesting. We're sitting there having this conversation, but nobody really wants to talk about how many times officers have stepped in and protected people from racism. And nobody knows about it, because, you know why? Because that's our job. And you talk about seeing it? Absolutely, we see it. It just seems like everybody wants to make people talk different and act different, when you asked the question.
The race for this year's acting Oscars couldn't possibly be less suspenseful: You can engrave those Academy Awards right now for Joaquin Phoenix (Joker), Renée Zellweger (Judy), Brad Pitt (Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood) and Laura Dern (Marriage Story), the fearsome foursome set to sweep up every trophy from now until Feb. 9, when the ceremony will take place.
In 2007 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that states direct 14 percent of funds from tobacco taxes and the national settlement toward antismoking campaigns, but most states have funneled it toward other areas, from agriculture to literacy.
I'm the only one of the halftime performers who actually risks his life, you know? he said. If I fall, I'm probably not getting up.
