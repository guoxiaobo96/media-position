she began school at such an early age that she could not remember when or where she started. her earliest recollections were of reading the newspaper to her father and his friends and of her mother going to school with the children until she was able to read the bible. students of all ages clustering around a limited number of books in small schools was a common sight to the newly freed slaves during reconstruction. whether ida's father learned to read is unclear. her reading the newspaper to him and his friends could have represented a father's desire to show off the accomplishments of his offspring or his inability to read for himself. like many freed heads of households, james wells was undoubtedly busy and apparently did not attend school with his family. however, he may have learned to read and write from his father or as an apprentice. regardless, wells was deeply involved in education because he was one of the trustees of shaw university, the school ida attended in holly springs.
in the hermetic kingdom of the dining room, the host is at once benefactor and dictator. alfred hitchcock planted whoopee cushions on seats, dyed food blue and reversed the order in which courses were served, beginning with dessert, all to toy with guests. less whimsically, during the renaissance, the aristocratic borgias were rumored to poison them. even without the threat of assassination, a dinner party can feel like a series of psychological tests: the table set with tiny implements of inscrutable purpose, the small talk like needles through the eyes. the oxford dictionary of psychology by andrew m. colman includes a listing for deipnophobia, fear of dinner parties — defined as irrational, although i'd argue it's a defensive response to our divided modern times.
what else should i expect? there will probably be remembrances of kirk douglas, who died on wednesday, and kobe bryant, the basketball star who won an oscar for a short film made after he retired. and there will reportedly be a special performance by janelle monáe with elton john and randy newman.
these will be issued in class, week by week. the instructor has found that spontaneity is often best, keeping the student reader in suspense and creating the impression that anything might happen: imagine, for instance, a gloved hand reaching for a knife, and the next thing we know a body is dappled in blood as if in red sunshine, his hoary bulk splayed across a desk in a modest office cluttered with manuscripts … but suddenly the alarm clock erupts with a —
not to fear. on saturday night for its new year's eve gala, the met introduced a new production of gounod's roméo et juliette starring mr. grigolo and ms. damrau as shakespeare's star-crossed adolescent lovers. in scene after scene, these exciting and charismatic artists disappeared into their characters, emboldening each other to sing with white-hot sensuality and impassioned lyricism.
critics of same-sex parenting have frequently pointed to a 2012 study by a university of texas sociologist that suggests children of gay and lesbian parents are significantly different from children raised by heterosexual couples. that study has been roundly criticized by others in academia.
major kettles was awarded the distinguished service cross, the army's highest citation for valor after the medal of honor, in 1968.
gallery hyundai, which has shown his work since the 1970s, confirmed the death.
chris's urge to be in the mountains was related to his postwar adjustments, and it became central to his regeneration and health. but i didn't blame the war for his death. his drive to pursue his passions outside of his first career gave me the resolve to do the same. six months after he died, i left the army, moved across the country and started medical school. becoming a physician requires years of intensive practice and study, and in this early stage of my career, i know i should be more concerned with learning drug names or the proper quantity of fluid boluses. yet it's the act of communicating bad news to patients and their families that i often ponder. i came to medical school having served around violence and trauma, and having already received and given a death notification. i've learned that the worst moments in someone's life can be a haze with few distinct memories. in these moments it matters less what you say than how you say it. people in pain remember compassion, like the compassion i received from the deputies who sat on the couch with me and didn't leave until i was no longer alone.
and my last name was no cakewalk either. i was a girl taunted for being a ho.
note: the instructor will not be assigning the self-published novel through the wild dreaming night by prof. arnold r. young. this novel was for many years on the required list for introductory fiction, but this instructor cannot in good conscience continue to inflict it on undergraduates. through professor young's temporary and capricious patronage i have survived on white bread and tuna in an apartment the size of a closet for the past two years; given my nonrenewal of contract, i am no longer obliged to pretend to respect his work.
like the novel's discreet and cheerful mrs. heeny, masseuse and manicurist to the rich, who travels from house to house with her bag full of press clippings, wharton observes and records it all. in this new gilded age, when the disparities between rich and poor are again, and disastrously, as great as they were in wharton's time, we could do with such a novelist, a cultural anthropologist who might hold up a mirror to our failings and our future, with eagle-eyed clarity and a small measure of compassion.
in saudi arabia, all women are required to have a male guardian, whose permission they need to get married, travel and undergo some medical procedures. the guardian is often a father or husband, but can be a brother or even a son.
who will be presenting? the academy has announced a long list of household names, including will ferrell, gal gadot, salma hayek, mindy kaling, spike lee, lin-manuel miranda, keanu reeves, maya rudolph and timothée chalamet.
criteria for evaluating fiction will be discussed in class. to those who would raise the buga boo of subjectivity or instructor favoritism, please see the classroom motto: life is not fair. though the instructor promises to do her best to evaluate student work according to clearly defined standards and procedures, students should note that this represents a break from the way in which business is conducted on campus. see, for example, my recent performance review, a vengeful hack job written by a member of the faculty not to be identified here (but recognizable by her badly dyed bouffant and her marriage to the scholar-cum-novelist referred to above).
there are echoes of beggar boy in the ironically titled story america the great equalizer. biks, a nepali graduate student living in illinois at the time of michael brown's shooting in ferguson, mo., simultaneously develops a heightened awareness of the racism all around him and learns that his beloved seema, back in nepal, has married. the death and the marriage, hardly comparable tragedies, intertwine in his mind, sparking a suspicion that seema rejected him because of his comparatively dark skin. feeling himself the victim of a terrible injustice due to prejudice, he begins to identify with african-americans, taking on what he believes to be black mannerisms, including addressing customers at his new job in a gas station as brothah. it's an uncomfortable charade, barreling right through the boundary between empathy and appropriation, and into offensive stereotypes, a fact biks is initially incapable of seeing, though others try to point it out. 'am i your brother because we have the same mother, or am i your brother because you're african-american?' one customer asks him. then he laughed and said he was just giving biks a hard time.
and now he really, really loves dear evan hansen. the first time he saw the musical, a couple of weeks after it opened on broadway in 2016, he was so overcome he couldn't find the words to talk about it when his mother came to pick him up.
but while buenos aires's portenos, as they called themselves, looked to europe for their cultural comparisons, much of the interior still languished in nineteenth-century neglect. in the north, despotic provincial caudillos held sway over vast expanses of cotton- and sugar-growing lands. among their workers, diseases such as leprosy, malaria, and even bubonic plague were still common. in the andean provinces, the indigenous quechua- and aymara-speaking indians known as coyas lived in conditions of extreme poverty. women would not be given the vote for another two decades, and legal divorce would take even longer. vigilante justice and indentured servitude were features of life in much of the hinterland.
political violence and klan activities frightened elizabeth wells and others, but reconstruction also brought new hope and opportunity to mississippi's black population. although brief, the period of republican ascendancy in holly springs had to be a source of great pride to the wells's and other black families. most whites, although they resented black political power, agreed that the city had been blessed with extraordinarily capable and honest black officeholders. two were singled out for praise: james hill, who rose from the state legislature to become mississippi's secretary of state from 1874 to 1878, and hiram rhodes revels, who moved to holly springs in the mid-1870s, and became the first african american u.s. senator. both won white respect by their conciliatory attitudes. but whites also noted that although state senator george allbright was a willing and eager tool in the hands of gill, he was a negro who was above average in intelligence. at the height of black political power in holly springs, ida wells was a child of about ten. the events she witnessed may have whetted her interest in politics, which remained strong her entire life.
other relationships caused difficulties for wells at rust. in late 1885, she referred to her tenure at rust as my darkest days. ida's fiery temper often got her in trouble, and a confrontation with president hooper apparently led to her dismissal sometime in 1880 or 1881. for years she resented him tremendously for her expulsion, but in june 1886 she admitted to herself that her own tempestuous, rebellious, hard headed wilfulness was to blame. she rued her disposition to question his authority and asserted, i no longer cherish feelings of resentment, nor blame him that my scholastic career was cut short.
cooper jameson kupp jr. — nicknamed june, as in junior, by his parents — did not know the significance behind the note his mother asked him to deliver last may. but the 2-year-old eagerly complied, bouncing over to his father.

forced into an early adulthood by her parents' deaths, in memphis wells began to feel the pull of conflicting duties and desires that marked her entire life. as she struggled to balance her responsibilities to her family and her race, wells also sought to fulfill her personal needs for independence and security. her quest for self-identity was complicated by a temperament that made it difficult for her accept the gender and racial roles expected of her. after much seeking and struggling, wells became both a woman and an activist in memphis.
in a crucial early scene of janacek's katya kabanova, the title character, a young woman trapped in a stultifying marriage to a timid merchant in a town on the volga, recalls memories of her carefree childhood. as a girl, katya tells varvara, her adopted sister-in-law, she would rise early on summer days, wash in the stream and tend to every flower in her house. going to church was like falling into a trance, katya says; she imagined rising to heaven to watch angels fly.
why, then, does it seem as if everybody is throwing dinner parties again? we could glibly dismiss it as an offshoot of the current obsession with food; amateur chefs looking to unleash their inner yotam ottolenghi on a captive audience. but these days, when our greatest intimacy is with our iphones and the spectral kinship of social media has supplanted the immediacy of analog conversation, the true hunger is for earnest connection. and so a new strain of dinner party dispenses with formality in favor of sincerity. gone are the napkins tortured into swans and the postprandial triage that shunted women to the drawing room while men dealt business. instead, tables might be strewn with tea lights bought by the hundred at ikea and dessert might be klondikes from the corner bodega. in a communal, nigh utopian spirit, guests share in the labor and often bring dishes of their own, rehabilitating the idea of the potluck — which has nothing to do, etymologically, with potlatch: it derives from the 16th-century english pot-lucke, in which unexpected guests made do with whatever was already in the pot. for every dinner party that leaves family bonds and lifelong friendships in smoldering ruins, there is another that unites and reaffirms: yes, we really like each other.
i was an english major in college, so i guess what i like is literary fiction. my four favorite books are blood meridian, by cormac mccarthy, moby-dick, by herman melville, invisible man, by ralph ellison, and continental drift, by russell banks — in that order.
after a whirlwind round of visits with their families in buenos aires to show off their infant son, the guevaras returned to their homestead in misiones.
holly springs was captured and recaptured by the two armies, changing hands at least fifty-nine times during the war. its geography and its history made the city's experiences of the war and reconstruction both typical and atypical of most of the state. when ida was born, holly springs had existed for only a few decades. in 1832 the chickasaw ceded the region, known as the chickasaw cession, to the federal government. four years later the territory was divided into counties--the largest of which was marshall county with holly springs as its seat. while still carving the city from the wilderness, its settlers sought to make it a cultural center. even before the town was incorporated, residents voted in a town meeting to establish the holly springs female institute, the first of a number of educational institutions. by 1850 the county was spending more on higher education than all the rest of the state, excluding the budget of the university of mississippi. a history of the state noted that in 1891 holly springs, called the city of flowers, was widely known for the hospitality and culture of its people.
the plumbers were hoping to get information about mr. ellsberg's mental state that would discredit him, but they found nothing of importance related to him.
although james wells was known as a race man who was intensely interested in politics, he apparently never held office but stayed busy running a business and taking care of his growing family. as in many households, however, ida's mother played the biggest role in the day-to-day affairs of the children. a very religious woman, elizabeth wells made sure that her children attended church regularly. the wells family likely belonged to asbury methodist church, where shaw university classes were first held. ida was baptized in that faith at the age of twelve. ida recalled that her mother won the prize for regular attendance at sunday school, taking the whole brood of six to nine o'clock sunday school the year before she died. elizabeth wells was a strict disciplinarian who kept close watch over her children. she regularly went to their school to check on their progress, taught them how to do household chores, and assigned each tasks around the home. ida proudly asserted that her mother brought us up with a strict discipline that many mothers who have had educational advantages have not exceeded.
the production, by the director bartlett sher, his seventh for the met, updates the setting from renaissance to 18th-century verona, presenting an essentially traditional staging with some surreal touches that seem a little forced. still, to whatever degree mr. sher shaped the courageous performances of his stars, and this very strong cast, he deserves much credit.
though he does allow them to be mocked. the specter of foolishness hovers close to many of the people found in mad country. the distinction between the questions who might i actually be? and just who do you think you are? is repeatedly revealed to be a slippery one. in freak street, set in 1970s nepal, a young american woman decides she is nepali, changing her name from sofi to sukumari, taking to wearing nepali clothes and calling her landlady ma. she is ridiculed for doing so, though again, her masquerade is the product of a profound unhappiness. the boy pointed at sukumari. 'she! she's funny! look at her. she a kuiriney hippie, but she thinks she's nepali.' with this drumbeat of mockery, upadhyay illuminates the unquestioned pressures on us all to remain as we are, a key element in a book about societal constructs, emotional exigencies and identity.
late in the fall of 1862, grant's army moved south, leaving only twenty-five hundred troops in holly springs. until that time holly springs had suffered little damage, although the town and the surrounding countryside had changed hands frequently. on a plantation near holly springs, eighteen-year-old cordelia scales wrote letters describing the changing parade of union and confederate troops that camped in her yard. both seem to have foraged--but not unduly. some outlying plantations suffered more than others, but major destruction of the town began with the raid by confederate general earl van dorn on 20 december 1862. van dorn's men quickly routed the outnumbered and unsuspecting federal troops in holly springs. knowing they had little time, confederate soldiers rapidly looted the easily transportable federal supplies. then, from early morning until 4:00 p.m., they set fire to the many buildings housing the remaining stores. exploding ammunition caused further destruction and some deaths. j. g. deupree, a participant, described the scene as
at a memorial service for him this week at the new york public library, the immensity of bob's loss was palpable. justice stephen breyer sent a note, read by the review's publisher, rea hederman. it extolled the importance of bob's forum for distinguishing sense from nonsense. ian buruma captured bob's particularly jewish identification with the oppressed and his decency – that word dear to camus, who observed in his novel the plague that, it may seem a ridiculous idea, but the only way to fight the plague is with decency. mark danner evoked the love of bob's life, grace dudley, and his sense of not knowing who i am after her death late last year. still, bob kept working. there were always things to do.
during the nineteenth century rosas tyranny, the male heirs of the wealthy guevara and lynch clans had fled argentina to join the california gold rush. after returning from exile, their american-born offspring, roberto guevara castro and ana isabel lynch, had married. ernesto was the sixth of their eleven children. they lived well, but they were no longer landed gentry. while her husband worked as a geographical surveyor, ana isabel raised the children in buenos aires. they summered at a rustic country house on her inherited slice of the old family seat. to prepare his son for a working life, roberto guevara had sent him to a state-run school, telling him: the only aristocracy i believe in is the aristocracy of talent.
mr. st. john began playing neil winters, a cosmetics executive who struggled with infidelity, alcoholism and many other plot twists, on the young and the restless in 1991. he most recently appeared as the character in january, completing nearly 1,700 episodes of the show.
in march 1929, celia became pregnant again. she hired a young galician-born nanny to look after ernestito, who was not yet a year old. carmen arias proved to be a welcome new addition to the family; she would live with the guevaras until her own marriage eight years later, and remain a lifelong family friend. freed from child-minding, celia began taking daily swims in the parana. she was a good swimmer, but one day when she was six month's pregnant, the river's current caught her. she would probably have drowned if two of her husband's axmen clearing the forest nearby hadn't seen her and thrown out liana vines to pull her to safety.
nobody can know for certain what goes on in a marriage, but political unions like the one between chuck and wendy — and anthony and huma, and bill and hillary — plainly involve considerations other than the boring-old conventions of trust, fidelity and happiness. we saw it last season, when chuck and wendy dined with a couple that does everything together and recoiled at their lovey-dovey intimacy. chuck sr. may seem like a sinister interloper in a relationship he knows nothing about, but he's there to remind wendy that she entered into a political marriage and that the arrangement calls for a certain amount of flexibility. a couple of scenes later, when chuck advises wendy to tell oliver dake the truth (i don't want you to lie for me), it may be the most romantic moment they've ever had on the show. they even hold hands!
i'm sure she does want it to go faster, rinaldi said of the process. she's got high expectations obviously, and it's tough to manage those in the beginning and be patient with herself. but as you can see, i think that's what makes her so great, too, is that she is tough on herself and has that drive. she wants to be back, wants to be playing and wants to be winning titles, it seems, and absolutely nobody knows how to do that better than she does.
for a few months, the guevaras spent an enjoyable time settling in and exploring the area. they sportfished, boated, and rode horses with benson, or else drove into montecarlo on their mule-drawn buggy. to eight-year-old gertrudis kraft, whose parents ran a little hostel on the montecarlo road, the guevaras were admirable, rich and elegant people, whose rustic home by the river was a mansion.
some critics called for judge nance to resign or face ethics charges after thursday's order. chris hartman, director of the fairness campaign, an l.g.b.t. advocacy group, said the order displayed clear discrimination.

versed in zen buddhism and taoism, he wrote in a statement for a 1988 exhibition that his aim in his tranquil paintings was to dissolve everything into drops of water and return it transparently into nothingness.
starting in my youth, i went exclusively by sally as my american name . it's a change many asian immigrants make in order to assimilate to their new worlds. having a western name was a kind of status symbol in the ethnic enclave of southern california where i grew up, where the prosperous and so-called model minorities aimed to set themselves apart.
nichols found fame in his mid-20s. his improvisational comedy routines with elaine may, whom he'd met in chicago, were fresh and irresistible. they took their act to broadway in 1960, where nichols met richard burton. through burton, he would get to know elizabeth taylor.
that's about the time when we first started getting serious, said mr. spencer, who graduated from m.i.t. and received a ph.d. in electrical engineering from the university of california, berkeley.
responsibility to community is the first question we must answer for ourselves. i believe that in writing honestly about my experience as a gay man, i have also contributed one more example of what it means to be a puerto rican man.
argentina's political system had not kept pace with its changing society and had stagnated. for decades, two parties, the radical and the conservative, had ruled the country's destiny. the current radical president, hipolito yrigoyen, was aging and eccentric, a sphinxlike figure who rarely spoke or appeared in public. workers had few rights, and strikes were often suppressed by gunfire and police batons. criminals were transported by ship to serve terms of imprisonment in the cold southern wastes of patagonia. but, with immigration and the twentieth century, new political ideas had also arrived. feminists, socialists, anarchists, and now fascists began making their voices heard. in the argentina of 1927, political and social change was inevitable, but had not yet come.
i couldn't wait to shed for good the stupid jokes involving santa claus and prostitutes, comforting myself with the idea that i had a married name to look forward to. it was a western tradition i was excited for, even though it's not the norm in asian cultures like mine.
any ensemble making its american debut is likely to feel some jitters, especially when the program includes a masterpiece as dense and thorny as beethoven's op. 130. but on sunday, members of the maxwell string quartet had an additional reason for feeling a little, well, vulnerable.
the guevaras' honeymoon idyll, such as it was, did not last long. within a few short months, celia's pregnancy was well advanced, and it was time to return to civilization, where she could give birth in greater comfort and security. the couple set out downriver and ended their journey in rosario, an important parana port city of three hundred thousand inhabitants. there, celia went into labor, and their son ernesto guevara de la serna was born.
he's an even huger fan of disney (which now owns star wars, so maybe that's redundant). he estimates that he's been to disney theme parks, including disneyworld, disneyland and disneyland paris, at least 20 times, starting when he was 6 months old. something draws me to the idea of being able to live in another world, he said.
the city's docks were bustling: ships carried argentina's meat, grains, and hides off to europe while others docked bringing american studebakers, gramophones, and the latest paris fashions. the city boasted an opera house, a stock exchange, and a fine university; rows of imposing neoclassical public buildings and private mansions; landscaped green parks with shade trees and polo fields, as well as ample boulevards graced with heroic statues and sparkling fountains. electric streetcars rattled and zinged along cobbled streets past elegant, bronzed-doored confiterias and wiskerias with gold lettering on etched glass windows. in their mirrored and marble interiors, haughty white-jacketed waiters with slicked-down hair posed and swooped like vigilant, gleaming eagles.
their homestead was in a place named puerto caraguatai, named in guarani after a beautiful native red flower, but its puerto was just a small wooden jetty. caraguatai was reached by a two-day river journey up from the old trading port of posadas on the ibera, a venerable victorian paddle-wheel steamer that had done prior service carrying british colonials up the nile. the nearest outpost was the small german settlers' community of montecarlo, five miles away, but the guevaras found they had a friendly neighbor who lived a few minutes' walk through the forest. charles benson was a retired english railway engineer and an avid angler, and just above the river he had built himself a white, rambling bungalow with its own internal water closet imported from england.
ida recalled that her father was interested in politics and remembered the anxious way my mother walked the floor at night when my father was out to a political meeting. her mother had good reason to be concerned. whites resented all black political participation but especially loathed the loyal league, a black political organization founded and often controlled by white republicans across the south. the holly springs branch of the league was established by a. c. mcdonald of shaw university and nelson gill of the freedmen's bureau. it usually met in gill's home or in the black baptist church. during one meeting, members of the local ku klux klan hid under gill's house listening to the proceedings and waiting for j. l. holland, who had been chosen among them by lot, to shoot gill. when holland finally decided it was time and aimed his pistol, another klansman had second thoughts and knocked the gun out of holland's hand just as he fired it. no one was hurt, but all were scared. afterward, pickets were posted outside during loyal league meetings.
but ernesto still belonged by birthright to argentine society. he had grown up on his mother's stories of california frontier life, and listening to his father's own terrifying tales of indian attacks and sudden death in the high andes. his family's illustrious and adventurous past was a legacy too powerful to overcome. he was nineteen when his father died, and although he went to college, studying architecture and engineering, he dropped out before graduation. he wanted to have his own adventures and make his own fortune, and he used his father's modest inheritance to pursue the goal.
i am trying to apply this lesson as i follow chris's example, knowing that as an emergency-medicine physician, it's inevitable that i will be informing families about a loved one's death. i don't view this as a dreaded duty. it is part of being human and connecting with others. i want to pass this knowledge on.
in late 1929, the family packed up once more for the long trip downriver to buenos aires. their land was cleared and their yerbatal had just been planted, but celia was about to give birth to their second child, and guevara lynch's presence was urgently needed at the astillero san isidro. during his absence, business had gone badly, and now one of its investors had withdrawn. they planned to be away only a few months, but they would never return as a family to puerto caraguatai. it was the end of what ernesto guevara lynch recalled as difficult but very happy years.
if that child had not grown up to become the renowned revolutionary che, his parents' secret might well have gone with them to their graves. he must be one of the rare public figures of modern times whose birth and death certificates are both falsified. yet it seems uniquely fitting that guevara, who spent most of his adult life engaged in clandestine activities and who died as the result of a secret conspiracy, should have also begun life with a subterfuge.
joanne rogers, who as the gregarious wife of fred rogers, the influential creator and host of mister rogers' neighborhood, spread his message of kindness after his death in 2003, died on thursday at her home in pittsburgh. she was 92.
as grant's army moved deeper into slave territory, slaves began coming in larger numbers to the union camps. to handle the hordes, grant asked chaplain john eaton to establish a camp for the contrabands. eaton chose grand junction, tennessee, as the camp's location--just across the state line from holly springs. eaton later described the scene of slaves coming garbed in rags or silks, with feet shod or bleeding, individually or in families and larger groups,--an army of slaves and fugitives, pushing its way irresistibly toward an army of fighting men. although the wells family and many other slaves chose to remain in holly springs, the camp's nearby location had an ameliorating impact on slavery in that city.
the factions agreed to allocate $39 million to support communities historically marginalized by the sin of racism, according to the agreement. that sum includes $13 million the traditionalists contributed instead of receiving as part of their portion.
ida bell wells was the first child born to the couple. her birth on 16 july 1862 was in the midst of the civil war. at first the union and the confederacy carefully tried to separate the issue of slavery from their war aims, but the process of the war ultimately destroyed the system of human bondage. when union troops arrived nearby, many slaves sought to liberate themselves by fleeing behind union lines. after a period of confusion over the status of these fugitives (at first, slaves were often returned to their confederate masters), the u.s. congress directed that escaped slaves of rebel masters could be considered contraband of war and proclaimed free. nevertheless, when union troops moved out of a region, some of the newly freed slaves found themselves recaptured in the web of slavery. for many southerners of all shades, the transition from slavery to freedom was chaotic and confusing. ida wells's birthplace was the scene of more-than-average confusion.
the doorbell rang. i opened the door to the three sheriff's deputies. i managed to speak first. it was him, wasn't it? i said. my voice was barely a squeak. my tears started as they asked if they could come in. one of them was a chaplain, who sat on the couch and confirmed my fears. much after that is a blur. many other phone calls were made: to a friend who would come over so i wouldn't be alone; to my parents, who would fly out the next day to be with me. the conversation with the deputies came around to informing chris's mother. she was in kentucky. one of them called to lexington. the police there were busy with new year's eve festivities. the deputy called a fire chief, who said he didn't feel comfortable with the task. it was left to me.
los angeles — the composer matthew aucoin began working on crossing, his first opera, when he was in college. it was a work of enormous talent, exciting promise and considerable hubris: mr. aucoin wrote his own libretto, inventing a story about walt whitman's work with wounded soldiers during the civil war.
by 1860 the county's population had grown to almost 29,000, including 1,295 slave owners and 17,439 slaves; the free black population remained at 8. now a minority, whites became even more determined to retain slavery as a source of control and power, and marshall county played an integral role in mississippi's march toward secession. one of its residents was coauthor of the state's ordinance of secession, and when it was signed on 9 january 1861, the county provided five signatories--more than any other county. thus a year and a half before ida wells's birthday, her parents and the rest of holly springs probably waited anxiously for the outcome of the bold move toward disunion.
janacek's restless music suggests that this nostalgic confession is fraught with katya's instability. the emotional complexities came through strongly on friday night when the juilliard school opened a production of katya kabanova by the director stephen wadsworth at the peter jay sharp theater — and not just because the soprano felicia moore, as katya, sang so expressively.
a partisan narrator but probably not an unreliable one, melinda is somehow able to present flashbacks to moments that she didn't see. that's just one of several ways in which mr. perry's screenplay feels structurally shaky. already ungainly in its mix of social realism and parable — melinda undergoes a series of overwrought, essentially biblical trials in a city vaguely identified as present-day pittsburgh — acrimony truly gets muddled once it starts making excuses for its excuse-making antagonist.
thursday would have been the 100th birthday of the composer, pianist and conductor leon kirchner, who died at 90 in 2009. one of the most comprehensive musicians of his day, he was a valued teacher during a long career at harvard. as a composer, mr. kirchner demonstrated that one could write works of rigorous complexity employing modernist techniques but in an instinctive, richly expressive, viscerally dramatic way.
the plot is simple: a married woman is trying to forget her lover. the woman, maggie ellmann, a contented mother of two grown children, meets james, a married poet, at a conference. they spend two years falling into a long-distance emotional affair. the affair culminates in a single, searing night together in chicago, after which they part for good. in the unsent letters she writes to james during this embargo, maggie struggles to find a theological framework for her longing and her pain. in one such letter, she admires the buddhist notion of death as the ultimate lack of attachment, noting, what relief there would be in no longer longing to feel, again, your whiskers on my inner thighs. her antagonist is time — so slow when she is trying to forget, so quick when she reflects on the simpler years with her husband and children, before the erotic disruption.
by the time he met celia, ernesto had invested most of his money with a wealthy relative in a yacht-building company, the astillero san isidro. he worked there for a time as an overseer, but it was not enough to hold his interest. soon he was enthused about a new project: a friend had convinced him he could make his fortune by growing yerba mate, the stimulating native tea ritually drunk by millions of argentines.
if we are going to let liberal judges write their personal biases and prejudices into law, as we have done on issues of marriage and sexuality, then, in the interest of fairness, we are going to have to allow judges with different views to at least recuse themselves from such cases, martin cothran, a spokesman for the group, said in a statement.
a cascade of embarrassment would overcome me any time my real first name, phuong, was discovered. the start and end of the school year served as the bookends to my self-consciousness.
some musical highlights of my years living in boston were the concerts mr. kirchner conducted with the harvard chamber orchestra. he was not the tidiest technician. but he led scores by mozart, beethoven, brahms and contemporary giants like a fellow composer who completely understood how the piece at hand worked. anthony tommasini
after all, what if robert really means well? what if this time will be different? in addition to endorsing the logic that keeps spouses stockholm syndrome'd in bad marriages, acrimony also offers poor economic advice (melinda's enduring devotion to robert is an illustration of the sunk-cost fallacy — except that the movie suggests she hasn't sunk enough). and the less said about the yacht-based climax, featuring some of the least convincing ship-jumping ever filmed, the better.
local churches will choose whether to join any new traditionalist denomination or remain in the united methodist church. several people interviewed on friday believed that most american churches would stay, though there has not been any formal survey.
mr. trump's comments about mr. cohen on saturday, made during a friendly interview with jeanine pirro of fox news, were his first extended remarks on the matter since mr. cohen's congressional testimony was announced. asked by ms. pirro if he was worried about the testimony, mr. trump called mr. cohen weak and asserted — in contradiction to filings by federal prosecutors in manhattan — that mr. cohen had no information on him.
nichols moved to manhattan to make it as a comedian. a friend said that she would enter his tiny apartment and the smell of acetone — wig-glue remover — would just hit you in the face.
after the war was over, james wells accepted bolling's invitation to continue working for him. like most freed people, wells sought to test and taste the varied fruits of freedom. he first exercised those rights that white southerners had grudgingly conceded--legalizing his marriage and seeking education for his family. the wells family continued to grow in the years following the war, and eventually ida had four brothers and three sisters. both parents were eager for their children to go to school. former slaves realized that education had been forbidden because it was a key to freedom and a source of white power. most slave children had worked at an early age; their freed fathers wanted them to have childhoods more like those of their former masters' children. ida wells later recalled, our job was to go to school and learn all we could.
i called the police and was connected to the dispatch office in the county where the avalanche had occurred. the dispatcher asked for my husband's name. i told her. hold on a minute, she said. she returned to the line. well, we don't have his name right here, she said. i will have the coroner call you back one way or the other. that should have been my clue. either she didn't want to tell me or she wasn't authorized to deliver the news.
with celia's money, guevara lynch bought two hundred hectares (about five hundred acres) of jungle along the banks of the rio parana. on a bluff overlooking the coffee-colored water and the dense green forest of the paraguayan shore, they erected a roomy wooden house on stilts, with an outdoor kitchen and outhouse. they were a long way from the comforts of buenos aires, but guevara lynch was enraptured. with an entrepreneur's eager eye, he looked into the jungle around him, and he saw the future.
her memoir, self-published last year, was titled, i never wanted to be a star — and i wasn't.
on their sixth date, the book club was created.
her death, at the motion picture & television fund's retirement home in woodland hills, where she had lived for a decade, was confirmed by her daughter lisa dudley.
in 1832, british naturalist charles darwin had witnessed the atrocities waged against argentina's native indians by gaucho warlord juan manuel de rosas, and predicted: the country will be in the hands of white gaucho savages instead of copper-coloured indians. the former being a little superior in education, as they are inferior in every moral virtue.
the novel dips back through time to track life before the affair. the mores of the ellmanns' lives are exceedingly conventional, as are many of the novel's touchstones — weddings, baptisms, the death of pets. but the way this slim book condenses these happenings in the context of the affair gives them poetry. lyrical lists of domestic detritus contain the sweetness of child rearing, as well as a mysterious sense of loss: parent meetings, medical forms, class photos, permission slips. organelles. passive versus active transport. quatro cuts gorgeous topiaries into the domestic landscape. maggie's little daughter mispronounces nail polish as pale nolish; her son fashions a makeshift loincloth from his father's old t-shirt, with a wrapping-paper tube for a spear. but over the years, invasive plants encroach, privet and wisteria, thistle and honeysuckle. the backyard steadily shrinks. even before she meets james, maggie is aware of a lack of feeling, an inattentiveness to self — this nothing. this nothing can partly be traced back to two difficult childbirths, and the habitual surrendering of her own body to others, most especially during sex, into which her usually benign husband manipulates and bullies her. middle age looms. the children grow into complicated teenagers, then leave for college. in other words, maggie has been in a personal stasis for a long time. enter james. she first becomes aware of him through reading his poetry, which she admires. i think i'm going to write to him, she announces to her husband, thomas.
in november 1973, mr. krogh, known as bud, pleaded guilty to conspiracy against rights of citizens for his role in the september 1971 break-in at the office of dr. lewis fielding in beverly hills, calif.
that was more than three decades ago, and over the years the company they founded — now called mcc theater, with a focus on new work by living writers — has become one of the more respected off broadway nonprofits, attracting such stars as lucas hedges, judith light and zachary quinto to its stages.
his passion for the imaginary goes way beyond musicals. he's a huge fan of star wars — we watched 'a new hope' in english class to learn about archetypes, and i was like, 'oh my god, this is the coolest thing' — and has dressed as general grievous and kylo ren for halloween. (it's not that he's drawn to the dark side; it's just, he says, that those characters look cooler.)
since the 1870s, the country had become more stable. and, when the conquest of the southern pampas was finally secured after an officially sponsored campaign to exterminate the native indian population, vast new lands had opened up for colonization. the pampas were fenced in as grazing and farming lands; new towns and industries sprang up; railroads, ports, and roads were built. by the turn of the century, its population had tripled, swollen by the influx of over a million immigrants from italy, spain, germany, britain, russia, and the middle east who had poured into the rich southern land of opportunity--and still they came.
rendered with meticulous care, mr. kim's drops can seem to sit miraculously atop his raw canvases or be in the midst of gliding down them, leaving a trail of moisture. they glimmer with light and cast shadows, and while vividly present, they are always on the verge of evanescing. they made mr. kim one of the most celebrated korean artists of his time.
last year, her boyfriend wanted to marry her, but her family refused because they perceived him as coming from a lower social class, said nourah, who spoke on the condition that only her first name be used for her safety. her father began to arrange her marriage to a man she did not know and who wanted to bar her from working. in october, a day before her prospective groom arrived, she ran away.
while the men were divvying up the children, ida had sat quietly. when they finished, however, she calmly announced that her parents would turn over in their graves to know their children had been scattered like that and she did not intend to let it happen. she would care for them if the masons would help her find work. although they initially scoffed at the idea, ida was adamant and they relented--probably relieved to be rid of the responsibility. wells later subtly altered the past and her experiences at rust university by recollecting, after being a happy, light-hearted schoolgirl i suddenly found myself at the head of a family. actually, her days there were less than idyllic, and she continued to attend rust between school terms until her expulsion some two years later.
in addition to exercising their rights to marriage and education, freedmen eagerly embraced the right to vote. for the entire republican reconstruction period in mississippi (1867-1875), african americans comprised a majority of the county's population and overwhelmingly supported republicans despite white democrats' efforts to win their votes. the democrats used both carrots and sticks to woo black voters. many used economic intimidation to persuade african americans to vote for democrats. james wells was one victim of such tactics. when bolling found out that wells had not voted democratic, he locked wells out of his shop. wells, however, was not easily intimidated. without saying a word to anyone, he bought his own tools, rented a house, and moved his family out of the dwelling owned by bolling.
arnold l. lehman is echt brooklyn.
it was approaching midnight where chris's mom lived. i wondered: should i wait until morning? i dreaded causing her the pain i knew was to come. the wretched cry i had heard from my own mother minutes before would surely be multiplied a hundredfold. for a moment i thought that if i could wait until morning maybe i would think of the right words. there are many gaps in my memories of that night. one comment i do remember was this: i'm a father, one of the deputies said. i would want to know now. i made the call. i told her that, yes, his body had been recovered and passed on the coroner's contact information. she responded with tears and devastation and shared in my disbelief of whether this moment was real.
the lehmans have filled up not only their high-ceiling floor-through in brooklyn, but also a house in maine and an apartment in miami. so they've finally slowed down. collecting is a lot easier now that we're not collecting anymore, said mr. lehman, who also formerly led the baltimore museum of art.
mr. frankel said the mutual friend, lauren jacobs, had reached out to him to say, i have this girl for you.
i learned of bob's passing while i was in france, where he'd worked for the paris review in the 1950s. i was a friend, not a close one, but i'd written one piece a year or so for him since 2008, and he would take me to lunch at en, a japanese brasserie near his downtown office. he was gallant, droll and courtly (another description of his accent, reported by thomas meaney in the times literary supplement, captured it as mineola via the grand tour). he was also challenging, indignant about all injustice, and a quiet saboteur of every jejune idea.
although wells was listed as the head of the household in the 1880 u.s. census, she received help in meeting her responsibilities from her extended family and friends. mr. and mrs. james hall, family friends who were in their early thirties, served as guardians. after fallacious rumors that wells was having an affair with a white doctor, her grandmother, peggy, came from the country to stay with them. although she was in her seventies, she tried to help out by working during the day. however, one night peggy collapsed with a paralytic stroke, and her daughter took her back to the country to care for her until she died?
when asked about guardianship laws last year, the prince said that saudi arabia had to figure out a way to treat this that doesn't harm families and doesn't harm the culture.
cooper kupp, a sure-handed receiver for the los angeles rams, scanned the piece of paper, then leapt past his surprised son to embrace his wife, anna kupp. the message: june would soon be a big brother.
saturday was not the first time mr. trump has targeted mr. cohen's family. after mr. cohen pleaded guilty to his crimes, the president said mr. cohen had done so only to save his wife and his father-in-law.
i was very excited, mr. spencer said. though i must admit, i needed a bit of a nudge to remember having met kayla previously through the car pool.
yet even sarmiento had wielded a dictator's authority to lead the country, and with his death the argentine cult of the strongman, or caudillo, had not disappeared. caudillismo would remain a feature of politics well into the next century as government swung back and forth between caudillos and democrats in a bewildering, cyclical dance. indeed, as if reflecting the sharp contrasts of the great land they had conquered, there was an unreconciled duality in the argentine temperament, seemingly balanced in a state of perpetual tension between savagery and enlightenment. at once passionate, volatile, and racist, argentines were also expansive, humorous, and hospitable. the paradox had produced a flourishing culture and found expression in classic works of literature such as ricardo guiraldes's don segundo sombra and the gaucho epic poem martin fierro by jose hernandez.
via writing exercises and discussion, students will gain an appreciation for plot, character, setting, mood, tone, dialogue, chronology, structure, tension, etc. they will experience the short story as a brief immersion in the lives and experiences of others — a vehicle for insight. students may come to understand, for example, why a 39-year-old woman, graduate degree in hand and reasonably attractive, would allow herself to be seduced by a potbellied has-been 20 years her senior, a scholar-cum-novelist who, after buying her a number of drinks at a conference, persuaded her to relocate from a reasonable metropolitan area to a splotch on the prairie, only to reunite, two and a half weeks after her arrival, with an almost-ex-wife he had somehow neglected to mention.
among other things, billions is a show about american aristocracy, of two men burnishing a legacy that will etch their families' names in the firmament for generations to come. one of the key distinctions between chuck rhoades and bobby axelrod is that they approach the same goal from different angles: chuck is an old-money political climber, on a conventional (if currently twisty) path from united states attorney to the governor's office, boosted by his father's reputation and connections. axe is a nouveau riche brawler from yonkers, using hedge fund billions to bully his way to the status his name itself cannot afford. hence the sizable donation necessary to change an august manhattan performance space into axelrod hall last season — the dubious permanence of which i likened to enron field in houston.
although a numerical minority in marshall county, democrats were able to get most of their candidates elected as late as the election of 1871. to do so, they utilized both intimidation and fraud. tactics included counterfeiting republican ballots, attempting to confuse voters by using african americans to distribute democratic tickets, hiding in the building to stuff ballot boxes while the election clerks were eating supper, and requiring black voters to present written proof of their age. as a result of reported electoral fraud, the state legislature refused to seat two marshall county democrats elected in 1871. in the next election, the republicans swept all the county's offices. one african american served as state senator and three as representatives. however, two years later in 1875, the democrats returned to power--permanently. black mississippi politician john roy lynch later noted, the new order of things was then set aside and the abandoned methods of a few years back were reviewed, reinaugurated, and readopted.
his doctored birth certificate, drawn up at the civil registrar's office on june 15, was witnessed by a cousin of guevara lynch's who lived in rosario and a brazilian taxi driver evidently drafted at the last minute. the document says the baby was delivered at 3:05 a.m. on the morning of june 14, in his parent's domicile on calle entre rios 480.
i am 17. since i was a baby, my mother has taken me to church with her on sunday mornings. recently, i've felt less religious and less interested in going than i used to. but when i bring this up with her, it always ends in a screaming match (especially on sunday mornings). she believes i must go. we get along fairly well otherwise. is there a better way to broach this subject, or should i simply endure the weekly ritual until i go to college?
maj. charles s. kettles, an army helicopter commander in the vietnam war, led an extraordinary rescue operation that saved the lives of dozens of airborne troops who had been ambushed by north vietnamese soldiers in may 1967. president barack obama would later describe the incident as like a bad rambo movie.
season 2, episode 2: 'dead cat bounce'
in 1878 ida b. wells encountered the next painful chapter of her life while on a visit to her grandmother. that year witnessed a devastating yellow fever epidemic in the mississippi valley. the region had undergone previous epidemics of yellow fever, but none was as extensive or deadly as the 1878 outbreak. an unusually mild winter, an early spring, and a blistering hot summer had allowed the mosquitoes, which served as the fever's agent of transmission, to breed prolifically and over a wide range of territory. thus the fever spread to areas that had never experienced an epidemic; therefore, most residents of those regions had no acquired immunities to yellow fever. compounding these factors, the strain of virus that year was particularly deadly, which caused higher mortality rates even in areas previously infected. in some regions the mortality rates exceeded 50 percent.
guevara lynch now made a serious attempt to get his plantation off the ground. he hired a paraguayan foreman, or capataz, named curtido, to oversee the clearing of his land and the planting of his first crop of yerba mate. but when it came to hiring laborers, he had to confront the system of labor bondage, still practiced widely in the untamed region.
but the story of his heroism and those of his fellow helicopter crewmen remained largely unknown beyond military circles for nearly half a century.
we both remembered being children and grappling with our cultural identities.
when, in 1927, ernesto guevara lynch first met celia de la serna, she had just graduated from the exclusive buenos aires catholic girls' school, sacre coeur. she was a dramatic-looking girl of twenty with an aquiline nose, wavy dark hair, and brown eyes. celia was well read but unworldly, devout but questioning. ripe, in other words, for a romantic adventure.
who will win? we'd love to know, too. our awards-season expert, kyle buchanan, has made his oscar predictions, and the short answer is that the world war i drama 1917 is well-positioned. then again the south korean thriller parasite could pose strong competition. buchanan also expects the quartet of joaquin phoenix (joker), renée zellweger (judy), brad pitt (once upon a time … in hollywood) and laura dern (marriage story) to take home acting trophies, as they have all season long.
when ida arrived at the house, she found out that all the children except eugenia had been stricken with the fever. although most had slight cases, the baby had died on 3 october, and two still remained in bed. eugenia told her what had happened since the fever struck, recounting their father's contribution to the emergency. to protect his family while he built coffins and comforted the sick, james wells left home but came daily as far as the gate to bring food and to check on them. elizabeth, however, was the first of the family to be stricken. an irish woman was sent to nurse her, and james came home to help--only to come down with the fever himself.
bernie telsey was still a student at n.y.u. when he met an actor named robert lupone and decided to form a theater club. their duo became a trio when they met will cantler, and soon they were putting on shows whenever and wherever they could.
the remarkable journey of ida wells began during the civil war in the northern mississippi town of holly springs. it was not the most auspicious place for an african american to be born, for mississippi has been the site of horrific incidents of white racism and violence. in the antebellum period, slaves from other states feared being sold down to mississippi; later, some of the bloodiest chapters of the civil rights movement would be written there. nevertheless, ida b. wells was born at a time and place in mississippi that offered african americans cause for hope as well as discouragement. her parents also emerged from slavery with more opportunity than many.
it's a little scary for all of us — for him, for me, for his mom — because we're asking a lot of him, said stacey mindich, the show's lead producer. but in every single moment he has grown with us already — at every passage he has shown us he is uber-capable.
because whites were outnumbered, a constant fear of racial revolt lingered in many minds. such fear was intensified by the uncertainties of war. early in the hostilities planters summoned home some of their hired-out slaves. the state legislature also moved to control slaves by penalizing masters who granted their bondsmen and bondswomen too much freedom. even so, rumors spread like epidemics, fanning the fever of fear with lurid descriptions of insurrection plots. hysteria required no tangible evidence. the month ida was born, the provost marshal of natchez reported the hanging of forty african americans during the preceding year, foreshadowing the postwar terror and murder of black men to retain white control. by the end of the century only the dominant excuse had changed--from insurrection to rape.
in a key scene in tonight's episode, chuck rhoades sr. pays a visit to wendy's home while her husband is away. for chuck sr., there's no more important goal than making certain his son builds upon the rhoades family legacy in the state of new york. and being the connected person that he is, it was only a matter of time before news of chuck and wendy's separation made its way through the grapevine. chuck sr. doesn't want to hear wendy's rationale about the lies and deception that led to the separation, which to him are mere bumps in the road. she needs to think about the children. she needs to think about how much harder it will be for little kevin rhoades to meet his station in life. they are the future of my name, he tells her, adding, you'd really rather have your three nights a week than be first lady of the state of new york?
as guevara lynch worked his plantation, his young son was learning how to walk. to help train him, his father used to send him to the kitchen with a little pot of yerba mate to give the cook for boiling. invariably stumbling along the way, ernestito would angrily pick himself up and carry on. another routine developed as a consequence of the pernicious insects that infested caraguatai. every night, while his son lay sleeping in his crib, guevara lynch and curtido crept quietly into his room. while his patron trained a flashlight on his son, curtido carefully used the burning tip of his cigarette to dislodge the day's harvest of chiggers burrowed into the baby's flesh.
the solution that we received is a welcome relief to the conflict we have been experiencing, said the rev. tom berlin, who represented groups that opposed discrimination against l.g.b.t. people in the mediation. i am very encouraged that the united methodist church found a way to offer a resolution to a long conflict.

alexandra levy olsman and zachary isaac frankel lived across rittenhouse square from each other at a young age and went to the same montessori preschool in philadelphia. but, when a mutual friend introduced them in october 2016, they had no memory of ever meeting.
of all the frantic, frightened human beings few were more scared than the negroes and abolitionists begging for mercy. james and elizabeth wells may well have feared for their six-month-old infant.
he got his first set (hair, eyebrows) before he went to college. it was dismal. nichols attended the university of chicago, where susan sontag was also a student. one reason they didn't date, harris writes, is that she was thrown off by his wig.
for if, as some have argued, dinner parties heralded the dawn of civilization, in this brawling era they might soon hasten its end. anxiety over forced commingling may explain why the trope of the nightmare feast has taken hold in the imaginations of contemporary artists. in the filmmaker sally potter's recent farce the party, guests are at each other's throats before they down a single hors d'oeuvre. shattering revelations bring a whiff of hell: i smell burning, a guest says. the vol-au-vents, the hostess sighs, momentarily distracted from her disemboweled marriage. thomas adès's opera the exterminating angel, which had its american premiere this fall, revisits the surrealist luis buñuel's 1962 film of the same title, in which socialites at a posh soiree can't muster the will to leave. they stay, trapped by their own ennui, until food and drink run out, until the mask — of who they strive to be in the presence of others — slips, and they wind up slaughtering a sheep and roasting it over a burning cello. (in uncanny synergy, buñuel's vision has likewise infiltrated both a musical-in-progress by stephen sondheim and david ives, and darren aronofsky's vexed 2017 horror movie, mother!, which ends in cannibalism and an ugly subversion of the last supper.)
hearing chuck sr. badger wendy over her marriage recalled, for me, last year's excellent documentary weiner, about the former congressman anthony weiner's failed campaign to become the mayor of new york city. among the many casualties of that run — including, in a tangential way, the presidential ambitions of hillary clinton — was the marriage between weiner and huma abedin, who also happened to a top clinton aide. there was a time when weiner and abedin were securing their place in the aristocracy: they married the year after weiner won the first of his seven terms in the house of representatives — bill clinton officiated their wedding — and their union survived the first sexting scandal, nicknamed weinergate, which led to his resignation from congress. weiner chronicles his attempt at a political comeback, which unravels after another round of sexts, sent under the pseudonym carlos danger, torpedoes his campaign for good.
wharton's genius lies in her novelistic ability to allow her characters their perspectives while seeing the situation from all sides. both in her lifetime and since, she has been maligned for being born rich (franzen complains that privilege like hers isn't easy to like; it puts her at a moral disadvantage); and janet flanner accused her, in a waspish 1929 new yorker profile, of lacking sensuality and sympathy, of formally proving that the wages of social sin were social death. but in fact wharton — who could well have sat around in her fancy houses eating bonbons with her feet up rather than writing wonderfully entertaining, humanly true novels that have stood the test of time — turned her critical eye equally upon transgressors and upholders of convention alike. that's not to excuse her snobbery or to overlook the limitations of accounts of high society; but now, as then, we're fascinated by the lives of the wealthy, and shouldn't project our own secret shame about it onto wharton. her sharp wit is hard on all her characters, and crucially, she captures also their redeeming qualities, their humanity. she sees and understands undine's laser-focused ambition, her parents' trembling and self-sacrificing indulgence, ralph's highly cultured but weak romanticism, elmer's robust desire for material success. and she appreciates also undine's splendor, her vitality and allure, ralph's delicacy and tenderness, elmer's frankness and generosity.
celia de la serna was a true argentine blue blood of undiluted spanish noble lineage. one ancestor had been the spanish royal viceroy of colonial peru; another a famous argentine military general. her paternal grandfather had been a wealthy landowner, and celia's own father had been a renowned law professor, congressman, and ambassador. both he and his wife died while celia was still a child, leaving her and her six brothers and sisters to be raised by a religious guardian aunt. but despite her parents' untimely deaths, the family had conserved its revenue-producing estates, and celia was due a comfortable inheritance when she reached the legal age of twenty-one.

wells taught for three years in marshall county and tate county schools and for six months in a school in cleveland county, arkansas. in 1881 wells accepted the invitation of her aunt, fannie wells, to come to memphis. fannie lived there with her three small children, having been widowed by the yellow fever epidemic. wells brought her two youngest sisters with her to memphis, while eugenia went to live with their aunt belle on her farm. after she arrived in the city at the age of nineteen, wells continued to teach--first in the nearby town of woodstock, and after 1884 in the city schools of memphis.
that is clearly true, but as with ramesh in beggar boy, the pretense has to do with enacting something genuinely felt. and while impostors are commonly thought of as assuming a higher status, to which they have no claim, these characters take on the identities of those they perceive to be of lower status, to whose sufferings they have no claim, in order to engage in a kind of theater of pain. their behaviors are particularly outlandish and so seem particularly egregious, but the wrong of using other people's troubles to soothe oneself is commonplace, a sin most of us commit at some point, which is perhaps why upadhyay maintains so empathic a stance toward his characters, even as they transgress.
so what is reasonable in terms of expectations? a few months for williams to get her bearings, drop some more weight and potentially pose a threat at wimbledon in july? or something more ambitious?

the deception had been necessary, she explained, because she was three months pregnant on the day she married che's father. immediately after their wedding, the couple had left buenos aires for the remote jungle backwater of misiones. there, as her husband set himself up as an enterprising yerba mate planter, she went through her pregnancy away from the prying eyes of buenos aires society. when she was near term, they traveled down the parana river to the city of rosario. she gave birth there, and a doctor friend falsified the date on her baby's birth certificate, moving it forward by one month to help shield them from scandal.
but i happened to be in a relationship at that time, said ms. mcculley, who graduated from pomona college and received two master's degrees, one in business administration and the other in sport management from the university of massachusetts amherst. she was also a fulbright scholar in switzerland from 2009-2010, where she conducted research on european sports law.
it is not everything that we would have hoped for, but we think it is a good agreement that gets us out of the decades-long conflict that we have experienced and enables us to focus on ministry in a positive way, said tom lambrecht, vice president of good news, one of the conservative groups.
still, since her broadway debut in 1948, she had accumulated about 140 acting credits in theatrical, movie and television productions.
there's really no difference, which is actually quite remarkable when you think about the additional layer of stigma these children are growing up with, she said.
i've read everything by colson whitehead, so the algorithms led me to percival everett's erasure, but it just didn't click. i've read most of t. c. boyle, but he's just writing the same book over and over now; and i stopped liking russell banks's work a while ago. (i understand his wanting to try different things, but how could the man who wrote the sweet hereafter also produce rule of the bone?)

seoul, south korea — kim tschang-yeul, who devoted a half century to creating luminous paintings of water drops that are informed by the trauma of war and eastern philosophy, died here on jan. 5. he was 91.
the next week, while ms. olsman was in england at christie's london, he texted her about meeting in new york when she got back.
eddie responded just as casually: what about our kids?
of course, the truth, as celia later told julia constenla de giussani (who had arranged for che's astral chart to be drawn up by their mutual astrologist friend), was that she had actually given birth in may, on the same day, and at the same hour as a striking dockworker nicknamed diente de oro (gold tooth) died of gunshot wounds.
until that time, wells had been sheltered by her parents, who were very protective. she had not been allowed to be in the presence of men unchaperoned, and her contacts with boys had been limited to what she called children's parties. she was naive and society was suspicious of women living without the protection of a father, husband, or male relative. the result was a pattern of rumors that would plague her until she married. after she insisted on staying in the family home with her siblings, the word spread that wells wanted the house for illicit assignations with a white man. she was dimly aware that such arrangements existed, but she was deeply shocked and hurt that people believed her capable of such action.
mrs. rogers was as comfortable being fred rogers's wife as she was performing for nearly 40 years in a piano-playing duo with her college friend jeannine morrison. mr. rogers was also a trained pianist, but he was not considered as adept as his wife.
some african americans followed the path of james wells, but black voters responded in a variety of ways. like wells, a number openly demonstrated their independence--a few attended democratic barbecues and picnics adorned in caps with the republican insignia. others dissembled. one man, threatened with eviction by his white landlord if he voted republican, won a reprieve with the explanation that he had been forced to vote for republicans by black threats to run him out of town. many accepted democratic gifts and then voted republican anyway. a few did become democrats either out of loyalty to former masters or employers or because of economic threats and incentives. the leader of a black democratic club was rewarded with the gift of a small house by his white fellow democrats.
but even as the blood flowed, argentina had spawned its own pantheon of civic-minded historical heroes, from general jose de san martin, the country's liberator in the independence struggle with spain, to domingo sarmiento, the crusading journalist, educator, and president who had finally wrested argentina into the modern age as a unified republic. sarmiento's 1845 book, facundo (civilization and barbarity), had been a clarion call to his compatriots to choose the path of civilized man over the brutality of the archetypal argentine frontiersman, the gaucho.
olympia, now five months old, is here in asheville with williams, who experienced complications after giving birth by emergency cesarean section in september. she has said she spent the first six weeks of motherhood in bed. after her wedding in november, williams resumed training in earnest in december, a few weeks before she played and lost a lucrative exhibition match to jelena ostapenko in abu dhabi on dec. 30.
like many african american families, the wells family was part of a network of kinship. although elizabeth wells had been unable to locate her parents and other siblings, her sister belle, who had also been sold to mississippi owners, lived out in the country near holly springs. james wells's mother, peggy, married a black man (probably named buffer) after emancipation and also lived nearby. they apparently lived as man and wife during slavery and had a daughter named margaret and at least one other son. the butlers tilled a number of acres and brought their corn and cotton to sell in holly springs each fall. utilizing that trip for a family visit, they usually brought gifts, some of which ida called souvenirs from hog-killing time. on one such visit, ida recalled her father angrily refusing his mother's request to go see his father's widow, miss polly, reminding his mother of how miss polly had her whipped and saying, i am never going to see her. i guess it is all right for you to take care of her and forgive her for what she did to you, but she could have starved to death if i'd had my say-so. she certainly would have, if it hadn't been for you. in addition to those visits, ida sometimes went to stay with her grandmother and aunt and uncle, who helped peggy and her husband on the farm. apparently, another uncle and his wife, fannie butler, had three children and lived in memphis, tennessee.
if crossing (2015) lacked a certain kind of unity — as mr. aucoin, now 29, said in a recent interview — it was still taut, intense and audacious. what would he do next?

as they prepared to indict him, prosecutors had signaled to mr. cohen that his wife could be implicated, since she had also signed his tax returns. that threat helped push mr. cohen to plead guilty to the charges, according to a person familiar with the events.
the outsider art fair, up at the metropolitan pavilion in chelsea until sunday, is still one of the best deals in new york: compact, but filled from edge to edge with things to see. you can brush up on the heroes of the genre — work by self-taught artists — with a stunning henry darger panorama at andrew edlin at booth d14, and a gorgeous, never-before-shown martín ramírez drawing of a cowboy on a rearing purple horse at ricco/maresca (a11). you can make new discoveries, like the off-center flower paintings of john maull at tierra del sol (b1), or the eye-grabbing shopping-bag paintings of a retired peruvian parachute trooper who goes by judá ben hur at gabby yamamoto/espacio (b5).
wild and exciting: federals running; confederates yelling and pursuing; tents and houses burning; torches flaming; guns popping; sabres clanking; negroes and abolitionists begging for mercy; women, in dreaming robes and with disheveled hair floating in the morning breeze, shouting encouragement to the raiders; a mass of frantic, frightened human beings.
my heart pounded as i spoke up at roll call on the first day of school to ask my teachers to call me sally. and i would quickly and quietly cross out my legal name in yearbooks when the last day of school came near, replacing it with sally and hoping those who flipped past the page wouldn't notice.
wells was concerned about her younger siblings in holly springs. two years earlier the next oldest child, eugenia, had developed severe scoliosis that had bent her spinal column until she became paralyzed below the waist. next in order of birth were her brothers james, age eleven, and george, age nine. her two youngest sisters were five-year-old annie, and lily, about two. the youngest sibling was a nine-month-old baby named stanley. another brother, eddie, had died a number of years earlier of spinal meningitis. wells wanted to go to the children immediately, but her relatives would not allow her to leave until they received a letter from a doctor saying that she should come.
the guevaras remained in rosario while celia recovered from the delivery of ernestito. they rented a spacious, three-bedroom apartment with servant's quarters in an exclusive new residential building near the city center, at the address given on the birth certificate. their stay was prolonged when, shortly after his birth, the baby contracted bronchial pneumonia. ernesto's mother, ana isabel lynch, and his spinster sister ercilia came to help out.
connie sawyer, who began performing in vaudeville and nightclubs more than eight decades ago and continued to appear on stages and screens until she became known as the oldest working actress in hollywood, died on jan. 21 in los angeles. she was 105.
during a recent interview, the german soprano diana damrau and the italian tenor vittorio grigolo tried to describe the chemistry they have together onstage. reading their comments, i worried that they might be overthinking things. after all, they first worked together only last year, appearing as the lovers in massenet's manon at the metropolitan opera. the couple thrilled audiences and critics with the smoldering intensity they emitted. so this is a new relationship. in talking about their instinctive connection might they risk making it self-conscious?
you might not know the name gal gadot right now, but you've probably seen her in the fast and the furious movies. now comes the biggest moment in her career: the title role in warner brothers' wonder woman, due in june. it will be the first live-action superhero movie in more than a decade led by female talent in front of and behind the camera. our reporter roslyn sulcas was on set during production and asked her whether she was feeling any pressure to prove that men aren't the only ones who can succeed with such a franchise. ms. gadot laughed and said, when you put it like that, yes! read more here.
when the writer and director mike nichols was young, he had an allergic reaction to a whooping cough vaccine. the result was a complete and lifelong inability to grow hair. one way to read mark harris's crisp new biography, mike nichols: a life, is as a tender comedy about a man and his wigs.
in november, scientists and engineers from nasa's jet propulsion laboratory successfully field tested bruie — the buoyant rover for under-ice exploration — beneath the ice of eastern antarctica. the remotely operated rover was built to crawl along the underside of sea ice and ice shelves. these tests on earth have a long-term goal of one day seeking evidence of life beneath the thick frozen shell covering jupiter's ocean moon of europa. beneath that ice is three times more liquid water than can be found in all the oceans on earth.
there are books with front doors, through which the reader walks right in, and there are books with side doors. side door books take more interpretive work, but yield special pleasures. jamie quatro's fantastic new novel, fire sermon, is a side door book. the novel delivers its story through a variety of methods: first-person confessions, fictional third-person descriptions, letters sent and unsent, emails, questionnaires, socratic dialogues with the self. roiling, raw and sensual on the surface, this mazy novel rewards a second reading.
casey station, antarctica — near a nice, big hole in the ice and beneath the stone gray, midday antarctic summer skies, six adélie penguins stared at six men toiling with tools. the chasm in the ice might have been an inviting entry to the krill-rich waters below. none of the members of the tuxedoed recon party dove into the hole, a square about six feet across. the risk of leopard seals was just too great.
but the lehmans are serious when it comes to collecting contemporary art. they have a tracy-and-hepburn-style disagreement about exactly how many works they own: he says 300, she says 120. so they settle on 200. that kind of compromise may be why the marriage has lasted since 1969.
when their baby son was a month old, the couple notified their families. their story was that they had tried to reach buenos aires, but at rosario celia guevara had gone into labor prematurely. a baby born at seven months, after all, is not an out-of-the-question occurrence. if there were any doubts, the couple's story and their child's official birth date were quietly accepted by their families and friends, and remained unchallenged for years.
before his death, james's father had taken him to holly springs, in northern mississippi, to be apprenticed to a carpenter. thus at age eighteen, james wells gained a valuable skill and a measure of independence as a hired-out slave living in town. masters hired out their slaves to other people for a variety of reasons--usually for compensation or for their slaves to acquire certain skills. hired-out slaves enjoyed a wide range of freedom, and some received very little. life in cities and towns, however, gave many hired-out slaves some freedom from supervision, and most found more autonomy than the slaves on their masters' plantations.
this week, noah baumbach's marriage story received six oscar nominations, including for best actor (adam driver) and best actress (scarlett johansson). in the movie, an amicable split becomes a shattering rupture, a.o. scott writes in his review. what is happening is catastrophic, ridiculous and also — as the lawyers know — perfectly ordinary.
this year, its 28th in new york, the fair has also introduced a diffident handful of curated booths, including the writer and curator paul laster's relishing the raw: contemporary artists collecting outsider art (a8), in which mr. laster teases out suggestive connections between contemporary artists and their own personal collections: it's like listening to a british invasion rocker talk about his favorite blues records. below are seven of my own favorite booths to get you started, but you're almost guaranteed, just by setting foot in the door, to find something i overlooked.
unsurprisingly, celia's family closed ranks in opposition to her dilettante suitor. celia was not yet twenty-one, and under argentine law she needed her family's approval to marry or receive her inheritance. she asked for it, but they refused. desperate, for by now she was pregnant, she and ernesto staged an elopement to force her family's consent. she ran away to an older sister's house. the show of force worked. the marriage was approved, but celia still had to go to court to win her inheritance. by order of the judge, she was granted a portion of her inheritance, including title to a cattle and grain-producing estancia in central cordoba province, and some cash bonds from her trust fund--enough to buy a mate plantation in misiones.
on november 10, 1927, she and ernesto were wed in a private ceremony at the home of a married older sister, edelmira moore de la serna. la prensa of buenos aires gave the news in its dia social column. immediately afterward, they fled buenos aires for the wilderness of misiones bearing their mutual secret. together we decided what to do with our lives, wrote guevara lynch in a memoir published years later. behind lay the penitences, the prudery and the tight circle of relatives and friends who wanted to impede our marriage.
ostapenko, the reigning french open champion, kindly stopped hitting many balls to the corners as the match progressed, and williams looked underwhelmed with her own play.
but the system's critics say it gives no recourse to women with controlling or abusive guardians.
june had been a blessing, arriving shortly after the couple decided to start a family. this time, the second time around, it took a little longer, cooper said during a recent zoom call. this was something we were trying for and just hadn't happened for us yet.
miss sawyer, as she liked to be known, was billed as the oldest member of the screen actors guild and the american federation of television and radio artists (sag-aftra) who was still working.
the answer came on saturday, with the premiere of eurydice at los angeles opera, where it runs through feb. 23 before traveling to the metropolitan opera next year. this project demanded a very different approach. mr. aucoin didn't write the libretto; instead, the text was a collaboration with the playwright sarah ruhl, closely hewing to her 2003 play, a modern-day take on the orpheus and eurydice myth which tells the story from the woman's perspective.
at its most fundamental, a dinner party is an act of generosity: come to my place; share my bounty. of course, it's rarely that simple. historically, the powerful have used these gatherings to flaunt their resources; social and political intimidation in the guise of hospitality. in the potlatch — a ritual practiced during precolonial times by indigenous tribes of the northwest coast, including the tlingit and the kwakiutl — the high-ranking host plied guests with enormous amounts of food (like fish oil served via quart-size spoons), often until they threw up. then he extravagantly gave away his most prized possessions — or destroyed them in a bonfire, just to show that he could. to save face, a guest from a rival village might counter with an even bigger feast.
the computer screen has no texture. our lives have no texture. that is why we're so drawn to cooking and eating right now. those things bring smells, texture and physicality into our lives. that feeling of baking bread, of turning over the dough, that doesn't happen on a screen.
she was in a playful mood, dancing as she walked to the baseline and cracking jokes in her chair during breaks and between deep breaths, but she was all business between the lines.
a dismal colonial garrison on the vast rio de la plata estuary only a century before, the city of buenos aires now had a melting pot's combustive quality, epitomized by the sensuous new culture of tango, its dark-eyed crooner carlos gardel giving redolent voice to a burgeoning national pride. its population spoke their own creole street dialect called lunfardo, an argentine cockney rich in double entendres, cribbed from quechua, italian, and local gaucho spanish.
so much a part of me was fred, mrs. rogers said in a tedx talk in 2018. one of the things he talked about was making goodness attractive, and i think that's something that we can try to do, and it's quite an assignment.
i applaud your mom for wanting a regular spiritual component in your life. but that needn't be church (in my irrelevant opinion) for one disinclined and on the cusp of adulthood. suggest a weekly commitment to serving those in need — at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter, maybe — in lieu of church. she may go for a switcheroo with a moral and compassionate flavor. (or she may want you sitting in the pew next to her.) bring it up quietly at dinner some tuesday night and see how it goes.
at age sixteen, ida b. wells was able to keep her family together because her father had been industrious and frugal. he had left them a house free of debt and accumulated savings of at least three hundred dollars. that met their needs for awhile, but ida needed to find work. on the suggestion of the masons, she sought a teaching job in a country school. she successfully passed the examination and was assigned to a school six miles outside of holly springs with a salary of twenty-five dollars a month. while she waited for school to open, wells lengthened all her skirts for the transition from schoolgirl to schoolmarm.
if the couple's families suspected anything, they kept quiet about it. che's younger brother roberto says that his mother told him that ernesto was born in a clinic in rosario on the 14 of june 1928. the address that appears on the birth register is where he lived the first days, but not where he was born. possibly it was the house of a friend, or that of the taxi driver who was a witness....
lacking a good understanding of how the fever was spread, most holly springs residents believed their town to be immune, so the city opened its doors to people from other infested cities. the first refugees were housed in a small brick building that had served as the original land office. within a week one of the refugees had died, which was only the beginning of the terrible toll the fever would exact in holly springs. on 4 september 1878, the new orleans picayune reported fifty cases of yellow fever in holly springs and two deaths; an epidemic was declared and panic began, causing a frenzied effort at flight from the unseen terror so that streets were jammed with every conceivable type of vehicle loaded with baggage and human beings. by the next day a different scene was described: the hurry and confusion of panic is gone. no hurried footsteps sound along the forsaken streets unless they seek help or a doctor. hollow echoes mock their passing. the mass exodus reduced the town's population from about thirty-five hundred to fifteen hundred, comprised of three hundred whites and twelve hundred african americans. one who remained telegraphed on 5 september, the stores are all closed.... physicians are broken down.... many cases will die today.... gloom, despair, and death rule the hour, and the situation is simply appalling. only a few dozen of those who stayed escaped the fever; by the end of the epidemic, 215 whites and 89 african americans had died.
other judges have faced consequences for similar stances on l.g.b.t. issues. a judge in wyoming was censured in march for refusing to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies, and an alabama judge was suspended in september for ordering probate judges to defy federal orders to issue marriage licenses.
this is not one of those stories about someone who happened into theater unwittingly. this is a story about an unabashed theater geek — a child who has adored broadway since he saw beauty and the beast at age 3, who has been happily singing on stage since he landed the role of mr. bundles in a community theater production of annie at age 8; who writes songs and plays the piano, guitar, drums, ukulele and bass; who has been to all four editions of broadwaycon, including the one last year where he won a lip-syncing competition while performing as angelica schuyler from hamilton.
i also wanted to be honest about my feelings without hurting his. he seemed unfazed when i suggested it may be awkward to appear as eddie and sally obermueller and morph into a singular identity that looked like neither of us.
for readers who have watched the movie, we're curious what the experience was like if you've gone through a divorce or if you grew up with divorced parents. if you're married and watched it with your spouse — and are still recovering — we'd love to hear from you too.
the inheritance was not my attempt at a grand summation of the past quarter century of queer history. what i was attempting was an examination of class, economic inequality, and poverty within the gay community — issues i have rarely seen depicted in theater. i have painted on a broad canvas. it is simply not the canvas others might have chosen.
there was never any question of bob stepping down, and so he worked and edited almost to the last. retirement was for sissies; better to step up to the plate. no eye for imprecise thought was ever more discerning; no edit a sharper yet gentler distillation than his. he had his quirks. he hated the word stance. he was a stickler for accuracy. the pencil in his hand went to the heart of the matter. to edit, for bob, was to make a writer better and get out of the way. that may sound simple. it's not and it's rare.
the custom of the country, wharton's novel of divorce, was among her favorites. begun in 1908 and published in 1913, the book took her an uncommonly long time to write. she was distracted by other projects — in those years, she produced ethan frome (1911) and the reef (1912) as well as short stories — but most significantly, wharton and her husband, teddy, themselves divorced, after twenty-eight years of marriage, in part because teddy had stolen significant sums of money from his wife. although born into an eminent yankee family with a great deal of wealth, and consequently in a considerably better position than most divorcées (then or now), she nevertheless found herself, as martin-wagner puts it, something of a social outcast, and left the united states for france, where she would live until her death in 1937. at the same time, her biographer r. w. b. lewis writes, she felt propelled out of her metaphorical prison, able to exercise what henry james had called a fantastic freedom.
the horoscope was confounding. if the famous guerrilla revolutionary ernesto che guevara was born on june 14, 1928, as stated on his birth certificate, then he was a gemini--and a lackluster one at that. the astrologer, a friend of che's mother, did her calculations again to find a mistake, but the results she came up with were the same. the che that emerged was a grey, dependent personality who had lived an uneventful life. there were only two possibilities: either she was right about che, or she was worthless as an astrologer.
i need an author i can read front to back, or one who has written five books that i'll want to read without stopping.
he's in trouble on some loans and fraud and taxicabs and stuff that i know nothing about, mr. trump said. and in order to get his sentence reduced, he says, i have an idea, i'll tell — i'll give you some information on the president.
true to form, he has a wisecrack at the ready. asked about his current job, as a senior adviser to the chairman of phillips auction house: to me, senior adviser means someone very old with a big mouth.
kristoff st. john, who won two daytime emmy awards during his long tenure on the cbs soap opera the young and the restless, was found dead early sunday morning at his home in los angeles. he was 52.
his son peter said the cause was heart failure.
heated campaigns led to physical assaults and fights--apparently instigated by democrats. republican speakers were pelted with sticks and brickbats, had their coattails ripped, were buggy-whipped, and had their legs broken. the most serious incident of violence was the fatal shooting of tyler williamson, an african american who was called a very turbulent leader and exceedingly impudent to the white people. despite that incident, holly springs remained more peaceful than many towns and cities during reconstruction. ida wells noted in her autobiography that she could not remember any riots in the city, although there were plenty in other parts of the state.
the dramatic impact was enhanced because the opera was performed in an english translation of janacek's original czech libretto. it used to be common, if never the prevailing practice, for operas to be translated into the language of the audience, especially in the united states. this was especially true for less familiar works, though i have wonderful early memories of hearing staples like the marriage of figaro and la bohème performed in english.
guevara lynch reprovingly recalled many such near-drowning episodes involving celia in the early years of their marriage. already, celia and ernesto's very different personalities had begun to collide. she was aloof, a loner, and seemingly immune to fear, while he was an emotionally needy man who liked having people around him, a chronic worrier whose vivid imagination magnified the risks he saw lurking everywhere.
andrew is so young — and so new to the rigors of broadway — that he's going to begin his run doing just five performances a week, while taking vocal lessons to shore up his stamina. this will be his first professional production, and the creative team, determined to protect him as well as their smash-hit show, has decided the reduced schedule is their way of investing in his long-term success; the show's alternate, michael lee brown, will do the other three performances as andrew builds comfort and strength.
the yellowing archives of rosario's daily newspaper la capital confirm the story. in may 1928, a strike by rosario's dockworkers had escalated into violence. almost every day, stabbings and shootings had taken place, most of them carried out by strikebreaking armed scabs working for the stevedores' hiring agency, the sociedad patronal. at 5:30 p.m. on tuesday, may 13, 1928, a twenty-eight-year-old stevedore named ramon romero, alias diente de oro, was shot in the head during a fracas at the puerto san martin. at dawn the next day, may 14, he died in the granaderos a caballo hospital in san lorenzo, about twenty kilometers north of rosario.
in misiones, loggers and owners of yerbatales usually hired itinerant guarani indian laborers called mensu, who were given binding contracts and cash advances against future work. paid low wages according to how much they produced, mensu received not cash but private bonds, valid only to purchase basic essentials at the overpriced plantation stores. the system virtually ensured that they could never redeem their original debts. armed plantation guards called capangas kept vigilant watch over the work crews to prevent escapes, and violent deaths by gunshot and machete were frequent occurrences. fugitive mensu who escaped the capangas but fell into the hands of police were inevitably returned to their patrones. guevara lynch hired mensu himself, but he was no yerba baron, and, horrified at the stories he heard, he paid his workers in cash. it made him a popular patron, and many years later, he was still remembered by local workers as a good man.
yes, it is time to fight with decency the indecency seeping from high office; to reject nonsense; to resist contempt for the persecuted and the refugee; to uphold love lived to its limit; to honor industry over ostentation. bob was the greatest editor of our time. editors cut; showmen splurge. and one day the showman is unmasked.

jake silverstein, editor in chief: what i love about this design, aside from the innate fascination of studying these couples closely, is how the subtle narrative of the four-part sequence (beginning with the husband and wife and then ending with them in a more intimate pose) perfectly captures the provocative idea posed by the question in the center.
when ida reached her teens, she enrolled at shaw university (informally called rust college until 1890, when the name change became official), where she was greatly influenced by the missionary spirit of the school. under the jurisdiction of the methodist episcopal church, north, rust was strongly tinged with evangelical christianity. students were required to attend daily chapel, weekly prayer meetings, and church on sunday. w. w. hooper, who became president of rust while ida was a student, was remembered as a religious man who prayed in chapel with his eyes open and would call your name when he got through if you didn't behave. such an environment reinforced the religious training ida received at home.

no one piece of writing about our complex, sprawling community will ever tell the entire story, and i believe that is a good thing: it creates an unquenchable thirst for more and more narratives — a thirst that has been evident in audiences for the inheritance and a thirst that the theater, television and film industries have been too slow to satisfy.
her death was announced by fred rogers productions, which produces children's programming for public television.
but he should give information maybe on his father-in-law, because that's the one that people want to look at, he said, adding, that's the money in the family. pressed by ms. pirro for more details, mr. trump said, i don't know, but you'll find out, and you'll look into it because nobody knows what's going on over there.
the kingdom's day-to-day ruler, crown prince mohammed bin salman, has vowed to make life better for saudi women. he defanged the once-feared religious police, who harassed women deemed inappropriately dressed, and last year he lifted the ban on women driving. saudi women can now attend mixed concerts and pursue careers off limits to their mothers.
such examinations run counter to our current desire for affirmative representation. but avoidance of uncomfortable truths is not the role of the artist. healing is impossible if you don't understand the cause of the injury.
as in many schools for african americans of that era, rust's faculty was predominately white. most of the teachers were northerners who saw themselves as missionaries. the white women teachers influenced ida's concept of ideal womanhood and her acceptance of victorian codes of propriety. at the same time, she may have been inspired by the example of black faculty member ophelia smith who wrote, i love my race.
story collections need not be entirely consistent to triumph. mad country is brilliant, daring, memorable — and also uneven. the opening piece, fast forward, about a newsmagazine in kathmandu, is a nuanced study of truth-telling under a repressive regime, while the novella dreaming of ghana, in which a young man first dreams about the country ghana and then meets a young black woman whom he rather presumptuously names ghana, involves disparate plot lines and symbolic representations that never quite add up. the title story, in which a successful businesswoman finds new forms of contentment while baselessly incarcerated, left me unconvinced. but i would not want any pieces excised. even the less powerful stories here are original and thought-provoking enough to add something of value to the whole.
sarah ardalani, a public information officer at the los angeles county medical examiner's office, confirmed the death. she said that an autopsy had been conducted but that the cause of death had not been determined.

perhaps he believed he could, as his grandfathers had done before him, restore the family fortunes by intrepidly striking out into new and unexplored lands. whether or not he was consciously emulating his forefathers' experiences, it is clear that for guevara lynch, misiones was his own wild west adventure. to him, it was not just another backward argentine province, but a thrilling place full of ferocious beasts, dangerous work, robbery and murders, jungle cyclones, interminable rains and tropical diseases.
once wells started to work at the country school, she needed someone to watch the children during the week. an old friend of her mother's (probably rachel rather) agreed to do so. rather was from virginia, twenty-four years older than elizabeth, and may have served as a surrogate mother to her. she took care of the children until ida would come home every friday, riding the six miles on the back of a big mule. before she returned on sunday afternoon, wells did all the laundry and housecleaning for the week. she also cooked for the children, often using eggs and butter that people near her school had given her. fortunately, she did not have to keep up this frantic pace for too long. gradually, she was relieved of the responsibility for some of the children. by 1880, her brother james, who the family called jim, had left home and had become apprenticed to a carpenter. although he was no longer under her direct supervision, wells still worried about jim. she later called him her problem child because he was constantly getting into minor difficulties, especially with women. he would then go to ida, who would help him out of the trouble. george was quieter and also became a carpenter's apprentice, eventually moving to kansas.
that woman was ms. olsman, an associate specialist then in the antiquities department at christie's new york. ms. olsman was part of an art gallery panel discussion about collecting art, which ms. jacobs was attending. the event, in philadelphia, was where ms. jacobs had the inspiration to match the two. after the talk, and over wine and cheese, she mentioned her idea to ms. olsman about meeting mr. frankel. minutes later he called ms. jacobs, who handed the phone over to ms. olsman, and they chatted.
when shown the dismal horoscope, che's mother laughed. she then confided a secret she had guarded closely for over three decades. her famous son had actually been born one month earlier, on may 14. he was no gemini, but a headstrong and decisive taurus.

i am a passionate vegan for many reasons. but contrary to popular opinion, i do not speak about them. still, when asked if i am vegan, i suffer an instant barrage of unsolicited opinions — from you're going to die of malnutrition to stop being a snowflake; animals don't have feelings. this offends me. these conversations aren't about me explaining my choices, but others imposing their (often incorrect) views on me. i am a peace-loving person, but i would like a saucy comeback. can you oblige?
land was cheap in the yerba-growing province of misiones, twelve hundred miles up the parana river from buenos aires on argentina's northern border with paraguay and brazil. originally settled by jesuit missionaries and their guarani indian converts in the sixteenth century, annexed only fifty years earlier by argentina, misiones was just then opening up to settlement. land speculators, well-heeled adventurers, and poor european migrants were flocking in. guevara lynch went to see it for himself, and caught yerba mate fever. his own money was tied up in the astillero, but, with celia's inheritance, they would be able to buy enough land for a yerba mate plantation, and, he hoped, become rich from the lucrative green gold.

but they have never had their own building, until now. on jan. 23, the box office opens at their first permanent home, on west 52nd street at 10th avenue, with two theaters, two rehearsal studios, and all the amenities (including a bar) one has come to expect from a modern theater. to have a home, it's mind-boggling, mr. telsey said.
at first holly springs seemed to have been spared the worst of the hysteria and war. not until about two weeks before ida's birth in july 1862 did the first significant civil war skirmish occur near holly springs. a considerable number of confederate troops remained in the area until later that fall when union general ulysses s. grant began moving troops into northern mississippi in preparation for the vicksburg campaign. before his army reached holly springs, confederate forces partially dismantled the local foundry and retreated to a more defensible position. grant proceeded to establish a large supply depot in the city. weapons, ammunition, food, and other materials filled every public building as well as churches, the masonic temple, and even a few private homes. while he briefly made his headquarters there, the city's black population celebrated a rare degree of freedom.

the former director of the brooklyn museum, who served for almost 18 years, mr. lehman, 72, was born in the borough. and he lives there, too, in a spacious brooklyn heights apartment with his wife, pamela.
we often discussed our favorite books with one another, he said. that became a great way to learn new things about each other, and to feel more comfortable when in each other's presence.
although slavery was hardly a benevolent institution, as white southerners sought to paint it, some slaves were more privileged than others. sources of privilege included kinship with the master, acquisition of valuable skills, and the opportunity to be hired out in cities. ida's father, james wells, apparently benefited from all three. his master/father owned a plantation in tippah county and had no children by his white wife, miss polly. like many slave owners, he had a black family with a slave--peggy. born in 1840, james wells was their first child and was cherished by his father, who was relatively old when james was born. such liaisons were deeply resented by most slave owners' white wives, who felt the bitterness of betrayal and the humiliation of seeing tangible, public proof of their husbands' infidelity in the skin color of the children. these wives' wrath was sometimes unleashed on the slave women who shared their husband's attention, whether or not the bondswomen were willing participants in the relationships. james wells recalled how miss polly had gotten someone to strip and whip peggy the day after her husband died.
i'm the last person in the world who's going to help the parties resolve their doctrinal differences, said mr. feinberg, who assisted in the church's mediation on a pro bono basis.
but while the early signs of their future marital discord were already in evidence, they had not yet pulled apart. the guevaras took family excursions together, either horse rides on the forest trails, with ernestito riding on the saddle mount in front of his father, or river excursions aboard the kid, a wooden launch with a four-berth cabin that guevara lynch had built at the astillero san isidro. once, they traveled upriver to the famous iguazu falls, where the argentine and brazilian borders meet, and watched the clouds of vapor rise from the brown cascades that roar down from the virgin jungle cliffs.
james wells had been a master mason, which in the black community often operated as a safety net for its members and their families. thus once the epidemic had passed, a group of masons gathered at the wells home to discuss what was to become of the children. after many hours of discussion, they had come to an agreement on the arrangements. they decided that ida was old enough to take care of herself, but the others would have to be parceled out. two of the masons' wives each agreed to take one of the younger girls, annie and lily. the two boys were to be apprenticed to two different men--one of whom was a local white who was familiar with their father's work and hoped his son shared wells's carpentry skills. the big problem was eugenia. because of her paralysis, no one wanted the responsibility of caring for her, so she was to be sent to a poorhouse.
despite the deep doctrinal disputes that led to the split, the negotiations were largely secular: process, governance, finances, said kenneth r. feinberg, the lawyer who helped craft the thorny settlements that arose from the 2010 bp oil spill and the sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
the family foundation, a lexington-based group that says it seeks to strengthen kentucky families, offered praise for judge nance's decision, saying, judges have a right of conscience like everyone else.
art can be expected to hold a mirror up to society, but it cannot be expected to hold a mirror up to every individual who is engaging with it. even with its long running time, there is a lot the inheritance does not and cannot cover.
while a student at rust, ida encountered the joys and sorrows of puberty. she experienced her first love and its painful demise. james b. combs was a rust student from georgia, who boarded with a local family. described in the 1880 u.s. census as mulatto, combs was about five years older than wells and apparently was the one to end the relationship. he married someone else and remained in holly springs for at least ten years--his presence reminding wells of the impermanence of love. throughout her twenties ida remained skittish of committing herself to just one man.
the plumbers, a group of white house operatives, were tasked with plugging leaks of confidential material, which had bedeviled the nixon administration. mr. ellsberg, a military analyst, had been responsible for the biggest leak of all: passing the pentagon papers, the top-secret government history of the vietnam war, to the new york times earlier that year.
i wouldn't be surprised if she steps back into it and does well, to be honest with you, rinaldi said. i've seen her this week, and every day she's better and stronger, and the desire is there.
does visiting a museum restore some of that sensation?
conservatives, who seemed to have the upper hand after the vote tightening a ban on same-sex marriage, would get $25 million once their new denomination is formed and incorporated. all current clergy and lay employees of the denomination, even if they affiliate with the traditionalists, will get to keep their pension plans.
i don't just stick to americans (i love ian mcewan's writing from the last few years) or men (i've read all of donna tartt's fiction and most of annie proulx's). now that i'm older, i'm thinking about going back to saul bellow (i grew up in hyde park), because back when i started to read his books, i'd always just put them down in favor of something by philip roth. i'm just starting my second magnus mills novel, so we'll see about him.
in one of the great understatements in (boxing) history, floyd mayweather jr. once said, self-preservation is an important thing to me. so it should be to all of us. you are probably financially dependent on your mother — and will be, to some extent, when you go to college. nothing in your letter suggests a dire backdrop, but many young people are cut off by their parents for warring over hot topics such as religion or sexuality. keep that (and your best interests) in mind.
one reason for the culture and prosperity in holly springs was the arrival of successful cotton planters, who had moved west for more fertile soil, as well as many others who grew cotton on a smaller scale. king cotton demanded slaves; the 1840 county population of 17,536 included 8,260 slaves and 8 free blacks. as a new town with many land claim cases, the city also was the home to numerous lawyers. both lawyers and planters tended to join the whig party, which dominated the town's early politics--until the rise of the slavery issue in national debate. the controversy destroyed the party there as elsewhere and no compromise democrats rose in power.
rust's curriculum spanned from elementary education to normal school training for teachers--a four-year high school level program. a. c. mcdonald founded the school to make former slaves and their children useful, independent citizens. in 1875 he wrote the following:
and while i examine race in the inheritance, it is not one of its central themes. this is a decision for which i have been criticized, but it is a decision that i made consciously as a person of color. it is a consideration that is not asked of white writers, but it is one that writers of color must face with every project we begin.
suddenly, the couple needed a game plan. navigating a pregnancy is strenuous for any expectant parent. for professional athletes, unyielding schedules can intrude on family obligations under the best of conditions. in the n.f.l., rigid coronavirus protocols have forced players to make tough work-life decisions as they trudge through the pandemic season.
this practice involves a trade-off. great composers wrote vocal lines that hewed to the sounds and flow of the words in the libretto, and that bond is hard to mimic even in the best translations. the advantage is the direct communication between singers and audiences that can result.
biks sees through his own masquerade only after reaching some acceptance about his former lover's marriage, a piece of timing that suggests the great degree to which his supposed empathy has been about managing his own emotional wounds. this was not the life he'd envisioned … trying to be blacker than blacks — 'blacker than thou,' he muttered to himself — when his history didn't compare to theirs, the brutality, the dehumanization, the violence. he was a fraud, trying to pretend to be someone he was not. … 'i am a pretender,' biks said to himself. 'a poseur. an impostor.'
poor thomas. he surely has his side of the story, but we don't get it here. instead we are told: thomas is, in fact, a good husband. syntactically, the sentence says so much. the fact of the husband's goodness becomes a sidebar. maggie is aware of, but helpless against, the greed for more love, when she already has more than most. the marriage has its problems, but the biggest one is its earthly limitations, the waning of interest and desire — its mortality. only if a person were married to god would she or he have a partner who would never suffer from overfamiliarity.
though steeped in the dodecaphonic music of his beloved teacher schoenberg, kirchner never used the 12-tone system strictly. just hints of the aesthetic run through this mysterious slow movement from kirchner's second string quartet (1958), beautifully performed here by the orion quartet. bartok and stravinsky where also major influences, as the punchy opening movement of kirchner's first piano concerto (1953) make clear in this 1956 performance featuring the composer at the piano, with mitropoulos conducting the new york philharmonic.
ms. henson does what she can with a role that keeps her anger at a low simmer until requiring her to go full banshee within basically one scene. you can't accuse her or acrimony of being boring, but the film falls short of a design for living.
at twenty-seven, ernesto guevara lynch was both moderately tall and handsome, with a strong chin and jaw. the glasses he wore for astigmatism gave him a deceptively clerkish appearance, for he had an ebullient, gregarious personality, a hot temper, and an outsized imagination. he also possessed argentine surnames of good vintage: he was the great-grandson of one of south america's richest men, and his ancestors included both spanish and irish nobility. but over the years, his family had lost most of its fortune.
mr. cohen's father-in-law, fima shusterman, emigrated from ukraine in 1975. the year before his daughter's marriage to mr. cohen, he pleaded guilty to evading federal reporting requirements for large cash transactions, admitting that he had cashed $5.5 million worth of checks to evade disclosure laws. he was sentenced to probation after cooperating with prosecutors in a related case.
it is our aim to do no hot-house work, seeking to hurry students through a college curriculum ... sending them into the battle of life only to disgrace themselves and bring reproach upon the cause of education at large, but to take the far more difficult and tedious plan of trying to lay well a foundation for a broad, thorough and practical education.
i miss the serendipity of bumping into people, crossing paths in a spontaneous way. some of our best conversations used to take place in an elevator or on our way out the door. those random things that are the fabric of our lives are so greatly diminished.
that changed on july 18, 2016, when president obama presented mr. kettles, a retired lieutenant colonel, with the medal of honor at the white house.
he wrote: there, in mysterious misiones ... everything attracts and entraps. it attracts like all that is dangerous, and entraps like all that is passionate. there, nothing was familiar, not its soil, its climate, its vegetation, nor its jungle full of wild animals, and even less its inhabitants.... from the moment one stepped on its shores, one felt that the safety of one's life lay in the machete or revolver....
in holly springs, wells learned carpentry and acquired a mate at the residence of a contractor and builder named bolling. he fell in love with elizabeth warrenton, the cook in the bolling household. as slaves they could not legally marry, but they lived as man and wife and legalized their vows after emancipation--as many slaves did. unlike james, elizabeth (born in 1844) had not been sheltered from bondage's worst abuses. one of ten children born to slaves in virginia, she vividly recalled receiving beatings from her masters. she also suffered one of the worst abuses of slavery: she and two of her sisters were sold and separated from their family. such separations were painful reminders of slaves' vulnerability and cut them off from the very people who provided comfort and support to cope with the harsh realities of slavery. like so many others, elizabeth sent inquiries back to virginia after emancipation in a vain attempt to find her lost family.
mr. st. john spoke openly about his depression after his 24-year-old son, julian, committed suicide in 2014. mark geragos, mr. st. john's lawyer and friend, said in a telephone interview on monday that mr. st. john had told him recently that his grief and depression had worsened.
it will be years before a spacecraft from earth lands on europa, which was most closely studied by nasa's galileo mission in the 1990s. the next robotic probe to visit that world will be europa clipper, scheduled to launch no sooner than 2025. when it arrives some years later, that spacecraft will orbit jupiter and encounter europa dozens of times at different angles to thoroughly scan and map the moon, considered one of the best candidates in our solar system to be inhabited by some form of extraterrestrial life.
the life of ida b. wells
judge nance's decision to recuse himself comes less than two years after kim davis, a county clerk in kentucky, defied federal court orders to issue same-sex marriage licenses because it went against her christian beliefs. she was jailed for her refusal and became a symbol of the resistance to same-sex marriage.
it can. our attendance is pretty strong. i find people come because they feel they can be safe, but also be with other people again, even if they are standing 15 or 20 feet away.
i wanted to write about addiction and alcoholism — a disease i have struggled with, and an epidemic that plagues our community just as perniciously as h.i.v./aids did 30 years ago. i also wanted to write about sex: how it can be used as a vehicle for pleasure and intimacy, but how it is also used as a tool to cauterize pain.
when we talked about iran, where i'd witnessed the postelection tumult in 2009, he broached human rights, the iran nuclear threat and the movies of abbas kiarostami with effortless authority. what did iran want? how could its people be brought closer to the world? how might their yearning for liberty be satisfied? bob probed. he was always ready to learn, even if he always seemed to know more than you. he was the generalist rebuking the specialist. he prodded me, most recently, to write — and then rewrite — a review of elena ferrante's work. he liked writers in new territory.
undine's repeated unions and their dissolutions — by the novel's end her full name is undine spragg marvell de chelles moffatt, though strictly speaking moffatt should be listed twice — are on the one hand socially unsettling to (though ultimately accommodated by) new york and paris societies, and on the other constitute for undine that fantastic freedom. it's perhaps not totally surprising, then, that, as lewis notes, undine shares a number of key traits with her creator, including their childhood nickname, puss. wharton understood well the personal costs of marriage for women, and the limits society placed upon them. she surely put something of herself into undine. at the same time, she knew intimately the suffering of poor ralph marvell, scion of old new york, who, upon reading about his divorce in the newspapers, felt that the coarse fingering of public curiosity had touched the secret places of his soul, and nothing that had gone before seemed as humiliating as this trivial comment on his tragedy.
those moves have increased his popularity among saudi women, many of whom say guardianship is not a burden because their male relatives take good care of them. others escape the rules by seeking jobs in neighboring countries like the united arab emirates, where social rules are more lax.
ms. mcculley provided the nudge, and two weeks later, mr. spencer took her on a whirlwind first date that included a stop for coffee and churros, followed by some bookstore browsing and ending with blues dancing lessons.
i believe much of what happens, happens through the art itself, through the voices of the artists. day's end, our big public art project with david hammons, will appear in may. it is an open structure, a ghost version of a pier shed that used to exist on the hudson. in many ways, it is an aspirational project, about reparations. it's symbolic of the resilience of new york. for me it is about the healing of a city and a country that have been battered.
rinaldi was tossing balls and occasional advice to williams on friday as williams exchanged groundstrokes with vandeweghe during their practice session. williams crushed certain shots with customary power and precision but mistimed many others, muttering to herself and shadow-stroking between rallies.
you once remarked that a museum cannot right all the ills of an unjust world. do you stand by that?
the destruction was not yet complete. two days later federal troops returned. one iowa soldier watched sadly as every portion of the fated city seemed given over to pillage and destruction and no hand was raised to save anything from the general sack and ruin. he was especially disturbed by the sacrileges committed in a church and the women and children standing in their homes wailing with the most piteous cries. before confederate forces in mississippi surrendered on 4 may 1865, holly springs had witnessed more than a dozen major skirmishes. after so much chaos and confusion, the county's slaves must have wondered if freedom had actually come to stay, while whites worried about what would replace slavery. former masters and former slaves warily sought to redefine their new relationships.
the film is just getting started. melinda marries robert anyway, and he continues to drain the money she inherited from her mother. mr. perry tracks the major expenses in onscreen text, and puts synonyms for the movie's principal themes (acrimony, of course, as well as deranged and inexorable) in title cards.
while holly springs was reeling from yellow fever, ida was safe at her grandmother's house and presumed that the rest of the family had evacuated the city and gone to stay with her mother's sister belle. when no word came from them, she assumed delivery of the mail had been disrupted. then three men from holly springs brought her a letter, which she scanned until, as she later recalled, four sentences caught her eye: jim and lizzie wells have both died of the fever. they died within twenty-four hours of each other. the children are all at home and the howard association has put a woman there to take care of them. send word to ida. she immediately fainted and came to in a house of mourning surrounded by her grandmother, aunt, and uncle. her father had died on 26 september and her mother the next day.
the $45 million project has been a long time coming, and brings mcc into a corner of hell's kitchen with a growing number of performing arts organizations.
that's what sent nourah, 20, fleeing for australia. her father had divorced her mother before nourah was born, and she was raised mostly by her uncles, she said. her father sometimes abused her, but her efforts to get help fell on deaf ears.
