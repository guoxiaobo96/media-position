MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS: Well, first of all, I do wonder, you've got California people who have been killed by illegals, and when she talks about that her life was in danger, there's a couple of things I've note. Did they have commercial reservations? If so, show us the reservations because they were scheduled to be on an Air Force plane. There's no indication that they actually made commercials --
HENRY: Meanwhile, the White House scoring a big victory announcing round two with North Korea's Kim Jong-un. The details, the summit 2.0 next.
WALLACE: When we come back, as former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg rises in the polls, troubling comments from his past are resurfacing. The Sunday panel will tackle that, next.
Activists and academics who have tracked gender identity laws and customs worldwide said Thursday that no other country has gone so far to embrace gender self-determination. In the United States and Europe, transgender people must submit to physical and mental health exams and get past a series of other hurdles before getting sex-change treatments.
HENRY: OK, let's get Joe in because many organizations have to stop doing fake stories, for team Trump maybe to stop calling it fake news. They have to actually accurately report and fairly report what is happening in this investigation, Joe.
More than six years later, Barronelle remains in litigation. Losing these cases could cost her nearly everything she owns. I know some of what she's going through. I've lived it. And she sat in the U.S. Supreme Court near me watching my attorney argue my case in front of the justices.
CONWAY: -- trafficking drugs, humans and guns, for example. Any number of issues you work on with the Department of Justice, this is small potatoes. But people see it from what it is.
HENRY: Right, Marie, your name was invoked. I want to give you a chance to respond to that.
PROUD BOYS LEADER TO APPEAR IN COURT AS DC PREPS FOR PRO-TRUMP RALLIES, ELECTORAL COLLEGE CERTIFICATION
The attitude of Mexico's leftist president is to open these migrants -- is to welcome these migrants with open arms. To treat them humanely to allow them passage through Mexico. And when you talk to the people around here many of them say they are willing to work in Mexico but really, for the most part, their goal are one the same, to get to the U.S. and they get there to work, and to make money.
If we give up Twitter, we are losing one of our last places to speak, Wang Aizhong, a human-rights activist, told the newspaper.
Look, I think there are many people in the Democratic Party who are looking at Mr. Bloomberg because he has the resources to take on President Trump. But the question in my judgment is his record. I mean, I am uncomfortable with his policies in New York. I understand he's apologized. I get that. I'm for forgiveness. But I am extremely dismayed at the information I read over the weekend about his sexist -- the sexist work environment.
LEWANDOWSKI: That's exactly right. And look, Ed, this is an extraordinary step from the Mueller team. Never in the last two years have we seen someone from the Mueller investigation come out and say this is a factually inaccurate story, which is basically what they are saying.
The North Koreans would close down their young beyond nuclear facility which is one of their main nuclear testing facilities, facilities that builds fissile material for weapons and essentially the President would either give a political declaration that ends the Korean War or we would take off some sanctions. Both sides win in that deal. And if the North Koreans cheat, if they lie, if they don't let inspectors in, we don't -- we don't do the deal.
Stokes said her anti-LGBTQ remarks likely will haunt her throughout her campaign, and that it behooves the congresswoman to confront it head-on and address skeptics by explaining how her evolution unfolded.
•No more wars! Since at least the 1960s peace movement, liberals typically have been dovish and conservatives hawkish. Regardless, President Trump rebuilt the armed forces that Obama-Biden neglected, and then he pursued a Reaganite policy of Peace through Strength.
Added Donald Trump Jr. :Good to know. My girls will be excited about this. When is it appropriate to let my boys (9, 7 and 6 years old) that there's no future for them? Not sure this is a winning platform but you be you.
MCCABE: We are seeing things happen every day in this country that many of us never, ever thought we'd see here -- the pursuit of political enemies and the use of the criminal justice system.
Also on the roll was Brian Buescher, for a seat as United States district judge for the District of Nebraska. In December, Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, raised concerns about the Omaha-based lawyer's membership in the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic service organization -- prompting legal commentators to suggest the Democrats were engaging in religious discrimination.
Along with a similar path to power, Harris has also already inherited much of Obama's base within the party, particularly among the donor class and political professionals. Joe Biden could certainly change that with the flip of a switch, but as for today, Harris is the Obama legacy candidate. And given the depth of love Democrats again feel for Obama, that's a good place to be.
The African-American community weren't the perpetrators of that financial crisis, many of them were the victims. What is he talking about?
MACCOBY: Well, they went along with the stories where the walls have closed in further. And that's why you've had Rudy Giuliani yesterday saying that members of the President's campaign may indeed have colluded with Russian officials and that's their defense which is a little concerning. So at this point, the members of the President's team are getting ready to throw anybody overboard that they can in order to save the President. And by the way, Cory, I just want to point out. When you say that the American people trust the President on this, that's just not true.
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're getting the establishment just a little bit nervous.
And if they hadn't done this, he would have been so furious when he was sworn in. And let me say this to Marie Harf, Marie, if you don't think this is enough to tell people that somebody got the story wrong, let's have some honesty, OK? This is an outrageous act by BuzzFeed reporters. They should be fired.
And, yes, that makes me a choice feminist.
CONWAY: I'm not going to spend a lot more of my life on Andy McCabe.
Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a leading group of social conservatives, said, I would not be surprised at all to see the president come out very soon calling on Congress to act.

We should be pinning a medal on Vindman and not on Rush Limbaugh. — Joe Biden
The real question is though is how the Mexican people feel about this. The President says to welcome them but you can see what this does to a small town. This is the second time this town has been hit by a caravan and there are two more still forming now in Honduras. Ed, back to you.

Harris, 54, has broken many barriers in her career, becoming the first African-American and woman to serve as California's attorney general. And when she joined the Senate, she became the first South Asian-American and second black woman to join. In January 2019, Harris officially announced she would run for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020.
KAZIANIS: Well, I think that it's the personal diplomacy. I think the difference here that the President brings to the table is his own personal touch. He wants to try to get to know the North Korean leaders, understand how they tick. And we have to remember, he doesn't understand the normal foreign policy playbook. He doesn't understand all of the history.
On domestic violence. The argument will not change and the approach will not be broadened significantly. In gender feminist theory, domestic violence is key to establishing that traditional marriage is a dangerous place for women.

For you're someone like Andy McCabe, who wasn't just a garden-variety FBI agent just starting out, he was the number two and for a while the acting director of the whole FBI after Comey was fired. No one, including Andy McCabe, his FBI counsel, Lisa Page, familiar name, has denied that he lied, and he didn't lie once, he lied multiple times.
Michael, let me start with you. You now have the attorney general calling on the president to stop commenting on criminal cases.

So the President appears to be taking matters into his own hands tonight. He says he's planning a major announcement 3:00 p.m. tomorrow afternoon. Will he finally declare a state of emergency?

He didn't have a conversation with Bill Barr about the Roger Stone case. He had a conversation with the whole world. He put it, as he is want to do, on his Twitter feed, on social media.

He said the police asked him to delete posts that criticized the government. After refusing to follow the order, he claimed a government-affiliated hacker sent him a backup code supposedly from Twitter that deleted his 3,000 tweets.
California provides capital defendants with substantial opportunities to challenge their convictions – and resources for doing so – for the precise purpose of ensuring that the death penalty will not be 'arbitrarily' imposed, she wrote.
Brasher is Trump's sixth appointment to the 11th Circuit, meaning the president has filled half the court's bench in his just over three years in office. Trump's and McConnell's focus on confirming judges has allowed them to change the balance on the 11th Circuit from a majority of Democrat-appointed judges to a majority of Republican-appointed judges. The same is the case on the 3rd Circuit and the 2nd Circuit.
Laments support for Clinton-era sentencing laws - NBC News: Former Vice President Joe Biden acknowledged Monday that his record on criminal justice issues hasn't always been perfect, addressing, albeit briefly, a key aspect of his long career in public office that could be a liability if he runs for president. 'You know I've been in this fight for a long time,' Biden said in remarks to a Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast in Washington. 'I haven't always been right, I know we haven't always done things the right way. But I've always tried.' Biden made no mention of the 1994 crime bill he authored, a law that's sparked criticism from progressive activists for its strict sentencing requirements. Biden had long touted his work on the issue, even recently as vice president since the legislation included gun control measures that have since expired.

Voting rights are at the very foundation of civil liberties and civil rights in our society, and we should be doing everything possible to protect and defend them, Coons said. I'm gravely concerned that Judge Andrew Brasher, if confirmed to the Eleventh Circuit, would only continue the efforts to roll them back. Judge Brasher's record and lack of candor during his confirmation hearing show that he is unfit for this appellate judgeship in the Eleventh Circuit, and I will be voting no.

More recently, Gillibrand has faced claims of misleading voters during her 2018 Senate run. Less than three months ago, Gillibrand promised when asked directly about her possible White House ambitions that I will serve my six-year term in the Senate, rather than run for the presidency.

And shouldn't Democrats, real quick, and then I'll will get to Corey, Marie, shouldn't Democrats, especially now that they have got some power in the House, take a deep breath and wait for the facts?
One thing is to say that marriage should be between a man and a woman, but another is to actively work to stymie the progress of a community that is marginalized, and to oppose an effort to keep kids safe.
Obviously, there is no comparison to this president and the way that he has treated and talked about women and people of color and continues to do so to this day. But we, in our party, hold ourselves to the highest standard. And it is going to be critical for us to have a nominee who cannot authentically lead and who can show growth on these challenges.
HAYWORTH: That has been thoroughly discredited.
WALLACE: The McCabe case is small potatoes?
TIME OUT: 'ONLY IN THE DARKNESS CAN YOU SEE THE STARS' AP: A collection of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s papers on display in Atlanta provides insight into the slain civil rights leader's thought processes as he drafted some of his most well-known speeches and notable sermons. 'The Meaning of Hope: The Best of the Morehouse College Martin Luther King, Jr. Collection' is set to open Saturday at the National Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta. It is timed to commemorate what would have been King's 90th birthday on Jan. 15 and to attract people visiting Atlanta for the Super Bowl next month. The Voice to the Voiceless gallery at the center plays host to exhibits of King's papers from the Morehouse collection that rotate every four months. Organizers intended this particular exhibit to showcase the 'best of the best,' papers that people would instantly recognize without much explanation.
Bloomberg looks to ditch centrist label - Politico: Bloomberg's top boosters insist he hasn't made up his mind yet about running. He'll make an official announcement within a month. If he decides to run, Bloomberg told reporters in Iowa last month, he would make climate change 'the issue.' Guns won't be far behind. … At first glance, Michael Bloomberg would seem to have zero appeal in a Democratic Party where progressive populism is on the rise and activists and elites say it's time for a woman or a person of color to win the White House. But unlike any of the other presidential hopefuls, Bloomberg plays a dominant leadership role on two of the top issues on the minds of progressives heading into the 2020 cycle: climate change and gun control. He's spent a decade as the nation's preeminent financier on those issues, buying considerable goodwill in progressive circles.
Progressive groups, which have opposed many Trump nominees, cried foul over the move.
CHUCK LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: It's a fair question. There is a paradox built into our constitutional order.
CHARLES LANE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, obviously, he's in a lot of trouble. And let's be candid here, a lot of people foresaw this kind of downward spiral if Biden was unable to up his game on the campaign trail and present as a more dynamic candidate. And he, so far, has not delivered.
CHRIS PRATT AND KATHERINE SCHWARZENEGGER SHARE A LOVE OF FAITH
This billionaire who's made his life's wealth in the financial services industry is now saying that and, look, this is not -- it's not that Michael Bloomberg was burning a bra or burning the flag at Woodstock when he was a teenager. He said these several years ago, a few short years ago as mayor of New York and it's the way he said it.

HENRY: Governor, there's a Web site that's just been created I understand this afternoon urging people to contribute money. These are supporters of the President. Contribute money so that the public can help fund the wall. And they're saying, if you send money in, they'll -- and you can see it right there -- send a brick to Chuck and Nancy. They will send a brick to either the office of Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi to say build that wall brick by brick.
The records at issue may contain answers to a question of great public concern that has consumed international headlines during recent weeks: What did senior Catholic officials know, and what did they do behind the scenes, while priests accused of molesting children were shielded from punishment? Smith wrote.
Although, there was some dispute between the two journalists who collaborated on the piece. One said they had seen it, the other said they hadn't. That was odd to me. That smelled a little bit fishy. So, this may not be, you know, the Mueller piece may not be here the statement, that every single thing in the story is false, but it was false enough, inaccurate enough that they had to come out and say no.
Backpage let users create posts to sell items, seek a roommate, participate in forums, list upcoming events or post job openings. But the site also had listings for adult escorts and other sexual services, and authorities said advertising related to those services has been extremely lucrative.
Look, I'm glad Nancy Pelosi wants to honor our troops and all of us. You know, I have no disagreement with that. Is this the best time to do it? Is it's the best time to go overseas while the government is shut down and there's a crisis on the border and 800,000 people are not getting their paychecks? And finally, to your point Ed, look, this is a crisis on the Southern Border, and what really hurts me to see is how our heart as a country is being taken advantage of.

I declined to defend Proposition 8 because it violates the Constitution. The Supreme Court has described marriage as a fundamental right 14 times since 1888, she said in a statement. The time has come for this right to be afforded to every citizen.
So bottom line, you remember the BuzzFeed story which broke late last night and sparked countless news stories and news analysis that appears now to be untrue based on what the Special Counsel is saying that the President allegedly directed that man there, Michael Cohen, his former lawyer, to lie to Congress.

And I do think it's important to that end Ed, when we're having these conversations, not to malign people who believe differently. People who believe in a traditional definition of marriage as bigots or hateful people, which I think is grossly unfair to the vast majority of them. I don't think we can -- we can have a better conversation about these issues and I think that she generally did pretty well on this one.

You know, he is not that strong among Latino voters. It's Bernie Sanders who seems to be polling among Latino voters in Nevada, which only heightens the importance of South Carolina. If Biden goes down and we're left with this sort of spread of several candidates, none of whom with a clear majority, then you could be looking at somebody -- or the primary season ending with no one having a majority and then things get really complicated.

While Democrats race to the radical left, they are running further away from mainstream Americans. — RNC spokesman Steve Guest
So, they are acknowledging that there's a problem with the story, at least that the Special Counsel is disputing it. But this is my question tonight, why did they go with the story if it wasn't all there, number one? And number two, BuzzFeed is the same organization, as you alluded to a moment ago, that went with the unverified dossier a couple of years ago, didn't they?
Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, said in his own statement: I believe and have fought for the principle that we should protect the fundamental rights of gay and lesbian couples — from inheritance to health benefits.

On the other hand, Jake, what Democrats are hanging this on in part is that as you know, the BuzzFeed story is not just about Michael Cohen's word against the President, it suggests and they don't have the evidence yet, it suggest that there were e-mails, text messages, perhaps other evidence from the Trump Organization to back this up.
Marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman, he said in the statement. If activist judges insist on redefining marriage by court order, the only alternative will be the constitutional process. We must do what is legally necessary to defend the sanctity of marriage.

JESSICA TARLOV, CONTRIBUTOR: Nancy Pelosi was clear that this wasn't a week-long P.R. stunt as the president said in his letter when he took away her military plane, but they were actually well overseas to talk to our men and women in uniform who I know are incredibly important to you as they are to all of us here on the panel and in this country. She was making a stop in Brussels to refuel and also to talk to our NATO allies, something that is also important even if you do think that they don't pay their fair share or whatever the talking point is on that front.
BYRON YORK, CONTRIBUTOR: Very unusual for Robert Mueller's office to do that. But, this was really probably the most spectacular big, if true, story that we had all of this in the -- this whole Trump-Russia affair. So, it's not really super surprising that Mueller might take -- make an effort to correct the record here because he was the problem.
Last week, the president praised the Justice Department for changing the way it's handling the case against former Trump associate Roger Stone. Stone was convicted in November on multiple counts of lying to Congress. Prosecutors plan to ask for a 7 to 9-year sentence, but senior Justice officials overruled their recommendation and planned to push for a shorter sentence.
HENRY: Guy, do you think it's a bit of a cop-out to say, well it's a conservative's fault?
PELOSI: No, I'm just saying what the State Department reported to us.
Hay later apologized for those comments stating, Through hard work, education and thanks in large part to the sisterhood that I have come to know through pageants, I am proud to say that I am today a better person.
Kamala Harris' rise to political power started in California, where she served as a district attorney and attorney general for the state. And it has culminated in a 2020 presidential run.
DONNA BRAZILE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Extremely.
WALLACE: OK, and I'm not going to spend anymore of this interview on that.
That is somebody who looks at people beneath him differently and we can't have that. And I -- I cannot -- I literally this week -- I got pretty big shock absorbers, my friend, I cannot believe all the prominent African- Americans I've seen publicly say, I think we can support Bloomberg because after all, he's electable, he's the one who can beat Donald Trump.
Many LGBT people hide their sexuality, fearing prejudice at home, school or work.
Over the past two years, the Senator has been attacked by right wing ideologues for her examination of Donald Trump's ideologically-driven nominees to the courts. It is unfortunate that Congresswoman Gabbard based her misguided opinion on the far-right wing manipulation of these straightforward questions.
The Cuban public will decide in a referendum Feb. 24 whether to approve the proposal, which would update the Cold War-era constitution.
Gabbard, a 37-year-old Democratic lawmaker from Hawaii, is known for being politically unpredictable, something she has publicly said she takes pride in. But some of her most fiery remarks against same-sex marriage in years past, as well as her active campaign to promote traditional marriage legislation, have drawn closer scrutiny since her announcement Friday.
A judge accused Harris, then a district attorney, of having violated defendants' rights by refusing to disclose problems regarding a police drug lab technician. In all, more than 600 cases were ultimately dismissed because of Deborah Madden, who was accused of stealing some of the cocaine she was supposed to analyze.
Buttigieg said at the debate that I just bring a different perspective. Look, I freely admit that if you're looking for the person with the most years of Washington establishment experience under their belt, you've got your candidate, and of course it's not me.

Margaret Court, a tennis legend who won each of the sport's four major tournaments multiple times and has created controversy over her anti-LGBT views, is set to be honored on Australia Day.
HARF: For every political candidate there are challenges and certainly in the social media era where you can go back and find statements or interviews from decades ago. People's past are sort of right in front of them, especially when you are a political candidate. I think that politicians and people, frankly, should be able to evolve and have positions change over the years, as long as they seem genuine and honest as they discussed that.
Apparently the use of the D-word went too far for One Million Moms.
WALLACE: And -- and in 30 seconds, is Bernie Sanders a suicide pact?
While I oppose the nomination of Brian Buescher to the U.S. District Court in Nebraska, I stand strongly against those who are fomenting religious bigotry, citing as disqualifiers Buescher's Catholicism and his affiliation with the Knights of Columbus, Gabbard said in an op-ed for The Hill on Tuesday.

This BuzzFeed story's suggestion that the President of the United States directed his former attorney, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress, has now been denied, by Robert Mueller. Someone, who the President is not usually on the same page with, instead tonight, again, we'll be watching for the President's reaction on Twitter or elsewhere, because he is a frequent critic of the Special Counsel.

This raises an important and serious question about his fitness to preside over the case. Yet it is a question that received almost no attention.
It was only three months ago during the campaign that Kirsten Gillibrand point-blank lied to New Yorkers that she would fulfill her term if re-elected, Proud said. In her lackluster career as an elected official, she has demonstrated a disturbing disregard for the truth and principled positions in the name of self-serving personal advancement. If she treats her current constituents with such disrespect, we shudder to think what she'd do to the nation.
She added: After I got appointed, I went down to Brooklyn to meet with families who had suffered from gun violence in their communities. And you immediately experience the feeling that I couldn't have been more wrong. You know, I only had the lens of upstate New York. (Prior to becoming a congresswoman, Gillibrand had lived in New York City for approximately a decade.)

Shelby County, Ala., was challenging a provision in the Voting Rights Act (VRA) that required certain jurisdictions to prove to the federal government that any election law they implemented was nondiscriminatory, a rule it said was an overreach by Congress. The majority agreed with Brasher in the case that Congress did, in fact, exceed its constitutional authority. But his amicus brief -- or friend of the court brief -- put him at odds with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who wrote in a dissent that the VRA provision was still relevant because Alabama had been found to violate the VRA more often than almost all other states between 1982 and 2005.
WALLACE: We'll pass your comments later to the Democratic candidates, I'm sure they'll be happy to hear them.
HENRY: Cory, Jake, I appreciate you both get your points in.
GUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM: No, it could be a gut check moment coming up for the Democratic Party, right? Here is a New York billionaire with potential vulnerabilities on race and sexism, right, which sounds familiar if you're a Democrat, and Mike Bloomberg is the human embodiment of money in politics. All right, this is a party that at least pretends to abhor the influence of money in politics and here's someone who is doing the closest thing you can do to buying a nomination. That combination, is that going to sit well with the Democratic electric? Are they willing to swallow hard and go for it because they think that he's got the money and maybe the moderation relatively to beat President Trump? That's a decision they're going to have to make, but there are no shortage of ironies here.
In June of last year, I was disappointed when the Washington court punished Barronelle again and reissued most of its previous decision word for word. The court concluded that, even though government commissions like the one in my case can't act with hostility toward religion, government officials like the Washington attorney general are free to do just that. That makes no sense.

Mayor Buttigieg is a great guy and a real patriot, Biden said. [He] has not demonstrated he has the ability to, and we'll soon find out, to get a broad scope of support across the spectrum, including African-Americans and Latinos.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., sought to differentiate herself from Sanders, presenting herself as someone could win more moderate voters.
Nine of the 51 appointments are for spots on prestigious and influential federal appellate benches, including two on the mostly liberal San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which President Trump has often derided as disgraceful and politically biased.
If the pending ruling throws out Prop. 8 – as it very likely will – it would be the biggest victory so far for those promoting same-sex marriage in the United States.

Burger King is airing a commercial that uses profanity to advertise its Impossible Whopper -- a burger made from plants instead of beef, the group's website reads. The language in the commercial is offensive, and it's sad that this once family restaurant has made yet another deliberate decision to produce a controversial advertisement instead of a wholesome one.
The defendant made violent threats against high school students, religious leaders, and school officials based solely on her disagreement with a private school's application of religious doctrine, Eric Drieband, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. Tolerance and religious freedom are cornerstone values in our society and the Department of Justice will continue to vigorously prosecute violent threats motivated by bias.
Gillibrand first began recasting her politics upon her appointment by then-Gov. David Paterson to fill the Senate seat vacated by Hillary Clinton in 2009. Liberal groups had savaged Gillibrand at the time not only for her pro-Second Amendment views, but also her strong opposition to illegal immigration -- which included a plan to make English the official language of the U.S. and to empower local law enforcement officials to enforce federal immigration laws.

Activists say Argentina now leads the world in transgender rights after it granted people the right to change their legal and physical gender identity simply because they want to, without having to undergo judicial, psychiatric and medical procedures beforehand.
So, it's not -- it's disingenuous to say that people -- presidents don't comment on criminal matters.
I represent a state where Trump's promises of bringing back jobs and re-industrialization and opening up new factories have clearly just fallen flat, Brown said on Sunday's appearance on Meet the Press. He's done nothing about these promises, so I know a whole lot about a president over promising and breaking those promises and selling out and betraying workers.
So again, I -- when you bring up an example, like a Kate Steinle or Officer Singh, it is a horrible tragedy but it doesn't mean that the President has the right to go out there and try to abuse and fear monger to get his way when the American public is not on his side.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, appeared to accuse fellow Democrats of stoking religious bigotry this week for their questioning of a Trump judicial pick's Knights of Columbus membership.
He's not going to be bullied by people like Elizabeth Warren. Steve Cohen, the congressman who put a bucket of chicken (INAUDIBLE) didn't show up to the State of the Union.
He characterized the criticism as an attack on the First Amendment.
HARF: No, I agree. I mean was looking at the Mueller statement and when you read it, it was really listening closely. Did they leave any wiggle room for the fact that maybe some pieces of the story were accurate but other big pieces really weren't?
MATTIE DUPPLER, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: Well, I think that everything that's mentioned today is really the point, which is that we need to be judicious. We need to have expectations of media and we need to be able to question when people are going to get the story wrong, why they got it wrong.
KIRK: 20,000 minors were smuggled across the southern border last month. Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants will commit crime year after year, ICE data shows. And look, this is a crisis on the Southern Border but it's not one that Nancy Pelosi wants to solve. She went to Hawaii over Christmas and New Year's Eve. She could have been at the negotiating table.
In his response, Buescher argued that the Knights of Columbus' official positions on issues do not represent every one of the group's members and said he would recuse himself from hearing cases where he saw a conflict of interest.
Soon a federal judge in California is going to rule in a lawsuit challenging Proposition 8, the referendum by which California's voters kept the traditional meaning of marriage in their law.

RUSH LIMBAUGH, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: A gay guy, 37 years old, loves kissing his husband on debate stages. Can you see Trump have fun with that?
But no one is immune to all conflicts of interest or of belief.

The Judicial Crisis Network announced in a statement it would launch a $1.5 million national advertising campaign on both television and the Internet calling on Democrats to support the 51 judges, and noting that there are an unprecedented 163 judicial vacancies in the federal court system.
And I think holding grudges or pointing fingers is probably the wrong approach. I think there's a lot of people who support gay marriage in this country, who had a different upbringing. I think she wasn't necessarily casting aspersions at her family or her parents or what have you. She was saying I've come to a different place.
The state of Washington has turned Barronelle's life upside-down just because it disagrees with her beliefs about marriage. She deserves better. She deserves the freedom to celebrate marriages that are consistent with her faith — without the government harassing her.
Julie Irwin Zimmerman: 'I Failed the Covington Catholic Test' - The Atlantic
Ferrer, the CEO, pleaded guilty last year to money laundering and conspiracy charges. The company pleaded guilty to human trafficking.
When the Obama IRS came after pastors gathering together in conferences with Rick Perry support traditional marriage, we had to defend the pastors, Sasser said. We beat the IRS then and we would do it again if O'Rourke attacks churches with the IRS in the future.
He's constantly around other people who have no faith or are apologetic about it, but not her, said the source. She is willing to talk about it to anyone who will listen.

This is big because (ph) I want to get your reaction, see Michael Cohen there.

So again, we don't have any knowledge that the President is totally in the clear or not. But BuzzFeed went out and last night they put out there and they said this morning, I believe, they were 100% confident of their sources here. Well, maybe they need to get some new sources because, I think, is a black eye, it appears, for BuzzFeed.
CHRIS PRATT DENIES HOLLYWOOD IS ANTI-RELIGIOUS
The field has been whittled. And I think what we're left with now is not just left versus right, we're trying to make sure that we elect someone who will give us the kind of country that we deserve, not someone like Donald Trump. And, therefore, it is clogged. It is clogged.
In 2016, Gabbard bucked the Obama administration by aligning herself with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and by criticizing Obama's refusal to use the term radical Islam.
BARR: I cannot do my job here at the department with constant background commentary that undercuts me.
When we got elected the president turned to me with the entire security apparatus and said, 'Joe, I want you to organize getting 156,000 troops out of Iraq,' Biden said. I did that. I did that.
Kristen Gillibrand is also a legacy candidate, but it's more baggage than blessing. She seems a great deal like an updated version of the woman she succeeded in the Senate, Hillary Clinton. Gillibrand has lots of love from Wall Street, fungible views on policy and is evidently worried about her relatability. That all sounds pretty familiar.
Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform and a conservative who is close to the White House, said a constitutional amendment is what you'd expect the president to do. ... They are forcing the president's hand — if you say only an amendment can fix this, guess what, you're going to get an amendment.
Listen to what Barr said in that interview with ABC. Here he is.

The Cuban government has been accused of censoring text communications that oppose the country's new proposed constitution.
HENRY: Man-made crisis. OK. For his part, the President continues to insist Democrats get back to the bargaining table to reopen the government and secure that Southern Border. But so far Speaker Nancy Pelosi will not budge. Instead today she blasted the President for putting her own security at risk when he grounded air Pelosi canceling that seven-day excursion the White House dismissed as nothing more than a Pelosi P.R. stunt.

You need to be able to go toe-to-toe with this guy [Trump] and take him down on the debate stage or you're going to lose. — Tom Steyer
•Slash drug prices! Cheaper pharmaceuticals are a leftist perennial. President Trump too often slammed the cure-producing drug industry. His Most Favored Nation Rule effectively let price-controlling foreign governments fix U.S. medication costs.
HENRY: Absolutely. But, Jake, you've reference to all that with, if it's true, if it's true, when you were working for Loretta Lynch as Attorney General, she couldn't even decide whether she'd be called the Hillary Clinton e-mail -- it should be a matter or an investigation. It was almost a semantical debate. Now, all of a sudden Democrats are running with something that we simply don't know.
CALIFORNIA WOMAN PLEADS GUILTY TO BOMB THREATS AGAINST CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL OVER SAME-SEX MARRIAGE VIEWS
BuzzFeed's description of specific statements to the Special Counsel's office in characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office regarding Michael Cohen's congressional testimony are not accurate. That is from Peter Carr, you see right there, Spokesperson for Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.
The other thing is, I don't understand how the Democratic Party is going to sit back and take it. Is it really worth it to this Democratic Party in the age of the #metoo movement, Black Lives Matter, you had the first African- American president, you have completely squeezed out and spat out the candidates of color this time, Cory Booker. Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, they are out of the race. You're left -- you're left with a bunch of white people, old white people at that with the exception of your next guest, Mayor Buttigieg, and you're going to go backwards because Michael Bloomberg will spend money and will take and will consult Donald Trump?
He added that financial feasibility will also need to be considered before any split.
Talackova was one of the hopefuls for winning the Miss Universe pageant in 2012, until the pageant organizers found out she was transgender, according to the National Post.

CONWAY: Well, a couple things, very different to pick up the phone and ask your attorney general to do something in a criminal case, the president hasn't done that. He had -- he says he hasn't done it, Bill Barr said he hasn't done it, he hasn't done it.
Meanwhile, prosecutors dropped a tough sentencing recommendation for a long time Trump advisor Roger Stone, but decided not to pursue criminal charges against a favorite Trump target, former FBI official Andrew McCabe.
In Barronelle's story, the details are important; her voice chokes up a little when she tells it. Rob Ingersoll was a friend and long-time customer for nearly 10 years, Barronelle had created over 30 flower arrangements for him. She knew Rob was gay, but that didn't affect their friendship. When Rob asked her to arrange the flowers for his same-sex wedding, Barronelle gave the decision a lot of thought.
The obstacles are worse for transgender people, who face extra difficulties including a requirement they be sterilized to marry someone of the same birth sex.
DIGENOVA: This is absolutely outrageous. What this is, this is journalistic piling on, a bad story, a false story, forget the word fake. This is utterly false.
Former Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Ric Grenell, America's first-ever gay Cabinet member, spearheaded this initiative. To prevent backlashes abroad, results were not ballyhooed. Still, Gabon legalized homosexuality, and Sudan has stopped executions for gay sex.
WALLACE: Guy, first of all, your reaction to Donna, but also, how do you see this playing out? Do you think this is a real rift between the president and his attorney general? Or is it a bit of theater as some people have suggested, where Barr is saying this because he needs to shore up his position at the Justice Department and there's kind of an inside agreement, tacit agreement between the White House and Justice?
FOLDS: Orchestral musicians are demoralized by loud music that covers up what they normally do. They're having to do a dumbed down version of it. The rock band goes out thinking, wow, that wasn't loud enough, didn't feel it.
HENRY: Yes, I suspect there are some producers at some other cable news channels are wondering, they have to change their rundowns because they were going with something from last night that may all wonder (ph).
WALLACE: All right. Panel, we have to take a break here.
On this broader issue of Barr and the Democratic reaction, I think your question was good. Have the Democrats learned their lesson? We have people talking about impeachment of Bill Barr, which I think is ludicrous.

Some of the senator's overtures to the progressive left have been less well received. Late last year, Gillibrand tweeted that the future is both female and intersectional, prompting a rebuke from Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who responded that the future is American and an identity based not on gender, race, ethnicity or religion.
Conversely, a January 15 roster of 605 Administration accomplishments says that Trump let pharmacists recommend lowest-cost options, ended the costly kickbacks to middlemen (cutting brand-name treatments up to 30 percent), and excised healthcare regulations, which lowered drug prices for the first time in 51 years.
The Post and Courier Palmetto: The annual King Day at the Dome in South Carolina served as a jumpstart to the 2020 presidential contest, featuring U.S. Sens. Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders telling voters they deserve better. The two are among a host of potential contenders to challenge President Donald Trump. … The event has become a staple for Democrats — or, in Sanders' case, an independent — seeking the nation's top job, as a way to appeal to voters in the first-in-the-South presidential primary. South Carolina is the first contest with a significant portion of black voters. … Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, broadly challenged the audience to honor King by getting involved and working for change.
Hers was the first statewide contest that featured no Republican in the general election under a new jungle primary system. Harris ran as an unapologetic liberal but one who would maintain her tough-on-crime credibility earned as a prosecutor.

Both Barronelle and I serve people, and we're happy to serve everyone.

By creating an online brothel – a hotbed of illicit and exploitative activity – Carl Ferrer, Michael Lacey and James Larkin preyed on vulnerable victims, including children, and profited from their exploitation, Harris said in 2016. My office will not turn a blind eye to this criminal behavior simply because the defendants are exploiting and pimping victims on the Internet rather than on a street corner.

You know, the Senate demonstrated that it's not going to hold this president accountable. It is up to us in 2020. It is our only shot. And as we see this president, as he's demonstrated, interfering in criminal prosecutions, growing more and more emboldened, so much is on the line. We dare not get this wrong. And that means nominating a candidate who can challenge this president on his own terms and put together a big enough winning coalition that we can have some coattails too and make gains in the Senate.

HENRY: Well, they suggested that they hadn't seen all the evidence but that their sources were representing it to them. And Susan it seems like --
Biden is coming off what appears to be a fourth-place performance in Iowa that he characterized as a gut punch while the Klobuchar campaign is looking for a momentum boost that didn't come in the Hawkeye State as it currently sits significantly behind Biden in fifth-place.
And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
They are saying that what BuzzFeed wrote about Michael Cohen was so wrong that they took the unprecedented step of coming out and saying that because we know that Michael Cohen is a serial liar. He's a convicted felon, he's a person with all kinds of problems and credibility issues. And BuzzFeed should have taken all of that into account before they published their story last night.
So, I apologize, Marie and Guy, to break in. But as you can imagine, doing a nightly -- a Fox News Radio Program, there's breaking news all the time in the Trump administration. So, I want to talk 2020 but react to that Guy first because we were talking about this early in the program. Week after week, we hear bombshell, the walls are closing in, that's it. We were just debating, is this one going to fall apart as well? And now the Special Counsel weighs in to say this is not accurate.
WALLACE: All, right now, on FOX News Sunday.
So Peter Carr, he is a spokesperson for Bob Mueller, is saying, BuzzFeed's description of specific statements to the Special Counsel's office and the characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's congressional testimony, are not accurate. The reason why I'm reading that slowly and going over again, Corey, is I'm looking for daylight.
LI: But they're pretty adamant about it, right. We have to be sure.
In May 2019, school officials announced that Visitation Prep, the oldest Catholic school for girls in the country, would begin publishing same-sex wedding announcements in its alumni magazine to advance its teaching that we are all children of God ... worthy of respect and love, according to the Justice Department.
They're resting now. They'll probably sleep outside. It's been a rough route for them. There was some chaos on the border with Mexico this morning. The gates of the border were briefly thrown open in the pre-dawn hours about a thousand people crossed with no documentation. After that, summer order was reestablished. We saw documents being checked, people given wristbands and given five days to wait for a visa.
Even after her sex-reassignment surgery, she has failed to get judicial permission to update her national identity card to reflect her new gender, according to a public health ministry announcement. But the law gives her hope, she said: The operation changed my life and today I'm celebrating that everyone who faces a situation similar to mine can get their surgery without having to make it through the judicial labyrinth I went through.
Kamala Harris has been running for president perhaps since even before her 2016 Senate win. Like 2005's favorite freshman, Barack Obama, she arrived in Washington with great expectations.
Now the question of course moving forward is what does BuzzFeed do in the wake of this? Is it a mea culpa? Do they say that, you know, we got some things wrong and we'll do better or do they double down and continue to defend a story that they said just a few moments ago was true?
WALLACE: Coming up, Bernie Sanders' win in New Hampshire put new pressure on Democrats fighting to be the moderate candidate in the race for the White House.
BUTTIGIEG, SANDERS, COMER UNDER ATTACK AT 2020 DEBATE IN NH
MARC THIESSEN: SUPREME COURT'S HIGH-PROFILE 2020 DOCKET BODES WELL FOR TRUMP
The Valentine Day lawsuits to be filed in Tokyo and in other courts around the country on Thursday argue that the law violates same-sex couples' constitutional rights to equality. They want the government to follow the example of many other nations in guaranteeing marital freedom.
Back then, Harris handily won the Democratic primary for what initially promised to be a hyper-competitive race to replace the retiring Barbara Boxer. Harris breezed in (thanks in part to her long, highly successful alliance with then-Mayor now California Gov. Gavin Newsome.)
Both sets of observers could probably agree with the explanation offered by conservative commentator Ed Whelan who has observed that Walker has been determined from the outset to use the case to advance the cause of same-sex marriage.
WALLACE: We'll ask Mayor Pete Buttigieg about his pitch to voters in Nevada, South Carolina, and the Super Tuesday states.
When career professionals walk out of their job, we all should take notice. What happened?

HARF: No, I know and every story about Russia --
In response, state Republican Party spokesman Zachery Henry accused McCain of pushing a false narrative about a perceived grudge and said that the censure is actually a tragic indictment by the Republican Party of Arizona at large of her own efforts to campaign for and support left-wing Democratic candidates.
ROMNEY APPLAUDED BY DEMS DURING NEW HAMPSHIRE DEBATE
The Associated Press contributed to this report.
The story should have been vetted and the major outlet who picked it up and gave it credibility should have to take a step back and say, look if you're going to write a story, there had better be some integrity out of it because it's not fair to the American people. And for 24 hours, the political world was thrown into a dither for somebody who was having fun at the President's expense.
But The Post's article revealed that O'Rourke, like Gillibrand, faces skepticism about the sincerity of his apparent change of heart. The paper's report included an apparent shot by at O'Rourke from Gutierrez, who told The Post he was very pleasantly surprised that O'Rourke -- who represented a mostly Hispanic district during his three terms in the House of Representatives -- was suddenly interested in immigration reform efforts last year.
BRAZILE: Well, the race is far from over. And I know everyone is focused on the four states that ultimately help us to winnow the field.
HENRY: Jake, he went through a long list of stories where the walls are closing in. It's all over for Trump but then we find out well, maybe not.
GOOGLE PRESSURED BY HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS TO ABANDON CENSORED SEARCH IN CHINA
An attack upon the free exercise of any person or group's religious beliefs is an attack upon the civil rights of every citizen, he added.
MACCOBY: Yes. And in fact, the reporters of this story has said that Michael Cohen wasn't a source for their story. So this isn't just about -- isn't a he said he said kind of situation. They have named -- they've said that there are multiple witnesses, that their text messages, e-mails, documents, which means that we're not just talking about two different groups of people arguing. We could be talking about hard evidence that shows something really concerning, and that's concerning for two reasons.
VIRGINIA GOV. NORTHAM FACES BACKLASH FOR COMMENTS ON 3RD-TRIMESTER ABORTION BILL: 'MORALLY REPUGNANT'
KIRK: Democrats just went vacation in Puerto Rico with lobbyists. They are not -- they are not genuine in their -- in their pursuit to try to get a deal --
HENRY: Joining me now, Guy Benson and Marie Harf, host of course of Benson & Harf on Fox News Radio. Good evening to both of you.
CONWAY: Well, the president recognizes, as many people do, that it feels like there's a two -- two-tiered criminal justice system. If your President Trump or people associated with him, this prosecution would have gone one way.
BENSON: So, last night was a wow when the story broke and this is absolutely another wow. Because, as you say, in your introduction of the breaking news, Ed, it is extremely rare for the Special Counsel's office to come out and say anything or dispute any particular report that's flying out there and they felt the need to do so here tonight.

But the president's -- what he's doing with his tweets, he's revealing what's going on in the Justice Department. And I think the House should get to the bottom of it.
Trump brokered four Middle East peace agreements with Israel and its Islamic neighbors. He also was the first American president since Jimmy Carter to launch no new wars. Hence, Trump earned four Nobel Peace Prize nominations.
On sexual harassment. The argument will not change because it has proven successful but the approach will be broadened to include male victims, especially boys. For example, the latest survey from the American Association of University Women on school and campus harassment reports on male victims.
The other senators running, particularly Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, boast robust fundraising and scores of devoted supporters. But they are also candidates of limited spectrum and will be stuck much of the campaign duking it out over and over again for the same activist voters. Harris has appeal among a broader swath.
How troubled are you by these allegations and this evidence of alleged sexism and racism?
Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke says he'd strip churches of tax-exempt status if they don't support same-sex marriage.
You know, it's one thing to have this so-called top law enforcement policy of stop and frisk. It was ruled unconstitutional. And it has taken him years to say I'm sorry about that. He has the -- he has the resources, but I'm -- I am very uncomfortable with -- with his record. Very comfortable.
Look, this is a time where voters are looking for a president who can lead us out of the days when it was just commonplace, or accepted to have these kinds of sexist and discriminatory attitudes. And, you know, right now, this is our chance to do something different.
All right, I will get to Byron York, is live on the phone right now. Byron, I want to get your reaction but I also wonder if -- as I think about this past week, I believe it was last Sunday that Jonathan Karl, a careful reporter, I believe, at ABC News, said that he was hearing the Mueller report was going to be anti-climactic and there wasn't necessarily going to be a bombshell.
In my past, I said and believed things that were wrong, and worse, hurtful to people in the LGBTQ+ community and their loved ones, Gabbard tweeted, along with a video. I'm deeply sorry for having said and believed them.

One Million Moms finds this highly inappropriate. When responding to the taste test, he didn't have to curse, the group said. Or if, in fact, it was a real and unscripted interview in which the man was not an actor, then Burger King could have simply chosen to edit the profanity out of the commercial.
JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I've said many times, you can't be the Democratic nominee and you can't win a general election as a Democrat unless you have overwhelming support from black and brown voters.
The controversial recommendation, announced Monday, was based on the board's analysis of nearly 4 million vehicle and pedestrian stops by California's 15 largest law enforcement agencies in 2019.
BENSON: Right, it comes back to the three words, we don't know. We don't know what Mueller has or doesn't have except this rare window into what they don't have.
The fact that there are no medical requirements at all — no surgery, no hormone treatment and no diagnosis — is a real game changer and completely unique in the world. It is light years ahead of the vast majority of countries, including the US, and significantly ahead of even the most advanced countries, said Eisfeld, who researched the laws of the 47 countries for the Council of Europe's human rights commission.
The social media post was a direct response to her expected censure by the state Republicans for her supposed ties to leftist, globalist causes and failure to support President Trump by endorsing President-elect Joe Biden.
HARF: Yes, thanks Ed. I mean, look, I as a Democrat, have throughout this entire investigation tried to remain very measured in what we know and what we don't know. But, there are real facts that real journalists have uncovered about the Trump team's relationship with Russia.
HENRY: OK, Joe diGenova, we appreciate you joining us live. You obviously have a strong point of view and you've made it. Guy and Marie --
Here are 13 times we found beauty pageant winners caught in a controversy:
HENRY: I've got 15 seconds. A sight we've heard about maybe it could be South Korea so that they'll go to the DMZ together. What's your sense?
She was accused by the pageant's director, Grant Gravitt Jr., of violating the rules by getting her hair and makeup professionally done based on an Instagram post. However, Davila's lawyers argue that the photo was taken a week before the pageant and their client did not cheat.
We said earlier on our radio show tonight Ed that if BuzzFeed went with the story and it turned out not to be true, that is a huge journalistic limb to go out on. If you're not confident in your sources, at the end of the day, all of this is speculation until we get the Mueller report.

Senator Hirono asks all judicial nominees – particularly those who have expressed very strong personal ideological views in conflict with Supreme Court precedent – if they can be fair. She asked Mr. Buescher, who has a clear record of anti-choice activism, whether he could separate his personal beliefs from decisions he would make if confirmed for a lifetime appointment on the federal bench, spokesperson Will Dempster said.
MICHAEL ANTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: Well, the fundamental problem the Democrats have is they have a big gap between enthusiasm and electability. So it seems like all the energy on the basis is for Bernie or for somebody on the left side of the party, but then you have an establishment and a leadership in the party who really worries that going that far to the left just guarantees a Trump re-election and we need some more moderate person to play nationwide, but they can't settle on who that more moderate person is.
At another point, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, cautioned Democrats against making their arguments all about the president.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The President does not want this shutdown to end. He manufactured this shutdown as a crisis.
Warren is comfortably in third place in Iowa and will try to make a case to her neighboring New Hampshire that she, and not Sanders -- who currently leads in most Granite State polls -- is the best New Englander to take on President Trump in November.

You know, I just -- you find it.
Pratt was rumored to be dating Schwarzenegger since June 2018, following his high-profile divorce. However, despite all the rumors and public outings, they only made their relationship official to the public in mid-December.
GOPers frustrated with White House dysfunction - NYT: Republicans had hoped his plan would put Democrats in a corner, but Democrats called it a nonstarter, prompting attacks from the president on the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. And her relationship with her counterpart in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, who presumably would need to make a deal with her, is fraught. … While Mr. Trump has projected confidence in public, he has expressed private frustration over what he views as negative coverage. Many Republicans concede, also in private, that he has made strategic errors and allowed dysfunction to continue.
Pratt added faith became important to him when he was 19 and he met a man who was sent by God. Pratt also declared he's unashamed to share his Christianity in Hollywood and has never been ridiculed about it.
CONWAY: But the war of words is between Michael Bloomberg and the African- American community.
WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me.
Biden – who's four decades older than Buttigieg – shot back that the politics of the past, I think, were not all that bad.
Sonia Tabizada, 36, of San Jacinto, Calif., pleaded guilty in federal court to intentionally obstructing persons in the enjoyment of their free exercise of religious beliefs by threatening to bomb the Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School in Washington, D.C., the DOJ annonced in a press release. Her actions qualified as a hate crime.
What is most important here -- two things, one is the president of the United States has not asked or directed his attorney general privately to do anything in any criminal matter including Roger Stone. Number two, he works hand and glove with the attorney general, as we all are privileged to do on a number of matters that affect this country. I --

He has said over the weekend that, you know, he was asked, does this mean there's a rift? Would seem that he had a rift with his prior attorney general and he said, no. So, I think he should listen.
Candidates also repeatedly hit Buttigieg on his experience, arguing the 38-year-old may not be equipped to beat Trump.
GABBARD: I said and believed things that were wrong and worse they were very hurtful to people in the LGBTQ community and to their loved ones. I sincerely repeat my apology today. I also grew up in a socially conservative household, where I was raised to believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman. So, for a period of my life I didn't see the contradiction in those beliefs.
And, sadly, it is quite too late to have it.
Remarks by Katsuei Hirasawa, a veteran lawmaker of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, were carried on Nippon News Network's national broadcast Friday. Outrage has been popping up on social media.

WALLACE: Mark Meredith reporting from Mar-a-Lago -- Mark, thank you.
I would say team Trump, as representatives of the administration and the President, have at times gotten themselves into trouble and seemed untrustworthy in their denials because their stories on so many issues have changed, if you just look at Rudy Giuliani this week and his story changing on the issue of collusion.
As attorney general, Harris defended an archaic law which banned firearms dealers from displaying advertisements visible from outside the stores that included a photo of a handgun. Notably, the law allowed for pictures of rifles to be visible.
I just went to something about law enforcement, a new commission they have. Our law enforcement feel more deeply respected and better resourced because of Donald Trump and Bill Barr.
Following in the clumsy footsteps of Rachel Smith, crowned Miss USA the year before, Crystle Stewart fell flat on her tush during the evening gown competition in 2008.
AUDIBLE: ABOUT THAT… I'm not thinking about politics right now. – Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, who announced her presidential candidacy 10 days ago, deflecting a question in an interview with CNN.
Biden also questioned Buttigieg's ability to attract support from minorities.
There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone or any institution, any organization in America, that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us, he said. So as president, we're going to make that a priority, and we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.
When Nancy Pelosi was complaining about it is exactly what Republicans complained about when President Trump caught flak for his trip overseas over the Christmas holiday where people said oh is just a P.R. stunt and he was acting you know, oh I'm home alone etcetera. And then he made it clear that you don't announce these plans in advance, right? You go and you get on the plane and you fly overnight so that no one sees that you are doing that because it is dangerous for American officials to be in combat zones. So just think back to how upset you were a few weeks ago and then direct that towards the president.
It's a fully legal referendum, a fully legal state-organized referendum and people should be allowed to vote for, against or even abstain, Sanchez told the outlet, saying the state-run telecommunications company should work for the people.

What they've done is, so you want to go after the President, go after him with something that's real. This is a fake story, it's outrageous. And I am very, very pleased that some professional prosecutors finally stood up to the liars in the media.
GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS RADIO: Well, first, I would just say to Donna, it's a fair point that she makes about the two examples that she gave. I would also note, that President Obama did make public comments about the Hillary Clinton emails investigation, which was a far cry from Rodney King, right? So there has been some precedent for presidents weighing in.
Bevin and Davis, who lost her re-election bid in November, have asked the court not to award legal fees. But if they do, they disagree on who should pay. Davis' attorneys argue she acted on behalf of the state.
And Cory Booker? Maybe Beto O'Rourke needs someone to ride shotgun as he LiveJournals his way across the hinterland.
I think the fact that the Special Counsel came out so brazenly with this -- with this statement shows that they really are -- they're producing a product that I think will be decisive in its own accord but we need to see it. Enough is enough to have this going on for months and months at a time.
I profoundly disagree with Hirshman's conclusions and many of her particulars. For example, I don't believe all of women's choices have been sanctioned as 'feminist'; sex work is a counter-example.
This law is saying that we're not going to require you to live as a man or a woman, or to change your anatomy in some way. They're saying that what you say you are is what you are. And that's extraordinary, said Katrina Karkazis, a Stanford University bioethicist who wrote Fixing Sex, a study of the legal and medical boundaries around gender identity issues in the United States.
Reform efforts have often focused on increasing training to make officers aware of how their implicit, or unconscious, bias may affect their interactions. Starting this year, a new California law requires agencies to screen job applicants for implicit and explicit biases.
Co-hosted by ABC News, WMUR-TV and Apple News, the debate brought seven of the Democratic contenders to Saint Anslem College in Manchester ahead of that state's first-in-the-nation primary on Tuesday. The debate comes as neither news organizations nor the Iowa Democratic Party have been able to call a winner in Monday's Iowa caucuses while Buttigieg and Sanders are both claiming victory in the state.
WALLACE: No, but I'm not asking you that. I'm asking you --
But some people would be corrupted. And everyone can have greater confidence in the outcome of public deliberations when they know that at least one temptation towards corruption has been removed.
Look, some of these are issues that our country's about to face are among the most intractable we've ever had, but you've got to arrive at those -- at those challenges with -- with the ability to explain your record and with an ability to explain how you're going to raise the bar at a time when we are finally asking a lot more from our elected leaders.
Last Wednesday, a narrow majority of the Senate voted to cover up the president's actions. Immediately after the vote to betray our democracy, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell turned right back to nominations, said Lena Zwarensteyn, the Fair Courts campaign director for The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. McConnell is staying the course on shielding the president's actions from checks and balances and stacking the courts with nominees who have records of hostility to civil and human rights, particularly voting rights.
And we're back now with the panel.
Flake, who faced criticisms similar to those against McCain, was successfully censured by Maricopa County Republicans earlier this month.
HARRY KAZIANIS, DIRECTOR OF DEFENSE, STUDIES AT THE CENTER FOR THE NATIONAL INTEREST: Thanks for having me.
Nor is the neglected bias related to the fact that (as several newspapers have reported) the judge is openly gay.
Quickly, I want to come back to my panel here and get everyone. Mattie, hearing that, I think it's very significant that it was not a statement saying some of the report is not true. It's saying specifically the documents, meaning the story hung on the idea that it was not Michael Cohen's word versus the President.
CONWAY: But no -- and let me say something. It's not correct to say that presidents have not interfered. Bill Clinton pardoned a relative. He pardoned someone who refused to testify against him, that's involving yourself in criminal matters --
Harris said her office followed the facts and the evidence and pursued it just like any other case.
We have a president who's a racist, Brown said. He built his political career knowing what he was doing, questioning the legitimacy and the birthplace of the president of the United States. I know early there have been all kinds of news reports about what he did early in his career with housing.
[L]iberal feminists abandoned the judgmental starting point…in favor of offering women 'choices'. The choice talk spilled over from…'abortion', and it provided an irresistible solution to feminists trying to duck the mommy wars. A woman could work, stay home, have 10 children or one, marry or stay single. It all counted as 'feminist' as long as she chose it.
Harris, in her questions to the nominee, called the Knights of Columbus an all-male society and asked the Nebraska lawyer if he was aware that the group was anti-abortion and opposed to same-sex marriage when he joined.
Donald Trump is the not the cause of all of our problems -- and we're making a mistake when we act like he is, Yang said. He added, He is a symptom of a disease...It is our job of getting to the harder work of actually curing the disease.
DIGENOVA: There -- well, first of all, CNN is a journalistic joke. MSNBC is a strong second. Their coverage tonight, which I was watching in anticipation of some other shows that I'm doing, was absolutely outrageous. These people are embarrassing from stem to stern, CNN, MSNBC, how sad. Where has journalism sunk? Tim Russert is rolling over in his grave.
HENRY: President Trump today scoring a big win in the form of a summit sequel. The President set to hold a second meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un as the U.S. continues to seek fully verified denuclearization from the rogue regime. Details still a bit scarce though. It's expected to take place at the end of February. The precise date and location still unknown. Here now live Harry Kazianis. He's Director of Defense Studies at the Center for the National Interest. Harry, thanks for coming in.
BENSON: And the fact that the Office of the Special Counsel felt compelled, based on all of the chatter, to come out and say, actually this story that's making so many waves here in this town is not accurate. I don't think we can downplay that as anything other than very significant in this whole process.
He adds, Freedom of religion is a fundamental right, but it should not be used to discriminate.
Can they nominate -- will they perhaps nominate someone who's got Bloomberg's record? And we should point out, it's a mixed record because there's a lot of things he did in New York, crime did go down. He's given tremendous amounts of money on a lot of issues that Democrats like, climate change, a lot of women's groups. Can, in the Me Too era, the Democratic Party nominate somebody, though, with this downside?
BUTTIGIEG: A fresh outlook is what makes new beginnings possible. It is how we build a new majority.
HARF: They do, Ed. And if this turns out to not be accurate, it will be a disservice to all of the other very good journalists who are running down real stories about what Bob Mueller is investigating. Many of which have been out there in the public and many of which have turned out to be true. So, they would actually do a disservice to journalism in that case.
We've seen [people] who may held a particular view and evolved to a place of acceptance,, but rarely have we seen someone who was so actively and vehemently and viscerally against LGBTQ equality and acceptance, said Zeke Stokes, the vice president of programs at GLAAD, one of the most prominent LGBTQ advocacy groups, in an interview with Fox News. [Gabbard] was someone who worked so actively against our community when the stakes were so high.
Every citizen and community has the Constitutional right to exercise their own religious beliefs free from fear and discrimination, he continued. Defending civil rights is a top priority for the FBI and we will continue to work to protect the civil rights and freedoms granted to all Americans.
We asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of Democratic calls to investigate political interference at the Department of Justice, we got this on Facebook from Mark Davis.
WALLACE: Well, let -- let me hear that again.
When the former Texas congressman was asked if religious institutions -- colleges, churches, charities -- should be stripped of tax-exempt status Thursday night by CNN anchor Don Lemon during the LGBTQ town hall, he immediately responded, Yes.
The Knights of Columbus has taken a number of extreme positions, Hirono said in the questionnaire. For example, it was reportedly one of the top contributors to California's Proposition 8 campaign to ban same-sex marriage.
WALLACE: That doesn't mean -- that doesn't mean it's not an issue.
Schwarzenegger's mother, Maria Shriver, congratulated the couple on Monday writing on Pratt's Instagram post: Congratulations to two loving kind caring thoughtful Spiritual people we are so happy for you you are blessed as is everyone who knows you yes let's go.
MEREDITH: Democrats don't buy it and are calling for Barr to step down.
In Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. ___ (2020), the Supreme Court held that Title VII's prohibition on discrimination 'because of [...] sex' covers discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation, the order read.
Gabbard said she grew up in a socially conservative household, where I was raised to believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman. For a period of my life I didn't see the contradiction in those beliefs.

LI: An ongoing questions to BuzzFeed because their journalist appeared on other stations today being asked over and over again, do you trust your sourcing, do you have the material to back it up? Over and over again, they said we have seen the e-mails, we have seen the text messages. Everything proves that our story is true.
The votes were typical for O'Rourke, whose outreach to Republicans was cited during his Senate run by numerous newspaper editorial boards, including the El Paso Times. An analysis by FiveThirtyEight found that in his final year in Congress, O'Rourke sided with the Trump administration 30 percent of the time, and ProPublica data showed he was among the top 20 percent of Democrats most willing to buck his own party.
Now, House Democrats have Barr squarely in their sights.
I came from a district that was 98 percent white, Gillibrand told the network. We have immigrants, but not a lot of immigrants. And I hadn't really spent the time to hear those kind of stories about what's it like to worry that your dad could be taken away at any moment.

The exchange between Biden and Buttigieg prompted Steyer to complain that both were too focused on using the military to carry out American foreign policy.
As California's attorney general, Harris secured a massive settlement with big banks for her state in 2012. Out of the $25 billion deal she helped negotiate with other state attorney generals, California homeowners received nearly $20 billion in mortgage relief and assistance for people who had their homes foreclosed from Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase, according to her office.
Good evening everyone, I'm Ed Henry in for Martha MacCallum and this is The Story. Tonight, word that many of those migrants will be yes, released out into our country as the government about to enter day 29 of the shutdown struggles to process those claims for asylum. Well, that sounds an awful lot like a crisis not as defined by the president but is defined by Webster's. I looked it up right before the show. A turning point they say, a situation that has reached a critical phase. That's how the dictionary defines a crisis.
Others on Monday a conference call with reporters that was organized by the liberal group included Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., former Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum and NAACP Alabama State Conference President Bernard Simelton. They said Brasher has a history of fighting against voting rights, gay rights, women's health care and environmental protection.
At the time, Gabbard also gave a lengthy speech at the Hawaii State House against a proposed resolution that addressed the bullying of gay students in public schools. Gabbard argued the resolution would cast homosexuality as normal, and that it would attract homosexual-advocacy organizations into our schools to promote their agenda to our vulnerable youth.
President Trump reauthorized the Washington, D.C. School Voucher Program (which Obama-Biden repeatedly tried to kill), boosted it with $85 million, and established steady funds for Historically Black Colleges and Universities.
WALLACE: Is this any worse -- is this any worse than the Access Hollywood tapes?
What will be interesting is if Trump dials it up and continues to do this even more aggressively, what does Barr do then? Having lay down a marker on this point?
There are roughly 13 million church members around the world and about half of them are in the United States, according to The Times.
I am not saying that Judge Walker should have refused himself in Perry v. Schwarzenegger.
WALLACE: He's still sharing his lightning bugs and spreading joy.
A draft of the text lists McCain's support of gay marriage, Biden and condemnation of Trump as reasons to dissolve any connections whatsoever with McCain, even going as far as to say that McCain acted in direct opposition to Republican values, the interests of the American people, and the Constitution of the United States.
HENRY: Still ahead, a 2020 Democratic candidate already in some hot water because of some past views that are being seen as anti-gay. Guy Benson and Marie Harf here live to weigh in, you see them there, next.
Look, the American people are not going to be fooled by anybody from the Trump White House when it comes to these issues. So I'll leave it to my competitors in this race to speak for themselves, but one thing we can all agree on is that we can do a lot better than this president.
But I do believe that we are going to see a clarifying moment that occurs over the next two weeks. And by the time we get to super Tuesday -- I've been to four of the Super Tuesday states. Let me just tell you, Michael Bloomberg is dominating the airwaves. But you're right, I don't know where the energy is on the ground for Michael Bloomberg, but he is dominating the airwaves.
Gillibrand has also been described by GQ Magazine as the face of #metoo, after she led to charge to secure former Minnesota Democratic Sen. Al Franken's resignation in 2017 amid claims of sexual misconduct. But her role in Franken's ouster rankled some progressives who felt that Franken was a victim of a rush to judgment.
At the end of the day, Chris, we're going to have a nominee by the end of March.
Buttigieg argued that judgment was more important than tenure, saying Biden had shown bad judgment when he voted for the use of force authorization that allowed former President George W. Bush to start the Iraq War. The former mayor added that the problems of the new decade will require a new perspective from the commander-in-chief.
CONWAY: The way he feels about people is so demeaning. The policy may have been stop-and-frisk, but the philosophy was to castigate and denigrate people of color and it's a disgrace.
One, is because telling a person to lie to Congress is a federal offense that carries a five-year prison term and because the President's own attorney general nominee has said that if the President told a witness to lie, then that would be obstruction of justice. But also because, if the President did carry out these actions, then Russia would know that he was lying and that gives them massive leverage over the President, massive leverage of the United States, and that is --
Once they claimed their current Senate majority, Republicans, in response, eliminated the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees as well.
HARF: That's what we need to see.
•End mass incarceration! Black Lives Matter, among other Leftist groups, insisted on the release of thousands of largely Black non-violent offenders vacuumed into federal prisons during the War on Drugs. Obama-Biden snored.
I think that there's this narrative that exists out there that Hollywood is anti-Christian or anti-religious, but it's just not the case, he said. They are kind of not anti-anything. … I've never had anyone try to same me, to my face. Maybe they go say it behind my back. But if that's the case, go ahead. You can say whatever you want about me — to my face or behind my back. I'm not going to change.
Those comments, gay-rights activists said this week, were politically unforgivable.
HENRY: Yes and Corey, I apologize. I'm looking down, I'm checking my phone, this is breaking as we speak. I want to repeat this statement because I want everyone to understand what we're talking about. I want to get more reaction.
Politico: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is slated to meet with veteran Republican strategist Ward Baker on Sunday afternoon to discuss a possible 2020 run for the vacant Kansas Senate seat, according to two people familiar with the plans. Pompeo, a former congressman and ex-CIA director who in April 2018 was confirmed as secretary of State, is considering a Senate bid, though he has yet to make a final decision. Yet party leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, are aggressively wooing him. McConnell (R-Ky.) and Pompeo spoke shortly after Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts announced his retirement. Pompeo and Baker are expected to talk about what a Senate campaign would entail.
In 2017, a federal judge ruled that Davis was acting as an agent for the state, making Kentucky taxpayers responsible for paying the legal fees of the gay and straight couples who filed suit. Bevin objected. His lawyers argue no one should have to pay the legal fees, because the gay and straight couples did not technically win the lawsuit since it was dismissed.
Anthony Albanese, of the Australian Labour Party, also tweeted about the decision.
Tabizada will be sentenced at a hearing scheduled for March 23, 2021. She faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000.
I don't give out those gongs. That's not a matter for me; that's for others. You might want to speak to them about why they think those views, which are disgraceful, hurtful and cost lives, should be honored, Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said Friday, via The Guardian.
REP. TULSI GABBARD, D-HI: Aloha. In my past, I said and believe things that were wrong. And worse they were very hurtful to people in the LGBTQ community and to their loved ones.
2006 is a fine year in which to ask that question. It is far enough into the new century for gender feminists to have provided a rough answer if one is coming. I believe the answer has arrived.
Hirshman bluntly acknowledges the failure of feminism by pointing to one phenomenon. Many educated women are rejecting successful careers to become mothers and embrace the domesticity that Betty Friedan compared to animal life and a Nazi concentration camp in her 1953 bestseller The Feminine Mystique. How did this happen? In a word, choice is to blame.
WALLACE: Walk us through, when you're sitting at a piano, how you come up with an idea.
Prejean's scandalous ventures began when, in the Miss America 2009 competition, she was asked what her views were on same-sex marriage.
Even beauty pageant queens are subject to scandal.
When the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, the largest U.S. attorney office, is removed and then a replacement is putting in, and then the sentencing charges are either meddled with -- yes, there needs to be a comprehensive investigation as to what is happening.
I'm in good company, he tweeted last week, referring to McCain.
The Racial and Identity Profiling Advisory Board report was unveiled amid calls to defund police departments and promises from state lawmakers to renew efforts to strip badges from bad officers, make more police misconduct records public, and allow community groups to handle mental health and drug calls where police powers may not be needed.
So, I take Bill Barr's word when he says that the president has never intervened, but that, you know, he finds the comments unhelpful.
Romero leads the Argentine Transvestite, Transsexual and Transgender Association, whose legal team helped draft the law with help from an international coalition of activist groups pushing for governments to drop barriers to people determining their own gender identity. None of those groups have managed to find politicians willing to go as far as Argentina's, however.
The Commonwealth exercised a great deal of control over Davis, while the County enjoyed none, Mando wrote.
HENRY: It really is and in fact we have Corey Lewandowski, who's on early. He's going to comment in a moment. We're going to go into breaking news mode here to make sure we stay on top of this. But, I want to get Marie's thoughts as a Democrat. There were democrats today as you know out there and we played a clip from Chris Wallace say, everybody take a breath.
BURGER KING TO GIVE BRONX RESIDENTS FREE WHOPPERS FOR DEALING WITH 'JOKER STAIRS' TOURISTS
You know, this, more than anything else, I think for so many voters and certainly a lot of voters that -- of color that I talked to across the Latino, the black in the AEPi (ph) communities is about making sure that we get this right.
And so, this is somebody -- he will still be a serial liar whether he's prosecuted or not --
A spokesman for Hirono pointed Fox News to a statement in Hawaii NewsNow, in which he said Gabbard was expressing a misguided opinion.
CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: Right. So first, Nancy Pelosi is the Speaker of the House. Her first duty is to first and foremost pass laws and legislation. She controls the purse. The Constitution says all spending bills must originate in the House. The President is the commander-in-chief. His first duty is to direct the Armed Forces and so when he goes overseas he's obeying his Constitutional duty.
Republicans have been supportive of Brasher's nomination, which saw a cloture vote split on party lines with no defections either way.
WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the new tension between President Trump and his attorney general.
People are starting to scratch their heads and wonder, 'When are we going to start up again? one source close to the White House told Politico earlier this month.
She reportedly campaigned for district attorney by pledging not to advocate for capital punishment which helped solidify her win, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.
•More school spending! Leftists cheer for higher educational outlays as predictably as roosters crow at dawn.
Read on for a look at some of the decisions she made throughout her career.
The vice president also called out the media for its lack of coverage of the annual March for Life taking place Friday in the nation's capital.
In California, current and former San Jose Police Department officers were found to have shared racist Facebook posts in the past. Other agencies, including the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and San Francisco Police Department, have been involved in similar issues.
In a moment, we'll speak with counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison didn't comment on Court's honor.
This isn't the first time the group, which claims its mission is to stop the exploitation of our children, has used its platform to call out a commercial it does not agree with.
That's why the Bernie voters are not going to take that. I predict. He'll keep winning contests. He's like President Trump in that he's got a committed base of loyal voters who aren't going to go elsewhere.
YORK: As a matter of fact if you read that, you get the idea that Cohen was in contact with the White House. And he kind of knew the party line, which is there was no collusion, no contact with Russia but we all knew that party line.
WALLACE: So what to expect? Do you -- I mean, going forward you expect the president to stay out of these cases?
Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick was a late entrant into the race and didn't register in the Iowa caucuses. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, has staked her entire campaign on New Hampshire, spending more time there than any other candidate. Sen. Mike Bennet, D-Colo., was on MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews from New Hampshire in the lead-up to the Friday debate, looking to get national television exposure for his campaign which has struggled to gain any traction.
TRUMP: It was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg, and it was terminated by a current mayor. But stop-and-frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City, tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.
WALLACE: Guy, you could tell that Kellyanne Conway was thoroughly enjoying the predicament, not just for Bloomberg, but for the Democratic Party.
WALLACE: You called it punk rock for sissies.
MACCOBY: Well, that's why it's called a scoop and we find out. That's why we -- this not only deserves an investigation but it demands one because we should know if this is true or not. And the only way we find out if it's true or not is by conducting a thorough investigation and I think that's what we should do.
TRUMP SLAMS 'DISGRACEFUL' NINTH CIRCUIT, SUGGESTS THEY WOULD OVERTURN HIS TURKEY PARDON IF THEY COULD
1759: George Washington and Martha Dandridge Custis are married in New Kent County, Va.
Pratt, 39, also loves the fact that Schwarzenegger, 29, doesn't shy away from discussing her beliefs openly with others.
One candidate didn't even need to be on the debate stage to loom large. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is skipping the early states and using his fortune to blanket the airwaves in Super Tuesday states, drew a rebuke from Warren.
She filed multiple charges against the site's CEO and shareholders, including money laundering, pimping and conspiracy to commit pimping.
WALLACE: OK. About Bloomberg's history of sexist comments, about women who work for him at his company.
KAZIANIS: Well, you know, Ed, I think both sides need to get a win here. Because you have to remember, even Kim Jong-un has his own domestic political audience, elites in North Korea that he has to convince that it's worth dealing with the United States. So I think the deal on the table that's been floated makes sense.
Rarely have we seen someone who was so actively and vehemently and viscerally against LGBTQ equality and acceptance. [Gabbard] was someone who worked so actively against our community when the stakes were so high. — Zeke Stokes, the vice president of programs at GLAAD
He then touted that I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. I managed the $900 billion Recovery Act, which, in fact, put millions and millions of dollars into his city before he came and helped save his city. I was able to do it -- I was able to pass the chemical weapons ban, arms control. And I was the first major leader holding public office to call for same-sex marriage.
The neglected bias in the Prop. 8 trial has instead to do with the fact that – as reported in The Los Angeles Times last month – Judge Walker attends bar functions with a companion, a physician.
WALLACE: Wish (ph) you could be talking to the commercial.
JESSICA SIMPSON'S SHOCKING TELL-ALL MEMOIR: 5 THINGS WE LEARNED
Biden leans on Obama legacy at Sharpton's King Day breakfast - Washington Examiner: Former Vice President Joe Biden on Monday touted his relationship with former President Barack Obama in a meeting with black voters in New York and assured them that he is close friends with Obama. 'He's my buddy,' Biden said at a breakfast hosted by Rev. Al Sharpton and the National Action Network. 'All those memes are true, except he did the first friendship bracelet, not me.' Biden name-checked Obama multiple times during his speech by referring to him as his friend 'Barack,' as he pitched the Obama administration's record on the topics such as criminal justice reform. Biden made no specific reference to 2020, although he has hinted he'll be a candidate in the coming months. He appeared with former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who hinted that both he and Biden might be running.
Klobuchar closed with an emotional plea to New Hampshire voters, embracing a populist message and referencing former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in a debate moment that struck some pundits as her best yet.
Michael R. Sherwin, Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, said the defendant's violent threats were directed at the free exercise of a private school community's religious beliefs.
In an interview The Washington Post this week, O'Rourke claimed that border walls like the one proposed by Trump will ensure death, and he even suggested the principles in the Constitution may be outdated and useless in the modern age.
When you have the Special Counsel who has issued no statements at all at any time during this investigation, except statements in open court, that they felt compelled to deny this story is a sign of the tragic state of American journalism but I applaud the Special Counsel. I'd been an extreme critic of the hacks (ph) that he has on his staff and I must say, tonight, he has acted like a professional.
CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Chris Wallace.

Those people, who otherwise might not enter the store, might respond on impulse to an advertisement in the store by entering and purchasing a handgun – indeed, that is the self-evident purpose of that kind of advertising, to draw people in and induce them to purchase a handgun, Harris argued.
Buttigieg and Sanders also butted heads, with Buttigieg characterizing the self-labeled democratic socialist's politics as my way or the highway.
WALLACE: Mayor, thank you. Thanks for joining us. We'll be watching developments next week out of Nevada.

Gillibrand has also reversed her position on driver's licenses for illegal immigrants, suggesting she supports the idea after previously opposing it years ago.
It's not just the middle class, it's the broad spectrum of people who work hard and just simply don't get a break these days, Brown told the audience, who turned out in sub-zero weather in the town of 3,800 where manufacturing jobs have sharply waned over the past decade.
With Vice President Al Gore presiding in his capacity as president of the Senate, Congress formally certifies George W.

Because, it was so egregious that they felt the need to keep the integrity in place of their investigation, to show that once again the facts that the media is putting out are not facts at all. It's conjecture and speculation and that does nobody any good.
Born Again Feminism for the 21st Century
She was once accused of violating defendants' rights
The Supreme Court eventually ruled against Proposition 8. Harris would officiate the wedding of Kris Perry and Sandy Stier, the first same-sex marriage in California.
WALLACE: Good luck with getting him to back off on the tweets.
Gabbard was a visible force against same-sex marriage, and in 2004 spearheaded a fight in the state against a same-sex union measure. To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, she said at the time. As Democrats, we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists.
WALLACE: Declassified as a means of de-confliction, and it's working.
When Fedorova gave up her Miss Universe crown, rumors swirled that she was pregnant. However, the beauty countered that the many responsibilities required of her interfered with her university studies.
Graham vowed that the committee will immediately begin working on these important nominations and trying to confirm as many as possible, as soon as possible.
On social media, critics for the most part were not forgiving.
In an Op-Ed this week in The Washington Post entitled Anti-Catholic bigotry is alive in the U.S. Senate, columnist Michael Gerson wrote that questions like the ones from Harris and Hirono were inappropriate and scare the hell out of vast sections of the country.

HEAD OF US BISHOPS' CONFERENCE WARNS BIDEN WOULD 'ADVANCE MORAL EVILS AND THREATEN HUMAN LIFE'
Romero, 48, said she personally knows 40 people who had to get judicial approval for sex-change operations, and are still on waiting lists. The law should help them get the treatment they need, she said.
That same year, in 2014, photographs surfaced of Jessica's father with then-22-year-old Scottish model Jonathan Keith. At the time, the singer's father denied having a relationship with Keith and also denied being gay.
He noted while it's important for district attorneys to not release information that could undermine a case or draw unwanted attention to victims, Harris' office seems to be going beyond these important principles to a blanket policy of secrecy.
SUSAN LI, CORRESPONDENT: Well being a journalist -- yes, being a journalist you have to have your sources right. You have to depend on them. It's not just one source, you better have one, two, even three to back up the same story and there is reputational risk. I mean look what happened to BuzzFeed. Is anyone going to believe them from now on?
After hearing my case, the Supreme Court said that my relig­ious beliefs about marriage are protected views, and that the gov­ernment must treat those beliefs with tolerance and respect. Because my state's hostility toward my beliefs was so blatant, the Supreme Court didn't fully address all the questions about my rights as an artist and creator.
That is I think a problem for BuzzFeed and the reporting. And we'll see where this story goes from here but that is a significant development.
Of course, Walker's opinions about marriage and sexual preference could be related to his own homosexuality.
MANCHESTER, N.H. – Former Vice President Joe Biden gave a full throttled defense of the politics of the past as he defended his record at Friday night's Democratic presidential primary debate.

Now one of the most outspoken advocates for eliminating Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Gillibrand admitted in 2009 that she would have to change her views because she now represented the whole state, rather than a traditionally conservative enclave.
BUTTIGIEG: Well, here's my generational -- or general election experience on this. You know, I came out during a general election in south Bend. And this was at a time when Mike Pence was the governor of Indiana. And we didn't know what would happen.
So look, let's get the facts right. But making accusations which we know to be not truthful aren't helpful.
He also said he didn't understand moves in Tokyo's Shibuya Ward and other local areas to recognize same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriages are not recognized in Japan nationally.
But look at all the people who were saying, you know what, I think Michael Bloomberg learned his lesson, he's apologized, that was so long ago. Chris, it was a few years ago as mayor of New York. And it wasn't just stop-and- frisk. He said redlining -- canceling redlining started the financial crisis.
The 38-year-old Brasher is Trump's 51st judge confirmed to the appeals courts and 188th overall, according to a Heritage Foundation count. He was confirmed to the Middle District Court of Alabama last year and was previously the Alabama Solicitor General, a job in which he argued before the Supreme Court and the 11th Circuit, the bench Trump and Senate Republicans would like him to join. Also a former white-collar criminal defense lawyer and civil litigator, Brasher received a unanimous Well-Qualified rating from the American Bar Association for his nomination to the 11th Circuit.
All that changed, Gabbard claimed, when she served two tours of duty in the Middle East, and saw how governments there maintain excessive control of people's personal lives.
HENRY: You're right. There were some Democrats who were responsive, I want to be fair. On the other hand, there were Democrats saying, impeachment. This will lead to impeachment. You're right, some of them said, if true. But for those of us in our business, you're not supposed to go with stories that you're like, if it's true, this is a big deal.
Under the left's despised Donald Trump, Gini advanced from 0.481 in 2016 to 0.489 in 2017. But then Gini fell two consecutive years, to 0.486 in 2018 and 0.484 in 2019 — 1.033 percent less unfairness.
FOLDS: It's about unformalizing the symphony orchestra in a way that doesn't intimidate people. People go to the symphony and they think, oh, how do I dress? They don't even know. So, you know, we make it informal in a way for them to feel comfortable to be there.
Gabbard spoke at the Democratic National Convention in 2012, and her initial congressional bid was endorsed by then-President Barack Obama. She also served as one of four vice chairs on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) -- but has since become a self-described enemy of the party's establishment.
Ever since William Barr became attorney general, critics have complained he acts more like the president's personal lawyer than the nation's top law enforcement officer. But this week, Barr said Mr. Trump's comments and tweets about criminal cases make it impossible for him to do his job.
BIDEN CREDITS TRUMP ON VACCINE EFFORT BEFORE ADDING PROGRAM WAS IN 'WORSE SHAPE' THAN EXPECTED
One thing is to say that marriage should be between a man and a woman, but another is to actively work to stymie the progress of a community that is marginalized, and to oppose an effort to keep kids safe, Stokes said.
If we cherish the freedom of religion in this country, this administration stands foursquare for the freedom of religion for people of all faiths, and to see the mainstream media criticize my wife cause she's choosing to return to the classroom of an elementary Christian school is wrong, Pence said. Again, the attacks on Christian education must end.
BUTTIGIEG: Well, I think he's going to have to answer for that and speak to it.
HENRY: Which was unverified then is largely unverified now as we report to you tonight, live from New York. Nan, Susan and Mattie, I appreciate you all coming in. This is Ed Henry. I had been sitting in, of course, for Martha MacCallum. We are going to be on top of this breaking news story all evening. I'll be back tomorrow morning, 6:00 a.m. Eastern for Fox & Friends as well.
At the beginning Friday evening's event, Biden -- long seen as the frontrunner in the race -- sought to downplay expectations ahead of the New Hampshire primary, saying I took a hit in Iowa and I'm probably going to take a hit here.
Gabbard also once gave a lengthy speech at the Hawaii State House against a proposed resolution that addressed the bullying of gay students in public schools. Gabbard argued the resolution would cast homosexuality as normal, and that it would attract homosexual-advocacy organizations into our schools to promote their agenda to our vulnerable youth.
Wednesday's order, they said, threatens to infringe the rights of people who recognize the truth of sexual difference or who uphold the institution of lifelong marriage between one man and one woman. This may manifest in mandates that, for example, erode health care conscience rights or needed and time-honored sex-specific spaces and activities.
HENRY: All right, Jessica, Charlie, Governor, I appreciate you all coming in today.
He's crowing about it every day, and he's going to beat us unless we beat him on the economy, stupid, Steyer said, calling back to ABC moderator George Stephanopoulos' time working for former President Bill Clinton, who adopted the slogan.
Attorney General William Barr takes an unusual public swipe at President Trump over his criticism of the Justice Department.
WALLACE: But is it fair game for President Trump when he's made sexist comments too?
HENRY: Corey, it was just one week ago tonight in fact that the New York Times had the previous blockbuster that was going to blow the President out of the water saying that the FBI had a counterintelligence investigation to find out whether he was a Russian agent and some of the same people said, oh my gosh, it's all over, the walls are closing in. Where are we one week later?
BRAZILE: Don't try to get me in trouble on a Sunday (ph).
Gabbard has in recent years said she has evolved in her views about gay rights, and has actively helped further LGBTQ interests in Congress. She was quoted in several media outlets as saying in a statement on Sunday, after her old remarks and actions came under fire, that she was sorry about her past views and comments.
And I raised a few concerns that I had about the report saying, let's be a little bit skeptical. And one of them was the fact that tou had anonymous sources talking about additional documentation that the journalists themselves apparently had not seen. So, they are reporting about characterizations of text messages and e-mails that others supposedly were giving them but they hadn't seen those particular items themselves.
Sweet Katherine, so happy you said yes! he captioned with a diamond ring emoji. I'm thrilled to be marrying you. Proud to live boldly in faith with you. Here we go!
The issue has the potential to become a hot factor in the presidential campaign.
…for upon some occasions things will not admit of accommodation; and then the measures of government must be injuriously suspended, or fatally defeated. – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 22
They are one of those rare couples that you root for from the beginning, said the source to the publication. It won't be a long engagement — Katherine has already talked about having a summer 2019 wedding.
While Republicans on Capitol Hill are ramping up probes of the overseas activities of Biden's son, Hunter, while Biden was vice president, the Democrats on the stage didn't go there.
Leona was stripped of her crown one day after winning Miss USA in 1957 when her mother-in-law revealed that she was married with two children and that her real age was 18, not 21, which was written on her application.
It's extremely early, and there will be changes on a near-daily basis. But Harris' candidacy has the most important hallmark of a frontrunner: She's making other candidates think and act differently.
The Knights of Columbus has taken a number of extreme positions, Hirono said in a questionnaire sent to Buescher. For example, it was reportedly one of the top contributors to California's Proposition 8 campaign to ban same-sex marriage.
Politicians have been struggling to deal with Japan's low birth rate without success, mostly blamed on a lack of child care and help for working women.
In a written statement late Wednesday, Bush termed deeply troubling the decision that same-sex couples in Massachusetts have a right to marry — not just form civil unions — and reiterated a position staked out in his State of the Union (search) speech last month.
What we're hearing here is a very long dissertation about exactly why America should be the world's policemen, Steyer said. So, when we're talking about our role in the world and commander in chief, we have abandoned diplomacy, we don't have a strategy and we don't have allies.
LEWANDOWSKI: Well, this is a huge story, Ed, because it just goes to show that the intellectual integrity of the BuzzFeed people has none. Look, they think it's all fun and games to go after the President and say if the story is true. There had to be an enormous discussion inside the Mueller investigators that they had to come out and make a public statement on a Friday night to dispute this story.
The White House announced in October Trump had nominated Patrick Bumatay, Daniel Collins and Kenneth Kiyul Lee (all from the Golden State, and reportedly all members of the conservative Federalist Society) to the 9th Circuit, bypassing the traditional blue slip process in an apparent snub of Feinstein and Harris.
JAKE MACCOBY, FORMER SPEECHWRITER, ATTORNEY GENERAL LORETTA LYNCH: Thanks, Ed. Good to be here.
HARF: So I am -- I, Joe, look I know you're happy that this story has been debunked. I don't want fake stories out there either but I don't like the way team Trump uses the label fake news on every story about Russia they don't like.
Religion will play a crucial role in the highly anticipated wedding of Chris Pratt and Katherine Schwarzenegger, a source close to the couple told People magazine Wednesday.

When asked on Wednesday about Biden's abortion policies, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the president was a devout Catholic.

The NRA quickly downgraded her perfect gun-rights rating to an F during her first year in the Senate, as she embraced gun-control proposals and described her epiphany on the dangers of unregulated firearms. In 2012, she wrote an op-ed in the New York Daily News asserting that the attempted assassination of Rep. Gabby Giffords in early 2011 at the hands of a mentally ill gunman had convinced her of the need for reasonable limits on the Second Amendment.
The attorney generals accused the banks of using illegal practices to foreclose on homes nationwide.
Gabbard now says she's evolved, reportedly explaining: Much work remains to ensure equality and civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ Americans and if elected president, I will continue to fight for equal rights for all.
KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: Good morning.
At the moment, Buttigieg has a narrow lead in state delegate equivalents, or SDEs, which are what helps decide how many delegates candidates get to bring to the Democratic National Convention later this year. Sanders, on the other hand, leads in the popular vote from both the first alignment and the second alignment phases of the caucuses.
Talackova eventually made it to the Top 12.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP, FEBRUARY 5, 2015)
The judge said the fact he might one day face a case with Brown v. Board of Education as a precedent meant he should not publicly take a position on it, a stance several Trump judicial nominees have taken in Senate hearings.
Harris, in her questions to the nominee, called the Knights of Columbus an all-male society and asked the Nebraska lawyer if he was aware that the group was anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage when he joined. The Catholic Church has opposed both abortion and gay marriage for centuries.
CONWAY: He is small potatoes. He will always be seen as a serial liar and a leaker, as will those who covered for him.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And it's about un-formalizing the symphony orchestra in a way that doesn't intimidate people.
FROM THE BLEACHERS Thank you for bringing some semblance of looking at all sides of an issue. I feel very upset and disappointed with all politics lately. It has left me feeling like I don't belong anywhere politically. Basically I'd like all the elected officials to do their jobs and stop acting like they are afraid to stand up to leaders in their party. I wonder if we would be better off if we didn't have parties - just elect individuals and make them responsible for working together to get things done. - Mary Anne Kenerson, Clarkston, Michigan
FOLDS: Here's the happy version. Hello, Chris Wallace, how are you today? We make it minor and it becomes sad because he has more work to do.
ED HENRY, HOST: Thanks, Shannon. Good to see you. Have a nice weekend. Happy birthday, May, by the way. We begin with the Fox New Alert. Brand new photos of a massive group of migrants that just now made a dubious bid of American history. The largest group ever to break into the United States successfully. 376 Central Americans digging tunnels under a weak portion of border fence near Yuma, Arizona where they were confronted by U.S. Border Patrol Agents and then immediately demanded asylum.
The next artist that you're about to hear, I just discovered her on YouTube.
HENRY: And by the way, the President has denied that he directed Michael Cohen to commit a crime either in terms of lying to Congress or in terms of those campaign finance laws as well. Byron, I appreciate your insight.
This election isn't about any of us candidates. It is about voters' lives. And we're the ones trying to get voters a raise. We're the ones trying to make sure that there is paid family leave, working to end endless war, serious about climate change --
YORK: And -- but at the same time, they did not say that President Trump directed him to lie to Congress.
What did he lie about? Well, on about October -- at the end of October, 2016, he authorized a leak to Devin Bartlett, then a reporter at The Wall Street Journal. And the leak was about the ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.
If (as The Times suggests) Judge Walker is in a stable same-sex relationship, then he might wish or even expect to wed should same-sex marriage become legally available in California.
The case dates to the summer of 2015 when same-sex marriage became legal nationwide. At the time, the county clerk's name appeared on all marriage licenses in Kentucky. Davis, a devout Apostolic Christian who says gay marriage is contrary to her religious beliefs, viewed this as her endorsement of same-sex marriage. She stopped issuing all marriage licenses.
As attorney general, Harris was a fierce opponent of the advertising website Backpage, which has been widely accused of knowingly aiding human traffickers. It was seized by the FBI in April 2018.
Hirshman dismisses what she calls choice feminism. Instead, she argues for a return to a judgmental starting point by which incorrect choices are to be shunned, choices like the traditional role of wife and mother.
No, here's -- if you're going to do that -- you know what? I'll take that on any time. I'll take a leave of absence from the White House and talk all day long about that stuff.
As the reinvention occurs, the gender feminist approach to specific issues will inevitably shift as well.
Hallmark later announced that it decided to pull the commercial just days after the petition was launched. After public backlash, however, the network reversed its decision and reinstated the same-sex marriage commercials.
Biden during the debate dinged Trump's recent move to give radio talker Rush Limbaugh the Medal of Freedom, saying, We should be pinning a medal on Vindman and not on Rush Limbaugh.
In her op-ed, Gabbard noted that the standard her fellow Democrats were using would have disqualified members of the Kennedy family from serving.
Because of this decision guided by her religious convictions, Barronelle became the target of the Washington attorney general's highly publicized lawsuit — initiated without a complaint from Rob. That lawsuit and another one later brought by the ACLU have taken away her wedding business and now threaten to destroy her financially.
GROWING NUMBER OF 2020 DEMS SUPPORTING 'GREEN NEW DEAL'
WALLACE: So why was stop-and-frisk tremendous then, and it's racist now?
Can -- will President Trump, if it's a Bloomberg-Trump race, will he be able to make an issue of that given President Trump's own long history of sexist comments?
The decision to award Court the honor on Australia Day received criticisms from Australian politicians. Former tennis star Martina Navratilova didn't outright criticize the decision but retweeted Court scrutiny.
I can't comment on an award that is done through an independent process that hasn't been announced or I have no official knowledge of those things, he said.
Meanwhile, Betty Williams, president the NAACP's Sacramento Branch, said the recommendation doesn't go far enough and should also include officers' personal cellphones.
Brasher also didn't receive what's called a blue slip, from Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., the traditional name for approval from a judge's home-state senators. The Senate typically would not move forward with a nomination without blue slips, but McConnell has done away with that precedent, particularly for nominations to the California-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals with Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., staunchly opposing Trump's picks.
That prompted an impassioned response from Biden, who raised his voice as he listed some of his foreign policy accomplishments.
Donald Trump is the not the cause of all of our problems -- and we're making a mistake when we act like he is. — Andrew Yang
Credit Trumponomics. Tax reductions, regulatory relief, and a pro-business tone ignited robust economic growth, buoyed the modest, and never bashed the moneyed. A rising floor, not a falling ceiling, squeezed Gini the right way.
Katie Blair, Miss Teen USA 2006, came under fire after stories surfaced claiming she danced on tables and made out with Miss USA Tara Connor during a night of drinking and snorting cocaine.
The 2020 presidential race is just beginning, and already several declared or possible Democratic contenders once seen as moderates have shifted markedly to the left, in apparent appeals to the party's powerful progressive wing that have at the same time exposed them to charges of political opportunism.
I don't want to overcorrect and say, oh boy, this means the President is in the clear because this investigation goes forward. But, it feels like a pretty darn big deal.
My father called me three days before we left for the wedding to tell me he was bringing his friend Jonathan, a young male model he often shot for his new photography business, Jessica wrote, according to the DailyMail.
In December, O'Rourke even demurred when asked if he is a progressive, saying only, I don't know and insisting that he was not big on labels.
Harris graduated from Howard University, a historically black university, and received her law degree from the University of California, Hastings.
HAYWORTH: It's not journalism, it's rumor mongering, Ed, and all bear in mind that BuzzFeed was the first to publish the dossier.
A humiliated Vanessa was forced to resign, but was able to triumph in the face of controversy with a highly successful career.
Supporters describe him as iconoclastic and creative. Those less enamored have charged him with turning the proceedings into a sensationalized show-trial.
But perhaps the most dramatic shift towards the progressive wing among prospective 2020 Democratic hopefuls has come from Tulsi Gabbard, the 37-year-old Hawaii congresswoman who has served since 2013.
JOE SIMPSON REVEALS HE IS CANCER FREE
McCain said Ward's assault was politically motivated and her involvement in both Senate elections to replace her husband and former Republican Sen. Jeff Flake resulted in Democrat wins.
WALLACE: There's been a war of --
This primary for Democrats, Ed, is going to be a huge primary. It's going to be spirited and I think that's great for the party. These candidates will get to air out these issues on national stages on really important state-level stages. And the people that can answer questions well and honestly and connect with voters, they will rise to the top.
For her part, Gillibrand fired back at Soros, saying that if he has a problem with her handling of the Franken situation, that's on him.
Buttigieg and Biden also clashed on Supreme Court expansion. Buttigieg advocated an expansion of the court but also called for structural reform so that some of the justices are not appointed through a partisan process. We cannot allow the Supreme Court to continue to become one more political battlefield.
JOE DIGENOVA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Well, it's fairly obvious that the reporter who wrote this story should be fired but don't count on it. Number two, this is a stunning revelation by the Office of Special Counsel. They have never done anything like this before. They felt compelled to do so for one reason, there is a new sheriff on the block and his name is Bill Barr.
So let's get beyond the credit, at least acknowledge that he's brought a fresh approach. What has to happen in Summit 2.0? What specifically two or three things that will tell us this is real?
FOLDS: We've sold out every show we've -- we've done here. People have walked away with a Spotify playlist of classical music, which we can see that they are listening to.
A surgical team at Stanford University School of Medicine in Palo Alto, Calif., led by Dr. Norman Shumway performs the first U.S. adult heart transplant, placing the heart of a 43-year-old man in a 54-year-old patient.

WALLACE: By the end of March?
I realized that everyone could relate to piano music, but it just wasn't cool at the moment.
The Miss Universe rules required all contestants to be born female, and as a result she was disqualified.
CONWAY: This is important -- July 2017, and lies again.
I'll tell you what happened, I got re-elected with 80 percent of the vote in my generally Democratic, but socially conservative community. More than I had the first time that I ran for office.
WALLACE: It's a constant test for symphony orchestra's, how to bring in fresh ideas and fans without alienating the diehards. Well now the guy who brought piano to the punk scene is taking on that challenge. He's our Power Player of the Week.
McConnell ready to run the rapids - AP: [T]he issue passed to the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has agreed to bring Trump's proposal to the floor this week. Democrats say there's little chance the measure will reach the 60-vote threshold usually required to advance legislation in the Senate. Republicans have a 53-47 majority, which means they need at least some Democrats to vote in favor.

However, the decision to give her the Companion in the General Division of the Order of Australia, which is awarded for eminent achievement and merit of the highest degree in service to Australia or humanity at large, sparked a massive backlash. The award is set to be given Tuesday, on Australia Day.
Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard barely finished announcing she is running for president in 2020 when the spotlight quickly shifted to anti-gay comments and actions from her past.
HENRY: So what was your biggest takeaway today in terms of what was new beyond them saying OK, because Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a meeting, then there was an Oval Office meeting with North Korean officials. What was your biggest takeaway?
Gay rights groups have criticized Gabbard for her past activism, with Zeke Stokes, the vice president of programs at GLAAD, telling Fox News she was was someone who worked so actively against our community when the stakes were so high.
Not exactly a scandal, but embarrassing nonetheless!
I also once supported a state constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman, she added.
And, you know, one of the reasons why I'm seeing a lot of folks from the Republican Party or formally from the Republican Party ready to cross over is that they can no longer look their children in the eye and explain the behavior of the current president of the United States.
We do know some things that are going on in this Cohen case through the court filings. We've seen the charges against Michael Cohen. We've seen his plea. We've seen his sentencing memo which was from last December. And if you look at that, the lawyers for Michael Cohen came flat out and said, President Trump directed him to commit a campaign finance violation.
President Trump has championed religious liberty, largely winning the evangelical vote in 2016, and earlier this year, his administration launched a global effort to decriminalize homosexuality.
Here we have a president who doesn't really I think even know about it, and flouts it through social media, broadcasting his desire to see this or that person benefited by justice, somebody else should go to jail, and that, as Bill Barr said is totally threatening to that norm.
BUTTIGIEG: Thanks. Good to be with you.
WALLACE: The Democratic race for the White House is gearing up with the votes in Iowa and New Hampshire starting to winnow the field of candidates and establish new frontrunners, but upcoming contest in Nevada and South Carolina, much more diverse states, could reshuffle the race again.
BUTTIGIEG: Well, I'll leave it to pundits due to the political analysis.
And they're at a prime moment where they could get more than they would have gotten and that's by bringing in the DACA portion of it. I think the President wants to resolve that and he will.
HENRY: Let me just reset. This is Ed Henry filling in for Martha MacCallum tonight with the breaking news. The Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, authorized his office to issue a very, very rare statement.
The board found that Black individuals, or people who appear to be Black, were most frequently stopped for reasonable suspicious as opposed to a traffic violation. The report describes reasonable suspicion as a legal standard in criminal law that requires an officer to point to specific articulable facts that would lead a reasonable person to believe that a crime is, was, or is about to occur.
And what I would say to you something, it wasn't true, I was always telling the truth. Team trump has gotten themselves into trouble on that. Rudy Giuliani, people like him doing that, are actually also doing a disservice to the President.
WALLACE: Mayor, what's your reaction to those comments?
The Protocol itself says it was developed in service to the General Conference delegates who will decide on its adoption or amendment, he said. Other plans may well be considered as alternatives. Significant questions remain to be answered about the Protocol's implementation. The Judicial Council will need to rule on its constitutionality.
A Japanese legislator is drawing criticism for his comment that a nation would collapse if everyone became LGBT.
Let me tell you something: the way Michael Bloomberg treated employees, female employees who were under his wing, who were relying on him for their -- for their livelihood, for their health benefits, for their 401(k)s, to have created that kind of culture, that unsafe workplace, to feel that you're being harassed because of your gender, that is problematic, and I think you're going to hear more of it.

KAMALA HARRIS KEEPS SEAT ON SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, BOOSTING POTENTIAL 2020 BID
Screen grabs of Hay's old tweets showed her referring to her followers with the N-word, in a joking manner.
The state's Republican Party, led by Chairwoman Dr. Kelli Ward, is seeking retribution -- starting with McCain, who endorsed the former vice president during the election and has since joined his transition team advisory board.
WALLACE: That's the Chris Wallace song?
The gender identity law that won congressional approval with a 55-0 Senate vote Wednesday night is the latest in a growing list of bold moves on social issues by the Argentine government, which also legalized gay marriage two years ago. These changes primarily affect minority groups, but they are fundamental, President Cristina Fernandez has said, for a democratic society still shaking off the human rights violations of the 1976-1983 dictatorship and the paternalism of the Roman Catholic Church.
We're not going to let them change the subject, Buttigieg said of Republicans when asked a question about Hunter Biden. This is not about Hunter Biden or Vice President Biden, or any Biden. This is about an abuse of power by the president.
The program was criticized, however, after it was revealed that it included undocumented immigrants, training them for jobs they couldn't legally get. Harris later called the acceptance of undocumented immigrants into the program a flaw in the design and asked for it to be fixed, the Los Angeles Times reported.
Hirshman writes, Now the glass ceiling begins at home. Although it is harder to shatter a ceiling that is also the roof over your head, there is no other choice.
Harris' real advantage, though, was she meant to be there. While as many as a dozen members of Congress, state lawmakers, mayors and others mulled a run, Harris got in early and did so with enough economic and institutional support to make her the frontrunner from the start.
But then he tried to test the allegations by himself to find out whether the Cuban government was engaging in censorship.

Under the Trump/GOP Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), numerous employers shared their tax savings with employees. Americans for Tax Reform reports that at least 45 employers hiked their minimum wages to $15 per hour, including major job creators such as Charter Communications, JP Morgan Chase, and Met Life. Cigna and at least two other enterprises hiked hourly wages to $16 — all without government mandates.

Democrats paint target on DeVos - AP
Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail give the first successful public demonstration of their telegraph in Morristown, N.J. 1941: President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in his State of the Union address, outlines a goal of Four Freedoms: freedom of speech and expression; the freedom of people to worship God in their own way; freedom from want; freedom from fear.
•Urban renewal! Since the 1960s, liberals have pushed to revitalize low-income, minority, inner-city communities. TCJA's incentives (e.g. capital gains tax: 0 percent) have lured $75 billion in private investment and created some 500,000 new jobs in 8,764 Opportunity Zones in such neighborhoods.

Five decades and some $16 trillion in federal outlays later, Manhattan Institute scholar Brian Riedl calculates, Trumponomics chopped the poverty rate from 11.8 percent in 2018 to 10.5 percent in 2019 — its nadir since federal estimates began in 1959, five years before the War on Poverty.

MARCH FOR LIFE: A LOOK AT THE LARGEST PRO-LIFE RALLY IN THE US
I am not saying so because nowhere (as far as I know) has Judge Walker volunteered or been made to answer questions about how the outcome of that case would affect his interest (whatever it is) in marrying, and thus his interest in the manifold tangible and intangible benefits of doing so.
HENRY: It is but on the other hand Marie --
The Massachusetts Supreme Court's (search) advisory opinion that gays are entitled to nothing less than marriage set the stage for the nation's fi1rst legally sanctioned same-sex weddings by the spring.
HENRY: Well, Marie makes a fair point. The administration has to look at its own credibility guy. On the other hand, that doesn't give news organizations a license to report, you know, whatever they want. Pardon me, who do we have on the phone?
On a political level, however, you should pay attention. Those same tiresome arguments have dramatically reshaped the institutions with which you and your children live every day.
The president wants very much to stick a label on every candidate, Biden said of how Trump would treat the eventual Democratic nominee. Bernie's labeled himself -- not me -- a democratic socialist.

MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, the White House as the president still has confidence and faith in his attorney general even has multiple congressional Democrats are calling for Bill Barr to resign, amid multiple controversies facing his department.
This month a federal judge in Massachusetts threw out a Congressional law which defined marriage as the union of man and woman.
This is the question of the judge's bias due to his possible interest in which side wins the case.
HENRY: Well advisors to the President are denying all that. We'll discuss in a moment. To be sure, the security of Nancy Pelosi and every other government official is important. It should not be taken lightly. But why is it the Democrats tonight seem to be chirping so much about their security saying so little about the security at the border especially with another caravan of thousands heading our way.
WALLACE: Attorney General Barr and former FBI official Andrew McCabe finding one thing they can agree on as both complain about President Trump weighing in on Justice Department investigations.

For example, in 1980, the term sexual harassment was virtually unknown. Today, it is a legal reality that every campus and workplace confronts. If gender feminism successfully recreates itself, then your day-to-day life may continue to reflect its vision, not yours. Linda R. Hirshman, co-author of the book Hard Bargains: The Politics of Sex, offers a glimpse of that vision. She recently published an article titled Homeward Bound in the liberal magazine American Prospect (12/20/05).

WALLACE: Meanwhile, Democrats are now calling for an investigation of Attorney General Barr. Or even more. Take a look.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And it is absolutely a manufactured crisis. Everyone knows this is a man-made crisis made by one man in particular.
BRAZILE: Sixty -- 60 percent of the delegates. We're going to have a clear shot at figuring out where the last two or three candidates will be. Yes, we're going to have a nominee.
Plus, what would you like us the panel about Democrats' calls to investigate political interference at the Department of Justice? Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.
I believe the shift is largely strategic. It is no longer possible to ignore male victims of harassment. Thus, the championing of boys will be co-opted and recast within gender feminism's established framework of sexual harassment.
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg took incoming fire on electability issues from former Vice President Joe Biden and other rivals in the eighth presidential primary debate as Democrats search for a candidate capable of beating President Trump in November.
He's the mayor of a small city, Biden said before going on to list several of his own major policy accomplishments as a U.S. senator and as former President Barack Obama's vice president, defending his politics of the past as effective. Biden touted his work on the Violence Against Women Act, Obama's economic stimulus package and same-sex marriage.
I'm not sure I would call it a rift, but between Bill Barr saying what he said on ABC News, and then his Justice Department declining to prosecute Andrew McCabe, an outcome that I think it's very clear the president wants, to Michael's point -- I think it's been about few days for the narrative that Bill Barr is just a hatchet man for President Trump who will do his bidding.
DEMS ACCUSED OF RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY FOR QUESTIONING TRUMP COURT PICK'S KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS TIES
Rather than our more sedimented ideas about what it is to be male or female, this sort of throws all of that up in the air in a really exciting way, she said.
HENRY: Joe -- no, Joe, I'll let you talk. Go ahead Marie.
It hung on the idea that there were e-mails, text messages, documents that would prove the President is lying and Michael Cohen is telling the truth. The Special Counsel is saying no.
BENSON: Yes. Now, they're rewriting prime time right now.
In 2013, in the infamous Shelby County v. Holder decision, five right-wing justices on the Supreme Court gutted the landmark Voting Rights Act, which had been repeatedly reauthorized by strong bipartisan majorities in Congress, the organization wrote in a letter. Mr. Brasher filed an amicus brief asking the Court to do just that. He asserted that 'Congress violated the Constitution' when it reauthorized the Voting Rights Act in 2006.
You know, I'm sure we all want to take in a lot of people that are suffering, but what bothers me is that these migrants or these border jumpers that come across the border, they don't go to a port of entry to establish asylum. And then as soon as they're caught, then they -- then they say they want to seek asylum. Our laws are being taken advantage of and there's a whole industry created around this of lawyers and nonprofit organizations that unfortunately take advantage of our benevolence.
No, she said. You have to own up to the facts, and it's important to own up to the facts of how race has totally permeated our criminal justice system.
Karla Oser, 38, underwent hormone therapy before surgeons transformed her male organ into a vagina in 2006, becoming one of only 40 people to have sex-reassignment surgery at a public hospital in the provincial capital of La Plata over the years. But first, she said, she had to present a judge with testimony from two psychologists, a psychiatrist, an ear-nose-and-throat specialist, a gynecologist and a urologist.
Next up for Argentina's government is an overhaul of the country's civil and penal codes, an often-contradictory conglomeration of laws dating back nearly two centuries that cover all aspects of society. Encouraged by the president, congressional commissions representing all leading parties and the Supreme Court are drafting draft wide-ranging legislation to modernize how the country deals with abortion, adoption, artificial insemination, divorce and many other difficult issues.
We've been able to demonstrate our ability to get diehard Democrats, yes, but also independents and even some Republicans to cross over a support my vision and what our campaign stands for. And I believe that's going to serve us well here in Nevada, South Carolina and beyond.
I will tell you this, there is a complete lack of empathy in this guy in the White House right now and I will bring back to you, she said. If you have trouble stretching your paycheck to pay for that rent, I know you and I will fight for you. If you have trouble deciding if you're going to pay for your child care or your long-term care, I know you and I will fight for you. … I do not have the biggest name up on this stage, I don't have the biggest bank account, I'm not a political newcomer with no record, but I have a record of fighting for people.
Bevin's in-house attorney, Steve Pitt, also noted the lawyers were hired by Beshear and said they have taken no position as to whether Ms. Davis acted unconstitutionally.
How important is it for you to do well, much better than those numbers, in both of those states to show that you can get support in states with a big minority voting bloc?
A year-round daylight saving time begins in the United States on a trial basis as a fuel-saving measure in response to the OPEC oil embargo. 1993: Authorities rescue Jennifer Stolpa and her infant son, Clayton, after Jennifer's husband, James, succeeds in reaching help, ending the family's eight-day ordeal after becoming lost in the snow-covered Nevada desert.
After compromising photos of Rees were posted on MySpace, the 2007 Miss Nevada USA was forced to give back her crown.
But he does it because the base loves it. I'm not even sure he really wants these threats and orders carried out, but the base loves it and that is why he will keep doing it.
March is Women's History Month, with a focus on the past raising questions about the future. Gender or left-wing feminism has defined the mainstream movement for decades, but can it carry feminism into the 21st century and away from the accusation of irrelevancy?
In 2018, Gillibrand told CBS News' 60 Minutes that she was embarrassed by her previous views on gun rights and ashamed of her stance on illegal immigration.
Critics accused her of protecting Catholic clergy who abused children
WALLACE: Thank you, panel. See you Sunday.
Gerard V. Bradley is a Professor of Law at the University of Notre Dame.
We adopted a strategy that said that drug enforcement would be targeted in cases where there was a connection to the most violent group or gang connected to a murder, Buttigieg said. These things are all connected, but that's the point.
CONWAY: Voters talk about what offends them, but they vote on what affects them. And they have a big decision to make. If you want -- if you want to elevate somebody who has treated people that are less than him, people of color and women, that's a big decision to make. It's a serious consequence in 2020 when our country has such great progress. This president has --
So, you know, back off a little with the tweets and the comments and take the advice of your attorney general, sure. But the fact of the matter is I think that the president is right in the opinions that he expresses and he's right to be concerned about unequal justice.
Trump's approval of Canadian pharmaceutical imports might work if 37.7 million Canadians had enough for 331 million Americans.
Harris' office had a duty to implement some type of procedure to secure and produce information relevant to Madden's criminal history, the judge ruled. By not disclosing information about Madden, Harris' office was complicit in the violation of the defendants' constitutional rights, the judge said.
As for the arguments over his embrace of socialism, Sanders defended himself, saying it doesn't matter what Donald Trump says, pointing out that Trump will attack any Democratic candidate.

So that lane remains clogged up. I think it's -- it's amazing to me that a -- a mayor of a town of 100,000 is actually in the top two in the Democratic nomination. Keep in mind that no mayor of New York City, population 8 million, the capital of the world, has gone on to higher office, of any higher office, since 1840. Not 1940, but 1840. So that sort of tells against Mike Bloomberg, but it shows that there is still a hunger from at least -- I don't think amongst the voters necessarily so much, but for part of the party to just -- we just need some kind of moderate voice in there. And even if it's the mayor of a small town, you know, we'll take it because they think Bernie's a disaster.
FOLDS: No guitar. No. In an -- in an era that was all about the guitar. That was the grunge era.
HIRONO SUGGESTS KAVANAUGH'S CONSERVATIVE VIEWS ARE A GOOD REASON TO DENY HIM DUE PROCESS
And in another memorable moment, Democrats in the debate hall applauded the mention of Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah -- the only Republican who voted to convict Trump in the impeachment trial this week.
HAYWORTH: -- instead of jumping on a bandwagon.
But first, let's bring in Mark Meredith, reporting from the president's retreat at Mar-a-Lago with the latest -- Mark.
TULSI GABBARD UNDER FIRE FOR PAST ANTI-GAY REMARKS AMID 2020 BID
President Trump took this battle overseas, largely by challenging rather than appeasing Islamic fundamentalism. While Obama literally bowed before Islamo-potentates, including Saudi King Abdullah, the Trump administration pressed 69 foreign governments (many in the Islamic world) to decriminalize homosexuality.
And if -- in either case, Ed, I want to hear BuzzFeed's response because this is -- if it's true that they were really wrong here, it does a disservice to everyone including fellow journalists.
CONWAY: You got it. Thank you.
HARF: Everyone should wait for the facts, I agree with that. I would also say there were a lot of conservative and Republican commentators today saying, if true, this would be a serious crime and this would be impeachable. So, everyone needs to take a deep breath. They need to look at the facts and Bob Mueller is the person we are all waiting for Ed.
Under the income-inequality-hating Obama-Biden administration, the relevant Gini Coefficient actually increased from 0.466 in 2008 to 0.481 in 2016 — 3.218 percent more unfairness.
Should the president listen to Bill Barr, will he listen to Bill Barr?
The Roman Catholic Church, which had an outsized role in forming these codes over the country's 200-year history, has opposed many social reforms, and not just those affecting gay, lesbian and transgender people.
And when it comes to LGBTQ issues, this is, I think, the most important thing is not the treatment of candidates, it's what's happening to individuals and families across the country from brave service members who have their careers threatened --
Senate Democrats previously eliminated the filibuster for federal judicial nominees below the Supreme Court level during the Obama administration, meaning that each of the 51 nominees needs only a majority vote in the Senate to win confirmation.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're essentially accusing the President of the United States of endangering Members of Congress and American --
BUTTIGIEG: Actually prepared to do something on gun violence.
In the hours before the debate, the Trump administration ousted two people from their jobs who testified during the impeachment trial: U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and National Security Council aide Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman.

I don't think anyone ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination, she said. I don't think any billionaire ought to be able to do it and I don't think people who suck up to billionaires in order to fund their campaigns ought to do it.
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, PRESS SECRETARY, WHITE HOUSE: Like that's absolutely ridiculous. I think that the President's outside council addressed this best and said in a statement earlier today that's categorically false.
Marcela Romero, who was born a man but got a sex-change operation 25 years ago, had to spend 10 years making his case in Argentina's courts before a judge ordered the civil registry to give her a new identity card listing her gender as female. It's something humiliating ... many of us have had to endure psychiatric and physical tests, she told The Associated Press on Thursday. With this law we'll no longer have to go through this.
DEMS UNDER PRESSURE TO MAKE A DEAL
Views on Court have changed since her playing days on the tennis courts. Court, now a Pentecostal minister, has been outspoken about her disagreement with LGBT rights and same-sex marriage in Australia. Her criticisms sparked calls for Australia to rename the Margaret Court Arena, which is one of the venues for the annual Australian Open.
WALLACE: No, they get really great because you're talking about a brokered convention, which all of us have been looking towards for our entire political lives.
Joining us now from Las Vegas, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
Regardless, Trump helped American workers enjoy $15-per-hour wages voluntarily.
However, Bevin's lawyers also argued if legal fees are awarded, either Rowan County or Davis herself should be responsible to pay them. Bevin's lawyer Palmer Vance II, noted the purpose of requiring losers to pay for attorneys' fees is to deter conduct that violates civil rights.
Gabbard also gave a lengthy speech at the Hawaii State House against a proposed resolution that addressed the bullying of gay students in public schools. Gabbard argued the resolution would cast homosexuality as normal, and that it would attract homosexual-advocacy organizations into our schools to promote their agenda to our vulnerable youth.
As skyscrapers, power plants, and buses switch to gas, they respectively yield 32 percent less CO2 than with heating oil, 50 percent less versus coal, and 88 percent less beside diesel. This helped push energy-related U.S. CO2 output into a post-1985 pit.
Touting his 8-year tenure as South Bend, Indiana mayor, Buttigieg said the perspective I'm bringing is that of somebody whose life has been shaped by the decisions that are made in those big, white buildings in Washington, D.C., somebody who has guided a community written off as dying just a decade ago through a historic transformation.
HENRY: Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, officially throwing her name into the ring to become a presidential candidate in 2020. But she already hit a bit of a speed bump over past comments on civil union for same sex couples. Gabbard issuing an apology in response to that stance but listen closely as she appears to at least partially blamed her conservative upbringing.
WALLACE: Well, let me follow up on that because Kellyanne Conway was, I think, trolling Democrats and saying, boy, this part that talks about all of these principles in the Me Too era, are they going to nominate somebody like Michael Bloomberg with his record of things he's done, for instance, towards women in the workplace, just because they think he can beat Donald Trump? What would that say about what the Democratic Party really stands for?
WALLACE: We'll ask Pete Buttigieg how he plans to stand out in the crowded center.
(Bevin) led the charge on that religious liberty accommodation, which is what we asked for from the very beginning, Staver said.
Time for some soul-searching in the Arizona GOP, she wrote in a tweet, which included a link to The Arizona Republic
Will Mr. Trump, going forward, respect Barr's request for him to stop commenting on current cases, whether it's -- whether it's in terms of on the air, you know, public statements, or tweets?
Brown attributes his re-election to a third Senate term last year to the resonance of a message to workers who feel left behind, while also embracing his party's liberal base, including its growing racial and ethnic diversity.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in his State of the Union address, outlines a goal of Four Freedoms: freedom of speech and expression; the freedom of people to worship God in their own way; freedom from want; freedom from fear. 1945: George Herbert Walker Bush marries Barbara Pierce at the First Presbyterian Church in Rye, N.Y.
The Argentine lawmakers are introducing profound changes in society that don't respond to any social demand and without taking into account the real consequences, Nicolas Lafferriere, who directs the church-sponsored Center for Bioethics, Personhood and Family, complained Thursday in Religious Values, an online publication sponsored by the archbishop of Buenos Aires.
WALLACE: Can you and I talk about Michael -- can we talk about Michael Bloomberg?
I truly appreciate the prompt attention President Trump and his White House team have shown to judicial nominations, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in a statement Wednesday. I also appreciate the list of 51 impressive judicial nominations to fulfill the Senate's constitutional role in advice and consent.
Biden's identification as a Catholic has come under intense scrutiny from some given his public advocacy and activity. For example, he previously presided over a same-sex wedding ceremony even though the Church has long condemned homosexuality. The Catechism reads: Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that 'homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered,' it said referencing a document from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. They are contrary to the natural law, it added.
TARLOV: To the table, yes, I think we'll go to the table. Chuck Schumer has been clear they have appropriated tens of billions of dollars over the years for border security. Democrats are not against border security. What they object to is a crisis that doesn't reflect the data. If you look at Border Patrol data, it shows that we are down 90 percent in terms of illegal crossings from the year 2000. That shows the net outflow.
That is a conversation worth having.
The president is the head of the executive branch and furthermore has the power to pardon, which sort of implies the power to pick and choose who gets prosecuted and put into prison. And that's why since Watergate, we have developed a strong norm, along with a lot of procedural protections, that try to distance presidential political self-interest from the operation of the Justice Department. And broadly speaking, notwithstanding the examples Kellyanne mentioned, that had been respected.
Federal law requires that, whenever a judge knows that he has any other interest [ that is, besides a financial interest] that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding at hand, or when his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, he must recuse himself.
As first reported by the Catholic News Agency, Hirono asked whether his membership in the Knights of Columbus would prevent him from hearing cases fairly and impartially and, if confirmed, whether he would end his membership in the charitable organization.
There is a degree of heartbreak within me because I never thought we would reach this point, New York Bishop Thomas Bickerton said. However, we are at this point. The differences are irreconcilable. This is inevitable.
Now, right on schedule and with an increasingly large number of backers, Harris is officially making her move. Her choice of Martin Luther King Day for the launch doubly emphasizes who she aims to be in the race: the candidate for an increasingly diverse party and one where women increasingly dominate.
As former President Trump encounters lefties in greater Mar-a-Lago, he should offer them these two words:
When a judge is obliged to withdraw from a case due to a conflicting interest we call it recusal.
The Catholic hierarchy also has been inexorably linked with the military junta that killed as many as 30,000 people during the dictatorship. Both enforced conservative social values at the time.
Cindy McCain, the widow of the late GOP Sen. John McCain, told prospective Arizona Republican candidates in a tweet that they should questions the party's leadership, philosophy and values.
WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: If he were to say, you know, go investigate somebody because -- and you sense it's because they're political opponent, then an attorney general shouldn't carry that out, wouldn't carry that out.
I do not doubt that Judge Walker made up his mind about Prop 8 before the trial began.
WALLACE (voice over): Ben Folds is all about breaking down barriers. Musical barriers between pop and classical.
MICHAEL ANTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: Well, look, I think he should listen to Bill Barr. The president obviously has confidence in Bill Barr. He appointed him.
Vance and Lear did not return a phone call seeking comment.
In New Hampshire, the so-called moderate candidates won more than 50 percent of the vote of voters in that state, but -- which was double what Bernie Sanders got, but he won in New Hampshire because he had that left lane, the more liberal lane, all to himself while the so-called more moderate lane was kind of clogged up by you and -- and Biden and Klobuchar, all of whom split up the votes.
FOLDS: As an artist, what I do is I capture the thing that I see, the thing that interests me. My job is putting that idea in a bottle, which I've taken my whole life to do, and to share that with other people.
CNN'S CHRIS CUOMO'S 'MINE TOO' JOKE TO KAMALA HARRIS AT LGBTQ EVENT DRAWS BACKLASH
But the main problem for Gabbard, observers said in the hours after she announced her presidential bid last week, was that she had espoused hardline beliefs on issues like homosexuality in the past.
WHITE HOUSE SAYS BIDEN IS A 'DEVOUT CATHOLIC' WHEN ASKED ABOUT ABORTION POLICIES
BUTTIGIEG: Well, I think that's what voters right now are in the process of settling. Look, there are a lot of different candidacies with a lot of different visions. But the vision of my candidacy is that we're going to have to bring change to Washington, that we can't confront the most disruptive president in modern times by falling back on the same playbook, just as we also can't do it by telling people that their only options are between a revolution or the status quo.
CNN anchor Chris Cuomo compared her job to GOP Iowa Rep. Steve King's remarks. The Trevor Project also announced it plans to send 100 copies of John Oliver's pro-gay book about the Pences' pet rabbit to the school.

MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: The way you should get the guns out of the kids' hands is to throw them up against the wall and frisk them.
STEVE HARRIGAN, CORRESPONDENT: Ed, if you wonder what it looks like when the caravan comes to town we can give you a little show-and-tell of what that is. This is Tapachula, Mexico where the first wave of that Caravan from Honduras has arrived after four days of hard walking and jumping in the back of pickup trucks. This is about a thousand people who've made it here. And you can see they basically take over the city square.
WHO IS LEV PARNAS? A 'CONMAN'? A 'GROUPIE'? OR IS HE CREDIBLE?
Staying the course is not only an ideological matter, it is also strategic. To the extent male victims are acknowledged, the focus will be on gay male victims. A lot of funding is on the line.
Jeffrey C. Mando, an attorney for Rowan County, dismissed that argument. He said clerks are elected officials and not county employees. He also added that all procedures relating to marriage licenses are governed solely by the state. He said that's why former Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear ordered county clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and it's why Bevin issued later issued an executive order removing clerks' names from the licenses.
WALLACE: Chuck, how much trouble is Biden in with the performance in those other states? Even his one-time overwhelming lead in South Carolina is now beginning to slip away.
Anita Snow in Mexico City and Almudena Calatrava in Buenos Aires contributed to this report.
On the last two issues Ed that you brought up, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden and women's issues I think to a lot of Democrats, those are certainly things they will consider. But when they look at that against someone like President Trump, right, there's really no comparison.
HENRY: Well, you get the point. Chris Wallace is right. Some are not taking the advice. They're jumping whole hog on what they think is a new blockbuster. Tonight, Democrats pledging to probe President Trump over an unverified BuzzFeed report alleging he instructed his former lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. Some are even crying impeachment immediately they say if the report is true. But tonight the White House is firing back.
CNN'S CHRIS CUOMO LINKS KAREN PENCE'S JOB AT IMMANUEL CHRISTIAN TO STEVE KING'S WHITE SUPREMACY REMARKS
LEWANDOWSKI: And moreover, Michael Cohen -- hold on -- very important, Ed, it's very important. Michael Cohen audio recorded every conversation he had. Let's see if there's an audio. This doesn't exist because it never happened.
What do I think is the real feminist line for the 21st century? Your peaceful choices are yours alone and no one else's business. Be a housewife, love your children without a time schedule…or dive into a 24/7 job that you get on merit. Live your own dream. Be your own woman.
Trump's policies graduated 4.2 million from poverty and cut Obama-Biden's 22 percent black poverty rate in 2016 to 18.8 percent in 2019 — a record low and its first-ever reading below 20 percent.
But even if they are, it does not follow that he would be incapable of being impartial and of rendering a judgment in accord with the law in the Prop. 8 case – any more than a happily married heterosexual would necessarily be.
I don't think anyone ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination. — Elizabeth Warren
It is highly likely that federal judges will soon be tearing apart our U.S. Constitution in order to force same-sex marriage down the throats of the people of Hawaii and America, Gabbard said. The only way to protect traditional marriage in Hawaii and throughout our country, the only way to stop activist federal judges from rewriting our constitution, is by the passage of the Federal Marriage Amendment.
Andrew Brasher is an outstanding choice to serve as a district judge for the Middle District of Alabama, Sen. Richard Shelby said when Brasher was confirmed to his district court post in May. His judicial temperament and vast legal experience make him well-suited to assume this new role.
POPE FRANCIS SUPPORTS LAW FOR SAME-SEX CIVIL UNIONS IN NEW DOCUMENTARY: 'THEY ARE CHILDREN OF GOD'
The president wants very much to stick a label on every candidate. — Joe Biden
What does the president think is his legal authority to intervene in criminal cases and to order who should be prosecuted and who should not be prosecuted?
McCain and the Arizona Republican Party did not immediately return messages from Fox News seeking comment.
BENSON: No, he'll tweet. There's a chance that he'll tweet a little bit less. I think that Mitch McConnell sat in the studio, the Senate majority leader, just a few days ago and urge the president to take the advice of his attorney general. I hope the president does it, even if he just calibrates it slightly differently.
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accuses U.N. inspectors of engaging in intelligence work instead of searching for suspected nuclear, chemical and biological weapons in his country. 2014: The U.S. Supreme Court stays a decision by a federal judge striking down Utah's ban on same-sex marriage so that the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver could decide the issue. (In June 2014, the Court of Appeals would overturn the ban; in October, the U.S Supreme Court would turn away appeals from five states seeking to preserve their bans, including Utah.)

TULSI GABBARD, HAWAII DEMOCRAT, SAYS SHE WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020
FOLDS: I don't know. You know, like I'm -- if I was going to say, hello, Chris Wallace, you know, then I find it. So it would be, hello, Chris Wallace, how are you today. You know, like then I would -- I would find it on the piano.
HENRY: Yes, I understand they were trying to make them is what I understood they were using a non-classified computer system so this State Department Cable is laying out the idea, Governor, that if you're on a non- classified computer making commercial flight plans as you say, it's hardly a secret.
Because, the whole story hung on the idea that this was not the testimony of a liar in Michael Cohen, against the President, man versus man. It was documents proving the President wrong. Now, the Special Counsel is saying, we don't have those documents.
Last month a poll came out that had the American -- that had 35 percent of Americans, just 35 percent of Americans saying that they believed somewhat or totally the President's denial in Russia and there was a big majority --

The proposal was first signed in December after the fundamental differences within the church became irreconcilable.
Most dramatically, Gabbard endorsed Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential candidacy. She resigned as DNC vice chair in the process, cementing her abandonment of the party's more centrist establishment in favor of Sanders' rejection of the status quo.
UNITED METHODIST DELEGATES REJECT RECOGNIZING GAY MARRIAGE, THREATENING SPLIT IN CHURCH
In 2015, O'Rourke was among a small number of House Democrats to oppose an oil export ban, and the next year, he rejected an amendment that would have barred spending on research for offshore drilling.
Steyer emphasized the importance of the economy in response to Sanders telling his fellow candidate that they cannot nibble around the edges in order to get radical change like Medicare-for-All.
WaPo: [Kirsten Gillibrand] … The moderate Democrat from Upstate New York had just been appointed to the Senate and liberals were in an uproar. Then a congresswoman, Gillibrand had an A-rating from the National Rifle Association. She co-sponsored bills to roll back restrictions on firearms in the District of Columbia and to limit disclosure of gun trace information by law enforcement. Gun control advocates were stunned that she was chosen to fill the seat. But Gillibrand's transformation had already begun. … Gillibrand overhauled her political identity during this period, abandoning the conservative positions that made her popular upstate and embracing or even moving further left than the liberal consensus on guns, immigration, Wall Street and same-sex marriage. As the Democratic Party itself moved left, she staked out positions popular with the party's swelling base of liberals, a posture most evident when she called for abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. She has voted against President Trump's agenda more than any other senator.
When news of Barronelle's decision hit the media, Rob was inundated with enough offers for free floral designs that he could have decorated 20 weddings. But because of the attorney general's lawsuit, Barronelle was inundated with hate-filled phone calls, e-mails, and Facebook messages that contained profanity, attacks on her faith, and threats against her safety, including a threat to burn down her shop.
Thirteen same-sex couples are filing Japan's first lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the country's rejection of same-sex marriage.
Matt Lewis, CNN political commentator, tweeted out, This isn't going to help win the electoral college. If you wonder why so many Christians are willing to hold their nose and support someone as horrible as Donald Trump, this helps explain it.
HENRY: You're absolutely right. And I want to be fair to BuzzFeed because they have, I'm looking down again, they have updated and they sent out a tweet with the statement for the Special Counsel and are saying, update, a spokesperson for the Special Counsel is disputing BuzzFeed News's report.
Arizona, a traditionally red state, played an important role in the Democrats' victory in the U.S. Senate and Joe Biden's presidential win.
HENRY: -- yes, it was professional but in all seriousness, you dealt with this kind of thing, where you would tell news organizations, you better have your stories straight. A story about the Iran nuclear deal or something else where the details really mattered, really have impact.
Retired Gen. Wesley Clark, another Democratic presidential candidate, said: I leave that to the states and the courts — whether you call it a marriage or not, I leave up to the states and churches and synagogues and mosques.
The former vice president – reprising criticism of Buttigieg he first brought up two days earlier on the campaign trail in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire – said, I don't know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden was so bad. What happened? What is it that he wants to do away with? We were just beginning. It was just the beginning of what will be the future of moving this country beyond where it is now in significant ways.
The bishops argued, however, that the executive order didn't leave as much flexibility for religious entities as the Court did.
New York GOP spokeswoman Jessica Proud, in a statement this week, characterized Gillibrand's shifts as disqualifying and cynical.
The state of Washington has turned Barronelle's life upside-down just because it disagrees with her beliefs about marriage. She deserves better. She deserves the freedom to celebrate marriages that are consistent with her faith — without the government harassing her.
McConnell's redoubled effort to shepherd one young conservative judge after another into lifetime appointments is sure to please conservatives like Carrie Severino, the president of the Judicial Crisis Network.

In an interview in The Arizona Republic, one of a handful throughout the course of the last few months, McCain said she was not surprised by the resolution and continuous insults and personal attacks from Arizona GOP Chairman Kelli Ward.
So, which leftist bullseyes did Trump hit with rightist bullets?
They didn't get in -- they didn't try to tip the scales of justice. They were trying to calm the community after, you know, two very horrific things occurred. So, we shouldn't put the two together.

Jessica informed her readers that her parents were fighting all the time but she was still blindsided by the news and then buried it.
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You couldn't go to your house. They were stopping you every day. What Bloomberg did to black -- to the black community was a disgrace.
And it's time now for our Sunday group.
O'Rourke was one of a handful of Democrats to support the Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization Act in 2017, which permitted the Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) commissioner to waive the polygraph requirement for certain applicants seeking to join the agency.
Meanwhile, negative messages or texts that say #Abstencion (Abstention) were reportedly blocked.
The Supreme Court established important principles in my case, but there's more to be said. That court should hear Barronelle's case, undo the ruling that threatens to bankrupt her, and declare that creative professionals who serve everyone, like Barronelle and I do, need not create custom art celebrating marriages that violate our faith.
The California senator and 2020 presidential hopeful also referenced Supreme Knight Carl A. Anderson's statement that abortion amounted to the killing of the innocent on a massive scale and asked Buescher if he agreed with the statement.
The party that worked so hard to convince people that Catholics and Knights of Columbus like Al Smith and John F. Kennedy could be both good Catholics and good public servants shows an alarming disregard of its own history in making such attacks today, she added.
WALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.
BUTTIGIEG: For a representative of this White House to speak about misogyny, to speak about sexism, to speak about racism is comical. And, you're right, I think it amounts to trolling.
Bush's statement was similar to his remarks in his Jan. 20 State of the Union address in which he said that if judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process.
That kind of message, it might not be for everybody, he explained. But there is a group of people for whom that message is designed. And nothing files my soul more than to think that maybe some kid watching that would say, 'Hey, I've been thinking about praying. Let me try that out.'
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He sees our poll numbers and I think it's fair to say he is scared because he knows I have the record and the resources to defeat him.
I also don't believe feminism ever ceased being judgmental. Nevertheless, the article is a fascinating glimpse into gender feminism's struggle to reinvent itself. The broad themes of this reinvention are: a rejection of the 'c-word' (choice) as the standard of feminism; the substitution of correct choices as feminism's touchstone; a renewed focus on deconstructing the traditional family; and, a reaching backward into the golden age of feminism in order to understand and correct mistakes.
We were given direct assurances from the very top, said Kelly Shackelford, president of the Texas-based Free Market Foundation. There's no doubt. It's our understanding that the president is waiting for a day when there is not a massive news story to do it himself.
Eduardo Sánchez, 23, told Miami's WPLG-TV that the alleged suppression of text messages first spread by the word of mouth.
Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, raised concerns about lawyer Buescher's membership in the Catholic organization as part of the Senate Judiciary Committee's review of his nomination by President Trump to sit on the U.S. District Court in Nebraska.

Attorney General Barr said this week the president has never asked him to do anything in a criminal case. But Mr. Trump tweeted: This doesn't mean that I do not have as president the legal right to do so. I do. But I have so far chosen not to.
HENRY: Sure -- OK, I want to say, Joe, quick point from you, CNN this morning, when you wake up, it was wall to wall impeachment, suborning perjury. Do other people owe the President an apology tonight?
WALLACE: And then, despite -- if you're able to winnow your way through all of those folks, that on Super Tuesday you face another centrist candidate in Mayor Mike Bloomberg. And over really the last week, week and a half, there have been a series of stories about his comments on stop and frisk and redlining and, as I discussed with Kellyanne Conway, a big story in The Washington Post today about a long history of him king sexist, profane comments to women who work for his company and some of whom said that it created a hostile workplace.
And it's why, Ed, last night I was on Shannon Bream's show, Fox News @ Night, while this was all breaking. And I said, if it's true, it's a very significant deal but there had been a string of so-called bombshells that have detonated over the Mueller issue and the Russia probe that have turned out under further scrutiny to be underwhelming or untrue. Let's be careful, let's use caution and this exactly is why.
In O'Rourke's Plan to Pursue Equality for LGBTQ+ People and Ensure They Can Live Openly Without Fear of Discrimination or Violence, he lists reversing the Trump administration's attempt to expand religious exemptions in order to enable discrimination or harm others.
In 2016, Jessica's dad, who was her manager before the singer fired him in 2012, battled prostate cancer. In the memoir, Jessica said her father's recovery forced a needed reconnnection between the daughter and father, according to TooFab.
AFP: Kyrgyzstan is gearing up to introduce legislation that would oblige its president to wear a national pointed hat on diplomatic trips following a national uproar. On Monday a parliamentary committee supported the proposal -- which will also see fines levied for insults to the felt hat -- the first step towards the legislation's introduction for a general parliamentary vote. The bill is a result of a furore that erupted in late 2017 when a dog was photographed wearing an Ak-Kalpak hat at a dog show. The headpiece, which is usually white, has a special place in the Central Asian country, revered so much that it has its own national day. The four-panelled hat symbolises 'the peaks of the magnificent Kyrgyz mountains, forever snow-capped,' a former presidential advisor, Topchubek Turgunaliyev, told AFP last year.
I don't think it disqualifies her, former New York lieutenant governor Richard Ravitch told Business Insider. I just don't like or respect what she did.
HENRY: But I want to underscore that because you'll remember a year and a half ago, there were all these people, the mainstream media saying the President is reckless. He doesn't know what he's doing. He's leading us into nuclear war and he said what you see from Republican Senator Lindsey Graham sometimes a friend not always a friend to the President, tough critics sometimes saying today President Trump deserves great credit for getting us to this point. We have a long way to go and I'm hopeful that the engagement started by President Trump can finally end the North Korean problem in a win-win fashion.
The new conservative Traditionalist Methodist denomination wouldn't allow gay marriage or gay clergy members, The New York Times reported.
The about-face struck some commentators as unpersuasive. Zack Beauchamp, a senior correspondent for the left-leaning Vox.com, wrote on Wednesday that a skeptic could cast this as mere political convenience: a person who had spent much of her adult life in politics getting a sense of which way the wind was blowing in the party.
HALLMARK PULLS ZOLA COMMERCIAL OF BRIDES KISSING AFTER CONSERVATIVE GROUP CALLS FOR BOYCOTT
BIDEN SAYS HE'S 'PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE A HIT' IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
BEN FOLDS, MUSICIAN AND AUTHOR: Because there seems to be a hierarchy, which you would think exists where the symphony is the great thing and the -- the -- the rockers of the dumb ones. But it's not that simple and each have something to offer the other.
WALLACE: We'll discuss the fallout with counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway. It's a FOX News Sunday exclusive.
Schwarzenegger shared the same sweet snap, writing, My sweet love. Wouldn't want to live this life with anyone but you.
HENRY: All right, Steve Harrigan, I appreciate your reporting. Moments ago the press secretary at the White House Sarah Sanders was asked if the President will use that announcement at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow to declare a national emergency. Her response, stay tuned.
On her Senate website, Harris lists the program she launched to reduce recidivism rates for non-violent drug offenders as one of her achievements as San Francisco's district attorney.
This is a woman who relied upon her employment, relied upon Michael Bloomberg for employment, and one would imagine her maternity benefits as she found out the good news. The comments he's made about women -- I mean, The Washington Post had to bleep out some of the actual words.
In China, young adults are facing intimidation and detention for the crime of posting on Twitter, with one man spending 15 days in a detention center for using the platform blocked in the country, the New York Times reported.
That right should be protected. The Supreme Court's Bostock decision, however, needlessly ignored the integrity of God's creation of the two complementary sexes, male and female, with reasoning that treated them as devoid of meaning. Wednesday's executive order on 'sex' discrimination exceeds the Court's decision.
Others said they wanted to hear more from the congresswoman about why she held the views and, in particularly, why she went out of her way to fight against issues of importance to the LGBTQ community.
And in this case, we have a situation where this is a presidency, this is a presidency on the line. Democrats suggesting that he can be impeached. We heard about suborning perjury, obstruction of justice. These are serious, serious matters. And these stories have to be accurate if we're going to get to the bottom of the story, don't they?
WALLACE: How damaging, if you don't show strong support among Latinos in Nevada, African-Americans in South Carolina -- because that question of whether or not you can get support from those minorities, of course, is the big knock on your campaign?
WALLACE: And how big an issue do you think this would be in a general election? Clearly they think it would be an issue. The idea that -- that you would need -- and you have reached out to social conservatives, many of whose votes you'd need -- but who might have concerns about your sexual orientation?
Authorities rescue Jennifer Stolpa and her infant son, Clayton, after Jennifer's husband, James, succeeds in reaching help, ending the family's eight-day ordeal after becoming lost in the snow-covered Nevada desert. 1998: In a new bid to expand health insurance, President Clinton unveils a proposal to offer Medicare coverage to hundreds of thousands of uninsured Americans between the ages of 55 to 64.
BENSON: Well one thing, Ed, is I am looking forward to the next presidential tweet. Because, I think there's a man in the Oval Office right now who is very happy to really dunk on fake news. And guess what? This is something apparently that BuzzFeed has brought on itself here. Because one of the things that I wrote today at townhall.com, I wrote about this whole thing and tried to be even handed about it.
WALLACE: What does he think is his authority to get involved in criminal cases under Article II?
But critics have noted that despite her refusal to seek the death penalty in multiple cases, Harris has defended capital punishment in court. In 2014, as California's attorney general, Harris asked an appeals court to reverse an earlier decision declaring California's death penalty unconstitutional, calling the ruling fundamentally misguided.
Connor took most of the heat for the incident, but Blair faced the wrath of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), who announced they would no longer use her as their spokeswoman against underage drinking.
The White House sharply denied it. Rudy Giuliani, the President's Attorney, last night said, I got -- if you want to believe Michael Cohen, I have a bridge in Brooklyn that you can buy. And a lot of people in the media laughed at that statement and said he's not really denying it. There's a more forceful statement from Rudy Giuliani today, sharply denying it, saying this was not true.
On Thursday, Gabbard said her views have changed significantly since then, and my record in Congress over the last 6 years reflects what is in my heart: A strong and ongoing commitment to fighting for LGBTQ+ rights.
WALLACE: Let me ask about women, because there's a long story in The Washington Post today.
But in an interview with The Associated Press, Davis' attorney Mat Staver said he does not attribute those arguments to Bevin, but to the attorneys who represent him. Those attorneys, Palmer G. Vance II and William M. Lear Jr., are the same ones who represented former Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear on the case before Bevin took office.
The 20th century gender war was fought largely in the workplace and on campuses; the 21st century's battleground is the traditional family. According to Hirshman, failure to deconstruct that one institution is the explanation for feminism's failures elsewhere.
I agree with Ruth Bader Ginsburg, that's who I agree with, Biden said before changing the subject to electability.
But up next, one of the Democratic front runners, Pete Buttigieg, joins us to discuss the upcoming contest in Nevada and South Carolina, and whether he can build on his early momentum straight through Super Tuesday.
Again, let me repeat, drug trafficking, human trafficking, gun trafficking, sanctuary cities, Texas versus Azar, eldercare now we do (ph), elder fraud we're doing.
BENSON: Well, look as someone who is actually planning his own same-sex marriage right now, and by the way you guys were totally right, it is so ludicrously expensive. I welcome the Congresswoman's change of heart on this issue. And I think when you feel passionately about something and someone comes over to your side, you should celebrate that and thank them.
A grassroots petition signed by thousands of fans convinced the pageant to change the rules and let the Miss Canada compete.
Then, there are two new front runners in the Democratic race.
HENRY: Marie, do you see it that way, number one and those broaden (ph) out in 2020. There's obviously a lot of candidates already in, more coming as well. You see Joe Biden, who is largely seen as, oh the left will love him but now you hear people whispering, well, he didn't treat Anita Hill that well when he was Senate Judiciary Chairman. Maybe someone on the left won't be happy with that.
That purpose is not vindicated if the offending office (the Rowan County Clerk's Office) suffers no liability, Vance wrote. Indeed, there is little to deter the Rowan County Clerk's Office from developing policies that violate the Kentucky or United States Constitutions.
WALLACE: There's been a war of words over the past week certainly between the president and former New York City --
HUCKABEE: Well, and that's not the President's fault. Let me tell you what would have been dangerous and if he had done this, the President would have been culpable. If he'd have waited till they got to Afghanistan and then taken the Air Force plane away, then they could have complained. But he did them the favor by telling them they weren't going to be able to use it before they ever got to the airport and I think that's incredibly appropriate because they need to be here.
Bevin has been a staunch supporter of Davis, who spent five days in jail for refusing a court order to issue marriage licenses following the historic U.S. Supreme Court ruling that effectively legalized gay marriage. Davis even switched parties, registering as a Republican because she said the Democratic Party abandoned her. But now, Davis and Bevin will oppose each other in federal court on Thursday as lawyers argue who should have to pay for the lawsuit that stemmed from Davis' actions.
Gabbard then also blasted Massachusetts' passage of same-sex marriage legislation, making it the first in the nation to recognize gay marriage. Speaking on behalf of the Alliance for Traditional Marriage and Values, a group headed by her father, she said the Massachusetts marriage law would cause a ripple effect across the country.
Only Davis refused to comply with the law as was her obligation and as required by the oath of office she took, Bevin attorney Palmer G. Vance II wrote in a brief filed with the court.
Judge Vaughan Walker has surprised just about everyone with his unorthodox handling of the Prop. 8 trial.
The crowd erupted in applause before O'Rourke further explained.
Like Gillibrand, the 46-year-old O'Rourke previously served in the House of Representatives, where he built a reputation as a moderate Democrat willing to reach bipartisan compromise -- even though, unlike Gillibrand, he represented a heavily Democratic district. O'Rourke has not formally announced that he is running for president, but is widely considered a potential contender.
The Guardians of the Galaxy actor posted a collage of photos of Schwarzenegger along with a caption celebrating her 29th birthday.
PHOENIX MAN IN CAPITOL RIOT DRESSED IN HORNS, BEARSKIN HEADDRESS IS ARRESTED, CHARGED
But we're not friends just because we love weddings. Barronelle and I both have been forced into long, hard legal battles. We didn't start these fights, but we're at the center of a national conversation about the First Amendment and the rights of creative professionals.
Senator McConnell has restated his commitment to filling the vacancies and has maintained that this is a Senate priority. It's time for Democrats to end the bullying and smear campaigns and confirm the judges, Severino added.
She served as the district attorney from 2004 until 2011, when she became California's attorney general. She was first elected to the Senate – where she serves on the Judiciary, Intelligence, Homeland Security and Budget Committees – in 2016.
HENRY: Let's let Jessica get in here.
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y., SENATE MINORITY LEADER: This President just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis.
This is a rush transcript from Fox News Sunday, February 16, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.
[Ed. note: I nominate you, Ms. Barnes! You sound like a most sensible human being, indeed.]
Last month, the group caused the Hallmark Channel to initially pull a Zola commercial featuring two brides kissing during a same-sex wedding ceremony.
So one can't help but wonder, with the breach this massive, will Democrats be forced to finally change those talking points we've heard throughout the shutdown?
How well is this setting up for Bernie Sanders to be the Democratic nominee?
Donna, as we've been saying, Mayor Bloomberg rising in the polls, news stories coming out, old tapes coming out about his record on race and, as we've said several times, a -- a big story, a takeout in The Washington Post today about his -- and you can see it there, about his long history of sexist comments going back decades at his company and women saying that they believed he created a hostile workplace.
We're both quiet, Christian business owners who were asked to use our talents to create custom art celebrating a view of marriage that contradicts our faith. We both believe that marriage is sacred and that God designed it as a union between one man and one woman. But when we politely declined to participate in celebrating something we didn't believe, we both found ourselves targeted by the government.
In fact, all judges have beliefs and personal habits which intersect from time to time with the matters in dispute before them. We do not require judges to be blank slates without a personal life. Judges are not automatons.
HENRY: Joining me now, Corey Lewandowski, he's the former Trump 2016 Campaign Manager of course and Jake MacCoby former Speechwriter for Attorney General Loretta Lynch. I appreciate you both coming in.
She also noted that Article 6 of the Constitution says there shall be no religious test for any seeking to serve.
They're going to want a religious wedding, said the insider. I know that Chris does, and I assume that she does, too. God is going to be a part of this marriage.
Jessica said she first reminded her father that his guest wasn't on the list, before thinking about the bigger picture.
But that is not the bias that has received too little attention.
Beyond voting rights, critics point to an amicus brief Brasher filed on behalf of Alabama that opposed federally mandated marriage equality in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case, arguing that Sexual relationships between men and women – and only such relationships – have the ability to provide children with both their biological mother and their biological father in a stable family unit. Brasher would also not explicitly say that Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court case that mandated public schools be racially integrated, was correctly decided.
Rival Pete Buttigieg – who at 38 is the youngest candidate in the White House race – once again targeted Biden and some of the other candidates on the debate stage with years of political experience in the nation's capital.
WALLACE: I didn't say he didn't. I'm saying, what does he think is his authority?
Attorney Bradley Benbrook, who filed the lawsuit challenging the law, said Harris was suggesting the right to free speech is OK except when it's about guns because guns are bad.
In 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, recently asked to withdraw that plea and is still awaiting sentencing. Meantime, the Justice Department says it's no longer pursuing a case against former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.
She worked as a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, California in the 1990s at a time when violent crime in Oakland was rising, according to The New York Times. She worked for the San Francisco city attorney before she was elected – twice – as the city's district attorney.
Gillibrand, who announced she was planning a presidential run on Tuesday night, boasted in 2009 about receiving a 100 percent A rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA) and said she kept two guns under her bed. She was also a member of the conservative Democratic Blue Dog coalition when she represented New York's rural 20th congressional district in the House.
AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… But remember: Enforcement followed by legalization is not just the political thing to do. It is the right thing to do — an act both of national generosity and national interest. It has long been the best answer to the immigration conundrum. It remains so. – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) wrote in the Washington Post January 31, 2013
In years past, she several times referred to LGBTQ activists as homosexual extremists, a view that echoes that of her father, Mike Gabbard, whom a New Yorker profile of the congresswoman described as having long been Hawaii's leading opponent of the gay-rights movement, an energetic and often brusque activist who stood ever ready to denounce what he called 'the radical homosexual agenda.'
Fox News: Democrats once said the so-called BRIDGE Act was urgently needed to protect young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. But now that President Trump has offered to essentially include it as part of a compromise to re-open shuttered government agencies, those same Democrats are rejecting it -- unwilling to trade border wall funding for the immigrant protections they have long sought. … While the Democratic leadership in Congress has come out against the compromise, they are facing some pressure to deal. The editorial board of the Washington Post over the weekend called on Democrats to come back to the table. In an editorial titled 'Make a deal. Save the dreamers,' the paper argued Trump 'should not be rewarded for having taken the government hostage' but said Trump's offer to compromise 'should be welcomed.'
As California's attorney general, Harris refused to defend Proposition 8, a constitutional amendment passed by the state's voters in 2008 which would have barred same-sex marriage.

We've seen [people] who may held a particular view and evolved to a place of acceptance, but rarely have we seen someone who was so actively and vehemently and viscerally against LGBTQ equality and acceptance, said Zeke Stokes, the vice president of programs at GLAAD, one of the most prominent LGBTQ advocacy groups, in an interview with Fox News. [Gabbard] was someone who worked so actively against our community when the stakes were so high.
Warren up next - The State: The U.S. senator from Massachusetts announced in an email Sunday she will hold an event in South Carolina's capital this week. It is the latest step in Warren's potential 2020 presidential campaign, following 'the launch of her exploratory committee,' according to the email. Warren will attend a 'Columbia Organizing Event,' on Wednesday, her press office said in the email. The event will be held at Columbia College, and 'is open to the public,' the email stated. Tickets for Warren's event can be reserved online. In addition to making tickets available, Warren's press office said it is also looking for volunteers to 'help' at the event, per the website. … Warren has already visited New Hampshire and Iowa since launching her exploratory committee, the Associated Press reported.

Danielle was stripped of her Miss Great Britain 2006 title when it was revealed that she had posed for Playboy and had dated one of the judges during the time of the pageant.
HENRY: OK, let Charlie jump in here as well and then we'll get to the, Governor, Charlie. Weigh in on that controversy, but I also want to get to the bigger question tonight which is how can Democrats continue to say this is a man-made crisis by the President at the border when you see those pictures of over 300 Central Americans breaking their way into America?
Here in Nevada, for example, we've got over 100 organizers on the ground, volunteers as we speak getting ready to go out and talk to fellow Nevadans in a state that looks to the future and in a state where I'm encountering a lot of workers concerned about how these political decisions are going to affect them. Whether it's workers who are concerned about health care and how to preserve the health care choice that is so important to them, people concerned about immigration reform and wanting to know that we're seriously going to get something done. And a lot of people looking to the future worried about climate.
FOLDS: That's the Chris Wallace song.
My career as a prosecutor was marked by fierce opposition to the death penalty while still upholding the law and a commitment to fixing a broken criminal justice system, Harris said in a 2018 Facebook post.
Missing from the list of re-nominated judges, for now, were three conservatives the White House has said it will install on the Ninth Circuit without first seeking what's known as a blue slip, or an opinion, from California senators Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Harris.
•War on Poverty! President Lyndon Baines Johnson launched the War on Poverty in 1964. SNAP, TANF, VISTA, and other tax-fueled acronyms became costly beads on the left's collective social-spending rosary.
The Steyer and Yang campaigns are essentially throwing Hail Marys in New Hampshire after dismal finishes in Iowa. They'll battle for votes with other flagging campaigns that did not qualify for the New Hampshire debate.
What these numbers don't tell is that in Los Angeles, 70% of violent crime victims are either Black or Hispanic and that 81% of the reported violent crime suspects are either Black or Hispanic, the league said.
America has moved on and we should have politics of belonging that welcomes everybody. That's what the American people are for. And I am saddened for what the Republican Party has become if they embrace that kind of homophobic rhetoric.
COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER, TRUMP CAMPAIGN: Well, look, this bud -- this BuzzFeed story is completely crazy. The fact that Michael Cohen has any credibility left to even be named as a potential source of the story should give everybody pause. This is an individual who's admitted to lying to Congress, who's admitted to embezzling his now a convicted felon, who's facing significant amount of jail time.
Now, parents can no longer trust Hallmark because Hallmark is no longer allowing parents to be the primary educators when it comes to sex and sexual morality, One Million Moms said at the time.
HENRY: Harry, I appreciate you coming in.
WALLACE: I want to talk about how this race is beginning to shape up because after Tuesday it is beginning to shape up.
How can you interfere in an organization you oversee? It's rhetorical. You can't.
George Herbert Walker Bush marries Barbara Pierce at the First Presbyterian Church in Rye, N.Y. 1968: A surgical team at Stanford University School of Medicine in Palo Alto, Calif., led by Dr. Norman Shumway performs the first U.S. adult heart transplant, placing the heart of a 43-year-old man in a 54-year-old patient. (The recipient would die 15 days later.)
WALLACE: But, Kellyanne, candidate Donald Trump supported what Bloomberg did with stop-and-frisk. Here he is in the first debate in 2016 with Hillary Clinton.

And look, here's the very important part, Ed. I think I have testified in front of Congress more than any other staff from the campaign. I've been very open about it. I've volunteered. I've been in front of the House twice and the Senate once. Never ever did the White House asked for me to present my testimony ahead of time. Never ever did anybody asked me to say something that wouldn't -- wasn't anything other than the truth and I'd had candidly no communication with them. So this story is just cannot be true because Michael Cohen is borderline crazy.
WALLACE: The attorney general, who's been a close ally of Mr. Trump, says he won't be bullied, while the president says he has the right to intervene even in cases like the one involving his long-time advisor, Roger Stone.
This is a state that is in many ways reflective of the future of America and I'm really excited to be on the ground here working to earn that support in the week that remains.
CONWAY: Article II provides our president, yes, ladies and gentlemen, including President Trump vast powers. And the president is making a point, and the Attorney General Bill Barr is backing him up on this, that he has not interfered in any criminal case.
The Knights of Columbus does not have the authority to take personal political positions on behalf of all of its approximately two million members, Buescher wrote. If confirmed, I will apply all provisions of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges regarding recusal and disqualification.
As an appellate advocate, Judge Brasher argued three times before the Supreme Court and seventeen times before the Eleventh Circuit, Severino said in a statement to Fox News Tuesday morning. Yet despite Brasher's impressive credentials and experience, the left persists in its sad and tiresome smear campaign against President Trump's outstanding nominees.

BUTTIGIEG: Well, I am in a faithful, loving, committed marriage. I'm -- I'm proud of my marriage. And I'm proud of my husband. And I'm not going to be lectured on family values from the likes of Rush Limbaugh or anybody who supports Donald J. Trump as the moral as well as political leader of the United States.

My father's timing added a layer of terrible sadness to what had been a joyous time. For a long time, I harbored a lot of resentment about the way he told me the family I knew was over, she said, according to the DailyMail.
The ABC News moderators threw Buttigieg against a wall on his time as the South Bend mayor, noting, over his objections, that the rate of black arrests for drug possession increased after he took office.
Before Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage, Harris was a champion for marriage equality.

In a new bid to expand health insurance, President Clinton unveils a proposal to offer Medicare coverage to hundreds of thousands of uninsured Americans between the ages of 55 to 64. 2001: With Vice President Al Gore presiding in his capacity as president of the Senate, Congress formally certifies George W. Bush the winner of the bitterly contested 2000 presidential election.
CONWAY: President Obama spoke up in the Freddie Gray case in Baltimore. President George Herbert Walker Bush, Bush 41, I think commented on the case in L.A., probably the Rodney King case.
CONWAY: Well, he is -- the president is toying with everybody by saying, oh, had he said something like that, had you unearthed a videotape like that of him, everybody would say racist, racist.
And the odds were 1.45 times greater that someone perceived as Black had force used against them during a traffic stop compared to someone perceived as White. The odds were 1.18 times greater for people perceived as Latino.
WALLACE: You were -- you've anticipated where we're going to go because one of the statements back and forth had to do with these comments that Michael Bloomberg made about stop and frisk in 2015. Take a look.
BUTTIGIEG: By this president, two kids experiencing bullying right now in this climate. We can do better and you don't have to be a diehard Democrat to know that we can do better when it comes to inclusion and equality in this country.
These high stakes have attracted a lot of attention to the California case of Perry v. Schwarzenegger. But not enough attention – in fact, almost none – has been paid to one very troubling aspect of the case.
During a stop in the early caucus state of Iowa last week, Brown argued that working-class voters who backed Trump have been betrayed, notably by the Republican-signed tax bill that benefited wealthy Americans more.

While they never will admit it, the now-former president secured numerous policy objectives that leftists advocate. However, Trump answered liberal prayers through conservative means. This, of course, makes him worse than Hitler, as Refuse Fascism organizer Sunsara Taylor told Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson.
WARREN: Everything that Bill Barr is about right now is just about loyalty to Donald Trump. And we just can't have that. He should not be the attorney general.
This is a rush transcript from The Story, January 18, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.
It is highly likely that federal judges will soon be tearing apart our U.S. Constitution in order to force same-sex marriage down the throats of the people of Hawaii and America, Gabbard said. The only way to protect traditional marriage in Hawaii and throughout our country, the only way to stop activist federal judges from rewriting our constitution, is by the passage of the Federal Marriage Amendment.
The liberal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, with a sprawling purview representing nine Western states, has long been a thorn in the side of the Trump White House, with rulings against the travel ban and limits on funding to sanctuary cities.
WARREN: What the attorney general has done, we should all be calling for the resignation of the attorney general. If he won't resign, remember, the attorney general can be impeached.
Whenever liberals see former President Donald J. Trump strolling through Palm Beach, they should disturb his peace just long enough to yell two words at him:
Governor Bevin does not believe that she has done so and continues to support Ms. Davis's actions, Pitt said. Our outside counsel have only argued, given the court's ruling, that if constitutional rights were violated, the taxpayers of Kentucky are not responsible to pay the ACLU's attorney fees.
HENRY: All right, quick point, Susan first.
But I think this controversy is still overblown in a sense that if the president were really intervening, we know what the president thinks. The president thinks Andrew McCabe probably should have been charged and he thinks Roger Stone is getting railroaded. If he were really intervening, the charges against Roger Stone would have been dropped and Andrew McCabe would be facing charges or maybe have already been tried by now.
I wouldn't change a single thing about my story, because I finally love who I am and I can forgive who I was, Jessica writes, according to the outlet.
If Buescher is 'unqualified' because of his Catholicism and affiliation with the Knights of Columbus, then President John F. Kennedy, and the 'liberal lion of the Senate' Ted Kennedy would have been 'unqualified' for the same reasons, she said.
The group called the ad irresponsible and tasteless.
Gabbard was a visible force against same-sex marriage, and in 2004 spearheaded a fight in the state against a same-sex union measure. To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, she said at the time. As Democrats, we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists.
Jessica's father then dropped the bombshell news just days before her wedding to Eric Johnson that he planned to bring a male model as his date.
Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, on Sunday decided to take a shot at the president – calling out Donald Trump and blaming the president for stirring a racial divide in the country, amid the mounting scandal over Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's medical school yearbook photo.
So that's why for a lot of people, not just Democrats, for a lot of Americans when they hear a denial from team Trump, it doesn't always ring true, and I think that is something that has been a problem. When you're a government spokesperson like I was as you mentioned, all you have is your word.
WALLACE: -- does the president think the McCabe case should be reopened and he should be prosecuted?
Battalions of commentators have wondered about his bizarre handling of the case, and many have attributed it to Walker's belief that it is unjust for the law to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples.
But four years later, after a court ordered Kentucky taxpayers to pay more than $222,000 in legal fees for the gay and straight couples who sued, outside lawyers for now Gov. Bevin say former Rowan County clerk Kim Davis broke the law and taxpayers should not have to collectively bear the financial responsibility for Davis' intransigence.
HENRY: Guy and Marie, I appreciate you both coming in and providing your insights as well. I have some other important guests here and we have them scheduled -- we were going to -- we're laughing because we're going to talk about some lighter stories in the news but this is big breaking news. Nan Hayworth, Susan Li and Mattie Duppler.
Some said they had been aware of talk about Gabbard's controversial remarks about gays, but were surprised to hear about the depth of her anti-LGBTQ views.
HENRY: So 30 seconds each, Jessica and Charlie, starting with Jessica. What do we -- can you expect from the President? Is there anything he can say tomorrow that will get Democrats to the table?
Biden hit back, siding with popular liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who has come out against Supreme Court expansion.
Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard on Thursday released a lengthy apology for her past activism and comments against gay marriage, saying her views have changed significantly since her outspoken protests of the early 2000s.
Then, this BuzzFeed report comes out a few days later suggesting there is a bombshell coming from Mueller. And now it looks like Mueller's office has put that in its track, to stop in its tracks tonight, Byron.
CONWAY: The president appreciates the fact that this Department of Justice and Attorney General Barr works on any number of issues at this White House that doesn't get any kind of coverage. Sanctuary cities, Texas versus Azar --
DUPPLER: It was decisive and so now we need to see the report. How long has the Special Counsel been going on and for how many months have we been promised an end to it.
WALLACE: The president tweeted right after that came out: Wow, Bloomberg is a total racist, and he expanded on that in a radio interview with Geraldo Rivera.
REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: The fact that they would leak the commercial -- that we were flying commercial isn't danger not only two us but two other people flying commercial. It is very irresponsible on the part of the President. We'll go again.
Roman Catholic bishops criticized on Friday President Biden's recent executive order on applying anti-discrimination protections to certain groups, arguing it didn't properly account for religious liberty and furthered false theories on human sexuality.
The White House on Tuesday announced the re-nomination of 51 federal judicial nominees left over from the previous Congress, kickstarting the administration's effort to install more conservative judges after GOP activists worried that such appointments had stalled.
One Million Moms called for the public to sign a petition urging Burger King to cancel the commercial, or at the very least, edit out the cuss word immediately.
Karlie Hay came under fire for controvesial tweets she made in 2013 and 2014 right after she was crowned Miss Teen USA 2016.
We have heard over and over again from Democrats, people on the left saying, why won't anyone stand up to President Trump? Why won't any of his people stand up to President Trump? Then Bill Barr does that with a brush back pitch that I think was needed and was correct, and people immediately jumped to the conclusion, well, it's fake, it's theater, it's not real.
The Leadership Conference cites several issues, chiefly Brasher's work to restrict voting rights, as reasons why it asked Senators to oppose the judge's nomination.
Notably, Harris declined to charge Steven Mnuchin, now President Trump's treasury secretary, for allegedly violating state foreclosure laws when he ran OneWest bank. Under his leadership, the bank foreclosed on more than 36,000 homes, according to The Hill.
The Arizona Republican Party will also meet to consider the censure of Republican Gov. Doug Ducey for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
I am the only one on this stage that has consistently won in red congressional districts – not once, not twice, but three times, she said.
Fox News' Caleb Parke, Gerren Keith Gaynor and the Associated Press contributed to this report.
The then-congressman said the legislation was needed to help speed up the hiring process and provide the CBP commissioner additional authorities to recruit and hire quality CBP officers and border patrol agents.
Many years ago I volunteered at my Son's elementary school (K-6) as what they called a 'Yard Teacher'. We were, quite simply, an adult presence on the playground during recess and lunch break to give the teachers a break and help keep mayhem to a minimum. The children would have their spats, they would come to us for a solution, we would help them work things out and they would quickly get back to business. In light of the present situation, I think the Executive and Legislative branches of our government are badly in need of a 'Yard Teacher'. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, 'Never have so few done so little for so many'. – Nancy Barnes, Moreno Valley, Calif.
Gabbard, 37, announced plans last week to seek the Democratic Party's nomination for president. Since then, her past statements have come under fire from Democrats and gay rights groups.
Jessica Simpson has provided readers of her new memoir with stunning admissions about her past substance abuse and becoming a victim of sexual assault. Now, a new revelation from her tell-all reveals details of a break in the bond she once shared with her dad.
WALLACE: There are plenty women who would say the same thing about Michael Bloomberg.
Conservative activists and religious groups, banding together under the name the Arlington Group, gathered in Washington this week to plot strategy. Some participants said they left with a White House commitment to fight for a constitutional amendment.
After praying about the situation with her husband, Barronelle knew she couldn't accept Rob's request. So she took him aside, held his hands, and explained her religious conflict. The two continued to talk, and she asked about his engagement story. Before he left, Barronelle referred Rob to three nearby florists she knew would do a good job for him. They hugged, and Barronelle hoped they would stay friends.

Consequences piling up across the country - Albuquerque Journal: The longest shutdown in history has left nine of the 15 major federal agencies without funding since Dec. 22, throwing government workers into furlough status, cutting pay to contractors and canceling previously scheduled projects. ADC, which provides security and conducts background checks for a variety of government agencies, has 350 employees in Albuquerque but it supports more than 2,600 workers nationwide.
All we ask and what we rightly expect is that judges put aside those things insofar as they might interfere with deciding a case fairly and in accord with the law.
[Ed. note: Take heart, Ms. Kenerson! You are far from alone. In fact, you are part of the largest segment of our electorate: unaffiliated voters. Like tens of millions of your fellow Americans, you're weighing your options and making your own choices.

Chief Eric Nuñez, president of the California Police Chiefs Association said police departments demand fair and impartial police services for the communities they serve, but said the state board's recommendations would require a significant additional funding source, time and legal issues that have not been properly identified or researched at this point.
HARF: Actually, Ed, I think a lot of Democrats did. And the people I talked to today and that I saw out there were saying, OK, if this is true, it's a big deal but we still need to wait for Bob Mueller. And the question at the end of the day is, is every single piece of that BuzzFeed story wrong, are some parts of it right but not the main parts?
WALLACE: Then there is -- I guess you have to call him the former frontrunner now, Joe Biden, who took it drubbing in Iowa, an even worse drubbing in New Hampshire and is now counting on the votes of minorities, Latinos, African-Americans in South Carolina and Nevada, to -- to rescue him.
I'm actually really sad that we couldn't build a bridge that could have provided a witness to the world of what unity amid diversity and disagreement could look like, Methodist Bishop Karen Oliveto, the denomination's first openly gay bishop, said.
The resolution will be up for consideration at the party's annual meeting on Jan. 23, according to the @AZGOP Twitter account.

WALLACE: No -- no brokered convention?
In 2017, the Judicial Council, the church's highest court, declared Oliveto's consecration was incompatible with church law. She was, however, allowed to remain as the resident bishop of the Mountain Sky Conference, which covers churches in Colorado, Montana, Utah, Wyoming and part of Idaho.
Less than half-an-hour after TV networks cut away from the Senate to dive into the ramifications of the body acquitting Trump, McConnell filed cloture on the nomination of Judge Andrew Brasher to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, a procedural step that moved the controversial nominee one step closer to confirmation. The Senate took the next step to confirming Brasher with a 46-41 cloture vote Monday, then confirmed him 52-43 on Tuesday.
Mattie, starting with you. What do you make of this news?
The Alliance for Traditional Marriage and Values also drew controversy for supporting so-called conversion gay therapy, which views homosexuality as a mental illness. More than a dozen states in the country have since outlawed or restricted the controversial practice.
HUCKABEE: Well, there's a better solution, and that is that there would be adults behaving like adults ought to behave in the Congress. They would recognize they're not going to get everything. The President is not going to get everything, but they ought to be able to sit down, work out a deal where they get DACA but they also get a real border security which they claim they all want but they really don't. If they did, they would have already done it. So let's get it done. There's no reason you can't.
WALLACE: Wait, pardoning is different. Wait. It's different, it's after the criminal process has been completed and clearly the --
What I will say is, of course it is extremely important to earn support from voters across the board. And when you look at the way that Latino voters here in Nevada know that they are under siege in this administration, talking to black voters who are sick and tired of the economic disempowerment among the injustices of systemic racism and looking for a president who can actually bring change to Washington and, more than anything, looking for a nominee who can defeat Donald Trump. We are ready to go out and have that conversation.
In years past, Gabbard referred to gay activists as homosexual extremists. Her father, Mike Gabbard, was known at the time as Hawaii's leading opponent of the gay-rights movement. Gabbard herself was a visible force against same-sex marriage, and in 2004 spearheaded a fight in the state against a same-sex union measure.
To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, she said at the time. As Democrats, we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists.
I think the President's advantage here is he's a businessman. He's pragmatic. And I think what he's going to try and do is get the best deal for the American people. And I think his approaches are bearing results. Keep in mind that it's been over 400 days since there's been a nuclear weapons test or missile test, that's results.
As state attorney general and previously a longtime San Francisco district attorney, Harris had the right credentials. But most of all, she was well suited to the new political realities of a one-party Golden State.
Brown has said some Democrats wrongly divide the party into its liberal base and working-class voters, chiefly those non-college-educated white voters who lifted Trump not just in Ohio, but also in swing states Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
KAMALA HARRIS' NEW BOOK PUBLISHED WITH PRAISE FOR 'LEADERSHIP' OF NOW-DISGRACED FORMER AIDE
Luke Goodrich, vice president and senior counsel at Becket, a religious liberty law firm, called it blatantly unconstitutional, adding it's also foolish because those groups provide billions of dollars in essential social services to their communities. Churches and ministries should be allowed to hold centuries-old beliefs without fear of government retribution.
1994: Figure skater Nancy Kerrigan is clubbed on the leg by an assailant at Detroit's Cobo Arena. (Four men, including the ex-husband of Kerrigan's rival, Tonya Harding, would go to prison for their roles in the attack. Harding would plead guilty to conspiracy to hinder prosecution, but deny any advance knowledge about the assault.)
Neomi Rao, the president's regulatory czar, who would take now-Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh's vacated seat on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, is on the list. Case Western University School of Law professor and Washington Post commentator Jonathan H. Adler wrote when Rao first joined the administration that Trump's selection of Rao suggests the administration is serious about regulatory reform, not merely reducing high-profile regulatory burdens.
While many Americans may relate to growing up in a conservative home, my story is a little different because my father was very outspoken, Gabbard said. He was an activist who was fighting against gay rights and marriage equality in Hawaii – and at that time, I forcefully defended him.
But, you know, let me pick up with you, Michael, on the point I was making with Mayor Buttigieg. You've got Bernie Sanders over here on the left and with Elizabeth Warren starting to fade, seeming to have a pretty clear shot in his path. And, meanwhile, you've got this center lane all clogged up with Buttigieg and Klobuchar and Biden and Bloomberg about to get into it.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We'll probably need another summit. We'll probably need -- or meeting. We could use a different term. But we'll probably need another one. We're probably -- I will say this. We're much further along than I would have thought.
President Trump signed the First Step Act criminal-reform bill, which freed some 3,100 such federal prisoners in fiscal year 2019. In FY 2021, expect another 8,700 similar returns to normal.
BRAZILE: Bernie Sanders is a strong, viable candidate with a lot of support out there.
And what we're most concerned about is making sure that the 35,000 rank- and-file FBI men and women who bravely do their job every day with integrity and fidelity and bravery don't -- aren't being put in that same big toxic stew with those, including Andy McCabe, who are at the top levels of the FBI in 2016 trying to prevent Donald Trump from being president.
BOOKER QUOTES THIS OLD TESTAMENT BIBLE VERSE TO DEFEND LGBTQ RIGHTS
New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, former Texas Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard are among the prominent Democrats whose fiery rhetoric little resembles their more moderate days off the national stage.
Additionally, Black individuals were searched at 2.5 times the rate of people perceived as White.
Texas-sized showdown shaping up between Castro and Beto - Dallas News: It's likely that former San Antonio mayor Julian Castro and former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke of El Paso will joust for the Democratic nomination for president, along with numerous contenders from across the country. Some analysts have dismissed Castro's chances. They point out that since his keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, his star has slipped…. Until he got into the presidential sweepstakes this month, Castro had been somewhat obscure since serving as Housing secretary in President Barack Obama's last term. Despite his low name recognition, Castro has strengths. He's currently the only major Latino in the contest. In the era of Donald Trump, where issues like building a wall along the nation's southern border with Mexico are dominant, Castro is a clear contrast to the sitting president.
On foreign policy, Steyer, Buttigieg and Biden got into a three-way dust-up that ended with both Steyer and Biden raising their voices.
When asked whether Buttigieg's answer was sufficient, Warren was terse.

POMPEO GETS SERIOUS ABOUT POSSIBLE SENATE RUN
Over the past six years in Congress, I have been fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to help work toward passing legislation that ensures equal rights and protections on LGBTQ+ issues, Gabbard said. Much work remains to ensure equality and civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ Americans and if elected president, I will continue to fight for equal rights for all.
Are they -- are they picking and choosing? Are they saying maybe one line in the story is not true but other parts are in fact true? And I'm reading it closely and it seems to me that second phrase there, about the characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office not being true is important.
As Chairman of the AZGOP she managed to turn Arizona blue in November for the first time since 1996, she told the Republic. Maybe she should be reminded that my husband never lost an Arizona election since his first win in 1982; he and Governor [Doug] Ducey are the last two Republicans to win statewide races in Arizona.
Mike Huckabee, I want to start with you because all this talk about security as I said at the top, I remember around Christmas I was asking Ted Lieu and other California Democrats, why haven't you spoken out about Officer Singh who was gunned down on Christmas night. He, Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein, many other California Democrats did not speak out about that. And yet now we hear all about a security around a plane.
