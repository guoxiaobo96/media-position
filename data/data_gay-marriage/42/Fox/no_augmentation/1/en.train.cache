Now, when I put on these sunglasses, suddenly the sun's glare is gone. Obviously, the sun has gone missing, but I wonder if Trump appreciated the sales pitch.

HUCKABEE: Well, and that's not the President's fault. Let me tell you what would have been dangerous and if he had done this, the President would have been culpable.

They probably never thought I had it. I can only say thank goodness they had it because otherwise I would have been falsely accused and it would have been sadly my word against them. But we had other people on that call. Think of this. I was going to do something wrong on a call where I know there are many people listening.

Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, already with $7 million in his campaign war chest, has been the presumptive GOP front-runner. But Reeves has trailed Hood in past and recent polling and is unpopular with some segments of the establishment state GOP and hard-line conservatives. Another Republican in the race, freshman state Rep. Robert Foster, a farmer from Hernando, lacks the name recognition and fundraising capacity of Reeves and Waller.

Typically, a media buyer receives a commission of about 15 percent of the cost for a media campaign. So if a campaign were to spend, say, $1,000,000 on television ads, the media buyer would pocket a $150,000 commission. But here's the kicker: the media buyer commission is not actually disclosed anywhere. Filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) only require disclosure of the bulk amount of the media buy. In this example, the FEC report will only disclose the $1,000,000 media buy.

Now, House Democrats have Barr squarely in their sights.
Gabbard was a visible force against same-sex marriage, and in 2004 spearheaded a fight in the state against a same-sex union measure. To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, she said at the time.

She has no idea what it says. She was forced to do that. You know why? She wouldn't have done it, but she did nothing. So, now she can say, I signed something. She is obsessed with impeachment. She has done nothing. She's going to go down as one of the worst Speakers in the history of our country. Now, in all fairness, she's hurting our country.

There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone or any institution, any organization in America, that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us, he said. So as president, we're going to make that a priority, and we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.
GUTFELD: Yes, you're right though because the modern progressive movement is eliminating the lubrication that keeps people from killing each other.

COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER, TRUMP CAMPAIGN: Well, look, this bud -- this BuzzFeed story is completely crazy.

She was born and raised here, she did her first baptismal here.

And above all, a country where normal people with an average education who grew up in no place special can get married, and have happy kids, and repeat unto the generations. A country that actually cares about families, the building block of everything.

Beto O'Rourke of El Paso will joust for the Democratic nomination for president, along with numerous contenders from across the country. Some analysts have dismissed Castro's chances. They point out that since his keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, his star has slipped…. Until he got into the presidential sweepstakes this month, Castro had been somewhat obscure since serving as Housing secretary in President Barack Obama's last term. Despite his low name recognition, Castro has strengths. He's currently the only major Latino in the contest.

Our leaders rarely mention any of this. They tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. Please. It's based on laws that the Congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. It worked well for those people. They did increase their economic advantage. But for everyone else, it came at a big cost. Unfairness is profoundly divisive. When you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you.

Julian Castro still lacking support from Hispanic Caucus - Politico: Julián Castro is the lone Latino candidate in the crowded 2020 Democratic primary field. He's uniquely positioned to capture the support of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which has more members than ever and more clout. Yet so far, he's come up dry. Just one of the 38-member group has publicly endorsed Castro's bid since his campaign announcement last month — his twin brother, Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), who chairs the CHC and also serves as chairman of Julián's campaign. It isn't personal, according to interviews with CHC members. The reluctance so far to commit to Castro, they say, is largely due to home-state loyalties or political caution in a race that's still taking shape.

Bain Capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: Take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. Romney became fantastically rich doing this.

Whenever liberals see former President Donald J. Trump strolling through Palm Beach, they should disturb his peace just long enough to yell two words at him:
HENRY: Man-made crisis. OK. For his part, the President continues to insist Democrats get back to the bargaining table to reopen the government and secure that Southern Border. But so far Speaker Nancy Pelosi will not budge. Instead today she blasted the President for putting her own security at risk when he grounded air Pelosi canceling that seven-day excursion the White House dismissed as nothing more than a Pelosi P.R. stunt.

I mean the criminal justice reform. You look at criminal justice reform Laura, and you say, the Obama administration sat there with Joe Biden who actually wrote the crime bill that locked up a mass incarcerating millions of black men, taking the fathers out of our homes. How can that not upset black America when President Obama sits in office for eight years and doesn't release these folks. Why does Donald Trump have to give Alice Johnson clemency? I mean these things go on and on again and you can't argue the facts and the facts are that Donald Trump has passed more policies for black folks than any President since Lincoln.

But watching everything play out over the last 72 hours or so, it's clear that the Democrat machine is trying desperately to claw back power. Claw back power from the radicals that they let run free in Washington for the last year.

We're picking our battles more carefully. Earlier in our relationship, I was willing to go to the mat about anything -- chores, church, restaurant choices -- you name it. So much of it wasn't worth it, and even if it was worth it (like working through wedding budgeting) we went about it the wrong way. Being willing to give up the fight -- or at least the way we fight -- reduces stress, brings peace, makes our relationship more loving, and with all of that, naturally strengthens our marriage.

TRUMP: I said we built one of the world's most expensive airport facilities anywhere in the world. I mean I wish we had it in New York. I wish we had it in Washington. We build runways that are 15,000 feet long at LaGuardia, they're 7000 feet long. In fact, I think they're 20,000 feet long over there and deep thick concrete and steel. Nobody ever built runways like this. OK, it's way overbuilt, but that's OK. But we have billions of dollars into that. I said if we leave, you've got to pay us. If we leave, you have to pay us for embassies, you have to pay us for the money we put in.
It's just a lot of things that go into it. It's not a simple answer, he told Entertainment Tonight. People ask me the question and they expect this, 'Boom, this is why,' and I can't give them that, because that's not how it is ... That's just the facts.
Internalizing all this will not be easy for Republican leaders. They'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. They'll likely lose donors in the process.

And yet, and here's the bewildering and infuriating part, those very same affluent married people, the ones making virtually all the decisions in our society, are doing pretty much nothing to help the people below them get and stay married.

GUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM: No, it could be a gut check moment coming up for the Democratic Party, right? Here is a New York billionaire with potential vulnerabilities on race and sexism, right, which sounds familiar if you're a Democrat, and Mike Bloomberg is the human embodiment of money in politics. All right, this is a party that at least pretends to abhor the influence of money in politics and here's someone who is doing the closest thing you can do to buying a nomination. That combination, is that going to sit well with the Democratic electric? Are they willing to swallow hard and go for it because they think that he's got the money and maybe the moderation relatively to beat President Trump? That's a decision they're going to have to make, but there are no shortage of ironies here.

This occurred when he was just starting out on the Strip. So when I'm hearing all of this with him, I'm crying with him. I was going, We have to do something, we have to say something.

CTV: A teen who set out for a day of sledding with friends on Ryan Street Hill found himself on a collision course with a massive rat. Seventeen-year-old Cole Salsman had his GoPro camera recording as he slid down the hill with dozens of other kids who were out of class because of widespread school cancellations Tuesday. 'We hitting the ramp boys?' Salsman is heard asking as they speed toward a bump. But it wasn't a ramp he hit seconds later – it was the rat. In the video, the critter is seen deftly dodging another sled before colliding with Salsman. 'I thought somebody's toboggan snapped and a piece of plastic flew my way,' he said. Shrieks from nearby sledders can be heard as the rodent ricochets off the sled, lands in the snow, and scurries away to safety. While getting a rat in your lap might ruin someone's day of fun, Salsman took it in stride. 'I think it made it better,' he said. No word on whether the rat was injured in the collision.

'You know I've been in this fight for a long time,' Biden said in remarks to a Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast in Washington. 'I haven't always been right, I know we haven't always done things the right way. But I've always tried.' Biden made no mention of the 1994 crime bill he authored, a law that's sparked criticism from progressive activists for its strict sentencing requirements. Biden had long touted his work on the issue, even recently as vice president since the legislation included gun control measures that have since expired.

And frankly, this was a lackluster even tonight. This should have been the high point of Biden's campaign. It's certainly the most important and consequential rally of this primary season on the Democratic side. It didn't feel like it at Gilley's tonight.

AFP: Kyrgyzstan is gearing up to introduce legislation that would oblige its president to wear a national pointed hat on diplomatic trips following a national uproar. On Monday a parliamentary committee supported the proposal -- which will also see fines levied for insults to the felt hat -- the first step towards the legislation's introduction for a general parliamentary vote. The bill is a result of a furore that erupted in late 2017 when a dog was photographed wearing an Ak-Kalpak hat at a dog show. The headpiece, which is usually white, has a special place in the Central Asian country, revered so much that it has its own national day. The four-panelled hat symbolises 'the peaks of the magnificent Kyrgyz mountains, forever snow-capped,' a former presidential advisor, Topchubek Turgunaliyev, told AFP last year.

Howard Dean to head Dems' new voter database - AP: Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez is declaring a major victory ahead of the 2020 presidential election, with the help of one of his most well-known predecessors. Howard Dean, the one-time presidential candidate, former Vermont governor and ex-DNC chairman, is set to head a new data exchange operation that Democrats hope puts them back on par with Republicans in the never-ending race to use voter data to drive Americans to the polls. State party leaders on Wednesday approved the arrangement hammered out by DNC officials, state party leaders and Democratic consultants. … The arrangement would allow the national party, state parties and independent political action groups on the left to share voter data in real time during campaigns. … When a presidential campaign spends big money on consumer data to update voter profiles, the new information would go into the central file as well.

All right, this is a party that at least pretends to abhor the influence of money in politics and here's someone who is doing the closest thing you can do to buying a nomination. That combination, is that going to sit well with the Democratic electric? Are they willing to swallow hard and go for it because they think that he's got the money and maybe the moderation relatively to beat President Trump? That's a decision they're going to have to make, but there are no shortage of ironies here.

WOODSON: Well, first of all, it's just -- I bristle every time because it's so insulting.

The answer used to be obvious. The overriding goal for America is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. But is that still true?

Mark Kelly could face some opposition to Arizona Senate run - HuffPo: Democratic operatives are ecstatic about Mark Kelly's decision to run against appointed Arizona Republican Sen. Martha McSally in 2020. He's a dream candidate… However, the party's left wing is holding off on the celebrations for now. Public records show Kelly voted in the 2012 GOP primary while living in Texas, meaning he likely cast a ballot for either Mitt Romney or one of the host of conservatives running against President Barack Obama and either Ted Cruz or David Dewhurst for Senate. (A Kelly spokesperson said he voted for Obama in the general election.) And progressives both in the state and nationally have long been preparing for Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Latino veteran of the war in Afghanistan and member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, to run for the seat. Gallego is still considering a bid, potentially creating an ideological clash with Kelly.

Well, you see my friends, this isn't your daddy's liberalism, where it was all about love and peace and live and let live. This is kind of the old school, New England puritanism with a radical twist.

Brasher also didn't receive what's called a blue slip, from Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., the traditional name for approval from a judge's home-state senators.

Aspire to the Heavens was published in 1969. It was a triumph, she recalled in her memoir Kitchen Privileges, but also a folly. The publisher was sold near the book's release and received little attention. She regretted the title and learned that some stores placed the book in religious sections. Her compensation was $1,500, minus commission. (The novel was reissued decades later, far more successfully, as Mount Vernon: A Love Story).
MICHAEL ANTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: Well, the fundamental problem the Democrats have is they have a big gap between enthusiasm and electability. So it seems like all the energy on the basis is for Bernie or for somebody on the left side of the party, but then you have an establishment and a leadership in the party who really worries that going that far to the left just guarantees a Trump re-election and we need some more moderate person to play nationwide, but they can't settle on who that more moderate person is.

TRUMP: Well, I think you have to for the sake of the office. I would love everybody to testify. I like Mick to testify. I like Mike Pompeo to testify. I like Rick Perry to testify. I want everybody, but there are things you can't do from the standpoint of Executive Privilege. You have to maintain that. So, we'll see where it all goes. But especially, a National Security Adviser, you can't have him explaining all of your statements about national security concerning Russia, China, North Korea, everything. We just can't do that. I think for the good of the office. Look, Nancy Pelosi will go down as probably the least successful Speaker of the House in the history of our nation. She has done nothing. The only thing she's done is she finally get done one of the best trade deals our country has ever made, the USMCA. That's with Mexico and Canada. But I did that. She doesn't even know what it says. She has no idea what it says. She was forced to do that. You know why? She wouldn't have done it, but she did nothing. So, now she can say, I signed something. She is obsessed with impeachment. She has done nothing. She's going to go down as one of the worst Speakers in the history of our country. Now, in all fairness, she's hurting our country. She's very bad for our country and she's become a crazed lunatic.

I'm probably more into helicopter parents than I would have imagined, she told the entertainment news outlet. And it also makes me think that I'll never regret checking on my children or spending that extra time to look after them or watch them. I'll never regret it.

Obviously, there is no comparison to this president and the way that he has treated and talked about women and people of color and continues to do so to this day. But we, in our party, hold ourselves to the highest standard. And it is going to be critical for us to have a nominee who cannot authentically lead and who can show growth on these challenges.
Washington state – where the pair live and where Amazon is based – is a community property state, as opposed to an equitable distribution state, like New York. In a community property state, all assets acquired during the marriage are considered marital property and subject to a 50-50 split. That means MacKenzie Bezos could be entitled to half of the entrepreneur's $137 billion fortune.

ARROYO: You know, it was not raised that through these two away. It was rude that ticked the royal family off. This is the duke and duchess sucking up to the celebrities. That's all they've ever done. Oprah has come out to support them. But look, if you want to trade on your title, you have to live up to the office. And the royals are not just liberties. There are public functions and responsibilities. But my take on this is the Queen, as the president rightly said, 65 years on the throne, she has taken them to World War II, the Falklands, Diana, Brexit. Meghan Markle is hardly a challenge for this lady. She will survive and so will the royals.

NIAC has consistently condemned the Iranian government's shameful track record of politically motivated detentions - including arbitrarily arresting dual citizens, holding them on spurious charges, subjecting them to cruel conditions, and using them as bargaining chips in negotiations, he added. Such practices are inhumane, illegal, and often in the service of agendas that seek to preserve U.S.-Iran hostility. It is absolutely critical that the U.S. government not follow suit and instead observe the core values of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.

Typically, a media buyer receives a commission of about 15 percent of the cost for a media campaign. So if a campaign were to spend, say, $1,000,000 on television ads, the media buyer would pocket a $150,000 commission. But here's the kicker: the media buyer commission is not actually disclosed anywhere. Filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) only require disclosure of the bulk amount of the media buy. In this example, the FEC report will only disclose the $1,000,000 media buy. And as for the fact that Jane Sanders is the spouse of a politician, she is only required to disclose that she earns more than $1,000 from her businesses.

INGRAHAM: Fascinating, Joe Biden supporters telling our own Raymond Arroyo what they really think about Bernie, and some of it is ugly. And it suggests a huge problem down the road for whoever gets the nomination, which famed pollster John Zogby warned about in an op-ed today. Democrats in 2020 face a serious dilemma, if not a crisis. We can expect a real war for the nomination, and it will not be pretty. If Sanders outright wins the nomination, do not expect establishment figures and consultants to display support and party unity.

This can be a theologically troubling passage for those who believe in the omnipotence and omniscience of Jesus. Why would Jesus ask the blind man what he saw if He is all-powerful and all-knowing? Jesus would often ask a question not so much to glean information as to impart revelation. Jesus forces the man to acknowledge the work of God on him but also to confront its lack of completion. He wanted him to come back for another touch. Jesus touched the man's eyes again, and he received clear vision. Once more Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.

Let's call the President's tax cut what it is: a middle-class tax hike to line the pockets of already wealthy corporations and the 1 percent,' she said in a tweet. Harris was apparently reacting to information from initial returns that the average refund is down approximately 8 percent. But, as fact checkers quickly pointed out, the size of one's refund has more to do with how much was withheld for taxes over the course of the year rather than one's overall tax burden.

I mean for folks to really deny the fact that Donald Trump has helped black people as much as he has, the policies, Laura. I mean the man gave HBCUs long-term funding when the administrations before him would never do that. They made these black schools continue to come back and beg and beg for money.

I also don't believe feminism ever ceased being judgmental. Nevertheless, the article is a fascinating glimpse into gender feminism's struggle to reinvent itself. The broad themes of this reinvention are: a rejection of the 'c-word' (choice) as the standard of feminism; the substitution of correct choices as feminism's touchstone; a renewed focus on deconstructing the traditional family; and, a reaching backward into the golden age of feminism in order to understand and correct mistakes.
But first, Republican leaders will have to acknowledge that market capitalism is not a religion. Market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster. You'd have to be a fool to worship it. Our system was created by human beings for the benefit of human beings. We do not exist to serve markets. Just the opposite. Any economic system that weakens and destroys families is not worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.

AZAR: That is such colossal nonsense. Listen, back in the beginning of January when we were informed by the Chinese that they were facing this novel virus, we are standing up the National Security Council apparatus. I'm briefing the president of the United States. We are getting scientific advisors in there with the president. We are actually served doing surveillance of people coming in from Wuhan.

And those same people attacked President Trump for taking those actions, and now the rest of the country is thanking him because he bought us time by doing those things.

He actually genuinely respects black America and that's why I view him as the first black president. I respect that.

But one of the things they asked was why did the Chinese government clamp down so hard? Was there something special about this virus? The report was the reason was the holiday, the Chinese New Year was coming, and during the new year, apparently everybody travels, and they wanted to get it under control before the holiday, so they clamped down quickly. They got it under control. The holiday came, people traveled. It did not spread. They did exactly what they needed to do. And then we need to calm down. It is here, it's mild, and the press needs to shut up. It's really getting to be a problem.
In nearly all the cases, the girls were the younger person in the relationship. In 149 instances, the adult was older than 40, and in 28 cases the adult was over 50, the committee found.

But his amicus brief -- or friend of the court brief -- put him at odds with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who wrote in a dissent that the VRA provision was still relevant because Alabama had been found to violate the VRA more often than almost all other states between 1982 and 2005.

New gubernatorial candidate joins Mississippi race - [Mississippi] Clarion Ledger: Retired longtime state Supreme Court Chief Justice Bill Waller Jr., son of a former governor, is planning a gubernatorial run this year as a Republican, sources involved in his planning confirmed Wednesday. One of Waller's main campaign themes is expected to be that he is the only Republican candidate who can beat Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood — who remains very popular in an otherwise deep red state — in the race for governor. Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, already with $7 million in his campaign war chest, has been the presumptive GOP front-runner. But Reeves has trailed Hood in past and recent polling and is unpopular with some segments of the establishment state GOP and hard-line conservatives. Another Republican in the race, freshman state Rep. Robert Foster, a farmer from Hernando, lacks the name recognition and fundraising capacity of Reeves and Waller.

He was still in my house at the time, she said. I was upstairs in my bedroom when I opened this message.

Marriage starts out with grand vision – a shared way of seeing what you hope your future together will be. It is exciting and full of possibilities. But for many, marriage becomes filled with problems we never anticipated and for which we do not have the tools to navigate.

ZOGBY: He may very well, and he could do worse. She is a good candidate, period. Let's not underestimate Joe Biden, however.

And Joe was still vice president under a very popular Democratic president, and someone, Barack Obama, who is still very popular among independents as well. So I wouldn't underestimate Joe Biden's story going into this. But with a good running mate, I think it will be a competitive race anyway. The numbers just show it would be competitive race, Biden versus Trump.

We have tens of thousands of ISIS prisoners. We've killed most of their fighters. We've gotten rid of ISIS. Now they come back and we take care of it. Other people should take care of it.

After working as a hotel switchboard operator (Tennessee Williams was among the guests she eavesdropped on) and a flight attendant for Pan American, she married Warren Clark, the regional manager of Capital Airways, in 1949. Throughout the 1950s and into the '60s, she raised the children, studied writing at New York University and began getting stories published. Some drew upon her experiences at Pan American. One story which appeared in The Saturday Evening Post, Beauty Contest at Buckingham Palace, imagined a pageant featuring Queen Elizabeth II, Jackie Kennedy and Princess Grace of Monaco. But by the mid-60s, the magazine market for fiction was rapidly shrinking and her husband's health was failing; Warren Clark died of a heart attack in 1964.

Harris fact-checked over 'nonsensical' claim Trump hiked taxes on middle class - Fox News: Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a 2020 presidential hopeful, is under fire for claiming that lower tax refunds are a sign that the Trump tax cuts are 'a middle-class tax hike' -- something a top fact-checker described as 'nonsensical and misleading.' 'The average tax refund is down about $170 compared to last year. Let's call the President's tax cut what it is: a middle-class tax hike to line the pockets of already wealthy corporations and the 1 percent,' she said in a tweet. Harris was apparently reacting to information from initial returns that the average refund is down approximately 8 percent. But, as fact checkers quickly pointed out, the size of one's refund has more to do with how much was withheld for taxes over the course of the year rather than one's overall tax burden.

Unlike the World Baseball Classic, whose heritage rule allowed countries to field players who were merely eligible for citizenship, the Olympics requires its participants to be full-fledged citizens of the countries they represent. Israel grants citizenship to anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent and in recent months the players have been going through the process, providing marriage certificates, letters from rabbis and other proof of their Judaism. Five of the players have Major League experience and others who find themselves outside opening day rosters may join later before the games kick off in July.

NIAC has consistently condemned the Iranian government's shameful track record of politically motivated detentions - including arbitrarily arresting dual citizens, holding them on spurious charges, subjecting them to cruel conditions, and using them as bargaining chips in negotiations, he added. Such practices are inhumane, illegal, and often in the service of agendas that seek to preserve U.S.-Iran hostility. It is absolutely critical that the U.S. government not follow suit and instead observe the core values of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.

Our leaders rarely mention any of this. They tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. Please. It's based on laws that the Congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. It worked well for those people. They did increase their economic advantage. But for everyone else, it came at a big cost. Unfairness is profoundly divisive. When you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. They hate each other.

You want to turn the page, she told The Associated Press in 2013. There are wonderful sagas you can thoroughly enjoy a section and put it down. But if you're reading my book, I want you stuck with reading the next paragraph. The greatest compliment I can receive is, 'I read your darned book 'til 4 in the morning, and now I'm tired.' I say, 'Then you get your money's worth.'

WOODSON: Well, first of all, it's just -- I bristle every time because it's so insulting. But I remember some years ago in Washington, D.C., the Klan, they'd come to town in a rickety little bus and 5,000 people were trying to get at them, and so The Washington Post came down into Ward 8, one of the most dangerous communities here in Washington with a lot of violence.

In her lifetime, Temple enjoyed a loving relationship with California businessman Charles Alden Black, who claimed he never saw any of her films. The marriage lasted from 1950 until his death in 2005 at age 86. But her first marriage to Agar wasn't as blissful. That union lasted from 1945 until 1950. I was 17, recalled Temple to Larry King. I was way too young. He was 24. But they didn't talk about alcohol then. It was something you hid… So we didn't talk about it.

And yet, and here's the bewildering and infuriating part, those very same affluent married people, the ones making virtually all the decisions in our society, are doing pretty much nothing to help the people below them get and stay married. Rich people are happy to fight malaria in Congo. But working to raise men's wages in Dayton or Detroit? That's crazy.

Trump sits us down in the cabinet room and asks us what we need and how he's doing as a President. If he's actually uplifting our communities, that's offering us a literal seat at the table to make the decisions, that's actually respecting black Americans, not because there's some novelty of you rap and disrespect and tell people that are younger than you that they should continue this pattern of disrespect. He actually genuinely respects black America and that's why I view him as the first black president. I respect that.

In [some shows] he would introduce my mom and I. He would have us stand up. And then he would say, OK guys, any of y'all single? I have a sister that's looking. And then all these guys were whistling, hollering and waving. The spotlight was right on me. I just went to myself, Oh my God, Lord have mercy. He was protective of me, but such a typical brother. He also used to say, If my sister ever gets married, she's going to have a bigger wedding than Princess Diana. I would tell him, There's no use for everybody to be miserable. I'm not getting married. He ended up putting that in his book. He [joked], I think my sister had the right idea on that.
WOODSON: Well, when I was active in the Civil Rights Movement as a young worker, we were seeking opportunity for people to achieve, but the Civil Rights Movement, I think part of the company, when they used what I call a bait and switch game, they used the demographics of low income blacks as the bait, and when money arrived, the switch occurred.

There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone or any institution, any organization in America, that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us, he said.

So even if Chuck agreed with Trump on immigration just a few years ago, it doesn't really matter. He's got to stay in his cell and the media makes it worse by turning these prisons into business models. There's no way MSNBC or the New York Times can make any money if Chuck and Nancy agree with Trump. Compromise doesn't sell advertising.

INGRAHAM: I think she is looking at this thing going oh, the petty squabbles of the youth.
So that lane remains clogged up. I think it's -- it's amazing to me that a -- a mayor of a town of 100,000 is actually in the top two in the Democratic nomination. Keep in mind that no mayor of New York City, population 8 million, the capital of the world, has gone on to higher office, of any higher office, since 1840. Not 1940, but 1840. So that sort of tells against Mike Bloomberg, but it shows that there is still a hunger from at least -- I don't think amongst the voters necessarily so much, but for part of the party to just -- we just need some kind of moderate voice in there. And even if it's the mayor of a small town, you know, we'll take it because they think Bernie's a disaster.
Look, anytime a sitting Supreme Court justice, especially at an advanced age, is in declining health, it does raise serious questions. That's why people are writing articles like Politico's. Remember how Democrats made a big deal about President Trump's health leading up to his first physical as commander-in-chief? They endlessly questioned his stamina and mental acuity. A White House physician, Ronny Jackson, reported that the president was in excellent health last January. People still didn't believe it.
INGRAHAM: Great to see you. I won't shake your hand because I'm not feeling well.

It's easy to place all the blame for the dissolution of a marriage on the other person. But marriage is the union of two imperfect people, so there are always areas you need to own. What did you do to bring about the problems? Don't sweep it under the rug and pin all fault on your spouse.

I also don't believe feminism ever ceased being judgmental. Nevertheless, the article is a fascinating glimpse into gender feminism's struggle to reinvent itself.
