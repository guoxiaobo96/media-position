It was an infection, it was sepsis, she told Entertainment Tonight. Well, he was finally ready to go, I will tell you that. You know, he never wanted to go but his sweet little body was just, it had just been hit so many times with so many things and once we heard the word COVID, all of our hearts just sunk.

But no, I didn't throw anything away. I chose a different path. And it wasn't for Martin specifically. Martin definitely was a catalyst, but helped kind of propel me in that direction. But, you know, I chose freedom, essentially.

We have a playful, loving marriage and I think that's why we're still married 24 years later, she continued. But I did respond because I always get bummed out when people have been married for so long and then I feel like the joke is always like, 'Oh, we're married – so that means we don't have sex anymore.'

The great challenge for today's conservative movement isn't to simply dismantle big government. It's to dismantle the powerful henchmen of big government in the private sector.

But you can no longer safely do both.

Smythe was one of the reporters who broke the story of Shkreli's arrest in 2015.

He is phenomenally intelligent and charismatic, but also has no emotional intelligence and very little common sense and is very awkward. And if you combine all of those things, you get kind of this public relations disaster.
Ingraham warned that it is worth considering what NGOs Psaki is referring to.
