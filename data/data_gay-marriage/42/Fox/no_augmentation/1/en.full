Shrieks from nearby sledders can be heard as the rodent ricochets off the sled, lands in the snow, and scurries away to safety. While getting a rat in your lap might ruin someone's day of fun, Salsman took it in stride. 'I think it made it better,' he said.

Shrieks from nearby sledders can be heard as the rodent ricochets off the sled, lands in the snow, and scurries away to safety. While getting a rat in your lap might ruin someone's day of fun, Salsman took it in stride. 'I think it made it better,' he said.
