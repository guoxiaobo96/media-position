Tens of thousands of embryos are stuck in limbo in fertility clinics, leftovers from pregnancy attempts and broken dreams of parenthood.\n\nSome are outright abandoned by people who quit paying storage fees and can't be found. In other cases, couples are struggling with tough decisions.\n\nJenny Sammis can't bring herself to donate nearly a dozen of her extras to research. She and her husband agreed to do that when they made their embryos 15 years ago, but her feelings changed after using some of them to have children.\n\nI have these two gorgeous, smart people who came from this process, Sammis said. These embryos are all like seeds that could become potential people. That reality to me was all abstract when they were in the freezer.\n\nTank failures at two clinics in Ohio and California last year revealed hidden issues with long-frozen embryos, including some from the 1980s when IVF began. A few years ago, medical groups developed sample consent forms clinics could use for new patients, spelling out what could happen to unused embryos. But that hasn't resolved what to do with ones made long ago.\n\nANTI-VAXXERS AMONG TOP 'THREATS TO GLOBAL HEALTH,' WHO SAYS\n\nIt's a real dilemma for these clinics, said Rich Vaughn, a Los Angeles lawyer who headed the American Bar Association's assisted reproduction committee for many years. We don't quite know what to do with them and everyone's afraid to act for fear they'll be sued if people surface decades later and want their embryos.\n\nThe number is growing as more couples try IVF and because of changes in how it's done. The old way was to mix eggs and sperm in the lab and transfer multiple fresh embryos to a womb, hoping at least one would lead to pregnancy. Now, couples usually freeze many embryos, test for health problems and transfer the most viable one at a time to avoid multiple births. That often means leftovers once the desired family is complete.\n\nHow many embryos are in storage isn't known — centers don't have to report that. One study estimated there were 1.4 million in the U.S. Researchers think 5 to 7 percent are abandoned, though it's as high as 18 percent at some clinics. Some define that as a year of no contact or storage payments after reasonable efforts to find the owners; others draw the line at five years. Some clinics search social media and hire investigators to find owners when abandonment is suspected.\n\nIt has vexed our field from the start, said Dr. Mark Sauer, a fertility specialist at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School who is on the ethics committee of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine.\n\nIt also has vexed couples, many of whom never expected so many leftovers. Sara Raber of New York's Long Island had five extras after conceiving two children.\n\nBABY BORN 3 YEARS AGO HAS GONE HOME FROM HOSPITAL AT LAST\n\nYour goal in the beginning is just to get pregnant, so making a lot of embryos seems necessary because you don't know how many tries it will take, she said. But disposing of extras brings a finality to family building that's different for IVF couples than it is for those who conceived naturally.\n\nYou're making a conscious decision not to have a baby anymore, said her husband, Howard Raber. That's what makes it hard.\n\nEven after the Rabers agreed to donate theirs to research, which usually means to a fertility clinic to let staff practice IVF, the paperwork sat on her desk for months, Sarah Raber said.\n\nIn Arlington, Virginia, Sammis is having a similar struggle. I get to the point of signing the papers and I just can't deal with it, she said.\n\nSammis said a friend who couldn't decide what to do with her embryos moved away and didn't give the fertility center her forwarding address ... That was her way of dealing with it.\n\nWhen couples have abandoned embryos, it was largely because they did not want to be responsible for making a very difficult decision. They would rather let the program do it, Sauer said.\n\nCOLORADO REPORTS STATE'S FIRST PEDIATRIC FLU DEATH OF SEASON\n\nAndrea Braverman, a health psychologist at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, said it's not an easy choice. A study of 131 couples in Canada found that one third had not returned for frozen embryos after five years. Another study found that up to 70 percent of couples delayed a decision for at least five years and many changed their minds about what they thought they'd do after they had IVF.\n\nThis is a fluid decision. It is not a one-and-done, Braverman said.\n\nDr. Craig Sweet, who runs a fertility clinic in Fort Myers, Florida, knows the problem well. About 18 percent, or 300, of his clinic's frozen embryos are abandoned, some for 25 years. A study he did found that couples were more likely to abandon embryos if they had stored them a long time, had a low education level, already had many children or owed the clinic money.\n\nOne of his patients with more than a dozen leftover embryos forged her husband's signature on forms giving permission to use them because she wanted more children and he did not. The plan fell apart when the clinic insisted on seeing him personally.\n\nThings happen. Life happens, divorce happens, depression, financial changes — many things can lead a couple to disagree about using embryos, Sweet said.\n\nThe courts view an embryo as something between person and property, said Susan Crockin, a reproductive law expert at Georgetown University. When it's in the lab as opposed to being in a womb, people have equal rights to it and most courts will not allow one member of a couple to use an embryo over the other's objection, she said.\n\nThe actress Sofia Vergara and her ex-fiancé Nick Loeb fought over frozen embryos they made, but a court said Vergara could not be forced to procreate against her wish and denied Loeb use of the embryos after the couple split.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nStates may try to rewrite legal precedents. Last April, Arizona's governor signed legislation allowing one member of a divorced couple to use embryos created during a marriage even if the ex-spouse doesn't want a child.\n\nClinics try to avoid being in the middle.\n\nWhat we tell couples is that if you're divorced, nobody gets to transfer the embryos until we get something from a court that says who has control of them, said Dr. Richard T. Scott Jr., scientific director of Reproductive Medicine Associates, one of the nation's largest clinics with centers in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida.\n\nIn 2005, Sweet began requiring patients to agree not to destroy unused embryos. He also started Embryo Donation International to provide embryos to couples willing to use them to have children. He accepts embryos from 62 facilities in North America and has more than 400 available; 50 to 60 were used in 2017, he said.\n\nIt just didn't make sense to us that people were discarding perfectly normal, useful embryos, he said.\n\nHis IVF coordinator, Rebecca Ruano, had 18 leftover embryos after the birth of her twins, and agreed to donate the extras to people unable to have children. I was not willing to destroy or donate them to science. We worked too hard for them, she said.\n\nFrozen embryos remain viable for decades as far as anyone knows. Last year, the National Embryo Donation Center in Tennessee reported a birth using an embryo that had been frozen for 24 years.\n\nSweet supplied a Chicago woman an embryo that had been frozen for 17 years and made one request:\n\nWhen the baby is born, he said, I want you to see if you can register the kid to vote.
A strange video of Julianne Hough that shows her shouting during an energy treatment has left fans thinking she underwent an exorcism.\n\nHough, 31, caught the public's attention after a blogger posted a video of the former Dancing with the Stars professional lying on a table as a doctor waved his hands over her body. Hough's body began to contort and move in a wave-like motion as she shouted uncontrollably.\n\nThe actress reportedly participated in the demonstration with Dr. John Amaral in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nJULIANNE HOUGH'S HUSBAND BROOKS LAICH 'STILL HOPING THINGS WILL WORK OUT' AMID RUMORED MARRIAGE TROUBLES: REPORT\n\nGonna tell my kids this is 'The Exorcist'...(Policy Guidline (sic) Disclaimer: I aspire to such flexibility and mind body connection and hope to have similar orgasmic experience at Kinrgy. Love and Light.) blogger Jackie Schimmel, who filmed the video, posted to her Instagram account.\n\nThe clip has since caused a frenzy on social media, with celebrities and Hough's fans weighing in on what exactly they think is going on.\n\nWhat the actual...., Vanderpump Rules star Stassi Schroder commented.\n\nBROOKS LAICH TALKS GOAL OF EXPLORING HIS SEXUALITY AMID RUMORED MARRIAGE TROUBLE WITH JULIANNE HOUGH\n\nI'm calling the cops, another Instagram user joked.\n\nHough even took to the post to agree with the exorcism claims.\n\nI thought the same thing when I first saw it too! the actress and dancer commented with a laughing face emoji.\n\nOthers were spooked by the video and in search of more answers as to what kind of treatment Hough was really receiving.\n\nThe demon is trapped in her little body. In the name of Jesus I rebuke this woman. Bye. Take it Jesus, comedian Heather McMahan wrote.\n\nBROOKS LAICH TALKS GOAL OF EXPLORING HIS SEXUALITY AMID RUMORED MARRIAGE TROUBLE WITH JULIANNE HOUGH\n\nI don't know whether this is absolutely hilarious or absolutely terrifying. My mind is still processing what I just witnessed. This can't be real. She is officially cult status, commented another.\n\nIn the video, Dr. Amaral explains how the treatment -- the exact name of it wasn't announced in the post -- affects the body's nervous system.\n\nThere's always a huge dissipation of energy and a feeling of relief, release, freedom, he said. Expression of emotion may happen when the system moves. When energy that was stored or bound up in the muscles begins to dissipate, and if we're really free to express and allow energy that we have in our bodies to move -- this woman is like an incredible dancer, actress, just human being and she has practiced just allowing things to move through -- but even with that, things get bound up.\n\nThe physician then told his audience that most people, especially in this environment, wouldn't make that sound.\n\nWe've just made it easier for that energy to be liberated, the physician continued.\n\nHough's twin brother, Derek Hough, commented on the video in support of the energy healing ritual.\n\nThis stuff looks whacky and crazy but diving into it with the understanding of pure energy is a pretty wild experience. Maybe ahead of its time but worth an open mind, Derek wrote.\n\nOthers noted that Hough's screams sounded orgasmic.\n\nTHIS IS NOT REAL! another freaked out user wrote.\n\nJULIANNE HOUGH, BROOKS LAICH SHARE LONG EMBRACE AT AIRPORT AMID REPORTS THEY'VE BEEN 'HAVING PROBLEMS'\n\nAnother person on Instagram said: She deserves an Oscar. Meryl Streep who?\n\nI listened to this with no sound and it's still frightening/confusing/scary, wrote another.\n\nThen, in a second strange video posted by Schimmel, Hough is seen performing another demonstration -- this time on her feet as she waves her arms up and down and breathes heavily.\n\nTake it and throw it! Hough says to the audience. Breathing in through the nose, out through the mouth. Yes. Keep going, keep going. We're turning up that heat. Taking that dirt, taking that fire, all that negative energy that we don't need in our life and throwing it away!\n\nSeconds later, Hough brings her hands together above her head and then swings them toward her hips.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe energy healing videos come amid rumors that Hough and her husband, Brooks Laich, are having marital problems.\n\nEarlier this month Laich shared a cryptic Instagram post about entering a new stage of life after Hough was spotted without her wedding ring. Sources told People that despite the couple's relationship appearing strained, Laich is hopeful that things will work out.

He is also a member of President Trump's Coronavirus Task Force, which is headed by Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nRedfield's path to his position started early. Both his parents were scientists at the National Institutes of Health and were huge influences in driving him toward a career in retroviruses in human disease.\n\nAlong his way to his current job, he worked as an Army physician and medical researcher for Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. While there, he worked together with several teams on the cutting edge of AIDS research, writing several papers on the topic.\n\nWHO IS ROBERT REDFIELD? 3 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE CDC'S NEW DIRECTOR\n\nHis work prior to joining the CDC was not without controversy and in 1992, the Defense Department launched an investigation after he was accused of promoting the effects of an HIV vaccine he'd overseen. Although no evidence of misconduct was found, the vaccine failed.\n\nSCIENTISTS AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY HAVE DEVELOPED A RAPID TESTING TECHNOLOGY FOR CORONAVIRUS\n\nWhen he retired from the Army in 1996 as a colonel, he began to concentrate on setting up a multidisciplinary research organization to develop research and treatment programs for chronic human viral infection and disease.\n\nTo help study this, he co-founded the Institute of Human Virology based at Maryland, together with his HIV research colleagues Robert Gallo, the co-discoverer of the HIV retrovirus, and renowned viral epidemiologist William Blattner.\n\nPrior to joining the CDC, Redfield served as a tenured professor of medicine and microbiology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, as well as chief of infectious disease, vice chair of medicine and co-founder and associate director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nSCIENTISTS MAP HOW IMMUNE SYSTEM FIGHTS BACK AGAINST COVID-19\n\nIn the early years of AIDS, Redfield led research responsible for being the first to conclusively show the HIV retrovirus could be heterosexually transmitted, while also developing the staging system now used worldwide for the clinical assessment of the HIV infection.\n\nHowever, in 1992 his work on a controversial AIDS vaccine that turned out to be ineffective brought allegations he committed scientific misconduct by selecting data that were favorable to the vaccine.\n\nA decade later, an investigation by the U.S. Army did say he had an inappropriate close relationship with the non-governmental group Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy (ASAP), which promoted the vaccine. The group, founded by evangelical Christians, worked to contain the HIV/AIDS outbreak by advocating for abstinence before marriage, rather than passing out condoms — a view Redfield says he's since changed...\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRedfield also authored the foreword to a book co-written by ASAP leader W. Shepard Smith, Christians in the Age of AIDS, which discouraged the distribution of sterile needles to drug users as well as condom use, calling them false prophets, a book describing AIDS as God's judgment against homosexuals.\n\n\n\nFox News' Adam Shaw and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) issued a stark condemnation of President Biden's abortion agenda on the day of his inauguration, arguing that he would advance moral evil on the preeminent priority for the faithful.\n\nI must point out that our new President has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender, said Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez, who serves as the USCCB's president. Of deep concern is the liberty of the Church and the freedom of believers to live according to their consciences.\n\nHis comments came amid a broader debate about U.S. politicians, like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who identify as Catholic but pursue policies that conflict with Church teaching. Biden, during the campaign, reversed his decades-old position on the Hyde Amendment, which blocks most taxpayer funding for abortions. He's also pledged to codify Roe v. Wade, a move that conservatives say would allow abortion up till the moment of birth.\n\nSOME ROMAN CATHOLICS SOUNDING ALARM ABOUT BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, CONFLICTS WITH MORAL TEACHING\n\nPrior to Biden's inauguration, he and Pelosi attended a mass held at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, D.C. It's unclear whether they took communion but Archbishop Wilton Gregory said beforehand that he wouldn't deny Biden the sacrament.\n\nDuring the campaign, then-candidate Biden was denied communion by a South Carolina priest and in August, Cardinal Raymond Burke, the former head of the Archdiocese of St. Louis, said the former vice president shouldn't receive communion and wasn't a Catholic in good standing.\n\nFor years, Biden supported the Hyde Amendment with the rationale that religious Americans shouldn't have to pay for procedures they fundamentally oppose. He similarly argued that Americans shouldn't be forced to embrace his faith's view of abortion. He appeared to personally flout church teaching, however, when he officiated a same-sex wedding ceremony in 2016. He also picked a Health and Human Services secretary who previously sued nuns for opposing Obamacare's contraception mandate.\n\nRegardless, Gomez welcomed Biden and said it would be refreshing to engage with a President who clearly understands, in a deep and personal way, the importance of religious faith and institutions.\n\nGomez added in Wednesday's statement that abortion is not only a private matter, it raises troubling and fundamental questions of fraternity, solidarity, and inclusion in the human community. It is also a matter of social justice. We cannot ignore the reality that abortion rates are much higher among the poor and minorities, and that the procedure is regularly used to eliminate children who would be born with disabilities.\n\nBIDEN LAUNCHES ADS TOUTING HIS FAITH AFTER CARDINAL SAYS HE'S 'NOT A CATHOLIC IN GOOD STANDING'\n\nBoth the Catholic Catechism and some clergy have indicated that politicians have an obligation to support anti-abortion legislation. The section of the Catechism discussing abortion says that the procedure and infanticide are abominable crimes.\n\nAfter Gomez's statement, Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich called it ill-considered, alleging that bishops only received it hours before it was released and was crafted without involvement from the body's Administrative Committee.\n\nThe internal institutional failures involved must be addressed, and I look forward to contributing to all efforts to that end, so that, inspired by the Gospel, we can build up the unity of the Church, and together take up the work of healing our nation in this moment of crisis, Cupich said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPope Francis, meanwhile, called on Biden to work towards a society that respected every human's rights.\n\nAt a time when the grave crises facing our human family call for farsighted and united responses, he said, I pray that your decisions will be guided by a concern for building a society marked by authentic justice and freedom, together with unfailing respect for the rights and dignity of every person, especially the poor, the vulnerable and those who have no voice.
Larry King's wife, Shawn King, has revealed his cause of death as well as the final words she spoke to him.\n\nThe iconic television host died Saturday morning at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles at the age of 87, leaving behind three living children -- Larry Jr., Chance and Cannon -- as well as his wife, Shawn.\n\nNo cause of death was given at the time of his passing, but he had been hospitalized with a COVID-19 infection weeks prior, reports said. In a new interview, his wife revealed the broadcaster did not die from the coronavirus.\n\nIt was an infection, it was sepsis, she told Entertainment Tonight. Well, he was finally ready to go, I will tell you that. You know, he never wanted to go but his sweet little body was just, it had just been hit so many times with so many things and once we heard the word COVID, all of our hearts just sunk. But he beat it, you know, he beat it, but it did take its toll and then the unrelated infection finally is what took him, but boy, he was not gonna go down easily.\n\nLARRY KING'S WIFE SHAWN KING SPEAKS OUT AFTER TV TALK-SHOW ICON IS LAID TO REST: 'I'M STILL PROCESSING'\n\nShawn said King's mind wasn't right and his body was going, noting it was a difficult thing to witness. The actress and King were in the middle of a divorce at the time of his passing. King filed for divorce in August 2019 after 22 years of marriage.\n\nShe confirmed the pair's divorce was never finalized.\n\nIn my heart, I didn't think it was really going to happen and it never did. We were partners in every sense of the way, in business, and in, well, first in our familiy and then in business. But we're a close family. You know, family is the most important thing, and God, she said.\n\nShawn also touched on King's final moments in the hospital. She said she and King's kids were able to FaceTime him.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nAnd it was hard for him to talk, but the one message that he wanted to make sure I heard was, 'I love you, take care of the boys,' she said.\n\nKing's family laid him to rest in a private funeral this week. She said she still feels his strong presence around her.\n\nI can very, very distinctly feel him around me and around us. I'm sure he is so happy at the coverage that his passing has gotten. ... Larry was a little boy in so many ways. And he used to always, you probably have 30 different soundbites of him saying, 'I pinch myself every day. I can't believe this is my life.' And he really, really did. So all of these beautiful tributes, you know, I'm sure he's thrilled, and the family, we're all just so happy and so proud of him for all the wonderful things that he did. He did a lot.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKing was married a total of eight times throughout his life, to seven different women. Shawn was his last marriage and his longest.\n\nJust months before his death, King lost two of his five adult children when Andy, 65, and Chaia, 51, died within weeks of each other. Andy had a heart attack, while Chaia had been battling lung cancer.
Good morning and welcome to Fox News First. Here's what you need to know as you start your day ...\n\nBloomberg pummeled in debate debut – with Warren leading the onslaught\n\nThe Democrats' showdown Wednesday night in Las Vegas repeatedly put former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in his primary rivals' crosshairs as the surging billionaire made his debate-stage debut. But the event quickly expanded into an all-out melee and was easily the most aggressive debate of the nomination season to date, as each of the 2020 presidential candidates took sharp and often personal shots at one another.\n\nThe fight started out white-hot when, in her first turn at the microphone, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., asserted she would support whoever wins the nomination, but warned that Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.\n\nShe said the field is running against somebody who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians -- and no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump, I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg.\n\nIn another explosive moment, attendees erupted in the hall when Warren called on Bloomberg to release women from nondisclosure agreements they have signed concerning their civil complaints that he harassed them in the workplace. After a disappointing fourth-place finish in New Hampshire, Warren was particularly combative as she tangled with multiple rivals in a bid to distinguish herself once more ahead of Saturday's Nevada caucuses.

He said he didn't expect the Senate to vote against having him testify.\n\nRice, citing security clearance procedures for her own book, said she couldn't imagine withholding my testimony, with or without a subpoena or going public with information if she thought it was of national importance. But Bolton insisted his testimony would not have mattered.\n\nPeople can argue about what I should have said and what I should have done, he said.

Kirk Douglas, one of the most famous American leading men of the mid-20th century remembered for his dimpled chin, chiseled features, and virile Hollywood roles, died Wednesday at the age of 103, his family announced.\n\nIt is with tremendous sadness that my brothers and I announce that Kirk Douglas left us today at the age of 103, Kirk's son, Michael Douglas, wrote in a statement shared to social media.\n\nHe continued: To the world he was a legend, an actor from the golden age of movies who lived well into his golden years, a humanitarian whose commitment to justice and the causes he believed in set a standard for all of us to aspire to.\n\nBut to me and my brothers Joel and Peter he was simply Dad, to Catherine, a wonderful father-in-law, to his grandchildren and great grandchild their loving grandfather, and to his wife Anne, a wonderful husband, he added.\n\nMichael concluded his post by writing: Kirk's life was well lived, and he leaves a legacy in film that will endure for generations to come, and a history as a renowned philanthropist who worked to aid the public and bring peace to the planet.Let me end with the words I told him on his last birthday and which will always remain true. Dad- I love you so much and I am so proud to be your son.\n\nThe statement did not indicate exactly how or where he died.\n\nKIRK DOUGLAS SAYS WIFE ANNE SAVED HIS LIFE TWICE\n\nThe 75-year-old actor also shared photos of his late father which included several sweet family photos.\n\nA World War II veteran who survived a helicopter crash, a stroke, and two knee replacements, Douglas literally rose from rags to riches -- his father was a ragman -- and starred in over 80 films, including, perhaps most famously, Spartacus. He remained in the public spotlight well into his old age, if not as an actor then as a producer, author, and blogger.\n\nDouglas was born Issur Izzy Danielovitch on Dec. 9, 1916, to Russian Jewish parents in Amsterdam, New York.\n\n\n\nHis family was poor, and he claimed to have worked more than 40 jobs -- including stints as a professional wrestler, a waiter, and a janitor -- before becoming an actor.\n\nMICHAEL DOUGLAS REVEALS PLANS FOR DAD KIRK DOUGLAS' 103RD BIRTHDAY\n\n\n\nLoans, scholarships, and sweet-talking propelled the aspiring performer through St. Lawrence University and, eventually, the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City, where he studied alongside Lauren Bacall and his future wife Diana Dill, who would give birth to his first and most famous son, Michael, in 1944.\n\n\n\nAfter two small roles on Broadway under his new stage name, Kirk Douglas, and a few years in the Navy during World War II, he made his on-screen debut with a part in 1946's The Strange Love of Martha Ivers at age 30.\n\nKirk's life was well lived, and he leaves a legacy in film that will endure for generations to come — Michael Douglas\n\n\n\nHowever, his big break came in 1949 when he starred as an ambitious boxer in the film noir classic Champion, which earned him his first of three Oscar nominations for Best Actor.\n\n\n\nThe role cemented Douglas' steely image, and with his distinctive raspy voice and piercing eyes he continued to take on intense, often cocky, characters in his films. He was once quoted as saying I've made a career of playing sons of b---hes.\n\nCATHERINE ZETA-JONES GUSHES OVER KIRK DOUGLAS\n\n\n\nHe played a ruthless Hollywood producer in The Bad and Beautiful (1952) and portrayed Vincent Van Gogh in Lust for Life (1956).\n\nThrough his own company, Bryna Productions -- named for his mother -- Douglas also produced and starred in the Kubrick-directed Paths of Glory (1957) and, more famously, in Spartacus (1960).\n\nDouglas' decision to give screen credit to Spartacus' blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo -- one of the Hollywood Ten who testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947 -- helped bring an end to entertainment industry McCarthyism.\n\nAfter a divorce from his first wife in 1951, Douglas eloped with German-born publicist Anne Buydens in 1954, and despite affairs with fellow stars Joan Crawford, Marlene Dietrich and Pier Angeli, among others, he retained a reputation as a family man, increasingly devoted to his wife as he grew old.\n\nOf the secret to his long-lasting marriage, Douglas told Fox News in 2017: [Date night is] the same as it's been throughout our marriage. We spend what we call the 'golden hour' together at around 6:30 each night. We'll sit and talk and laugh and share our day and our thoughts with each other.\n\nAs his film career waned in the 1980s -- and his son's career took off -- Douglas focused on philanthropy, charity work, and his role as goodwill ambassador for the US State Department, a post he has held since 1963.\n\n\n\nHe received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1981, the Jefferson Award for public service in 1983, and the French Legion of Honor in 1985.\n\n\n\nThough he never actually won an Academy Award, Douglas was granted an Honorary Oscar in 1996 for 50 years as a creative and moral force in the motion picture community.\n\nDouglas wrote three novels and several memoirs about his career, his newfound spirituality -- he embraced Judaism, the faith in which he was raised, after surviving a helicopter crash that killed two others in 1991 -- and his struggle with depression and regaining his speech after suffering a stroke in 1996.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\n\nIn 2003, Douglas finally starred alongside his son Michael, as well as his first wife and grandson Cameron, in It Runs in the Family, a movie about a dysfunctional multi-generation family trying to reconcile their differences. It earned disappointing box office figures and cool reviews.\n\nHe fared much better with critics at age 92, when he delivered sold-out performances of his one-man show, Before I Forget, presenting anecdotes about living through Hollywood's Golden Age and self-deprecating meditations on his achievements.\n\n\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 65 years (married May 29, 1954) Anne Buydens, their son Peter Douglas, two sons from his first marriage -- Michael and Joel Douglas -- and seven grandchildren.

The president is expected to be joined by his senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nTrump's visit to comes after he walked out of a White House meeting with congressional leaders Wednesday afternoon as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi again rejected his pitch to fund the border wall.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNIELSEN BLASTS DEMS' 'MANUFACTURED' RHETORIC: On the eve of her trip to the southern border in Texas with President Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told FOX News' Sean Hannity that it was offensive and disrespectful for top Democrats to accuse Republicans of exploiting illegal immigration for political gain ... Speaking earlier on Wednesday, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez echoed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's language, telling America's Newsroom that this whole border security crisis … it really, I believe, is a manufactured crisis.\n\nNielsen, who met with congressional leaders Wednesday in the Situation Room with President Trump and has played a central role in talks to end a partial federal government shutdown, called that rhetoric disgraceful on Hannity.\n\nJUSTICE RETURNING TO JUSTICE DEPARTMENT: What is in store for the Justice Department with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein expected to resign after soon after President Trump's nominee, William Barr, is confirmed as the nation's next attorney general? Badly needed reforms, says FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett in an analysis on FoxNews.com ... Jarrett writes: Under the failed leadership of fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Rosenstein, the department has been operating more like the Department of Injustice in its handling of the out-of-control and ever-expanding Russia probe led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and overseen by Rosenstein. And that's only one example of Rosenstein's misconduct.\n\nNEW, DEADLY SUSPICION HANGS OVER DEM MEGADONOR: Democratic Party megadonor Ed Buck faces new questions this week as Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives investigate the death of a man at Buck's home - the second in less than two years ... In addition, a third man has come forward and claimed that the well-connected Buck lured him to a sex toy-filled apartment and injected him with crystal methamphetamine during a frightening encounter.\n\nBuck has not been arrested and his attorney says he is cooperating with authorities. Both of the men found dead at his home were black; so is the man who accused him of injecting him with meth.\n\nBuck, 64, has donated tens of thousands of dollars to a slew of liberal causes and candidates over the years, including Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and a who's who of top California politicians. Critics have wondered whether Buck's wealth and influence caused authorities to slow-walk the investigation into the first death at his home.\n\nBILLIONS ON THE LINE IN BEZOS DIVORCE: Billionaire Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced Wednesday that he and his wife MacKenzie are divorcing after 25 years of marriage, and some observers believe the soon-to-be ex-Mrs. Bezos could become the world's richest woman ... It isn't clear whether the Bezoses have a prenuptial agreement or any other contract affecting the financial terms of their divorce. However, without an agreement, MacKenzie Bezos would likely be entitled to an equal share of Bezos' personal fortune of $137.2 billion, Bloomberg reported.\n\nWith approximately $69 billion, MacKenzie Bezos would easily surpass the world's current richest woman, L'Oreal cosmetics heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, who has an estimated net worth of $45.6 billion.\n\n\n\nTHE SOUNDBITE\n\nLIBERAL PARROTS IN THE MEDIA - If Democratic leaders saying it, reporters are saying it, too.

As a journalist, falling in love with a person you are covering is about as taboo as it gets. Add in the fact that the subject of such affection is a person who once earned the title The Most Hated Man in America, and you've got one big story to either share or conceal. As former Bloomberg journalist Christie Smythe tells me, it is in fact, a crazy story.\n\nI sat down with Smythe for her first TV interview since revealing her love affair with Martin Shkreli in a tell-all article published in Elle magazine in December. Shkreli is best known as Pharma-Bro, the former drug company CEO who is currently serving seven years in the low-security Allenwood Low Federal Correctional Institution in Pennsylvania for two counts of securities fraud and one count of securities fraud conspiracy.\n\nShkreli earned the nickname after raising the price of the life-saving HIV drug Daraprim by 5,000% overnight, sparking outrage and earning him the moniker for what was called his callous nature in making the dramatic price increase.\n\nREPORTER QUITS JOB, LEAVES HUSBAND AFTER FALLING FOR JAILED 'PHARMA BRO' MARTIN SHKRELI\n\nSmythe describes her budding relationship with Shkreli as something unimaginable at first saying, I mean, from where I started and where I ended up, it's like no one would believe that. If you wrote fiction about it, no one would believe it. But, I've been a journalist for 15 years. I've covered business and legal issues mostly. I graduated from the University of Missouri. I did a fellowship at Columbia. You know, I have a solid journalism education. I got into covering courts after moving to New York in 2008.\n\nSmythe began covering Brooklyn Federal Court for Bloomberg News in 2012, which is how she ended up reporting on Shkreli. She says, He was the villain everybody hated. So, of course, when he was arrested for securities fraud charges, massive story. My biggest story ever. That was how I got into the story. Like that was my first introduction to him.\n\nShkreli gave tabloid writers and business reporters plenty of fodder through the course of his trial, creating headlines as he rolled his eyes through testimony, and live-streamed at home after court, drinking the occasional beer.\n\nSmythe was one of the reporters who broke the story of Shkreli's arrest in 2015. She says that over time the two fell in love and that Shkreli is simply misunderstood, saying, He's just a very, very eccentric person. It doesn't play well in public, especially in negative light. He is phenomenally intelligent and charismatic, but also has no emotional intelligence and very little common sense and is very awkward. And if you combine all of those things, you get kind of this public relations disaster.\n\nTRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER TO LOWER DRUG PRICES IN FIGHT AGAINST BIG PHARMA\n\nSmythe says her marriage was already having difficulties and her attention to Shkreli only made things worse. But, she says, she didn't cross the line when it came to covering him.\n\nHer former employer disagrees. In a statement, a Bloomberg News spokesperson said in part, Ms. Smythe's conduct with regard to Mr. Shkreli was not consistent with expectations for a Bloomberg journalist. It became apparent that it would be best to part ways. Ms. Smythe tendered her resignation, and we accepted it.\n\nAfter Smythe left her job she says that's when things between the two heated up, and her marriage cooled off, telling me, After I left my job at Bloomberg and I was kind of on the way out with my husband, with my ex-husband, we were planning to split up. I visited Martin in prison and I just simply told him that I loved him.\n\nI asked Smythe if there was any sort of soft launch into the romantic conversation, to which she replied, No, once you're in, you're in. Smythe says that's when Shkreli told her that he loved her, too.\n\nThere is only one photo of the two together, taken during a visitation day inside the prison. Smythe says that over the course of his imprisonment the two have shared letters, spoken on the phone, exchanged emails and even talked about having a life together once he is released from custody. Smythe added that Shkreli also told her he wanted to have children with her, too. She told me, We talked about me freezing my eggs and after he suggested that that could be a possibility, I said, 'OK, sure, I'll go ahead and try, I'll look into it and see about that' and I did it and I'm really glad I did it. I mean, if things work out with Martin, great. If they don't, I feel like I've preserved that option for myself.\n\n'PHARMA BRO' MARTIN SHKRELI DENIED PRISON RELEASE TO RESEARCH CORONAVIRUS CURE\n\nI asked Smythe what she has to say to people who have told her she's been brainwashed and that Shkreli is using and manipulating her. She said she would tell them, You don't know what you're talking about, you don't know me and what an incredibly willful and independent person I have been since childhood. And you don't know Martin. Martin is not a brilliant manipulator when you get to know him.\n\nSmythe says she's also had to confront criticism about how Shkreli treated other female journalists, even calling him out for some of the comments he made online and says she doesn't support any form of harassment but says she believed Shkreli saw some of his comments as justified responses.\n\nAccording to Smythe, the relationship hit a snag after COVID hit and the Elle article was published. She says their relationship started to break down and the two stopped speaking. As of this writing, Smythe says they are back on speaking terms and have been corresponding through emails and phone calls.\n\nAs for what's next, she says they are figuring things out.\n\nI would love Martin to get out, she said. I would love him to start working on something productive that helps the world. And I'd like to play some sort of role in helping him get there. That's my dream.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJust this week, a federal judge denied Shkreli's second request for an early release, rejecting his claims that the prison's lockdown due to COVID-19 has put a strain on his mental health. In the 12-page ruling, the judge said Shkreli didn't make an extraordinary and compelling reason to modify his sentence.\n\nSo for now, Smythe waits for Shkreli's release. I asked her if she felt like she threw it all away in the end, as some of the post-Elle magazine headlines have suggested. Smythe told me, No, that was their interpretation. Obviously, they wanted to heighten the drama and the contrast of where my life was before and where it is now. So I understand those choices. But no, I didn't throw anything away. I chose a different path. And it wasn't for Martin specifically. Martin definitely was a catalyst, but helped kind of propel me in that direction. But, you know, I chose freedom, essentially.
Mary-Kate Olsen has finally settled her divorce from estranged husband Olivier Sarkozy.\n\nAttorneys for the former pair appeared virtually in front of a Manhattan judge on Wednesday and entered their decisions, adding that they expect to have a signed copy of the split agreement to the court by next week, according to Page Six.\n\nAs of this morning, we reached a final agreement, Sarkozy's lawyer Michael Mosberg told a judge during a Manhattan Supreme Court video hearing.\n\nCourt Justice Lori Sattler asked Olsen's lawyer, Nancy Chemtob, if she agreed, to which Chemtob replied, Yes, your honor, that is correct, everything is resolved. We've been working very hard. We do have a settlement.\n\nMARY-KATE OLSEN LOSES BID TO FILE FOR AN EMERGENCY DIVORCE AS JUDGE DETERMINES IT'S 'NOT AN ESSENTIAL MATTER'\n\nOlsen, 34, who filed to dissolve her marriage to the French banker in May, appeared on the video feed donning a simple black turtleneck as the respective parties' attorneys proceeded with formalities.\n\nOlsen lost a bid in her request for an emergency divorce amid the coronavirus pandemic in May. New York City Judge Michael Katz denied the request, saying the matter wasn't essential in nature and thus, the estranged pair had to follow the proper channels in settling their marital dispute.\n\nMARY-KATE OLSEN'S EMERGENCY DIVORCE FILING DENIAL IS LIKELY A 'VERY PUBLIC MESSAGE' FROM JUDGE: LEGAL EXPERT\n\nCurrently, we are only accepting essential, emergency matters for filing, a spokesperson for the New York courts said in a statement to Fox News at the time. The original filing was rejected by the New York County clerk because they did not follow the essential matter procedure.\n\nThey refiled under the essential matter procedure and the matter was referred to the ex-parte judge, a New York State Supreme Court judge, the note continued. He determined that it is not an essential matter, so they can't file anything at this point.\n\nOlsen was reportedly looking to speed up the process after she claimed Sarkozy terminated the lease of the New York City apartment they shared and sent a notice to Olsen that she needed to vacate by May 18.\n\nMARY-KATE OLSEN WANTED CHILDREN WITH OLIVIER SARKOZY BEFORE DIVORCE, SOURCE CLAIMS\n\nPage Six reported at the time that Olsen stated in her filing: I am petrified that my husband is trying to deprive me of the home we have lived in and if he is successful, I will not only lose my home but I risk losing my personal property, as well.\n\nAmid the divorce, Olsen moved to a $325,000 Hamptons rental for the summer.\n\nSattler pushed the lawyers to finalize the settlement, the outlet maintained.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nUntil I actually see the proof, I'm going to hold your feet to the fire a little bit, the jurist said, according to Page Six. I do trust and believe that this is happening, however, I'm going to keep control of the case to make sure this gets done and get them divorced.\n\nAttorneys for the pair did not immediately respond to Fox News' requests for comment.
2020 was not easy for many celebrity marriages, and Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's union was certainly no exception.\n\nThe 40-year-old reality star and the hip hop icon, 43, have been married for six years, after tying the knot in an extravagant televised celebration in Italy in 2014.\n\nOver the years, the fashion-forward couple has supported one another's professional endeavors, put on united fronts at awards shows and red carpet events, and of course, have been generous in giving fans a glimpse at their private lives on social media and on the Kardashian family's hit reality show.\n\nBut much like a number of seemingly sturdy celebrity marriages that fell apart in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic, Kardashian and West's marital troubles loomed. Social media outbursts from West hinted at a divorce between the pair shortly after the rapper announced his 2020 bid for president. The couple appeared to keep it together, however, with Kardashian jumping at the defense for her husband more than once.\n\nHere's a look back at the couple's ups and downs over the last year and what may have contributed to their reported imminent divorce.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN HASN'T OFFICIALLY FILED FOR DIVORCE FROM KANYE WEST BECAUSE OF THEIR KIDS: REPORT\n\nKim Kardashian, Kanye West give a peek at their Calabasas compound\n\nAs 2021 neared, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were reportedly leading separate lives and had been spending a lot of time apart. But back in March 2020, the pair appeared in sync, sharing details about their home life and giving a rare glimpse at their famously minimalist Los Angeles mansion for the cover of Architectural Digest.\n\nThe rapper and his reality-star wife told the magazine that they let their kids run loose within their sprawling home, which features bare-bones furnishings and a beige and white aesthetic. West said it was designed with their family of six in mind.\n\nThe kids ride their scooters down the hallways and jump around on top of the low Axel tables, which they use as a kind of stage, West told the magazine. This house may be a case study, but our vision for it was built around our family.\n\nIn the end, we don't take it too seriously. We're not going to be fanatics, Kardashian agreed.\n\nKim defends Kanye amid Taylor Swift audio leak\n\nAlso in March, Kardashian voiced support for her husband when the full audio of the rapper's infamous four-year-old phone call with Taylor Swift about his controversial song Famous leaked.\n\nSwift used the opportunity to plug her donations to the World Health Organization and Feeding America in the midst of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and encouraged her fans to do the same. She also took aim at the Hollywood couple over the years-long feud.\n\nInstead of answering those who are asking how I feel about the video footage that leaked, proving that I was telling the truth the whole time about *that call* (you know, the one that was illegally recorded, that somebody edited and manipulated in order to frame me and put me, my family, and fans through hell for 4 years)…SWIPE UP to see what really matters, Swift wrote on her Instagram Story Monday in reference to the leaked video.\n\nKardashian fired back, defending herself and West in a series of tweets.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN, KANYE WEST DIVORCE 'IMMINENT': REPORT\n\n.@taylorswift13 has chosen to reignite an old exchange - that at this point in time feels very self-serving given the suffering millions of real victims are facing right now, Kim began her statement.\n\nTo add, Kanye as an artist has every right to document his musical journey and process, just like she recently did through her documentary, Kardashian wrote. Kanye has documented the making of all of his albums for his personal archive, however has never released any of it for public consumption & the call between the two of them would have remained private or would have gone in the trash had she not lied & forced me to defend him.\n\nKanye announces his 2020 presidential run\n\nWest took center stage on Indepence Day last year when he shocked many with the formal announcement of his decision to run for president of the United States in the 2020 election on Twitter.\n\nWe must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future, he wrote. I am running for president of the United States! #2020VISION.\n\nAt the time, the mother of four showed her support for West by sharing his tweet on her own Twitter profile with an American flag. Additionally, a source told Us Weekly at the time, Kim has known about his aspirations and has been supportive.\n\nKardashian 'furious' at West over remarks about abortion\n\nDuring his first campaign rally in South Carolina in July, West brought up the possibility of divorcing his wife while claiming they considered aborting their first child, North, 7.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA REACTS TO KIM KARDASHIAN, KANYE WEST SPLIT REPORTS: 'REALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOALS'\n\nShe was crying… and for one month and two months and three months, we talked about her not having this child. She had the pills in her hand, West continued (via People magazine).\n\nEven if my wife wants to divorce me after this speech she brought North into the world even when I didn't want to. She stood up and she protected that child. You know who else protected a child? 43 years ago, who do you think protected a child? West said at the rally as he began to sob uncontrollably.\n\nA source told the magazine that Kardashian was furious that he shared something so private. Kardashian later implied it was an episode brought on by his bipolar disorder.\n\nKanye's Twitter rant about divorcing Kim goes viral\n\nWest's fans began to fear for his mental health in late July as he went on a lengthy Twitter rant in which he touched on his marriage to Kim Kardashian, his fears of getting locked up and teased an upcoming album named after his late mother.\n\nIn one tweet, West wrote, Kim was trying to fly to Wyoming with a doctor to lock me up like on the movie Get Out because I cried about saving my daughters life yesterday.\n\nIn a since-deleted tweet, the Power rapper also claimed that he'd been trying to divorce Kardashian ever since she attended a prison reform event with Meek Mill in 2018.\n\nIn the same rant, he also shaded Kardashian's past Playboy spread and claimed that the reality star's mother, Kris Jenner, was no longer allowed to see his children.\n\nDays later, West issued a public apology to Kardashian. I would like to apologize to my wife Kim for going public with something that was a private matter. I did not cover her like she has covered me.to [sic] Kim I want to say I know I hurt you. Please forgive me. Thank you for always being there for me.\n\nKim breaks silence on Kanye's bipolar disorder\n\nIn response to West's social media outburst, Kardashian spoke up about the Yeezy founder's bipolar disorder for the first time, asking for compassion from the public.\n\nAs many of you know, Kanye has bi-polar disorder. Anyone who has this or has a loved one in their life who does, knows how incredibly complicated and painful it is to understand, Kardashian's statement shared to Instagram began.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN REPORTEDLY 'FURIOUS' AT KANYE WEST: A LOOK BACK AT THEIR RELATIONSHIP\n\nKardashian added she realized that her husband's words can carry particular weight and cause strong opinions and emotions due to his status as a public figure. However, she said she finds him to be a brilliant and complicated person that is simply struggling to deal with his mental illness at times.\n\nHe is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressure of being an artist and a black man, who experienced the painful loss of his mother, and has to deal with the pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bi-polar disorder, she wrote. Those who are close with Kanye know his heart and understand his words some times do not align with his intentions.\n\nTensions rise in Wyoming\n\nThe pair reunited in late July at a local fast-food joint in Cody, Wyo.\n\nHours after Kardashian's arrival broke, photos of the couple show the two appearing to be in an emotional argument while sitting in their car.\n\nIn the pics, Kardashian can be seen crying while she and West are talking to each other. At the time, a source claimed to People that the pair had been discussing divorce for several weeks.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN AND KANYE WEST LEADING 'SEPARATE LIVES' IN MARRIAGE: REPORT\n\nA second insider claimed that both the KKW Beauty founder and the rapper felt the marriage is over.\n\nFamily vacations, Kanye squashes beef with Kris\n\nIn August, social media footage showed evidence that the couple jet-setted to an undisclosed tropical location enjoying some R&R with their kids. West appeared to provide evidence of the family's reunion with a video of himself and daughter, North, 7, busting some moves. Kardashian was noticeably heard laughing in the background.\n\nMeanwhile, West took to Twitter to make it known he had smoothed things over with Kris Jenner.\n\nMy mother in law Kris Jenner ... makes the best music playlist, West, 43, tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN AND KANYE WEST HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING DIVORCE FOR WEEKS: REPORTS\n\nThe appreciative comments about Jenner followed reports he referred to the famed mom-ager as Kris Jong-Un, called her boyfriend Corey Gamble Calmye, said the matriarch is involved in white supremacy because she didn't reply to his texts, and informed her that she couldn't see his kids.\n\nKim recalls assisting Kanye amid coronavirus fight\n\nIn October, more information about the Kardashian-West household came to light. In an interview with Grazia magazine, the prison reform advocate revealed she helped care for West as he fought the novel virus in early 2020 while also caring for their four kids.\n\nKanye had it way at the beginning, when nobody really knew what was going on, recalled Kardashian. It was so scary and unknown. I had my four babies and no one else in the house to help.\n\nThe star said she'd change her husband's sheets and help him get out of bed when he wasn't feeling good as he fought the infection.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN LAUGHS WITH KANYE WEST IN FAMILY VIDEO FOLLOWING REPORTS OF MARITAL STRUGGLES\n\nIt was a challenge because it was so unknown, she confessed. Changing his sheets with gloves and a face shield was really a scary time.\n\nKanye gifts Kardashian a birthday gift of a lifetime\n\nIn October, the KKW Beauty founder said she received the most thoughtful gift of a lifetime from West for her 40th birthday: a hologram of her late father, Robert Kardashian.\n\nShe recalled on Twitter: For my birthday, Kanye got me the most thoughtful gift of a lifetime. A special surprise from heaven. A hologram of my dad.\n\nThe KKW Beauty mogul also shared a two-minute clip of the hologram. I am so proud of the woman that you've become, Kimberly, and all that you have accomplished, the hologram of the late attorney said in part.\n\nWest reportedly also helped Kardashian celebrate her 40th by attending her birthday extravaganza in the tropics with friends.

Carly Waddell wanted to set the record straight regarding her divorce from her husband Evan Bass after three years of marriage.\n\nThe Bachelor in Paradise alum, 35, addressed rumors in a YouTube video posted on Sunday.\n\nI call this the divorce room because this is where Evan told me he wanted a divorce.

We greatly appreciate everyone's love and support and kindly ask that you please respect our family's privacy as we navigate through this.
In her Ingraham Angle monologue on Monday, host Laura Ingraham said Democrats are misuing American servicemembers for political theater just months after they roundly condemned Donald Trump for considering deploying National Guardsmen to quell left-wing riots in major cities across the country.\n\nIngraham played a montage of top Democrats, including former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro and Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut claiming at the time that Trump was misusing military and government assets for his own advantages.\n\nFast-forwarding to present day, Ingraham pointed to how District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser will hold National Guard troops in Washington until at least March.\n\nThousands of troops were called to action in town earlier this month in advent of President Biden's inauguration.\n\nThose Democrats have had a change of heart, she said, adding that Bowser's plan calls for 5,000 guardsmen to stay in the District -- down from about 25,000 called upon following Capitol unrest and ahead of Biden's ceremony.\n\nDid they really think that insane animal skin guy was planning to return to D.C. with other furry friends to make a stand? she said, referring to now-indicted Q-Anon Shaman Jacob Jake Angeli Chansley of Arizona.\n\nThis is political theater directed by Democrat leadership. They are using the military to ratchet up the drama of their kangaroo impeachment trial of former President Trump, the host said.\n\nIt allows them to play the victim despite evidence of any serious on-going threat. It furnishes them with a back door way to execute their next agenda item: purging the military of any political opponents.\n\nIngraham went on to explain that, according to The Hill, Democrats seek to use the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to address purported extremism within the Pentagon and related agencies.\n\nThe broader and more opaque the language, the easier it is to cancel military members and other government personnel who don't call in line politically or even culturally, she said.\n\nMost people would agree that generally dangerous extremists should not be allowed to serve and join the military. We don't want members of ISIS in our ranks and obviously KKK, of course not. That's not who the Democrats are talking about.\n\nIngraham went on to point out a recent comment from White House Press Secretary Jennifer Psaki, who said Biden ordered the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to execute a comprehensive threat assessment coordinated with the FBI and DHS on domestic violent extremists.\n\nThis assessment will draw on the analysis from across the government and as appropriate, nongovernmental organizations, said Psaki.\n\nIngraham warned that it is worth considering what NGOs Psaki is referring to.\n\nWhat non-governmental organizations is she talking about that will report on their fellow Americans? The ACLU, Black Lives Matter, Planned Parenthood? Anti-gun rights organizations?\n\nPresumably, they think anyone who disagrees with their far-left goals are extremists. From what we have already heard the Biden administration say, it's clear that they are going to use the power and surveillance of the U.S. Government to keep tabs on a lot more people than we ever would have thought would have been embedded in government agencies as domestic terrorists.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nYes, law-abiding Americans whom the party in power think are getting out of the line.\n\nWhat if someone complains on Facebook that the federal government wastes money or says Roe V. Wade should be overturned. Or what if they are conservative baptists and believe sex outside of marriage is immoral? Will they now be considered extremists or even terrorists? We deserve to know, she continued.\n\nYou see where this is destined to lead. It is not to a freer and more united America.
Ioan Gruffudd and his wife, Alice Evans, are apparently splitting after 13 years of marriage.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, a rep for the couple said, As you can imagine, this is an incredibly difficult time for our family and we remain committed to our children. Thank you for respecting our privacy.\n\nThe 49-year-old actress revealed the news via Twitter late Monday evening writing how the Welsh actor, 47, has left his family.\n\nSad news. My believed husband/soulmate of 20 years, Ioan Gruffudd, has announced he is to leave his family, starting next week, she wrote in the since-deleted tweet according to Page Six.\n\nADELE REACHES DIVORCE SETTLEMENT WITH ESTRANGED HUSBAND NEARLY 2 YEARS AFTER SPLIT: REPORTS\n\nMe and our young daughters girls are very confused and sad, revealed Evans, as quoted by the outlet. We haven't been given a reason except that he 'no longer loves me.'\n\nEvans and Gruffudd married in 2007 and share two daughters, Ella, 11, and Elsie, 7.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Evans alleged that it was Gruffudd who took over her account and deleted her tweet.\n\nI didn't delete the tweet from a few hours ago about him leaving, she explained. He did. From my account.\n\nEvans added, And hell yes when I am being gaslit and mentally tortured then hell yes I will wash my linen in public.\n\nWhen one fan commented on Evans' tweets, calling them weird,, another person commented, I did the same when this happened to me. I think it's how one acknowledges there's no returning to what existed before. Accepting it by stating it publicly helps you to recognize the impossibility if reconciliation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nTo which Evans replied, This is exactly why. And thank you. Six months of harrassment: yes/no/maybe. I cannot live anymore like this.\n\nThen she added, Why? I have lost my mind.\n\nGruffudd's Twitter account is set to private.\n\nIn an interview with The Guardian in February 2020, the Fantastic Four star implied that his busy work schedule and extended periods away from home have hurt his marriage.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGruffudd said that he Evans have struggled the past four years, making time for each other because physically we're apart.\n\nAlice had come back, she had been away for a week. I was showing off – 'the kids are in bed' – and she was [like], 'Yeah, you've done one week [alone], try six months,' he said at the time.
Farrah Fawcett was destined to be a star.\n\nThe future Charlie's Angels icon was in her freshman year studying microbiology when she was named one of the 10 most beautiful coeds on the University of Texas campus. It was 1968.\n\nFARRAH FAWCETT MAINTAINED CLOSE BONDS WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS AFTER BECOMING FAMOUS\n\nAs a result, her photos were sent to various agencies in Hollywood before it caught the eye of agent David Mirisch. He took two years trying to convince a young Fawcett to leave behind Texas for Hollywood. By junior year, she finally agreed.\n\nCloser Weekly reported she was quickly signed by Screen Gems to a contract that paid her $350 a week.\n\nHer father was shocked, wondering what she was doing to make so much money a week, Mike Pingel, Fawcett's former assistant who currently runs CharliesAngels.com, told Closer Weekly. … Fans have told me when they saw her in those commercials, they were like, 'Who is that girl?' She just had the 'It' girl look.\n\nFawcett was soon in demand for TV guest roles for shows such as I Dream of Jeannie, Myra Breckinridge and The Flying Nun, just to name a few. But it was a poster that would forever change her life.\n\n'CHARLIE'S ANGELS' STAR JACLYN SMITH REFLECTS ON BATTLING BREAST CANCER\n\nAccording to the publication, Fawcett was approached in 1976 by Pro-Arts, Inc. to become their newest pinup. Fawcett agreed and 40 rolls of film were shot by photographer Bruce McBroom, the choice coming down to the famous one of her in the one-piece red swimsuit. That image reportedly remains the best-selling poster in history. The sultry image is currently enshrined at the Smithsonian.\n\nThe combination of that poster with 'Charlie's Angels' was a phenomenon that was hard to escape, said Pingel. Something like 12 million boys plus had that poster on their walls, so it's hard to avoid the big smile, big hair and that bathing suit.\n\nIt was also that same year when Jill Munroe came calling.\n\nCloser Weekly noted that Fawcett and then-husband, The Six Million Dollar Man star Lee Majors, often played tennis with producer Aaron Spelling, which led to her being cast as the heavenly blonde bombshell in the 1976 movie Charlie's Angels, which spawned the series that ran from that same year until 1981.\n\nCHERYL LADD EXPLAINS WHY SHE NEARLY TURNED DOWN ROLE\n\nCharlie's Angels was based on a wealthy mystery man named Charlie who ran a detective agency featuring three beautiful women (Fawcett, Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith). It was an immediate hit.\n\n… These three women were not only breaking the ceiling of being three leads on their own show, but they were number one in the ratings, Pingel explained. It was just lightning in a bottle. … The funny thing is that many of them told me that they were working so hard all the time, they had no time to really understand what was going on until they had a break. Then they would go out in public and be mobbed. And they all had stalkers; people were trying to break into their homes. [Co-star] Cheryl Ladd said, 'One day I was nobody and the next day everything I ate was something interesting to someone.\n\nBut despite the show's success, Fawcett was ready to spread her wings even further. The Guardian reported that after Season 1, she left.\n\nAt that point, I think she was like, 'I'm pretty good at doing something like this,' said Pingel. Farrah was wanting to expand her acting. The progression came and at the end of the first season, she wanted more as an actress. People are going to hate me for saying this, but she was done with the 'cookie-cutter' Jill Munroe, the beautiful girl that episode after episode did the same thing.\n\nPingel added Fawcett also knew her worth.\n\nSUZANNE SOMERS TALKS 'THREE'S COMPANY' FIRING\n\nEven in '77 she knew the power of her imagery and what money can come with that, and what she's worth as far as that's concerned, he explained. They were only offering her 2.5 percent of the merchandise. At that point, she already had her own poster coming out; she knew she wanted much more than that for her image and her rights. And that's why she didn't sign the contract. She kept saying to them, 'Can we renegotiate this?'\n\nCloser Weekly noted Fawcett was allowed to leave the show but was contractually obliged to make guest appearances six times, which she did. Ladd, who played Munroe's sister Kris, would go on to replace her.\n\nNot only did Fawcett stayed busy professionally, but she was also focusing on her personal life. Her marriage to Majors lasted from 1973 until 1982. And while her relationship with actor Ryan O'Neal was on again/off again for a number of years, they welcomed a son, Redmond James Fawcett-O'Neal, in 1985. Fawcett and O'Neal remained together in the last decade of the star's life.\n\nPingel said he had zero regrets working alongside the star.\n\nWhen I was being asked to even interview for the job, I was like, 'I don't really want this job, because I don't want Farrah Fawcett to be yelling at me at some point,' he admitted. And at some point that is gonna happen, because you're an assistant. But honestly, we had such a great rapport in our working relationship. … she was just a down home country girl. Very sweet, but the smartest businesswoman I've ever met. She knew the value of her and she wasn't going to take anything less than what she valued herself for.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFawcett passed away in 2009 at age 62 from anal cancer. Pingel said it's still difficult to think about his former boss all these years later.\n\nIt's tough for all of us who were very close to her, he explained. Because she had such a way about her. Such sweetness and just a genuine, amazing person. She's gone way too soon; she had so much more to offer… It's been 10 years this summer, and it's still hard to even wrap my head around the fact that she's no longer her. I know that's a weird thing to say. Believe it or not, I'll be in a store and I'll see something and still be like, 'Oh, Farrah would love that. I should call her.'\n\nShe was a boss. She was a friend. She was an angel, added Pingel.\n\nBut Fawcett's legacy lives on. Closer Weekly noted the Farrah Fawcett Foundation was designed to help with patient care and financial assistance for those battling cancer.\n\nBack in April 2018, Jaclyn Smith told Fox News she still cherishes fond memories from her times on Charlie's Angels.\n\nWe had laughs, we had so many laughs, said the now-73-year-old. Angels in chains, being chained together. Eating lunch together. It was an education and it was eye-opening because each girl was so unique with her own personality and style. And these are my friends today. That bond is what I really remember.\n\nThe friendship is what I treasure from that. The friendship. Aaron Spelling was so dear to me. He's somebody I miss. He was a personal friend, as well as the producer of that show and the creator. We've lost some people. John Forsythe, what a gentleman. David Doyle. And of course Farrah [Fawcett]. It's bittersweet to think back.

The marriage of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip has lasted for over 70 years — yet it hasn't escaped rumors of alleged affairs.\n\nBritish author Ingrid Seward, who is also editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, has been covering the royals since the 1980s and has written over 20 books on the subject. Her latest one, My Husband and I: The Inside Story of 70 Years of Royal Marriage, analyzes the lasting union between Elizabeth, 92 and Philip, 97.\n\nIn the book, Seward investigates allegations of Philip's affairs that have lingered for decades. As previously reported by Town & Country, the Duke of Edinburgh has been linked to numerous women, most notably Pat Kirkwood in the '30s and '40s, a stage actress whose legs were coined the eighth wonder of the world.\n\nPhilip and Kirkwood reportedly met on seven different occasions, the first of which Philip went to her dressing room before a performance in London in 1948. That initial meeting purportedly led to dinner and dancing until dawn. Elizabeth, who was then a princess, was eight months pregnant with Prince Charles at the time.\n\nAccording to the U.K.'s Mirror, Kirkwood denied claims of any illicit relationship with Prince Phillip until her death in 2007 at age 86.\n\nIn my research, I never got a conclusive answer, Seward told Fox News about all the rumors. There's so much gossip about Philip and his affairs, but all the women that deny it, that have been picked out of possibilities of having affairs — well, most of them are dead now. … And Philip himself obviously denies it.\n\nIn 2012, The Telegraph reported royal biographer and historian Michael Thornton had custody of the letters between Philip and Kirkwood. Thornton claimed he wasn't allowed, by the terms of Kirkwood's will, to show the letters to anyone except the person who will be chosen as Philip's official biographer after his death.\n\nHowever, the publication noted nothing in the letters confirmed anything improper occurred between the prince and the showgirl.\n\nThe Telegraph added it was photographer Baron Nahum who introduced his pal Philip to Kirkwood at the London Hippodrome, where she was headlining in the revue Starlight Roof. Thornton claimed Kirkwood was reportedly upset that Philip never released an official denial of the affair to protect her reputation.\n\nKirkwood reportedly wrote to Philip, … if there had been some support from your direction, the matter could have been squashed years ago, instead of (my) having to battle a sea of sharks single-handed.\n\nPhilip replied, Short of starting libel proceedings, there is absolutely nothing to be done. Invasion of privacy, invention and false quotations are the bane of our existence.\n\nKirkwood reportedly went on to tell one journalist: A lady is not normally expected to defend her honor. It is the gentleman who should do that. I would have had a happier and easier life if Prince Philip, instead of coming uninvited to my dressing room, had gone home to his pregnant wife on the night in question.\n\nIn addition to Kirkwood, Philip has also been linked to other actresses, including Helene Cordet, Merle Oberon and Anna Massey. People magazine previously reported rumors persisted that Philip was actually the father — not the godfather — of Cordet's two children. She called the paternity gossip ridiculous and claimed they were fathered by French fighter pilot Marcel Boisot.\n\nNo one is saying anything [about these stories] and probably won't until after the queen dies, said Seward. No one will say anything because anything would be very hurtful to her if indeed they were true. But, there are lots of stories. You can't ignore it.\n\nIn 2017, Netflix's The Crown implied Philip may have had an affair with Russian ballerina Galina Ulanova in the 1950s. However, People noted there is no evidence that a relationship ever occurred.\n\nPeople have often said, 'He must have been unfaithful,' but there is no solid evidence for that, said the show's historical consultant Robert Lacey to the publication. When you've seen the episodes, you get the feeling why people made that supposition. But there is no evidence for it.\n\nThere was one woman who rocked the royal household — and it wasn't an alleged mistress.\n\nSeward revealed that despite tabloids claiming Philip never welcomed his former daughter-in-law Princess Diana when she said I do to his son Charles in 1981, the pair did connect before her seemingly fairytale marriage fell apart by rumors of his infidelity.\n\nHe did everything he could to help her, said Seward. And he wrote these very charming letters saying, 'I too was an outsider and it's very difficult to marry into this family.' … But when the marriage started to fall apart, she became very difficult. And his tone got harsher. And at the end Diana says… that she hated him.\n\nShe absolutely hated him. But to begin with they had a very good relationship. It just deteriorated as Diana's marriage deteriorated. Philip's reasoning for this was that her actions were derogatory to the monarchy. … [He felt] if people are reading all these stories, they will lose respect for the royal family and that's what worried him. And sadly, by the end, she wasn't on speaking terms with him.\n\nDiana and Charles officially divorced in 1996. In 1997, Diana passed away at age 36 after suffering from injuries she sustained in a Paris car crash.\n\nDespite all the gossip and scandals Elizabeth and Philip had to face over the years, their bond endured.\n\nIt's quite extraordinary really, said Seward. … In those days, it wasn't quite so unusual to have a young girl fall in love with someone and stay in love with them. But she never really looked at anyone else once she met him. He was just gorgeous. He was so handsome, tall, blonde and very funny. And you know, women love funny men.\n\n… I think women just adored him because he was such a handsome specimen. … And he has an amazing charm when he wants to use it, an amazing charm. He's a very interesting character. … Whatever he may have done in his private life, no one has really put their finger on that. He's always put his duty to the queen first.
After five years of dating, Blake Shelton stunned Gwen Stefani with a marriage proposal near the end of 2020, leaving their fan bases equally excited for what's to come.\n\nThe possibility of walking down the aisle for a second time is one Stefani, 51, had been frequently asked about in interviews and by fans during the power couple's dating years. The former No Doubt singer filed for divorce from Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale in 2015 after 20 years together. Similarly, Shelton endured a public divorce from country star Miranda Lambert after four years of marriage. He was also previously married to and divorced from Kaynette Williams.\n\nJust months into their engagement, Stefani and Shelton have both opened up about their past and future, including details of the country star getting down on one knee to what they have in store for a future ceremony.\n\nHere's a look back at their romance and all the things the musicians have said about their love since becoming one step closer to officially saying I do.\n\nBLAKE SHELTON REVEALS HE HID GWEN STEFANI'S ENGAGEMENT RING IN HIS TRUCK FOR 'ABOUT A WEEK'\n\nThe proposal\n\nOn Oct. 27, 2020, Stefani shared the big news on Instagram with a snap showing her kissing the country music singer while holding her left hand up to the camera, showing off her new ring.\n\n@blakeshelton yes please! she captioned the snap.\n\nShelton posted the same picture of the pair and captioned it: thanks for saving my 2020... And the rest of my life.. I love you. I heard a YES!\n\nDuring an appearance on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon in January, Stefani called the proposal magical.\n\nGWEN STEFANI AND BLAKE SHELTON ANNOUNCE ENGAGEMENT\n\nWasn't expecting it at the moment it happened at all, she admitted. Didn't have any idea.\n\nI was sort of like, 'What's happening with us?' Stefani added about their relationship before Shelton, 44, finally asked her to marry him.\n\nInvolving Stefani's kids\n\nStefani shares three sons – Kingston, 14, Zuma, 12, and Apollo, 6 – with Rossdale. Shelton has no kids of his own but has seemingly grown close to Stefani's children.\n\nShortly after announcing their engagement, reports claimed that Shelton even asked Stefani's sons for their permission to wed the star before proposing.\n\nA source close to Stefani told People magazine that Shelton reached out to her children before getting down on one knee and proposing to his longtime love.\n\n10 CELEBRITIES WHO GOT ENGAGED IN 2020\n\nBlake told her boys that he wanted to propose and ask their permission, the source alleged to the outlet. Her family very much approves of him. He's an amazing partner and a great dad to the boys. Gwen is ecstatic. The proposal was a surprise.\n\nPlus, the boys will have a large part in the upcoming nuptials, said the source.\n\nGwen's sons are just really solid, sweet kids, and they're so excited for Blake and Gwen to get married, the insider shared. They can't wait to stand by their sides.\n\nWedding plans\n\nStefani and Shelton followed in the footsteps of a bevy of other Hollywood stars who became engaged in 2020, an unprecedented year given the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe health crisis is still surging around the globe, meaning the date of the duo's future ceremony is unknown. Earlier this month, Stefani admitted to Fallon that they have no plans because of the pandemic.\n\nAlso, back in December, Stefani appeared on On Air with Ryan Seacrest, where she spilled details of her dream nuptials to the country star and how the pandemic will impact it.\n\nIt's so funny to even say 'engaged.' It feels so weird. People have been saying it for so long, like five years, 'Are you getting married? Are you engaged?' And now we actually are and it feels like I'm in a cartoon or something, Stefani told Seacrest, via People magazine.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Let Me Reintroduce Myself singer said her one request is for her parents to be in attendance when she walks down the aisle, noting that the global pandemic makes it difficult to nail down a date.\n\nI would say I just want my parents there at this point. My parents wouldn't come to Thanksgiving because they're so scared, so really would rather it not be a COVID situation. Like, I would rather not have masks and that kind of thing, Stefani said.\n\nStefani, her boys and Shelton have reportedly been spending most of their time during the pandemic at Shelton's Oklahoma ranch.

For that same time period, Love is Blind garnered more than 350,000 social media engagements, such as comments, retweets and likes, according to the outlet.\n\nThat rate of engagement would be considered extremely high, Talkwalker's marketing operations manager, Rafael Sternbach-Le Noury, told the Journal.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nDozens of fan pages have been created on Facebook – some with more than 7,500 members.\n\nGood, bad and ugly, viewers had a lot to say about Love is Blind.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nBy shortly after 2 a.m. on Thursday – the scheduled finale date – people were eager to see how the show ends.\n\nNETFLIX CEO'S NEW BOOK TO SHED LIGHT ON STREAMING GIANT'S WORK CULTURE\n\nWhile the show's creator and executive producer Chris Coelen would not give the Journal any spoilers, he shared some useful information about how the ending: Without giving anything away, the people who decided to get married, anybody that does that is still together today, he said.

Candace Cameron Bure began the New Year with words of encouragement to her fans, but soon after she found herself caught in another controversy on social media.\n\nThe Fuller House actress responded to a swarm of criticism she received after sharing a family photo on Instagram in which she shared well wishes for a positive 2021.\n\nHappy New Year from the Bures!! Looking forward to what 2021 has in store. I'm praying for unity, grace, humility, compassion and love for mankind. With God, all things are possible 🙏🏻. Sending virtual hugs and kisses! XO, Bure captioned the pic, which features herself, her husband, Valeri Bure, and their kids Natasha, 22, Lev, 20 and Maksim, 18.\n\nThe 44-year-old was none too pleased when some claimed the photo looked weird and like a Ralph Lauren ad, while others mocked some of her kids' expressions.\n\nCANDACE CAMERON BURE SAYS SHE'D RATHER 'SHARE JESUS WITH PEOPLE' THAN RETURN TO 'THE VIEW'\n\nWow- I post a family photo and you all find everything you don't like about it or can make fun of. Do better than that. Please, Bure responded.\n\nBure noted the photo was taken by her Fuller House co-star Dave Coulier's wife, photographer Melissa Coulier. The married couple and their youngest, Maksim, smile for the photo, while Natasha and Lev have more serious faces as they pose around a porch.\n\nNatasha caught wind of the backlash over her expression and sarcastically commented, Omg!!!! I didn't smile or look at the camera sue me!!!\n\nBure's daughter then added: Vibes.\n\nWhile the backlash dominated the photo shortly after it was posted, some of Bure's famous pals reacted with kind words.\n\nCANDACE CAMERON BURE ON WHY SEX 'IS SOMETHING TO BE CELEBRATED AS A CHRISTIAN'\n\nPretty in white, actress Kristin Chenoweth replied, referring to the form-fitting white dress Bure wears in the pic.\n\nThe most beautiful family inside and out, trainer Kira Stokes commented.\n\nI'm buyin what ur sellin! celebrity hair stylist Paul Norton said.\n\nFormer Disney star Christy Carlson Romano wrote: Slayyyyyy Bures!!!!\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Hallmark actress' dismissal of social media trolls comes months after she was shamed for posting a photo with her husband that showed him cupping one of her breasts. The pic did not sit well with members of her Christian fan base, who sounded off in similar critical remarks. At the time, Bure felt no remorse for sharing the pic, writing, Classic Val. He approved this post.\n\nBure also clapped back, revealing that she found the backlash funny and added that she and her husband of nearly 25 years have so much fun together.\n\nLater, in an interview with Fox News, Bure said she felt like she needed to respond to the backlash because she doesn't ever feel that sexual intimacy has to be lacking in marriage.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI love the fact that so many people had an opinion on it. It made me laugh because I wasn't trying to make a statement, she said of the cheeky photo. This is just how my husband and I are. You know, we adore each other and we still have fun and we're spicy together.\n\nWe have a playful, loving marriage and I think that's why we're still married 24 years later, she continued. But I did respond because I always get bummed out when people have been married for so long and then I feel like the joke is always like, 'Oh, we're married – so that means we don't have sex anymore.' And it's kind of like that a lot. And so I thought it was just a cute, funny picture and it was playful and it's very much reflective of our personalities in real life.\n\nFox News' Stephanie Nolasco contributed to this report.
A man from New Jersey has been charged with disorderly conduct after setting off fireworks in celebration of his buddy's engagement — and scaring the living daylights out of everyone within earshot.\n\nNathan Sanders, 23, had arranged to set off the fireworks outside of an indoor rock-climbing facility in Howell Township, to coincide with a marriage proposal his friend was planning on Wednesday. However, the sound of the fireworks was mistaken for gunfire, and immediately caused panic at the adjacent Xscape movie theater, according to Howell Township police.\n\nMOM ACCIDENTALLY RECORDS OWN REACTION INSTEAD OF DAUGHTER'S PROPOSAL\n\nSome patrons believed the gunfire to be coming from inside the theater. Police responded to the scene, but could not immediately confirm there was an actual shooting.\n\nPatrons of the movie theater were evacuated and detained during the preliminary investigation.\n\nAccording to police, a manager at the movie theater had discovered that Sanders, from Lakewood, had set off fireworks outside of the adjacent Climb Zone. Law enforcement soon discovered the remnants of discharged fireworks nearby.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nSanders was placed under arrest and charged with a fireworks infraction and disorderly conduct, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHe was released from custody the same evening.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMr. Sanders lit off the fireworks while a friend was proposing marriage. There was no intent to cause panic to theatre patrons, police wrote on Facebook.\n\nObviously this was a very poor decision rather than an overt act.
Evangelist Franklin Graham shared a hopeful message on Fox & Friends Friday for anyone suffering amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn addition to the COVID-19 crisis, Graham said: And all of us go through catastrophic events in our life: marriage problems, health problems, so forth.\n\nFRANKLIN GRAHAM ASKS IF PELOSI PROMISED 10 REPUBLICANS 'PIECES OF SILVER' TO BETRAY TRUMP\n\nThe president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association wrote the forward to Who's in Charge of a World That Suffers? authored by his father, the late Rev. Billy Graham, in 1981 and is now being rereleased.\n\nEven though my father's been dead for two years, his voice is still being heard and this is a book that can help change your life right here in the middle of this pandemic, said Graham, who is also the CEO of Samaritan's Purse.\n\nThe preacher shared a faith-filled message, quoting from John 3:16 and giving a call for salvation, asking anyone who hasn't made the decision to follow Christ to do so today.\n\nGod made us and he created us and he loves us. He sent his son Jesus Christ from heaven to this earth to take our sins. He died on the cross. He rose again from the grave. He's alive and he can come into each and every heart that invites him, he said.\n\nMAX LUCADO: YOU'LL GET THROUGH THIS — WHATEVER MESS YOU'RE FACING GOD WILL USE FOR GOOD\n\nExplaining pain and suffering, Graham said the devil wants to destroy everything as the god of this age, adding, but we know that if we put our faith and trust in Christ, we come under his shelter, we come under his protection, and nobody can snatch us out of his hand.\n\nGraham also thanked President Trump and his administration for their efforts protecting religious freedom ahead of National Religious Freedom Day Saturday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAbout 260 million people live in areas where they are persecuted for their faith. You had, I believe it was around 3,000 Christians, close to 4,000 that lost their lives because of their faith in God. Churches were destroyed. Close to 10,000 churches were attacked and destroyed last year, so religious freedom is very important and I appreciate the fact that Donald Trump made this a big issue in his administration, he said in part.\n\nI hope that Joe Biden will see the value of religious freedom and that he will protect it as well, Graham concluded.
The following is a look at the faith of the top 2020 Democratic presidential candidates:\n\nPete Buttigieg: Episcopalian\n\nFormer Mayor of South Bend, Ind., Pete Buttigieg was baptized Catholic but says he did not consider participating in the church because he is gay. He eventually settled on the Episcopal Church, the American branch of Anglicanism and a progressive branch, which voted to allow same-sex marriages.\n\nI was reluctant to talk about (religion) for a long time, Buttigieg told CNN. But after he married his husband, Chasten Glezman, at the Cathedral of St. James, and declared his candidacy, he has pointed to his faith on the campaign trail.\n\nHe questioned whether President Trump believes in God, called Vice President Mike Pence a cheerleader for the porn-star presidency, and condemned conservative Christians as moral hypocrites for supporting the Trump administration.\n\nAmy Klobuchar: Congregationalist\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she is a Congregationalist, a member of the United Church of Christ, and her husband is Catholic.\n\nFaith is very important to me, it helped me get through my dad's addiction. I think everyone should be able to practice whatever religion they want in this country, Klobuchar said during a CNN town hall. That's the United States of America. Or not practice religion. But for me that's a very important part of my life.\n\nBernie Sanders: Jewish\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told the New York Times he is proud to be Jewish but is not actively involved in organized religion.\n\nI am Jewish, Sanders told the Times' editorial board when asked whether he believes in God. I am proud to be Jewish. I was bar mitzvahed from the Kings Highway Jewish Center, a long time ago. I am not actively involved in organized religion.\n\nSanders says he believes in God and freedom of religion in contrast to President Trump, whom he says practices discrimination by restricting immigration from a number of Muslim-majority countries.\n\nJoe Biden: Roman Catholic\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden has not been shy about his Roman Catholic faith, with which he has always identified.\n\nI find great solace in my faith, Biden told NPR in 2017. I happen to be a Roman Catholic, a practicing Catholic … I found that, for me, the externalities of my faith bring me a sense of peace. … My son died, and he had this set of rosaries on and I've been wearing it since and I will wear it till I die. … I'm not saying when I pray the rosary God's gonna help me — it's just solace.\n\nThe former senator was denied communion at a Catholic church in South Carolina for his support for abortion rights, which he refused to comment on saying it was his personal life. He also diverges from the church's official stance on LGBTQ rights, backing same-sex marriage.\n\nElizabeth Warren: Methodist\n\nAlthough Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she grew up as a Methodist, she attends various churches and told a CNN town hall that she taught Sunday School to fifth graders.\n\nMy faith animates all that I do, Warren told reporters at the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition's annual convention in Chicago. I truly do believe in the worth of every single human being.\n\nTom Steyer: Episcopalian\n\nThe billionaire-turned-liberal activist Tom Steyer was raised by a Jewish father and Episcopalian mother, and he said he was taken to synagogue and church and given the option to choose synagogue, church, or neither.\n\nAt 30 years old, he told his mom he believes in God. He has adamantly pushed for impeachment against President Trump and fighting climate change, and says it is informed by his Christian faith.\n\nSteyer told ABC News' Journeys of Faith with Paula Faris every day he inks a Jerusalem cross on his hand to remind himself to do the right thing.\n\nMichael Bloomberg: Jewish\n\nBillionaire and former mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg is running for president out of his own pocket but in 2007 he lamented America was never going to elect a short, divorced Jewish billionaire commander-in-chief.\n\nAccording to a 2010 story in The Wall Street Journal, Judaism never took a stronghold in the New York mayor's own life, his advisers and other observers say. He believes in God, but is more likely to be found at church for a political event than temple for worship. He grew up among very few Jews in Medford, Massachusetts, but his family maintained some traditions, such as a kosher kitchen and Hebrew school.\n\nA member of the Temple Emanu-El, the Upper East Side Reform synagogue, Bloomberg didn't raise either of his daughters Jewish nor is his current companion Jewish.\n\nAndrew Yang: Progressive Christian\n\nWith a campaign slogan Humanity First and MATH hats to counter Trump's MAGA hats, businessman-turned-politician Andrew Yang defends his signature campaign promise, the freedom dividend, or a universal basic income of $1,000/month for every American, using his pastor, Rev. Dr. Mark Mast.\n\nI was brought up in an entirely secular household, Yang told the H3 Podcast in December. His wife, Evelyn is a Christian and together they are raising their kids in the church.\n\nThe church we belong to is very progressive. They've got a rainbow flag up out front, he added about the Reformed Church of New Paltz. Certainly I'm very excited to have my little boys in that kind of environment because I can see that they love it.\n\nTulsi Gabbard: Hindu\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii became the first Hindu to join either chamber of Congress, sworn in on the Bhagavad Gita in 2013, but on her website, she highlights being raised in a multi-faith family studying both the Christian and Hindu scriptures.\n\nShe grew up celebrating Christmas and Janmashtami, the birth of Krishna, and she says, rather than saying I'm 'religious,' it would be more accurate to say that I am a very spiritual person, and yoga and meditation are the focus of my spiritual practices.\n\nGabbard, the first female combat veteran to run for president, said her faith was put to the test while she served in Iraq. She married her husband, Abraham Williams, in 2015 in a traditional Vedic wedding ceremony.
Last month, Chinese leader Xi Jinping reportedly made China's wealthiest man Jack Ma disappear. Here at home, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey made the president of the United States disappear. Both of these moves were shows of strength. And the parallels between them should shake every American to their core.\n\nSilicon Valley tech giants like Twitter and Facebook are now, undisputedly, the most powerful companies in the history of the world. The Dutch East India Company wielded a private militia, but it still couldn't control what people said and read.\n\nAs of today, President Trump will have access to neither the nuclear codes nor a Twitter account. But our new class of unelected corporate monarchs now controls whether and how Americans can hear any democratically elected president in the future.\n\nJUDGE ANDREW P. NAPOLITANO: FREE SPEECH, THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND OUR MODERN TECH-FILLED WORLD\n\nThis is the power of the 21st-century Leviathan, far more insidious than anything Thomas Hobbes imagined. It's the unholy marriage between big government and big business, through which corporations operate as the extended tentacles of the state.\n\nIt's the birth of woke capitalism – a toxic new brew of profit-seeking and wokeism. It's a cultural revolution perpetuated not just by politicians, but by the leaders of big corporations – especially in Silicon Valley.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nDon't private companies get to decide who uses their platforms? Yes – if they're actually behaving as private companies. But in reality, today's corporate behemoths in Silicon Valley are effectively doing the work of big government under the cloak of private enterprise to evade constitutional constraints. Here's how the game works.\n\nFirst, Congress endowed big tech with the special corporate privilege of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that immunizes technology companies from any liability in state court for censoring or otherwise regulating user content.\n\nSecond, liberal congressmen threatened those same companies at hearings for the last year saying that if they fail to remove hate speech from White nationalists, they would be punished.\n\nThird, liberal lawmakers congratulated social media companies after they go on to censor content that Democrats don't like.\n\nFourth, tech titans took their most aggressive actions of all just as Democrats are poised to have control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives for the first time in over a decade.\n\nAnd fifth – of course – Silicon Valley billionaires made staggeringly one-sided campaign contributions to those same Democratic candidates as a show of good faith, and to remind them where their bread is buttered.\n\nIn 2020, keeping money out of politics ceased to be a liberal mantra. Instead, blending profits with politics became the new progressive way. Consequently, we have devolved from a three-branch federal government to one with a headquarters in Silicon Valley and a branch office in Washington D.C., and with no pesky constitutional term limits for Jack Dorsey and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nHopefully, victories in court against today's new class of state-like actors will spawn a cultural revival that steadily restores the voice of every American.\n\nThe great challenge for today's conservative movement isn't to simply dismantle big government. It's to dismantle the powerful henchmen of big government in the private sector. They can fire you, tarnish your reputation, excise you from the Internet and cancel your identity. You can either speak your mind freely or enjoy the comforts of modern life. But you can no longer safely do both.\n\nConservative solutions must be prudent, not merely reactionary. Enacting regulations out of spite will only favor big business leaders who deftly capture the regulatory process. Likewise, repealing Section 230 would be a boon to big tech in the long run. The statute was a bad mistake but repealing it now would simply empower Silicon Valley's titans against smaller startups since larger companies can better withstand legal liability.\n\nInstead, the right first step is to work through the last institutional bastion that we can trust – our court system – to recognize that state action dressed up as private business is still state action. The First Amendment applies to big tech censorship, a view supported by certain Supreme Court precedents.\n\nHopefully, victories in court against today's new class of state-like actors will spawn a cultural revival that steadily restores the voice of every American – in their places of work and their sites of worship, at the dinner table and on the Internet.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNo doubt this will be difficult for both populist conservatives and classical free-market conservatives to swallow. But to borrow from Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, we're not in 1980 anymore. The problem isn't just big government; it's the woke-industrial complex. Defeating that monster should be the defining challenge of the new conservative movement.\n\nIf we succeed, the prize is worth winning: a revival of true democracy and true capitalism in America. To save both, we need to disentangle each from the other. The leaders who help the Republican Party understand this new reality will hold the keys to the GOP's future – and more importantly, our country's future as well.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM VIVEK RAMASWAMY
Just two months after Enrique Pena Nieto's tenure as Mexico's president came to an end, his wife has announced that she's divorcing him.\n\nAngelica Rivera, the former first lady, took to Instagram on Friday to announce that after nearly nine years of marriage she would be divorcing Nieto.\n\nToday all my energy, strength and love are focused on continuing to be a good mother, on recovering my life and my professional career, Rivera said, according to a translation of a post made in Spanish.\n\nShe said she had always given her all to her marriage and deeply regrets this very painful situation.\n\nRumors circulated earlier this week that the couple split back in December. Nieto's six-year term ended Dec. 1.\n\nThe pair, who wed in November 2010, were last seen together in January at the funeral of a prominent leader of his Institutional Revolutionary Party. Their last official public appearance was on Sept. 15, for Mexican Independence Day celebrations.\n\nMEXICAN JOURNALIST KILLED IN GULF COAST STATE OF TABASCO\n\nBeyond Mexico's soaring murder rates and strained diplomacy with U.S., Nieto's presidency was mired in scandal and corruption cases -- one even involving Rivera.\n\nIn 2014, many Mexicans were outraged when it was reported that Rivera was living in a multimillion-dollar home registered to a builder who'd been awarded public contracts.\n\nRivera, a onetime telenovela actress, claimed she had paid for the mansion legitimately with earnings from her acting career. She said she was selling her stake in the property.\n\nAccording to local reports, the couple remain cordial. This was the second marriage for both Nieto and Rivera. Nieto and his three children remain in Mexico, while Rivera and her children have gone to her residence in the United States.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
People often ask what the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would say today. No need to second guess. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\n\nSurely, the violence at the U.S. Capitol would have broken his heart, as would the partisan witch hunts that seem to multiply daily.\n\nWe adopt the means of nonviolence because our end is a community at peace with itself, he once said. We will try to persuade with our words, but if our words fail, we will try to persuade with our acts.\n\nREMEMBERING MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.\n\nMy earliest memory of my uncle was his marriage to Coretta. I was the flower girl at the wedding, which took place on the lawn of my aunt's parent's house in Marion, Ala., in June 1953. I was almost 3 years old. My early memories were just like snapshots, yet I knew even then that I was a member of a family whose faith in God was the driving force.\n\nMy granddaddy, Rev. Martin Luther King Sr., and my grandmother, Alberta Williams King, instilled in their three children, Christine, Martin and Alfred, that the King Family Legacy is one established by God, in faith, hope and love. It was that faith, that deep and consequential love of God, that brought my family to a level of leadership of the 20th-century civil rights movement.\n\nNonviolence is absolute commitment to the way of love. Love is not emotional bash; it is not empty sentimentalism, Uncle ML said. It is the active outpouring of one's whole being into the being of another.\n\nWe were also taught that forgiveness must be bestowed willingly, freely and without conditions. Those were lessons we fell back on many times as we were called on to forgive, publicly and sincerely, the most heinous of crimes.\n\nIt's true we lived in the spotlight, and many of the civil rights leaders passed through our homes on a regular basis during their journey. Yet, in many ways, we were just a normal family. My daddy, Rev. A.D. King, would wrestle with his older brother, Uncle ML, while the family chuckled in the background. They were playful and joyful and growing up around them was a lot of fun.\n\nI have decided to stick with love, my uncle famously said. Hate is too great a burden to bear.\n\nWhen Uncle ML was assassinated in 1968, I was 17 years old and in the restive way of teenagers, I wanted to blame all White people. I wanted to give hate room to grow in my heart. But my mother and father and my grandparents and Uncle ML reminded all of us that hate only begets more hate, and there should not be room in the world for animosity or mistrust or hostility.\n\nWhen my uncle was killed on April 4, 1968, I remember talking to my daddy about my feelings of hating White people. Daddy rocked me in his arms and said to me, White people march with us, they go to jail with us, they pray with us, they live with us, and they die with us. White people didn't kill your uncle, the Devil did.\n\nThe next year I was called to forgive again – not only those still-unknown people who had killed my uncle, but now they had killed my father. I had to forgive yet another injustice; including all those that had shrugged off my daddy's death and called it a suicide.\n\nDuring this time from 1968 to 1974, much was happening in my life. I became engaged to be married in 1968, a bride in 1969, and a mother in 1970. Still reeling from the brutal deaths of my daddy and uncle I experienced two abortions and a miscarriage. Then on June 30, 1974, my beloved grandmother Alberta King was murdered while playing the Lord's Prayer on the organ during Sunday services at Historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nBack then I didn't think my broken heart was big enough to forgive and to go on loving my fellow men and women. But love and forgiveness were the King family legacy, and while that legacy sometimes felt like a burden, I see now how it is a gift.\n\nI have decided to stick with love, my uncle famously said. Hate is too great a burden to bear.\n\nThat's what he would tell us today, and what I say whenever I am given an opportunity. This year, as we observe MLK Day, I urge everyone to remember that it is designated not as a day off from work, but as a day on of service. We can all find something constructive to do in our communities, even if it's just shaking the hand of the neighbor who supported a different candidate. Anything we can do to increase the peace is more than worth our efforts.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLove, my Uncle ML said, is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend.\n\nWhen we learn to value the human personality, and understand that we are one blood and one human race, we can learn to live together as brothers and sisters and we won't perish as fools.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM ALVEDA KING
A group that advocates for religious liberty in the military says the U.S. Air Force Academy should cancel a planned speech by a Chick-fil-A executive.\n\nThe Military Religious Freedom Foundation said Wednesday the company has a history of supporting anti-gay causes and that Rodney Bullard, a Chick-fil-A vice president and academy graduate, shouldn't speak at the school's upcoming leadership conference.\n\nBullard said the company and its charitable foundation don't fund anti-gay programs. He says Chick-fil-A's foundation funds programs to help children in poverty, including groups that work with LGBQT youth.\n\nChick-fil-A has faced accusations that it is anti-gay since 2012 when its president, Dan Cathy, publicly opposed gay marriage. The company has said Cathy's statements are his personal views.\n\nThe academy said it invited speakers with a variety of backgrounds and perspectives, and conference participants choose which talks to attend.
After coming out as a lesbian and revealing she has a girlfriend, Real Housewives of Orange County star Braunwyn Windham-Burke revealed that she would be heartbroken if her husband were to move on with another woman.\n\nLast month, the 43-year-old reality TV star came out during an interview with GLAAD. At the time, she also revealed that she started dating a 28-year-old woman named Kris. However, the mom of seven explained that her husband, Sean Burke, is supportive and they're working on what to do with their 20-year marriage in light of her revelation.\n\nThe star conducted a Q&A Saturday on her Instagram Story, where she was asked about her marriage. She revealed that they both want to stay married but acknowledged that divorce might be in the cards. In response to another question about Sean moving on with another woman, Braunwyn admitted she would be heartbroken if that happened. Sean, who was sitting beside her during the Q&A, noted that he'll likely date other people, but isn't sure when.\n\nYeah, it kinda sucks cause it's hard, figuring it out, he said of the situation with his wife's new relationship.\n\n'REAL HOUSEWIVES OF BEVERLY HILLS' STAR ERIKA GIRARDI SPLITS FROM HUSBAND TOM AFTER 21-YEAR MARRIAGE\n\nIt didn't take long before Braunwyn's followers called her out for being selfish by barring her husband from doing exactly what she did. The star noted that she is indeed being unfair but explained that's why they're currently in therapy together.\n\nWe are working through this. We can't figure this out on our own. This is a lot … This is hard and we're working it out, she explained.\n\nHowever, she also noted that she is not keeping Sean from doing anything or forcing him to do anything he doesn't want to do. Although unique, they're both trying to manage their family situation from a place of transparency and honesty.\n\n'UMBRELLA ACADEMY' STAR ELLIOT PAGE COMES OUT AS TRANSGENDER\n\nI don't own Sean, she said in response to a question.
