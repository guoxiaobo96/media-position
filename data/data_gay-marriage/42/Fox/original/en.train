Activists say Argentina now leads the world in transgender rights after it granted people the right to change their legal and physical gender identity simply because they want to, without having to undergo judicial, psychiatric and medical procedures beforehand.\n\nThe gender identity law that won congressional approval with a 55-0 Senate vote Wednesday night is the latest in a growing list of bold moves on social issues by the Argentine government, which also legalized gay marriage two years ago. These changes primarily affect minority groups, but they are fundamental, President Cristina Fernandez has said, for a democratic society still shaking off the human rights violations of the 1976-1983 dictatorship and the paternalism of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nActivists and academics who have tracked gender identity laws and customs worldwide said Thursday that no other country has gone so far to embrace gender self-determination. In the United States and Europe, transgender people must submit to physical and mental health exams and get past a series of other hurdles before getting sex-change treatments.\n\nArgentina's law also is the first to give citizens the right to change their legal gender without first changing their bodies, said Justus Eisfeld, co-director of Global Action for Trans Equality in New York.\n\nThe fact that there are no medical requirements at all — no surgery, no hormone treatment and no diagnosis — is a real game changer and completely unique in the world. It is light years ahead of the vast majority of countries, including the US, and significantly ahead of even the most advanced countries, said Eisfeld, who researched the laws of the 47 countries for the Council of Europe's human rights commission.\n\nMarcela Romero, who was born a man but got a sex-change operation 25 years ago, had to spend 10 years making his case in Argentina's courts before a judge ordered the civil registry to give her a new identity card listing her gender as female. It's something humiliating ... many of us have had to endure psychiatric and physical tests, she told The Associated Press on Thursday. With this law we'll no longer have to go through this.\n\nRomero, 48, said she personally knows 40 people who had to get judicial approval for sex-change operations, and are still on waiting lists. The law should help them get the treatment they need, she said.\n\nRomero leads the Argentine Transvestite, Transsexual and Transgender Association, whose legal team helped draft the law with help from an international coalition of activist groups pushing for governments to drop barriers to people determining their own gender identity. None of those groups have managed to find politicians willing to go as far as Argentina's, however.\n\nThis law is saying that we're not going to require you to live as a man or a woman, or to change your anatomy in some way. They're saying that what you say you are is what you are. And that's extraordinary, said Katrina Karkazis, a Stanford University bioethicist who wrote Fixing Sex, a study of the legal and medical boundaries around gender identity issues in the United States.\n\nRather than our more sedimented ideas about what it is to be male or female, this sort of throws all of that up in the air in a really exciting way, she said.\n\nNext up for Argentina's government is an overhaul of the country's civil and penal codes, an often-contradictory conglomeration of laws dating back nearly two centuries that cover all aspects of society. Encouraged by the president, congressional commissions representing all leading parties and the Supreme Court are drafting draft wide-ranging legislation to modernize how the country deals with abortion, adoption, artificial insemination, divorce and many other difficult issues.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church, which had an outsized role in forming these codes over the country's 200-year history, has opposed many social reforms, and not just those affecting gay, lesbian and transgender people.\n\nThe Argentine lawmakers are introducing profound changes in society that don't respond to any social demand and without taking into account the real consequences, Nicolas Lafferriere, who directs the church-sponsored Center for Bioethics, Personhood and Family, complained Thursday in Religious Values, an online publication sponsored by the archbishop of Buenos Aires.\n\nWe have found ourselves faced with the most permissive law in the world in this area. Now, to change all the civil registries you don't need any more justification than a personal desire, based on someone's self-perception. It won't be easy to predict the consequences. Lafferriere warned.\n\nMost Argentines still identify themselves as Catholic, and Catholicism remains the nation's official religion.\n\nBut fewer and fewer Argentines regularly attend Mass, and local priests and bishops don't have the same power of the pulpit anymore. The church but has become so weakened politically that the government has treated it more like a useful enemy than a force capable of influencing vast numbers of voters.\n\nThe Catholic hierarchy also has been inexorably linked with the military junta that killed as many as 30,000 people during the dictatorship. Both enforced conservative social values at the time.\n\nKarla Oser, 38, underwent hormone therapy before surgeons transformed her male organ into a vagina in 2006, becoming one of only 40 people to have sex-reassignment surgery at a public hospital in the provincial capital of La Plata over the years. But first, she said, she had to present a judge with testimony from two psychologists, a psychiatrist, an ear-nose-and-throat specialist, a gynecologist and a urologist.\n\nEven after her sex-reassignment surgery, she has failed to get judicial permission to update her national identity card to reflect her new gender, according to a public health ministry announcement. But the law gives her hope, she said: The operation changed my life and today I'm celebrating that everyone who faces a situation similar to mine can get their surgery without having to make it through the judicial labyrinth I went through.\n\nThe ministry quoted Oser as part of an announcement saying government surgeons are now open for business, ready to provide similar treatment for anyone who decides they want it — no more questions asked.\n\n___\n\nAnita Snow in Mexico City and Almudena Calatrava in Buenos Aires contributed to this report.

This is a rush transcript from The Ingraham Angle, March 2, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham. This is The Ingraham Angle from Washington tonight. Joe Biden's win in South Carolina, well force Amy and Pete to drop out and they're both in Texas tonight and they're at the rally to endorse him and that's where our own Raymond Arroyo is tonight. You've wondered where he was for the past week. He was just getting ready for tonight. He's going to join us throughout the hour, and he's been all over these rallies.\n\nAnd while Pete and Amy came out for Joe, well Bernie spent his Super Tuesday eve with Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is here on what that might mean. Plus, HHS Secretary Alex Azar is here for a Coronavirus update. Dr. Drew Pinsky, he's going to tell us why the media coverage of this virus has been actually dangerous and counterproductive.\n\nAlso, former NFL player Jack Brewer, he was viciously attacked after he called Trump, America's first black President. He's here tonight to defend those comments and respond to the haters.\n\nBut first, and now there are four. Well at least serious ones. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.\n\nAfter the New Hampshire primary, I warned Democrats that they didn't have much time. Bernie won New Hampshire and won huge in Nevada and then old Joe Biden won big in South Carolina on Saturday. Remember winning Iowa which Pete Buttigieg did by a hair meant absolutely nothing. He dropped out last night and Klobuchar today. Of course, she's gone, both endorsing Biden.\n\nNow, tomorrow is Super Tuesday and the moderates, they're out of time. For the progressives, its Sanders and Warren and in the moderate lane, Bloomberg and Biden. Because of early voting, which we conservatives have always been against. Biden's Joementum may be blunted.\n\nBernie's followers were jacked up very early in this whole process and if Biden does, let's say, he does really, really well, better than expected tomorrow. Well, Bernie's at that point of real trouble. The Beltway media will work to write-off Bernie completely and quickly. But if it turns out the way most people think and Bernie does well tomorrow, enormous pressure will be brought to bear on Bloomberg to drop out to help Biden out.\n\nAnd frankly, also on Warren to drop out to help Bernie finish off Biden. And then prominent elected Democrats, they're going to begin lining up for their choice.\n\nNow, even if they manage to pull off this Biden rescue effort, the question is, can Biden himself really withstand the rigors of a grueling campaign.\n\nHe seems to be having a lot of trouble lately. And it's pretty apparent that if Biden wins the nomination and somehow, and somehow beat Trump, heaven forbid, he'd just be a figurehead President doing whatever Washington wants and then the swamp wins again.\n\nIt will be donors who set the policy on China and immigration, and then throw a bone at the hard left. They'll get to pick the judges. A power coalition from hell, if you ask me. Now what we're seeing is the beginning of the Democrat establishment's rebellion against the will of its own voters. They don't want Sanders, a socialist to get the nomination despite the fact that he's the frontrunner in the polls and has won two of the last four primaries and caucuses.\n\nBut what's happening to Bernie, if you think about it is somewhat similar to what the GOP establishment tried to do to Trump back in 2016. They hated him. They tried their hardest to rally the party around Jeb Bush. But that dog wouldn't hunt. Jeb dropped out after South Carolina, even after George W., Nikki Haley and Lindsey Graham all tried to stop Trump there, but guess what, Donald Trump won anyway.\n\nAnd then Marco Rubio, he dropped out after Florida, lost that, that was his home state. Then Kasich flopped. You know you'd forgotten about him, right.\n\nWell, he flopped everywhere, except Ohio. But he hung on until he lost all credibility. It was so bad for him that he didn't even speak at the RNC which was held in the state in which he's governor.\n\nBut watching everything play out over the last 72 hours or so, it's clear that the Democrat machine is trying desperately to claw back power. Claw back power from the radicals that they let run free in Washington for the last year. They made huge mistakes underestimating the power of the AOC crowd over the last year and of course, the Democrat establishment. They're not helped by the fact that it has a terribly weak candidate, Joe Biden.\n\nIt's far more difficult to prop up Biden now who is mentally collapsing in public.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Tomorrow's superstar Suzie. I was waiting for a black man to pick me up and take me to a total of 147 miles south to Washington D.C. to be sworn in as President and Vice President of the United States of America.\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident. All men and women created by the - you know the thing.\n\nJack, thank you very much.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right, its Chris.\n\nBIDEN: Chris. I just did Chris. No, no. I just did Chuck.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: The fact is most of the excitement and the momentum is on the Left and it's behind Bernie. And it's reflected in the polls. Nationally, Bernie is polling eight points above Biden and his lead is even starker and most of the 14 states set to vote on Super Tuesday tomorrow. He's currently polling on average of 15 points ahead of everyone else in California, the state with the most delegates. Bernie is pulling ahead in eight of the 14 states set for tomorrow. Meanwhile, Biden leads in just four states.\n\nAnd until those states, North Carolina and Oklahoma, his lead is a very narrow one and he's almost out of cash.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The problem is a former Vice President, two-term Vice President, Obama's guy should be just sucking in money, he's broke. That shows a lack of enthusiasm not just at the grassroots level where he needed that, but also at the top. He's not filling stadiums like Bernie Sanders.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: No, he's not filling stadiums, he's not in close, he'd be lucky. Look at fill the local Elks Club. Just look at the massive crowds Bernie drew in California yesterday.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The establishment is getting very, very nervous. The corporate elites are getting nervous and the political establishment is getting nervous as well. And some of the leaders in the Democratic establishment are saying, my God, look at the turnout here. What's going on.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Back up. Meanwhile, Joe Biden, he's just relegated to - I don't know after he wins in South Carolina, he did this little video that I saw on Twitter where he and Jill, his wife were essentially begging for money.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBIDEN: South Carolina, I'm going to use all the time, all the time, you're the launching pad. This is the biggest deal so far in this campaign. So, thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nJILL BIDEN, JOE BIDEN'S WIFE: Thank you for your love and your kindness. And so, we're going forward, so can you chip in $5, $10 because we're going to power forward and win this race.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Won't you help, Joe. This was sad with. The audio quality wasn't so great either, but it's just a presidential campaign. I was thinking about this tonight. Democrats remember how they love to scream power to the people. But in the end, it may just be power to the donors who were all pulling out, all the stops to end Bernie's second quest for the presidency. And reports tonight say, he's starting to bring in the cash, but Democrats should really learn the lessons of history. Biden is the new Jeb, except he's old and make zero sense.\n\nBoth are kind of low energy, but nice guys with good resumes. Neither generate the type of excitement that successful candidates for the presidency usually need to have. The battle in November should obviously be Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump, not Trump versus Obama nostalgia.\n\nIf Obama's policies were so effective, Hillary would have glided past Trump in 2016. But Obama's policies didn't deliver the rising wages or business optimism that Trump's have. And for his liberal supporters, this failure has only driven them into the arms of a socialist.\n\nAmericans deserve a real choice. Capitalism versus socialism. That's a choice and letting people decide for themselves will tell us what the country thinks of Trump's America First conservatism versus Sanders collectivism.\n\nMay the best man, not the most influential block of donors wins. And that's The Angle.\n\nSpeaking of Bernie Sanders, on the eve of the most important day in the 2020 primary, he chose to host a rally with Ilhan Omar. Now, it just goes to show you that she and the rest of the Squad are the political force to be reckoned with that I told you they were back in March of last year, when I was scoffed at for saying that.\n\nThey're not the amateurs who Nancy Pelosi once tried to brush off. Joining me now, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Congressman, given Omar's past anti-Semitism, kind of a denier of al-Qaeda. What does this tell you about Bernie Sanders values?\n\nREP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, R-CALIF.: It tells a lot, because of the contrast. Look, where he was in Minnesota, you know what's happening in Washington today? APAC. Here is Bernie. He'll promote communist Cuba, but he will not praise Israel. Who does he want introducing him tonight? Omar. Omar who introduced a boycott divestiture and sanctions bill against Israel themselves. That shows that Pelosi folded to these socialist freshmen at the beginning of this year.\n\nDo you remember when AOC at the very beginning had a meeting with Speaker Pelosi. AOC didn't tweet out the picture. Pelosi did. The Speaker of the House tweeting a picture out with the freshmen. She has succumbed to letting these socialist take over.\n\nINGRAHAM: You see my point and THE ANGLE tonight. I mean you saw what happened in 2016. The people wanted one thing and a lot of the donors wanted something else. And Donald Trump said basically, I'm going to beat the Bush's, the Obama's, the media, Hollywood, I'm going to take them all on because I think they're all destructive to America. And he clear cut the whole field. He clear cut the Republican, the Democrat, the moderate, because he was bold, and he had the energy. The Democrats are in a pickle here. They're in a real pickle.\n\nMCCARTHY: And he did it with about one-third of all the money Bloomberg has already spent. That's things no one talks about.\n\nINGRAHAM: There's going to be pressure on Bloomberg correct to get out.\n\nMCCARTHY: Oh! Yes.\n\nINGRAHAM: So, he and Warren are both going to have huge pressure brought to bear to get out. Clarify this race after tomorrow.\n\nMCCARTHY: I personally believe beating Biden would be easier for President Trump. And I don't know where these Democrats get behind. Bernie has a crowd. Biden does not. Bernie knows what states he's in. Biden does not.\n\nBernie knows that he's running for President, not the Senate. Biden does not.\n\nINGRAHAM: I personally think that debate is actually really important for the country to have because these kids are getting taught all about collectivism and socialism and the wonders of Sweden and France and its heyday and if we only did socialism right, it would be great. And it's not fair now. This is what they're being taught. So, it's kind of time we had this debate once and for all. And I would love to see Bernie versus Trump debate that the wonders of socialism versus the power of the Trump economy. I think that's necessary frankly.\n\nMCCARTHY: I think it has to. I think it's something that's been brewing for quite some time. You look at what's been happening in Congress, another with the Democrats. It's a fight about to happen and we ought to have it, but we better make sure we win it. Socialism versus freedom.\n\nINGRAHAM: There was an interesting moment where Biden's campaign manager, or spokeswoman Katie Bedingfield was asked about the Obama endorsement and is it ever coming, does it matter? This is how she tries to answer.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is the Vice President disappointed that he hasn't gotten that sort of public show of support at this sort of very critical point in the race from Barack Obama?\n\nKATIE BEDINGFIELD, JOE BIDEN 2020 CAMPAIGN DEPUTY MANAGER: No, of course not. He said from the outset that he didn't want it, that he didn't think that that was right. And that coming out of the gate, he needed to earn this on his own merit.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMCCARTHY: Look, there's only four left and he still can't decide if he's going to endorse Joe Biden. If there was any power to that endorsement, it would have happened today. It's not going to matter anymore. And I think what you find with Obama. He sees that Bernie is going to win this thing, that Bernie has the momentum. This is where the Democratic Party has moved, a Socialist Democratic Party.\n\nLook, how much politics they want to play. The dirty little secret. We have a Coronavirus. We have government funding that we need to fund this. You know what, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker did. She withheld the bill last week. You know why? So, the DCCC could run ads against seven Republicans.\n\nINGRAHAM: How many people ran ads on the Coronavirus fundraising appeals?\n\nMCCARTHY: I don't know how many ran but they actually took the Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee, spent money, went into these seven Republican seats to campaign against them about the Coronavirus, when she's the Speaker of the House. Instead of putting America first, she put her politics first and held the bill from coming to the floor.\n\nINGRAHAM: But she said last week that this is the time for the parties to come together, Congressman.\n\nMCCARTHY: She is politics all the time. That's exactly what she did from the Powerhouse. And think of this, all those Democrats had an opportunity last week to denounce what Bernie said about Cuba. Not one of them voted against what he said.\n\nINGRAHAM: Obama, he's smart. He's not - he is not going to jump on this grenade right now. He's a - but if his policies were so smart, Hillary would have won in 2016 and they like Obama the man and the personality, because he's cool and he's a great campaigner and he has a great family. I don't think the policies ended up being as popular as the man. That's the problem.\n\nMCCARTHY: You had to have a magic wand to have this economy. We just needed somebody who understood the economy.\n\nINGRAHAM: Congressman, great to see you tonight. Thanks so much for coming on.\n\nMCCARTHY: Thank you.\n\nINGRAHAM: And Joe Biden tonight hosting an event in Dallas after snagging endorsements from 2020 also ran, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke, our own Raymond Arroyo is at Biden's event tonight. And it's still going on. Raymond, what did the voters tell you?\n\nRAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Laura, we're here at Gillies where several hundred Biden supporters are here. Now, they have some lingering concerns about the Left's or the Democrat establishment's last best hope.\n\nWatch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nARROYO: There are a lot of stories emerging about the mental acuity of Joe Biden. People worried about his recall, the slippage of facts. Does that concern you in a debate situation?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, it does.\n\nARROYO: What particularly?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everything.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't think the slipups matter. I think where he stands in his heart and in his mind and who he surrounds himself with is going to make the difference.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I wish he was younger, but he's the best we got. So, you've got to just go with the best.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am concerned about it as far as the debate performance with - you know going up against the other side with Trump. But like the gentleman before me said, I'll take that any day of the week compared to the vile man that sits in the White House right now.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We volunteered for him in 2008 when he was running back then, and I see no difference between now and then.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: If we're going to talk about a few gaffes here and there, let's talk about the President tongue tied that we currently have.\n\nARROYO: Are you concerned?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: A little bit. Yes.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's one of the reasons why I could not vote with my conscience for Joe Biden. I don't have to worry about mental issues. We already have mental issues in the White House.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely. It's very concerning. I mean when he's getting softballs thrown at him and he can't answer the question, it's going to be even rougher, it's getting rougher. It hasn't - the hard times haven't even started. He needs to get some rest.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nARROYO: Laura, these were the Democratic supporters of Joe Biden waiting to get in here tonight. There are only a few hundred people, maybe 700, 800 people here tonight, but there's almost a defeatism in the air that he's their only hope, so they've got to keep going with this.\n\nBut the feeling here is odd. There's not the excitement or the drama of a Trump rally for instance or even a Bernie Sanders rally. This is very different. It has the feeling of the Bob Dole campaign without the war hero.\n\nINGRAHAM: Well, Raymond, it looks like Beto. I'd almost forgotten about him. He just wrapped up there.\n\nARROYO: Yes. No, it's like a reunion of all the also ran, Laura. They have come together, and you know Joe Biden, he talks at the audience. He doesn't talk with them. And you know somebody told me where I got talked to on the way in. Gillies is known for urban cowboy and though there aren't many urban cowboys. There was a lot of mechanical bull tonight. So, I'll leave it there.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right. Raymond, thank you so much for being there. We'll check back with you later in the hour with more. Be careful out there. All right. Ahead, he was called an Uncle Tom for calling Trump the first black President. Former NFL player Jack Brewer is next. He'll respond to all the critics and then Candace Owens and Leo Terrell debate. That's coming up.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJACK BREWER, FORMER NFL PLAYER: I've got to say this it's Black History Month, man, you the first black president.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Though he obviously didn't mean it literally, the remarks you just heard from former football star Jack Brewer sparked outrage on the Left.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKEITH BOYKIN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: The reality is, he doesn't care about black people, except as a potential voting bloc. He has not made any serious effort to reach black people. The idea that anybody would sit in the room with Donald Trump and call him the first black president after we had Barack Obama as the President of the United States shows just what kind of Uncle Toms were sitting in that room in the first place.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Joining me now is Jack Brewer, former NFL player. Jack, CNN analyst calling you an Uncle Tom. Your reaction.\n\nBREWER: You know what Laura, I have been called so many names, this attack on me started a long time ago after I wrote my first article telling the truth about the Clintons and exposing them. And you know I'm a black man and I have served the black community all of my life, and I've done it tirelessly. And so, for me it goes back to all those poor kids in Haiti that I serve and watching the Obama administration misappropriate over $14 billion leaving the first black nation in the world in desolate, just destruction.\n\nAnd it was terrible--\n\nINGRAHAM: Let's keep on Trump. We don't have time to get to Obama. But with Donald Trump, it is - Fox's poll, registered voters, not likely voters say that his approval rate is 13 percent among African Americans. I think it's probably higher than that and especially among likely voters.\n\nBREWER: Yes.\n\nINGRAHAM: But he only got 8 percent last time of the black vote. It's been a ceiling it seems that figure although it's a little higher than some would have thought. You know, I'm stunned that he can't get more than that in this election, if he can't get more than that, because to me, he's been pretty good for all Americans, especially those at the - who have been really struggling to you know make more money in a blue collar economy.\n\nBREWER: Laura, it's misrepresentation. It's people that are uneducated on the facts. And so, the reason I said what I said was to stir the pot and expose the evilness that is really going on. I mean for folks to really deny the fact that Donald Trump has helped black people as much as he has, the policies, Laura. I mean the man gave HBCUs long-term funding when the administrations before him would never do that. They made these black schools continue to come back and beg and beg for money.\n\nI mean the criminal justice reform. You look at criminal justice reform Laura, and you say, the Obama administration sat there with Joe Biden who actually wrote the crime bill that locked up a mass incarcerating millions of black men, taking the fathers out of our homes. How can that not upset black America when President Obama sits in office for eight years and doesn't release these folks. Why does Donald Trump have to give Alice Johnson clemency? I mean these things go on and on again and you can't argue the facts and the facts are that Donald Trump has passed more policies for black folks than any President since Lincoln.\n\nINGRAHAM: You stand by your comment. He's the first black president, you obviously didn't mean that literally, but your comment was really--\n\nBREWER: Not literally. Laura listen, blacks called President Bill Clinton the first black president because--\n\nINGRAHAM: Good point.\n\nBREWER: He sat in the Oval Office and had a woman give him oral sex and bragged on that, and now the fact that I say that, now I'm getting bashed. They're talking about me and my family. Listen, I take the high road. I'm a man of God and I know that spiritually in this nation, there has been over 20 million black babies aborted and we've completely changed and went against the Bible. Change what the Constitution of marriage means. I stand against that Laura, adamantly as a believer of Jesus Christ. I walk by faith and not by sight.\n\nINGRAHAM: Jack, thank you for coming on. I think that people need to know--\n\nBREWER: Thank you.\n\nINGRAHAM: That there is not a monolith among African Americans about this President because it's distorted and it really, really bugs me. Thank you so much for coming on.\n\nBREWER: And I will be in the community serving our people, I'll tell you that.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right. Joining me now is Candice Owens, Founder of the Blexit Organization, author of Blackout. Also, with me Leo Terrell, Civil Rights Attorney. All right, Candace, you were with - at that meeting with Jack Brewer. What did you think about his remarks?\n\nCANDACE OWENS, FOUNDER, BLEXIT ORGANIZATION: Look, plain and simple. It was absolutely amazing. The meeting was extra special and especially because you've seen in the pass, the Left, they have these meetings when they're with the President, always hip-hop artist and rappers. I mean was it pandering when Bernie Sanders sat down with Cardi B, was it pandering when Hillary Clinton brought up hot sauce and did a Beyoncc concert. Was it pandering this past weekend when Bernie Sanders did a Public Enemy concert?\n\nAnybody actually realistically thinks Bernie Sanders listens to Public Enemy and Cardi B. Absolutely not. That's pandering.\n\nTrump sits us down in the cabinet room and asks us what we need and how he's doing as a President. If he's actually uplifting our communities, that's offering us a literal seat at the table to make the decisions, that's actually respecting black Americans, not because there's some novelty of you rap and disrespect and tell people that are younger than you that they should continue this pattern of disrespect. He actually genuinely respects black America and that's why I view him as the first black president. I respect that.\n\nINGRAHAM: Leo, your reaction to what Jack said and also to what Candace just said.\n\nLEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Thank you very much, Laura. This is sort of very embarrassing for what Jack said, ignored the fact that we had a black president in this country. And you mentioned the poll, the numbers that are staggering. Wall Street Journal. How can he or Candance call Trump, the first black president when less than 12 percent of the black population supports Trump right now. That's not even a majority. That's nothing. 12 percent.\n\nHere's the other part, Laura. I saw the picture of Candace, Diamond and Silk Jack in that room with Trump. I would ask you, ask the Fox viewers, where are the qualifications of these African Americans, where's the experience. Laura, your resume - you can go in the government right now, but none of the people, look at those people in that picture, what's their college education? What's their government experience? How can they sit there and tell us what policies are for blacks? I don't know any of their qualifications.\n\nINGRAHAM: OK.\n\nTERRELL: That is not true representative, Laura. They're not representatives.\n\nINGRAHAM: Well, when the Obamas entertained--\n\nOWENS: Jay-Z and Beyonce, what were their qualifications.\n\nTERRELL: Let Laura talk, Candace.\n\nINGRAHAM: No, they're very talented in their field, their talented in their field. And I would never deny that. But when we're bringing in celebrities to offer advice on policies, which look a lot of administrations have done this. Republican and Democrat.\n\nTERRELL: Oh! Yes, Laura.\n\nINGRAHAM: We don't - people sit there and criticize that and oh, you can't criticize celebrities, because they're celebrities and they do work in the community. And when conservatives do work in the community, they also deserve credit, Leo, for doing that and not condescension in my view.\n\nTERRELL: Two quick points, Laura. Two quick points. There is no Condoleezza Rice in that meeting with Candace. There is no Colin Powell on a bloody Sunday. I didn't see Candace or Diamond and Silk or Jack in Selma, Alabama. I think any Trump representative said what Black people wanted to see, Laura. And that's one--\n\nINGRAHAM: They also want to see results.\n\nOWENS: They want to see results.\n\nTERRELL: They were there for a photo op.\n\nOWENS: This is truly the difference between the Left and the Right. People on the Left want to focus on the past. They always want to focus on black history. Right now, we have--\n\nTERRELL: My God, black history.\n\nOWENS: Focus on black future.\n\nTERRELL: Yes, black history.\n\nOWENS: Stop, don't cut me off, I just let you speak. He is focused on--\n\nTERRELL: This is Black History month.\n\nOWENS: What are the qualifications, every single person in that - that was sitting in that room has lived through being black in America under Democrat rule and has watched their families suffered tremendously. You had Angelista and King (ph), who was literally handcuffed to a bed in prison.\n\nTERRELL: Qualifications and experience--\n\nOWENS: And had to give birth. So, if you don't think that is meaningful--\n\nTERRELL: News flash.\n\nINGRAHAM: Quiet Leo.\n\nTERRELL: Black history month, Candace.\n\nOWENS: Stop cutting me off, Leo. Stop cutting me off.\n\nTERRELL: Candace, we celebrate Black History Month.\n\nOWENS: You don't think it was meaningful for somebody who was handcuffed to a prison, had to give birth, was forced to give birth, to sit next to a president and talk about what his policies, uplifting --\n\nTERRELL: There are no heavyweights in that room, Laura. There are no heavyweights in that room.\n\nINGRAHAM: So as long --\n\nOWENS: Leo, that's what you routinely do is discount the fact that there\n\nare experiences of black --\n\nTERRELL: We celebrate Black History Month, Candace, if you don't know that. Black History Month is celebrated. You should be proud of that.\n\nOWENS: Black future moving forward --\n\nTERRELL: And let me tell you right now, 13 percent of African-Americans,\n\n13 percent of African-Americans do not qualify calling Trump a black president. Shame on you. Shame on you.\n\nOWENS: First black president.\n\nINGRAHAM: We have got to roll.\n\nTERRELL: Thank you.\n\nINGRAHAM: Leo and Candace, always fun.\n\nTERRELL: Always.\n\nINGRAHAM: Ahead, HHS Secretary Alex Azar brings us the latest coronavirus updates. How does this compare to the regular flu?\n\nAnd has the media been irresponsibly hyping this virus? Dr. Drew Pinsky says yes. He is here to tell us why.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT: The risk to the American people of the coronavirus remains low. There is been a seamless relationship between all the agencies with the federal government and states thus far. Within the next 12 hours, there will be 100 percent screening all direct flights at all airports across Italy and across South Korea.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: It's good, it's about time. And today, the coronavirus claimed the lives of three senior citizens at a nursing home outside of Seattle, bringing the death toll in the U.S. to six. So far the only virus deaths have been in Washington and mostly among the elderly. There are now over 100 confirmed cases reported throughout the country, and that figure includes Americans flown back from that Diamond Princess cruise line. This comes as President Trump met with pharmaceutical executives today about when we might see a coronavirus vaccine on the market.\n\nJoining me now with all the latest is HHS Secretary Alex Azar. Mr. Secretary, thanks for being here. I know you've had a jam-packed schedule. How is the administration feeling about where we are today given the number now that is ticked up somewhat over the past week?\n\nALEX AZAR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: What we are trying to convey to the American people is the risk remains low for any individual American. The president has taken very aggressive actions, historically unprecedented actions to protect the American people so that risk has stayed low, but that can change at any time. As you mentioned, we are seeing some person-to-person transmission in the United States. We are seeing some community spreading. That's where we don't have anyone tied to travel to China or to Japan.\n\nBut we had and an important announcement just before I came on this show about America's preparedness for you that I'm going to give to you, which is we have expanded access to these N95 respirator masks for health care providers with a deregulatory action that I took this evening.\n\nINGRAHAM: OK, so everybody who needs the masks working in health care facilities, because that's where this thing spreads a lot, they have the mask.\n\nAZAR: So they have masks now. We are increasing the available supply. What we've done, people don't realize this, these masks are used by construction trades and miners. We have now approved an emergency use where those could be used for health care workers. It increases our supply in the United States dramatically for health care workers.\n\nINGRAHAM: Six corona deaths, as I said so far as of today, and so people get some sense of perspective. As of February 22nd, for the same period of time, we had 74 flu deaths. That's not to minimize the death of any individual. It's all tragic when it happens to you. But there is a panic in the United States. I was at the CVS pharmacy earlier today because I'm not feeling so well, and it really is like all of the antibacterial wipes are gone off the shelves. So how do you minimize and lower the panic factor of everyone just going about their daily lives, because that has obviously affected people.\n\nAZAR: I'm glad you're talking about that, Laura, because it's important we be balanced. There is no need for panic. There is no need for any individual person in America to change their daily life. You should always be prepared, but I'd tell you how to prepare today the same way I told you six months ago in terms of basic supplies and preparedness. CDC.gov has great advice on how to prepare.\n\nINGRAHAM: Wash your hands. Finally, people are washing their hands. That drives me crazy.\n\nAZAR: Yes, wash your hands. Just good old soap and water for a long time under warm, that is as good as that antibacterial soap.\n\nINGRAHAM: The attacks on the administration have been so disgusting on so many levels, and the media in particular, I think more so even than the Democrat folks, are using this to smear the administration in a number of ways. This is their favorite way. Watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This administration has been decimating the scientists.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a president who tried to change science with a sharpie.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is going to go short on science and long on science denial.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is also a president who hates science, right, and has no use for it.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Totally. Mr. Secretary, what is your reaction?\n\nAZAR: That is such colossal nonsense. Listen, back in the beginning of January when we were informed by the Chinese that they were facing this novel virus, we are standing up the National Security Council apparatus. I'm briefing the president of the United States. We are getting scientific advisors in there with the president. We are actually served doing surveillance of people coming in from Wuhan. We enact unprecedented controls on travel, the first federal quarantine in 50 years. And those same people attacked President Trump for taking those actions, and now the rest of the country is thanking him because he bought us time by doing those things.\n\nINGRAHAM: Bloomberg was on with Bret Baier tonight in a town hall, and he dove into this. Watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHEATHER ALSUP-MORTON, U.S. ARMY DOCTORATE OF NURSING PRACTICE AT GMU: How would you respond to the current coronavirus if you are president?\n\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG, D-FORMER NEW YORK MAYOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: For a start, we wouldn't be in this situation.\n\nThe president has been involved in trying to influence the reporting of what is going on, how many people have caught it, how many people have died.\n\nThe real thing that leaves me uncomfortable is we haven't done the planning and don't have the right people in place.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: No planning, I think testing kids, don't have enough testing kids.\n\nAZAR: Laura, do you mind if I take that on? The notion of no planning, because I personally led our pandemic flu planning efforts in the Bush administration. We just in 2017 updated our pandemic plan, which is the playbook that we use for this.\n\nAnd then, the right people? The right people -- Tony Fauci, Robert Redfield, Bob Cadlack (ph), Deb Birx. The right people, this is the best public health team you could ever assemble to protect the American people.\n\nINGRAHAM: So he is a virus killer, too, Bloomberg. The virus wouldn't be here. I don't even know how to respond to that. But it has got to be frustrating on the front lines of this, as you guys are, when you hear this kind of stuff, and it is taken seriously by the other party.\n\nAZAR: It is absolutely frustrating. I'll tell what's also frustrating is the fact that we are doing very bold things. As I told you, the president has taken unprecedented steps on my advice with Chinese flights, with federal quarantine. We stood up federal quarantine facilities on DOD bases because of our great relationship with Secretary Esper. This is unprecedented. And you know what, it's ruffled some feathers. And so they go to the media, and our political opponents try to politicize things. But we're going to take the hard measures to protect the American people.\n\nINGRAHAM: And we have the drugs that we need? We are not worried about drugs from China, getting all these drugs from China? We have to reexamine that?\n\nAZAR: So we do worry about our drug supply, Laura. President Trump is the one who brought to the fore concern about the supply of drugs coming through China. We only have 20 drugs that we have identified where we are sole sourced through China, and we've had one generic drug that is readily replaceable with a shortage identified so far.\n\nINGRAHAM: We've got to bring that home. We've got to bring that manufacturing home, but you can't get that done tonight.\n\nAZAR: Not tonight.\n\nINGRAHAM: Great to see you. I won't shake your hand because I'm not feeling well.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nINGRAHAM: See, that's the rule. I'm violating the rule.\n\nAZAR: We'll do the Ebola bump.\n\nINGRAHAM: Exactly. Good to see you, Mr. Secretary, thanks so much.\n\nNow, it's not just the Democrats who are recklessly politicizing the coronavirus threat. Their media lapdogs are at it as well.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The coronavirus outbreak has the potential to become a global pandemic.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a global health process, the spread of the coronavirus in the United States.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a serious threat, and Donald Trump needs to do his job.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It could get worse, and it could be precipitated by actions taken by the administration.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: My next guest says some of those in the media need to sit back and let the professionals do their work. Joining me now, Dr. Do Pinsky, an addiction medicine specialist, host of Dr. Drew After Dark podcast. Dr. Drew, how much damage is the media causing now the way they're covering this?\n\nDR. DREW PINSKY, ADDICTION MEDICINE SPECIALIST: Essentially the entire problem we are having is due to panic, not the virus. I was saying this six weeks ago. We have six deaths from the coronavirus, 18,000 deaths from the flu. Why isn't the message, get your flu vaccine? This is amongst us. It is milder than we thought. The fatality rate is going to drop as we identify more cases. The entirety of the problem now is that people are being pushed into bankruptcy. Travel is down. The supply chain is being interrupted because of panic, not because of the virus. The flu virus in this country is vastly more consequential, and nobody is talking about that.\n\nINGRAHAM: And Dr. Drew, I was traveling over the weekend, four different flights. And people are wearing masks on the plane. Now, it makes traveling kind of interesting, you can't really see their facial expressions. But that does zero to prevent you from getting the flu. Zero, correct?\n\nPINSKY: It's panic. It's panic. That is panic. That is people engaged in panicked behavior. And that is what concerns me. It is a press-induced panic that will have real consequences. It will not be the virus.\n\nListen, The Journal of the American Medical Association published lead articles this week about what they were reporting on the coronavirus. But one of the things they asked was why did the Chinese government clamp down so hard? Was there something special about this virus? The report was the reason was the holiday, the Chinese New Year was coming, and during the new year, apparently everybody travels, and they wanted to get it under control before the holiday, so they clamped down quickly. They got it under control. The holiday came, people traveled. It did not spread. They did exactly what they needed to do. And then we need to calm down. It is here, it's mild, and the press needs to shut up. It's really getting to be a problem.\n\nINGRAHAM: Dr. Drew, I love having you on. Thank you so much for joining us tonight.\n\nPINSKY: Pleasure.\n\nINGRAHAM: Will Biden supporters vote for Bernie if he is the nominee?\n\nRaymond Arroyo has more from Dallas when we return.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Would you support Bernie Sanders if he ends up being the nominee?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, I would not. I would write my own name and before checking his.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We'd have to think about it.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I would support a sandwich over Donald Trump.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I will never support Bernie Sanders. He is too old and I think he's too far left.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I would stand behind him.\n\nARROYO: He is so at odds Joe Biden. It is night and day from Joe Biden's policy.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I know he is, but we have to get Trump out.\n\nARROYO: No concerns about democratic socialism?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have concerns about it, but I have way more concerns about Trump.\n\nARROYO: Would you support Bernie Sanders if he is a nominee?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. No, I don't believe in what he is saying, plain and simple.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Fascinating, Joe Biden supporters telling our own Raymond Arroyo what they really think about Bernie, and some of it is ugly. And it suggests a huge problem down the road for whoever gets the nomination, which famed pollster John Zogby warned about in an op-ed today. Democrats in 2020 face a serious dilemma, if not a crisis. We can expect a real war for the nomination, and it will not be pretty. If Sanders outright wins the nomination, do not expect establishment figures and consultants to display support and party unity.\n\nBack with me now in Dallas is Raymond Arroyo, along with John Zogby, senior partner Zogby Strategies. All right, John, if Sanders does not get the nomination, will his supporters vote for his opponent in the general election?\n\nJOHN ZOGBY, FOUNDER OF THE ZOGBY POLL: Some will, but many will not. And even if he shakes hands and embraces Joe Biden, 18 to 29-year-olds, I think, are pretty clear that they're not ready to support someone other than Bernie. So I don't think they will vote for Trump, but I do believe they will not show up to vote.\n\nINGRAHAM: Raymond, we have been hearing forever that it's just anybody but Trump. But you found out when you were at the rally tonight, and it's still\n\ngoing on, people still trickling out, that that is not --\n\nRAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: They're gone.\n\nINGRAHAM: They're gone now. It's just the music in the background, or are you at bar? Where are you?\n\nARROYO: It's just the music on me. I'm looking for the bar now, Laura.\n\nINGRAHAM: You're getting the broom and sweeping up for the crowd. But a lot of them said they aren't going to vote. They will not vote for Bernie.\n\nIt's fascinating.\n\nARROYO: Laura, what unites the party at this moment, the Democratic Party, is their hatred of Trump. That seems to be it. Beyond that, when you start digging down to policy, when you start talking about Bernie Sanders, there is great divisions here.\n\nAnd frankly, this was a lackluster even tonight. This should have been the high point of Biden's campaign. It's certainly the most important and consequential rally of this primary season on the Democratic side. It didn't feel like it at Gilley's tonight. You had 700 people or so, and nobody out on the street. I think that's a real problem sign for the Biden campaign.\n\nAnd his speech tonight was kind of the boilerplate, and you almost felt he was going through the motions as well when he should have been grabbing that brass ring and saying, we're going to take this all the way home. It didn't have that feel.\n\nINGRAHAM: John, when I watched Amy Klobuchar get up tonight, she is endearing. There are something and something endearing about her as a person and as a candidate. And seeing her next to Joe Biden, I was like, they picked the wrong person here. The establishment is getting behind the wrong person. This is part of what she said. Watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR, D-MINN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I cannot think of a better way to end my campaign then joining his. It is because of your undying belief that for all of us, the best is yet to come.\n\nTomorrow is Super Tuesday. What I want all of you to do is vote for Joe.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: And the huge applause, John, after that, even though they ripped off Trump's best is yet to come line. But she kept it together. She had really nice stories. There was no malapropism. She didn't have a mental blackout. If I had to guess now, he is going to pick if he gets the nomination as his running mate.\n\nZOGBY: He may very well, and he could do worse. She is a good candidate, period. Let's not underestimate Joe Biden, however. There is a fundamental problem of disunity within the party between the left and the center, but Joe is still uncle Joe to many. And Joe was still vice president under a very popular Democratic president, and someone, Barack Obama, who is still very popular among independents as well. So I wouldn't underestimate Joe Biden's story going into this. But with a good running mate, I think it will be a competitive race anyway. The numbers just show it would be competitive race, Biden versus Trump.\n\nINGRAHAM: I want the conservative populist versus the socialist. We have to have a real debate in this country. That's going to be it. That's what I hope for, at least. All right, gentlemen, thank you so much.\n\nAnd coming up, we found the real reason Tom Steyer dropped out of the race.\n\nDon't tell anybody. Next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nINGRAHAM: It's time for tonight's Last Bite. Before Tom Steyer said goodbye from the campaign, he left us with this gem.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(MUSIC)\n\nTOM STEYER, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: OK, you guys, let's see what you got!\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Didn't old white guys realize they just cannot dance on stage in a political environment?\n\nThat's all the time we have tonight.

Sign up here.\n\nChristina Anstead has had to switch things up a bit during the coronavirus pandemic that continues to keep folks inside as the country is throwing everything in the face of COVID-19 to ease its spread.\n\nThe Christina On the Coast star said as much to Us Weekly on Friday and explained how she's adjusting to the new normal, making sure she gets the most out of herself every day.\n\nObviously, everybody's in a very different situation than we were a month ago. We're at home and we're all busy, but we definitely have more time to do things at home than we did before, Anstead, 36, said about her mission to refocus and try to stay positive while in quarantine.\n\nANT ANSTEAD ON CHRISTINA'S BLENDED FAMILY: 'NOBODY GIVES YOU A MANUAL'\n\nWhat we're doing here right now and what I'm doing [with] my kids is actually really cooking together, doing more projects together, doing exercises together, the mom of three said.\n\nThe Wellness Remodel co-author said the added time to herself and her family has allowed her to formulate a plan or a menu of sort for what she and her children will be eating each week, which she admitted to the publication has been a little bit different.\n\nTAREK EL MOUSSA RECALLS HITTING 'ROCK BOTTOM' IN 2016: IT WAS 'FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OF ABSOLUTE HELL'\n\nIt just leaves out like, 'Oh my gosh, I'm starving, there's nothing to eat. I'm gonna order pizza,' right? the Flip or Flop star explained. I see people snacking on all this junk and, like, we don't want to come out of this being like, 'Gosh, I really wish, you know, a month or two ago was sitting there eating all this junk all day long.'\n\nDespite remaining cooped up with new husband Ant Anstead and their 7-month-old son, Hudson London, during the pandemic, one thing that has remained consistent is the incredibly amicable relationship she has since formed with ex-husband Tarek El Moussa's girlfriend, Selling Sunset star Heather Rae Young – whom Anstead said she's been exchanging yummy recipes and dieting tips with.\n\nI feel like you could either look at this in a really negative way or you could just try to look at this, as far as like, 'OK, I have this time right now. How can I shift my mind and try to make things more positive?' Especially for people around us and people that we live with, Anstead said.\n\nTAREK EL MOUSSA IS 'HAPPY' FOR EX-WIFE CHRISTINA AND HER MARRIAGE TO ANT ANSTEAD: 'I'M GLAD SHE FOUND SOMEONE'\n\nThe HGTV star and El Moussa, 38, married back in 2009. The pair stayed married until 2018 when they divorced but not before they became parents to two children: Taylor, now 9, and Brayden, now 4.\n\nEl Moussa spoke to Fox News last month and echoed Anstead's sentiment on co-parenting, adding that he's proud of the way everyone has embraced the difficult task.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWe just do what's right for the kids. I mean, you know, kids, in any given situation, you can get 50 different answers, but the answer should always be what's right for the kids, he explained. And we just always stuck by that rule.
Kim Kardashian and Kanye West appear to be calling it quits, according to a new report.\n\nA source claimed to Page Six that divorce is imminent for the two.\n\nThey are keeping it low-key but they are done, the source further claimed. Kim has hired Laura Wasser and they are in settlement talks.\n\nWasser is a well-known divorce attorney in Hollywood and frequently oversees starry splits.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA REACTS TO KIM KARDASHIAN, KANYE WEST SPLIT REPORTS: 'REALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOALS'\n\nRepresentatives for Kardashian, West and Wasser did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, E! News reports that the couple is going their separate ways, but Kardashian has yet to officially file for divorce because she wants to be sure she's making the right decision for the kids, an insider says.\n\nThe 40-year-old reality star married the hip-hop icon, 43, in May 2014. They share four children: North, 7, Saint, 5, Chicago, 2, and Psalm, 1.\n\nTMZ also reports the two have been living separately for a few months and that their relationship was in deep trouble for the last half of 2020, with the pair reportedly in marriage counseling.\n\nWHAT WOULD BE AT STAKE IF KANYE WEST, KIM KARDASHIAN WERE TO DIVORCE? EXPERT WEIGHS IN\n\nKim got Kanye to go up there [to Wyoming] so they could live separate lives and quietly get things sorted out to separate and divorce. She's done, Page Six's insider echoed. Similarly, E! News' source claims that Kim knows the marriage is over. She's known for a while.\n\nAccording to TMZ, no final decision has been made, but the outlet reports that when it comes to divorce, to not bet against it.\n\nTrouble in paradise between the two was first reported over the summer when West announced his candidacy for president in the 2020 election.\n\nDuring what Kardashian later implied was an episode brought on by his bipolar disorder, West brought up the possibility of divorcing his wife at a campaign event while claiming they considered aborting their first child.\n\nEven if my wife wants to divorce me after this speech, she brought North into the world even when I didn't want to, West told a crowd while crying, according to People magazine.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN AND KANYE WEST 'SPEND A LOT OF TIME APART' BUT REMAIN FOCUSED ON KIDS\n\nIn a since-deleted tweet, the Power rapper also claimed that he'd been trying to divorce Kardashian ever since she attended a prison reform event with Meek Mill in 2018.\n\nIn the same rant, he also shaded Kardashian's past Playboy spread and claimed that the reality star's mother, Kris Jenner, was no longer allowed to see his children.\n\nHe later apologized for the Twitter rant but the ordeal reportedly left Kardashian furious.\n\nIn July, it was reported that the couple had been considering divorce for weeks and that Kardashian and her famous family were shielding her children from their father's public outbursts.\n\nLater that month, the stars were spotted having an emotional conversation in Wyoming, where the Yeezy founder owns a ranch and had been staying for a time over the summer.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN REPORTEDLY 'FURIOUS' AT KANYE WEST: A LOOK BACK AT THEIR RELATIONSHIP\n\nThings seemed to be better between the two as Kardashian showed support for her husband at one of his Sunday Service events in August and was also seen laughing with West in a family video that same month.\n\nLast month, however, it seems things may have taken a turn for the worse as reports surfaced that the two were leading separate lives and had been spending a lot of time apart.\n\nThe marriage is West's first and Kardashian's third. She was previously married to Damon Thomas from 2000 to 2004 and to basketball pro Kris Humphries from 2011 to 2013, though she filed for divorce after just 72 days of marriage.\n\nKardashian and West began dating in 2012 while the Skims creator was still legally married and became engaged just months after her divorce was finalized.\n\nPage Six's source claimed that the divorce is happening because Kim has grown up a lot.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN AND KANYE WEST LEADING 'SEPARATE LIVES' IN MARRIAGE: REPORT\n\nShe is serious about taking the bar exam and becoming a lawyer, she is serious about her prison reform campaign, they said. Meanwhile Kanye is talking about running for president and saying other crazy s–t, and she's just had enough of it.\n\nKardashian has voiced interest in becoming a lawyer and has devoted a relatively large amount of attention to prison reform. She's recently visited death row inmates Julius Jones and Brandon Bernard, even calling on President Trump to commute the latter's execution.\n\nThe insider also claimed that West attended Kardashian's extravagant island birthday party in October for only a single day.\n\nHe showed up late and left early, he wouldn't appear in any of their Instagram shots. All he did was bring over the hologram of her father Robert Kardashian, then got out of there as fast as he could, the source explained to Page Six.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN AND KANYE WEST HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING DIVORCE FOR WEEKS: REPORTS\n\nAdditionally, the couple's Calabasas home is reportedly a point of contention as Kardashian is asking for her husband to sign it over to her, as it's where the kids are based.\n\nThis isn't the first time they've been talking about a split, but this time it is way, way more serious, said the insider.\n\nA second source also confirmed the split to the outlet.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Kardashian and West have a lot of differences ranging from lifestyle to politics, but they both agree when it comes to parenting.\n\nPeople magazine reports that West is well aware of Kardashian's desire to get a divorce, though he's uncertain when exactly Kardashian will file the suit.\n\nHe knows that she's done, a source told the outlet. She has had enough, and she told him that she wants some space to figure out her future.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN LAUGHS WITH KANYE WEST IN FAMILY VIDEO FOLLOWING REPORTS OF MARITAL STRUGGLES\n\nThe source said that West is understandably feeling down about the whole situation.\n\nHe's okay. He's sad, but okay. He knows the inevitable will happen, and he knows that it's coming soon, they said.\n\nFurthermore, a second source told the outlet that while the divorce will happen eventually, Kardashian is waffling over the idea.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKardashian became Hollywood royalty alongside her mother Kris and sisters: Kourtney, 41, Khloé, 36, Kendall Jenner, 25, and Kylie Jenner, 23, as well as her 33-year-old brother, Rob.\n\nSeveral prominent figures have been a part of the famous family as well, including Caitlyn Jenner, Blac Chyna, Scott Disick and Tristan Thompson.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nWest rose to prominence via his rap music and has been regarded an innovator in the industry.

Joe Biden campaigned on pledges to unite the country and defeat the pandemic; he continues to stress these twin priorities. But his nominee to be secretary of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra, is a partisan culture warrior who undermines both pledges.\n\nThe Senate ought to reject Becerra's nomination.\n\nFirst off, Becerra isn't qualified for the job. Facing a once-in-a-century pandemic, one might think that Biden would nominate, say, a doctor or a seasoned health-care executive to oversee the federal response and vaccine distribution. Donald Trump's two HHS Secretaries fit that description.\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO: JOE BIDEN IS PRESIDENT, NOW WHAT\n\nBut Becerra is a lawyer and career politician. He served 12 terms in the House of Representatives before becoming California's attorney general in 2017. He has no experience in public health, large-scale logistics or other challenges of the pandemic.\n\nWhat Becerra lacks in public-health experience, however, he makes up for in enthusiasm for his party's most radical views.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nFor instance, Becerra has bragged that he absolutely supports Medicare-for-all, Bernie Sanders' $34 trillion proposal to eliminate private health-insurance coverage and replace it with government-run plans. This idea is so toxic that it sank several Democratic presidential campaigns.\n\nBut if confirmed, Becerra would oversee Medicare, Medicaid and other health-care programs, which he could use to get the camel's nose of socialized medicine under the tent of America's health-care system. A government takeover of our health-care system rightly terrifies many Americans, and this position alone is disqualifying for an HHS nominee.\n\nBecerra also belongs to the open-borders wing of his party. He has proposed to decriminalize illegal immigration, which could allow illegal aliens to receive government benefits such as Medicaid. Further, HHS has sensitive immigration responsibilities that a radical like Becerra would likely politicize.\n\nBut Becerra is most extreme when it comes to abortion. In Congress, he earned perfect scores from Planned Parenthood and NARAL by voting, for example, against the 2003 bill that banned partial-birth abortions. Becerra also cosponsored bills that would have mandated HHS to conduct research using human embryonic stem cells and forced religious employers like Hobby Lobby to cover contraception, such as the morning-after pill, that violates their sincere religious convictions.\n\nBesides his extreme views, though, perhaps most alarming is how Becerra has wielded his power as attorney general to harass his political opponents with a flood of lawsuits and prosecutions.\n\nBecerra has targeted social conservatives, religious groups and others who deny the Democratic Party's dogmas about life, marriage and the family. That's why he has enforced California's unconstitutional lockdowns against houses of worship while Gov. Gavin Newsom and San Francisco Mayor London Breed attended dinner parties at the French Laundry.\n\nAmerica deserves a professional at HHS – not a partisan culture warrior.\n\nConsider two of Becerra's rogue abuses of the law and his office.\n\nBecerra prosecuted pro-life activists David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, who released undercover footage of Planned Parenthood executives discussing the sale of the body parts of aborted babies.\n\nThese activists employed tactics little different than those used by animal-rights activists concerned about factory farming, but they exposed the wrong kind of business. Becerra charged the activists with 15 felonies, mostly for recording conversations in violation of California's two-party consent law. The Los Angeles Times editorial board – not exactly ardent pro-lifers – commented that it's disturbingly aggressive for Becerra to apply this criminal statute to people who were trying to influence a contested issue of public policy.\n\nAnother example is the Supreme Court case bearing his name, NIFLA v. Becerra.\n\nBecerra defended California's Reproductive FACT Act, a law targeting pro-life pregnancy crisis centers. The FACT Act compelled licensed pro-life clinics to distribute notices to their patients advertising the state's free and low-cost abortion programs. The act also required unlicensed pregnancy centers – which frequently provide ultrasounds, pregnancy tests and counseling to women in need – to conspicuously post in no less than 48-point type that they are not licensed as a medical facility by the State of California.\n\nThe law notoriously did not impose the same demands on other clinics, such as those that provide free birth control.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled against Becerra, explaining that the act compelled pro-life clinics to promote the very service they exist to oppose, a gross violation of the First Amendment. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in his concurring opinion, this law is a paradigmatic example of the serious threat presented when government seeks to impose its own message in the place of individual speech, thought, and expression.\n\nThat line serves as a succinct indictment of Becerra's abusive tenure as attorney general.\n\nHHS has the largest budget in the federal government – even bigger than the Pentagon's – and one of the most powerful bureaucracies. Given how Becerra conducted himself as a state attorney general, who can doubt that he would use HHS's vast resources and powers to keep waging his culture war?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs we fight to defeat the coronavirus, America deserves a professional at HHS – not a partisan culture warrior. Becerra's zeal for lockdowns, radical politics and abuse of power won't distribute a single vaccine or improve health care for a single citizen. But he will threaten on-the-job health insurance and persecute disfavored political opponents.\n\nAny senator who supports his nomination will bear responsibility for his all-too-predictable radical actions in office.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM SEN.

Dwayne The Rock Johnson may be a producer and have cameos in Fighting With My Family, but his real life involves very little of that — and he works and co-parents with his ex-wife.\n\nDWAYNE 'THE ROCK' JOHNSON WON'T RULE OUT PRESIDENTIAL RUN AFTER 2020\n\nJohnson, 46, and Dany Garcia, 50, divorced in 2008 after 10 years of marriage, but remain close friends and business partners. Johnson revealed to Good Morning America Wednesday that they cite therapy as the main reason they're able to work so well together.\n\nFriendship and the expansion of wanting what's best for everyone, Garcia added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe pair welcomed daughter Simone, 17, when Johnson was 29, and he admitted he may not have been ready for all the responsiblity on his plate at the time.\n\nAt 29, I was still trying to find myself, the Jumanji: Into the Jungle star said. I was flying by the seat of my pants at that time. I was in WWE, and as she's going into a business that I have enjoyed over the years, it has brought us even closer together.\n\nDWAYNE 'THE ROCK' JOHNSON BOUGHT HIS MOM A HOUSE FOR CHRISTMAS\n\nWe are so different today than who we were 10 years ago, 12, 15 years ago that it's like that past almost doesn't exist, Garcia said.\n\nGarcia is now married to Johnson's close friend and trainer, Dave Rienzi. The entire brood attended the 2018 Golden Globes together.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, has been with girlfriend Lauren Hashian since 2007. They share daughters Tiana, 9 months, and Jasmine, 3.\n\nDWAYNE 'THE ROCK' JOHNSON BODYSLAMS FABRICATED INTERVIEW DECRYING 'SNOWFLAKE' CULTURE\n\nDespite the domestic bliss in which all parties live now, Johnson says part of what inspired him and Garcia to produce Fighting With My Family, a biopic of WWE star Paige, was his own upbringing.\n\nI grew up in a wrestling family, he said. We lived like gypsies ... So lots of fun dysfunction. The dysfunctionality you see in the movie is just taken from our lives.
Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover girl Ashley Graham has been married to cinematographer and director Justin Ervin for eight years — and she knows exactly how to keep the passion alive.\n\nJust have sex, the 31-year-old told ELLE magazine for her February 2019 cover story. Have sex all the time. Even if you don't feel like it, just have sex. I have found that if we haven't had sex, we get snippy, and then if we are having sex, we're all over each other. For us it's like, 'Oh, let's have sex.' And then we're just right back in a great mood.\n\nAnd while things may be hot and heavy for the pair these days, Graham and Ervin remained abstinent until they officially tied the knot in 2010.\n\nSomething that it did for us was build up our friendship, and it also built up our trust and communication, explained Graham. Of course we were sexually attracted to each other; we would make out heavily. All those things were there. I wasn't worried about, 'What's sex gonna be like with him?' It was more, 'Do I trust him?' 'Is he someone I want to be with for the rest of my life?'\n\nASHLEY GRAHAM GETS CANDID ON BEING A SEX SYMBOL\n\nGraham also said their faith was essential to their relationship. The couple first met while volunteering at her church.\n\nWhen you fast and you pray, it's bringing more sensitivity to hear from God, said the Nebraska native. That's exactly what we wanted; we were like, 'OK, we want more sensitivity to be able to hear from God in the big decisions that we're making.' We do it together because there's a verse in the Bible that says, 'Where two or more are gathered, He is in the midst.' So as we do it together, it just makes it even stronger.\n\nDespite their joyous union, Graham said she isn't in a hurry to become a mother.\n\nFor me, being a wife and being a woman, happiness doesn't equate to having kids, she explained. Kids will come when they come. Happiness right now is building with my husband and building my business.\n\nHaving a lifestyle brand is a very big goal for me, added Graham on what the future holds for her.\n\nGraham first made history in 2016 when she became the first plus-size model to grace the cover of the coveted Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.\n\nI think since my Vogue and Sports Illustrated covers, my relationship with my body hasn't changed, Graham told Fox News in 2017. I think since I was a young girl in Nebraska to a girl who moved to New York at age 17, I had a lot of adjustment.\n\nAnd then from the age of 17 to even 22-23 years old where I really had to figure out who I was, why I was a model, what my voice was, the message I wanted to get out to young women and men. I really had to come to a realization that my body is my body. I call the shots. Nobody else… gets to do that. I think that has been a very interesting road… I want other young people to know that they are not alone in their body journey.\n\nAnd Graham doesn't mind being recognized as a sex symbol who happens to have a huge female following.\n\nI think it's fantastic! she said. I think that women should definitely follow other women that they find sexy, that they find intelligent. You have different role models for different purposes. I think that's important. And I love all of my female followers. And my men followers, too!\n\nThe February 2019 issue of ELLE hits newsstands Jan. 22.
A body has been recovered from a Florida home that was linked to the killings of three family members, investigators said Sunday.\n\nThe identity of the body was not immediately clear, but the Pasco County Sheriff's Office said the body was with the medical examiner's office.\n\nAt the home, located in Tarpon Springs, the bodies of a couple, identified as Richard Ivancic, 71 and Laura Ivancic, 59, and their son, 25-year-old Nicholas Ivancic, were found dead on Jan. 1 after authorities conducted a welfare check.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOfficials said their bodies were found in a state of advanced decomposition, and said the killings likely happened on Dec. 19 or Dec. 20. The bodies of three small dogs were also found in the home.\n\nThe Ivancics' daughter, 21-year-old Jamie Ivancic, was missing under what police called suspicious circumstances. Her husband, Shelby Nealy, 25, was taken into custody on Friday in Lakewood, Ohio. Authorities said he initially was charged with receiving stolen property because he was driving one victim's car, but later faced three charges of first-degree murder.\n\nMAN WITH MISSING WIFE, FLORIDA IN-LAWS DEAD ARRESTED IN OHIO\n\nTarpon Spring Police Maj. Jeffrey Young said at a news conference Friday that the situation remained under investigation, and that officials feared Jamie Ivancic also may be a victim of foul play.\n\nTarpon Springs police investigators said Nealy admitted he was involved in the killings. He was arrested after investigators were able to track a red 2013 Kia Sorento owned by Laura Ivancic to Ohio.\n\nHe was taken into custody after walking outside toward the vehicle from an apartment, where the younger couple's two children, aged 2 and 3, were inside unharmed. They were taken to a family services agency.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
This is a rush transcript from Life, Liberty & Levin, March 8, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nMARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Hello, America, I'm Mark Levin. This is LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN.\n\nWe have a great guest, Robert Woodson. How are you, sir?\n\nROBERT WOODSON, AMERICAN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT LEADER, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF THE WOODSON CENTER: Pleased to be here, Mark.\n\nLEVIN: We first met like three decades ago.\n\nWOODSON: Yes.\n\nLEVIN: Long time ago. You haven't changed. I've changed a lot.\n\nI want to talk about the 1619 Project that America was founded in slavery. That slavery is in America's DNA.\n\nYou've been a Civil Rights activist. You've spent your life committed to improving the lives, not just of African-Americans, but all Americans, really.\n\nSo very briefly, you run an organization called the Woodson Center. Before we get into this big 1619 issue, The New York Times and what they're doing to our history and our future, what does your center do?\n\nWOODSON: The Woodson Center is an organization that I founded 38 years ago. It's headquartered in Washington. And we assist what we call grassroots josephs all over the country. In other words, our approach to poverty isn't to support professional programs that parachute into communities.\n\nWe go into high-crime, low-income neighborhoods, and we ask questions others don't. If 70 percent of the families are raising children are dysfunctional, it means 30 percent are raising them successfully.\n\nSo the Woodson Center goes in and looks for those who are achieving against the odds in these low-income communities and we treat them like -- we are like a venture capitalist without capital.\n\nAnd once we find solutions that are developed by the people suffering the problem, we provide training, we provide them access to money, and then we determine, what are the policy barriers that prevents them from maximizing?\n\nSo if someone is successfully reaching 50 kids in the community and reducing their violent behavior, we provide them with the assistance they need so they can grow, so they're affecting 500 kids.\n\nAnd so we have grassroots leaders who -- we have trained 2,500 of them in 38 states, the different racial groups, different ethnic groups. And so they are the, what we call antibodies, just as the human body is anti- oriented towards strength. These are antibodies.\n\nAnd so the Woodson Center celebrates their success, and then we introduce their success to public policies and try to get changes, so that we improve. We are the antithesis of the poverty problem.\n\nLEVIN: Well, I want to ask you about this because you don't participate in this massive government centralized effort that's really been going on almost half a century.\n\nWOODSON: Yes.\n\nLEVIN: Going into these minority communities, as a matter of fact, you were a civil rights activist.\n\nWOODSON: Right.\n\nLEVIN: And there was a point at which you broke off from the old time Civil Rights activists. Tell me about that.\n\nWOODSON: Well, when I was active in the Civil Rights Movement as a young worker, we were seeking opportunity for people to achieve, but the Civil Rights Movement, I think part of the company, when they used what I call a bait and switch game, they used the demographics of low income blacks as the bait, and when money arrived, the switch occurred.\n\nAnd so they began to exploit the people. They also supported forced busing for integration. I said the opposite of segregation is not integration, it is desegregation.\n\nAnd so what I was pursuing is if you develop Centers of Excellence in communities, like Marva Collins did in Chicago, and you -- and so we worked on perfecting excellence, and if you produce excellence, people will be drawn to you, and the integration should be a byproduct of the pursuit of excellence.\n\nAnd so, this was one departure, and so I fell out of sorts with the Civil Rights Movement because of desegregation. I remember debating Julius Chambers before the New York Bar Association. He was a black PhD from Harvard, a lawyer.\n\nAnd midway through the debate, I said, Julius, if we have two circumstances, you've got School A that is all black, but there's a presence of excellence and School B with diminished sections, where should we send our children? He says School B. And I said, then there's no debate.\n\nAnd so what I have sought is to help low-income people to become empowered. And so that's why I departed the company with the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nAlso when the poverty programs came, I knew that this was a scam. See, in 1960, when the government starts spending $22 trillion, 70 cents of every dollar did not go to the poor, it went to those who served the poor. They asked not which problems are solvable, but which ones are fundable.\n\nAnd so what happened is we've created a commodity out of poor people. And so, as a consequence, there was no incentives to solve problems of the poor because the careers of those serving them were dependent upon having people to serve.\n\nAnd that's why in the black community, you've seen the families disintegrate over the last 50 years, when prior -- but a hundred years prior to that, black families were intact.\n\nWe have a whole history of a hundred years when black families left slavery, 80 percent of all those black families had a man and a woman raising children. And this family composition continued generation after generation.\n\nBut in the '60s, that changed because of government policies. There was a deliberate attempt on the part of Cloward and Piven at the university -- Columbia University. They said one of the ways that we can emphasize the contradictions of capitalism is to separate work from income. It will make the father redundant.\n\nAnd so that's what the poverty programs and welfare programs did, separate wealth from income. Make the father redundant. And so, the nuclear family was redefined as Eurocentric, and therefore irrelevant. Christian faith was demeaned.\n\nAnd so you had this common -- government programs began to attack the stigma that was present in the black community on receiving welfare.\n\nAnd as a combination, the Federal government opened up offices to recruit blacks into the welfare system. And as a consequence, in the early '70s, millions of blacks were recruited into the welfare system in New York and other major cities at a time when the unemployment rate for black men was four percent.\n\nAnd so what the social engineers at the time predicted came true. Up until 1960, eighty-five percent of all black families had a man and a woman raising children, and that declines to now, just 75 percent of families. So social policies of the '60s did what racism couldn't have accomplished before.\n\nLEVIN: You have now started the 1776 Group to counter the 1619 New York Times effort. Now the 1619 New York Times effort, I'll read the first paragraph from one of their articles on this, so the American people know what they're up to. They say, 1619 is not a year that most Americans know as a notable date in our country's history. I certainly didn't.\n\nThose who do are at most a tiny fraction of those who can tell you that 1776 is the year of our nation's birth. What if, however, we were to tell you that the moment that the country's defining contradictions first came into the world was in late August 1690? That was when a ship arrived at Point Comfort in the British colony of Virginia, bearing a cargo of 20 to 30 enslaved Africans.\n\nTheir arrival inaugurated a barbaric system of chattel slavery that would last for the next 250 years. This is sometimes referred to as the country's original sin. But it is more than that, it's the country's very origin.\n\nAnd in fact, some of the supporters of this have heard of said, slavery is in our DNA, which means we can't get rid of it. It's in our DNA. Now, you heard this and you read about this. And you were repulsed by this.\n\nWOODSON: It is one of the most diabolical, self-destructive ideas that I've ever heard. And what they're doing is rewriting American history and unfortunately, they are using the suffering and struggle of black America as a bludgeon to beat America and define America as a criminal organization.\n\nAnd it's lethal -- and what the -- and the message that they are saying is all white Americans are oppressors and all black Americans are victims.\n\nWhat this does, Mark, it means, therefore, the black community is exempting them from any kind of personal responsibility. It's really white supremacy to assume that blacks have no agency. And the basic premise that we brought together a group of independent thinkers and activists called 1776, that's the real birth of America.\n\nAnd what we organized to do, we are demonstrating that this is a lie, but we're not going to engage in vitriolic debate. What we want to offer through our essays, through our scholars that we brought together, we are providing an aspirational and inspirational alternative narrative that presents facts.\n\nFor instance, 1619 says that the current problems faced in black America with 75 percent of babies were out of wedlock. We lost more blacks, killed more blacks in one year than were lynched by the Klan in 50 years.\n\nAnd they are saying that these present problems are directly related to the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow.\n\nWell, in our essays by our scholars, we're providing evidence that that is not true. In fact, when slavery ended, 75 percent of all blacks were illiterate. But within less than 50 years, that number reduced to 35.\n\nThe literacy rates, black Americans, we started our own schools. The education gap between whites and blacks in the south in 1910, was eighth grade for whites, fifth grade for blacks.\n\nBooker T. Washington partnered with Julius Rosenwald and Julius Rosenwald put up about four million dollars, the black community put a 4.6 and they built 5,000 Rosenwald schools. So that one third of all low-income blacks attended a Rosenwald school.\n\nWell, Mark, between 1920 and 1940, the studies show that that three-year gap was reduced to six months. So if blacks could reduce the educational gap between 1920 and 1940, and we have five major high schools, Dunbar here in Washington and Atlanta, where the class sizes were 50, we used textbooks. The budgets of those schools were a small fraction of what the white schools.\n\nBut every one of those black high schools in the '20s tested higher than any other white school in the city.\n\nLEVIN: I want to pursue this with you further, because I think it's very important. And you and I agree that if we lose our history, we lose our future.\n\nWOODSON: Yes.\n\nLEVIN: And that's the battle that's taking place here. We'll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nLEVIN: Welcome back. Bob Woodson, I want to read you something from five top historians. Two of whom are Pulitzer Prize winners, James MacPherson, Gordon Wood, top schools in the country -- five of them, they felt compelled to write a letter to The New York Times.\n\nAnd among other things, they wrote this on the 1619 Project. On the American Revolution, pivotal to any account of our history, the project asserts that the founders declared the colonies independence of Britain in order to ensure slavery would continue.\n\nThis is not true, they say, If supportable, the allegation will be astounding -- yet, every statement offered by the project to validate it is false.\n\nSome of the other material in the project is distorted, including the claim that 'for the most part, black Americans have fought their freedom struggles alone.\n\nThey go on, The 1619 Project has not been presented as the views of individual writers -- views that in some cases, as on the suppose a direct connections between slavery and the modern court practices have so far failed to establish any empirical veracity or reliability and have been seriously challenged by other historians.\n\nInstead, the project is offered as an authoritative account that bears the imprimatur and credibility of 'The New York Times.'\n\nThose connected with a project to assure the public that its materials were shaped by a panel of historians, and have been scrupulously fact- checked. Yet, the process remains opaque.\n\nThe names of only some of the historians involved have been released, they extent of their involvement as consultants, and fact checkers remains vague. The selective transparency deepens our concern.\n\nYou started this 1776 Project to counter this distortion of the history that these historians talk about.\n\nWOODSON: Absolutely. You know, Mark, there are two ways to prevent people from competing. One, to deny them by law the way we did under segregation. But the more insidious way is to convince them that they don't have to compete.\n\nThat because of their history of oppression, that your oppressor is obligated to be responsible for your future. That is a recipe for absolute disaster for people.\n\nIt says, if you're robbing and killing one another, it's not your fault. If you're having babies out of wedlock, and not taking care of them, it's not your fault.\n\nIf you're eating too much, and you're overweight, it's not your fault. So it's structural and distant. That's why in the '60s, the doors were locked from the outside. And so we fought to open those doors.\n\nBut 1619 says the blacks, those doors are locked from -- still are locked from the outside and in 1776, we say no. As C.S. Lewis said, this is a door that's locked from the inside. You have the right of self-determination and the 1619 said that these conditions of history are dictates are present.\n\nAnd we, at 1776, offer evidence to the contrary. They say that capitalism is hostile to the interests of blacks. Well, there are 20 blacks who were born slaves who died millionaires.\n\nHow is that possible if slavery were responsible for the decline of people? For example, one woman Biddy Mason was born 1818 in Mississippi and she couldn't read or write. And her master moved -- he was a Mormon and moved to Salt Lake City.\n\nShe walked behind a wagon for a thousand miles tending to the sheep. She had three babies by him, and when she got to Salt Lake City, he moved to California and that was a free state, a judge freed her. And as a result, she was a midwife, and she earned $1.50 a day.\n\nShe saved her money for 10 years and purchased property in what is now Downtown LA, and got into real estate. And eventually, when she died, she was worth about $670,000.00 and she is the founder of the AME Church that is still operating. And her great -- her grandson became one of the wealthiest blacks.\n\nSo there are countless stories like this, of blacks in that period who achieved against the odds, and those traditions continue.\n\nFor instance, 1619 says that the decimation of the family can be traced to racism. Well between 1930, let's look at the evidence -- between 1930 and 1940, during the Depression, when there was a 25 percent unemployment rate, the unemployment rate in the black community was 40 percent.\n\nWe had the highest marriage rate of any other group. Elderly people could walk safely without being fearful of being mugged by their grandkids.\n\nIf racism were responsible, then how could we accomplish that?\n\nSo our essays by our scholars and our activists, we provide evidence of this. It was our Christian faith that helped us to maintain standards.\n\nThere was a church, a Mother Bethel Church in Philadelphia, where the members were taxed a shillings a week, and they had their own welfare system, but you couldn't obtain welfare if you were slothful, or if you were lazy or if you were a drunk.\n\nSo we had moral standards even during the time of segregation and slavery, and it was a strong content of our character as a people, which enabled us to withstand the horrors of oppression.\n\nBut 1619 is cheating black children by telling them that their only lot in life is to be a victim, and Mark, it has horrendous kind of national security implications, too.\n\nCan you imagine if 1619 that is being taught in 3,000 schools around the country and the black children will grow up believing that they are a victim of a racist society, and they become 18 and that's all they're fed, why would they want to defend this nation against foreign invaders or become a member of law enforcement and protect us domestically?\n\nSo, if we -- but we have got to challenge it, but we cannot challenge it by writing papers and having conferences. That's why at the 1776, we have assembled not just thinkers, but activists.\n\nLEVIN: I want to pursue this with you.\n\nWOODSON: Okay.\n\nLEVIN: This activism point. It's very, very important because you're saying let's not exchange white papers because nobody cares. And nobody can print more than The New York Times anyway.\n\nWOODSON: Right.\n\nLEVIN: So you're saying we need to get into an activist movement.\n\nWOODSON: We need a ground game.\n\nLEVIN: We need a ground -- so when we come back, I want you to explain that to us a little bit. We'll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Aishah Hasnie.\n\nConcerns over the deadly coronavirus continue to spread globally. In Washington, D.C., a man in his 50s has now tested positive for the virus marking the first presumptively confirmed case in our Nation's Capital.\n\nFive states have now declared health emergencies as the outbreak grows to more than 500 cases nationwide, at least 21 of them fatal.\n\nWorldwide, the number of known cases tops a hundred thousand and now, Senator Ted Cruz says he will self-quarantine for two weeks after shaking hands with a man who has tested positive.\n\nSouth Korea's military reporting North Korea has fired three unidentified projectiles. The launches come days after North Korea said it had carried out two rounds of live fire artillery exercises, its first weapons test since late November.\n\nI'm Aishah Hasnie, now back to LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN.\n\nLEVIN: Welcome back, Bob Woodson. You were saying, we don't have to exchange white papers. That's good for the intellectual, but the battle is at the ground level.\n\nThey have the Smithsonian Institution now, 1619 effort in The New York Times. Our public schools, a growing number of them are embracing this. This is a big problem, and you're saying, we compete against this how?\n\nWOODSON: Well, first of all, as I said, the concern is if we were fighting the Second World War executing it, and we were invading Normandy, we would have only Navy and the Air Force, and we'll be bombing the hell out of -- waiting for Hitler to show up and surrender on the beach.\n\nWe wouldn't have any Marines or soldiers, nor would we be supporting the insurgents in these occupied countries.\n\nLEVIN: We need ground forces.\n\nWOODSON: We need ground forces. So that's why, with 1776, we assembled not just thinkers and that's important. But we are also activists. People whose lives and actions embody the principles that we said we advocate.\n\nIf we want people to embrace these principles and virtues, we must demonstrate that they have the consequences of improving people's lives. They can restore community.\n\nSo we brought people like John Ponder from Los Angeles, Tyrone Parker from Washington, and Gary Wyatt from Akron, Ohio; Willie Peterson -- all of these are activists in low income communities, bringing about a gang intervention and making communities safe.\n\nJohn Ponder is taking 2,000 people who've come out of prison and help them to live stable lives. They have 500 volunteers, 50 of them -- about 40 percent -- are police officers. Police officers actually mentoring ex- offenders and as a consequence, the violent encounters between police and the minority community is dramatically reduced.\n\nSo we have models on the ground around the country that shows that these are people who are taking those values, and using them as a means of promoting redemption and transformation of people in communities, and they're restoring communities.\n\nWe as conservatives must see them as allies and supply them with funding. Also, scholars should be writing about them.\n\nAnd so when you're talking about a principle, it would be good to point to an example, in the low-income communities.\n\nWhat the Woodson Center is trying to establish is the center for the study of resilience, and not just do failure studies.\n\nAnd so, as you say, the left uses Broadway, movies. So what we're doing at 1776, we're going to have a K through 12 curriculum. We're going to have videos. We're going to have festivals to celebrate 1776.\n\nWe also should make grassroots leaders, civic teachers. So if young people cleave to these grassroots leaders, we, at the Woodson Center want to equip these grassroots leaders so that they are teaching young people the values and virtues of our founders, and not just leave it to the academic scholars to do that.\n\nAnd so it's a comprehensive approach. We should see movies. We want to see more movies. We have an illustrator as a part of us. So we want to -- we just want to have children's books.\n\nMark, the leading book in the socialist section in Amazon is Communism for Kids. That's what we're up against. But we've got to match it. That's why what the Woodson Center is doing is we are developing a ground game, but we need support for that.\n\nLEVIN: You also seem to be saying, conversely, we have to do this because we're up against this radical ideology that says more government, society is bad. There's nothing you can do for yourself to break out of this.\n\nWOODSON: Right.\n\nLEVIN: It's an America's DNA. This is a failed country from day one. And what you seem to be saying to me and the nation is, we better rid ourselves of that mighty fast, and it's particularly deleterious to minority communities where the suffering, honestly is greater, for a whole host of reasons.\n\nAnd what The New York Times and the 1619 Project is basically dressing up hardcore leftism and pushing it out as part of American history. Am I right?\n\nWOODSON: Right. And they're trying to divide us. They're saying what is important, but Mark, that mother in Palo Alto, who lost a 17-year-old daughter to suicide, and a mother -- a black mother in public housing in Washington lost a 17-year-old girl to homicide, they have more in common than they do their difference.\n\nOne isn't white privilege, and the other one is lack of social justice. No, we must put race aside so we can find out why even in affluent white communities like in Palo Alto, the suicide rate is six times the national average.\n\nIn inner city, Washington, D.C., the Center for Disease Control said that 10 percent of the middle schoolers have attempted suicide. Well, there are 4,000 middle schoolers. That means that's more than one a day.\n\nSo there's a crisis, a moral and spiritual crisis. But as long as we have to contend with racial differences, we won't be able to get at that deep longing that's inside.\n\nOne other thing, deep in the DNA of this country is a desire to support virtue, and it gets expressed in spontaneous ways.\n\nWhen a homeless man up in Boston found a knapsack with $46,000.00 in it and he turned it in. Someone posted up on GoFundMe, they raised $93,000.00 in a matter of days.\n\nWhen a black homeless guy up in Oakland, a white woman came and emptied her change purse that had her $15,000.00 wedding band in it, she came back five hours later, he held it up and said, were you looking for this? Again, there was an outpouring of support.\n\nSo that means that deep in the deep in the DNA, there is a thirst to support virtue, but they want to see a sermon. They're tired of people preaching sermons. They're tired of this gladiatorial combat.\n\nThat's why 1776, we aren't offering this as a debate. We want to offer the country a more inspirational and aspirational alternative by telling stories.\n\nFor instance, Mark, everybody ought to read about Covert, Michigan.\n\nLEVIN: When we come back, I want you to tell us about Covert, Michigan. We'll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nLEVIN: Welcome back, Bob Woodson. We've been talking about the 1619 Project and your 1776 Project, which is to counter at all levels.\n\nAnd when we left, you were talking about Covert, Michigan and you thought there's an important story there.\n\nWOODSON: Yes, there's a woman named Anna-Lisa Cox, she wrote a book about Covert, Michigan. This was settled right after the Civil War by some veterans on the Civil War, black and white, and from the time it was settled, it was integrated. It was never segregated.\n\nBlacks and whites lived in the same neighborhoods. They attended the same schools. They worked in the same companies. They were paid comparable wages, even though in Michigan, blacks were not allowed to hold elected office by law, they were elected to office and they served faithfully.\n\nIt's a model for what America could have been throughout the country. But it defies what 1619 says is possible in America.\n\nSo Covert, Michigan, interracial marriage was common there. People moved there because they knew that they could live there in peace.\n\nAnd so there are all kinds of examples that children need to be introduced to because people are motivated to improve their lives, Mark when you show them victories that are possible, not constantly reminding them of injuries to be avoided.\n\nAnd so that's what 1776 is trying to do. We must tell stories, we must arm children. There are contemporary examples of people doing resilience.\n\nWe have an 18-year-old black kid who was homeless, and borrowed his brother's bike and rode six hours across the State of Georgia to go to his Community College and he pitched a tent. Two white cops comes up in the middle of the night, sees him, finds out what his story is, puts him up in a motel, a friend of theirs gives him a job.\n\nAnd he says, I don't want a charity, I want to work, so he washes dishes in a pizzeria. They posted it on the internet. They raised $80,000 in a few days, and the president of college was moved by him. So there are all kinds of stories like that.\n\nLEVIN: Can I give you one now? Nashville, Tennessee. I see what this tornado do.\n\nWOODSON: Yes.\n\nLEVIN: Nobody cares what color you are. Nobody cares anything about your background. Those people are helping each other. 9/11. Whether it's Mother Nature, or whether it's man-made disasters, this country, the people pull together. You see that all the time, don't you?\n\nWOODSON: Yes. But this really defines America. We spontaneously respond to those in need and that's the real America and there are just endless examples of that kind of resilience.\n\nBut when we see it, we ought to celebrate it. A mother with two daughters sleeping in her car and in a homeless shelter and the kids are studying by the light of the cell phone and these kids graduate With Honors.\n\nValedictorian, Salutatorian and they start college as sophomores because they've taken so many advanced placement courses.\n\nLEVIN: Amazing.\n\nWOODSON: Mark, they should be headlining at every conservative banquet. We should be writing about them. We should be inquiring of her and the kids. How did you do this?\n\nLEVIN: Bob Woodson, not just conservatives.\n\nWOODSON: Everybody.\n\nLEVIN: This ought to be on cable TV.\n\nWOODSON: Exactly.\n\nLEVIN: On every network -- every now and then, let's say something positive about the people of this country.\n\nWhen we come back, I have a question for you. Bernie Sanders says, and he says it on the stump constantly, America is racist from top to bottom.\n\nI want you to answer Bernie Sanders when we come back. We'll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nLEVIN: Welcome back. Bob Woodson, Bernie Sanders at almost every stump speech, and he gets big applause. He says, America is racist from top to bottom. How do you react to that?\n\nWOODSON: Well, first of all, it's just -- I bristle every time because it's so insulting. But I remember some years ago in Washington, D.C., the Klan, they'd come to town in a rickety little bus and 5,000 people were trying to get at them, and so The Washington Post came down into Ward 8, one of the most dangerous communities here in Washington with a lot of violence.\n\nAnd they asked a 70-year-old man if he was going to join the demonstration against the Klan. He said, well, bring them down here so they can get rid of these drug dealers.\n\nSo his reality was the condition of drug addiction and violence in his community. It was not raised. White people are not in these communities robbing people and creating the murders.\n\nAnd so the realities of people who have to live in these troubled community is very different than those who posture on television and just have a shorthand way of somehow speaking to the needs of black people and assume that the only thing that's of interest to black America is race. That's insulting.\n\nLEVIN: Do you see a huge disconnect between the way the media reports what's going on in these communities or even the politicians who supposedly represent these communities speak about these communities? Does that question make sense there?\n\nWOODSON: Oh sure. For instance, we know about the Starbucks situation in Philadelphia about these two men who were supposed to have gotten locked up, and I followed that because it's our hometown.\n\nLEVIN: What happened?\n\nWOODSON: What happened is these two men came to Starbucks and they were just waiting for someone.\n\nLEVIN: They were both Philadelphians.\n\nWOODSON: Philadelphians, and they didn't order anything. And so the manager asked them to leave and like that, they call the police.\n\nWell, The Washington Post reported that they were locked up for being in Starbucks. That's not the truth. The police asked them on three different occasions to please leave, and they refused the police directive.\n\nSo therefore, they were arrested for refusing the police, but the reporters left that part out and only reported that they were arrested for being in Starbucks and that's when Starbucks, you know, caved in and this is where the race hustlers had a field day because their consulting contracts were signed.\n\nSo Starbucks closed down for a half a day to teach race sensitivity to its employees, which is one of the biggest growing rackets in the country.\n\nBut that shows you where we are in the sad state of race in America today.\n\nLEVIN: I just -- you know, I hear a guy like Bernie Sanders, who has spent his entire career in Vermont, talking about what's going on in the inner cities. I see a lot of these reporters who don't live in the inner cities. I mean, the tough neighborhoods.\n\nI see a lot of the politicians elected from these tough neighborhoods who a lot of them don't live in those neighborhoods for most of the time, or when they leave office, some of them get wealthy, they buy homes on Martha's Vineyard or what have you.\n\nI don't feel, from my perspective than I really get the truth from our media and others on what's going on in these communities. Does that make sense to you?\n\nWOODSON: It does, but also when they underreport assaults of blacks on whites and also, so that's a big problem --\n\nLEVIN: You know, you'll be attacked for just saying that.\n\nWOODSON: Oh, I know. But we -- but the problem is we've got to tell the truth and that this is crisis in truth telling, and so I have an obligation to talk about if there's a problem within the community, then I have to stand up for that and say, as I said before with C.S. Lewis, in black America, we have to address the problem that is the enemy within and that's what our groups do around the country. We address the enemy within.\n\nWe don't need a Bernie Sanders telling us that our folks are exempt from any personal responsibility.\n\nLEVIN: Because you're there.\n\nWOODSON: It's insulting.\n\nLEVIN: You live it every day and your organization does.\n\nWOODSON: Right.\n\nLEVIN: We'll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nLEVIN: Welcome back. Bob Woodson, you've written a beautiful book, The Triumph of Joseph: How Today's Community Healers are Reviving Our Streets and Neighborhoods. I strongly suggest you go to Amazon and grab a copy of it. This entire show is kind of built up to this book.\n\nBob Woodson, 1776 Project, the 1619 Project. Your project really is about Americanism, isn't it? Their project is about radical leftism, isn't it? Is that a good way to put it?\n\nWOODSON: It is. It is reaffirming the values of 1776. And the purpose is to bring America together because as I said, we have a critical problem that is destroying this and even rich white people are dying from drug overdose. There's a crisis in meaning in America.\n\nAnd we can -- we need to be coming together black, white, brown, whatever - - so that we can exchange our strategies for healing it. But we can't do it as long as this race is hanging over it.\n\nSo I have gotten permission from the Great High Council of Black America to absolve all white people of the sins of the past, and let's put it aside. So now we can concentrate on healing the hurt that is within us that's causing us to destroy ourselves.\n\nThis country is in trouble, but we can fix it because America is America.\n\nLEVIN: And where do we find these basic principles? We find them in faith and we find them in our founding document, the Declaration of Independence, isn't that so?\n\nWOODSON: And the Constitution is a document that allows us to modify and improve.\n\nNo one should be defined by its birth defect. None of us want to be defined by the worst things we did as a young person, and nor should a nation be defined by its defects, but by the promise, thousands and thousands of American blacks over the years, have fought and died to protect these principles, because they have been endearing and they have been responsible for the success that we have achieved.\n\nWe are the only country that has an Emancipation Proclamation. We are the only country that fought a war to end slavery, and the redemption is what we should all be working to towards redeeming our own lives and also redeeming our communities and healing us from within.\n\nLEVIN: It's been a great pleasure, Bob Woodson. Thank you my friend. I appreciate it.\n\nJoin us next time on LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Nobody pokes more fun at Dolly Parton — all hair, sequins, nine-inch nails and five-inch stilettos — than the country superstar herself.\n\nParton was celebrated for her musical achievements and philanthropic work as MusiCares Person of the Year on Friday night. She's the first country artist to be saluted in the tribute's 29-year history.\n\nGarth Brooks, Brandi Carlile, Miley Cyrus, Shawn Mendes, Kacey Musgraves, Willie Nelson, Katy Perry, Pink, Chris Stapleton and Don Henley were among those honoring the 73-year-old singer-songwriter two days before the Grammy Awards.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAll of my life I have been known for two things. Well, not them, the well-endowed Parton joked in a bawdy acceptance speech. I've also been known as a singer and songwriter too. Although I'm not complaining. Ol' Pancho and Lefty's been pretty good to me. Everybody always expects me to do a boob joke and I like to do that right up front.\n\nSurprising Parton with her award and earning a standing ovation were Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt, who teamed with Parton for two successful Trio albums. It was a rare public appearance for Ronstadt, who can't sing anymore because of Parkinson's disease, which Parton mentioned.\n\nDOLLY PARTON TALKS RETIREMENT\n\nIt has been a wonderful journey, Parton said.\n\nAs Parton rushed to embrace Harris and Ronstadt, her award crashed to the floor. It appeared to survive intact.\n\nParton said people ask her about it being a man's world when she got into the music business in the 1960s.\n\nI never met a man that I didn't like and I never met a man whose (rear) I couldn't kick if he didn't treat me with the right respect, she said, drawing raucous cheers.\n\nDOLLY PARTON SHARES SECRET BEHIND 52-YEAR MARRIAGE\n\nEarlier, Parton watched from the audience while other performers sampled her vast catalog.\n\nWearing a black jacket with Parton's visage on the back, Pink kicked off the evening with a powerhouse rendition of the man-stealing song Jolene.\n\nGospel singer Yolanda Adams received a standing ovation for I Will Always Love You, the Parton-penned song famously covered by Whitney Houston.\n\nYolanda, you killed that, said Karen Fairchild of Little Big Town.\n\nDOLLY PARTON REVEALS HER CONNECTION TO REESE WITHERSPOON\n\nCyrus, who is Parton's goddaughter, and Mendes dueted on Islands in the Stream with Mark Ronson on guitar. Grammy nominee Carlile and Nelson sang Everything's Beautiful (In Its Own Way).\n\nWe love you, Doll, Nelson said.\n\nBacked by a horn section, Stapleton tackled 9 to 5, getting the audience clapping along to Parton's ode to empowered yet challenged working women.\n\nMusgraves and Perry teamed up on Here You Come Again, with Perry decked out in lilac fringe with matching boots and cowboy hat.\n\nDOLLY PARTON MAKES RACY THREESOME JOKE ABOUT JENNIFER ANISTON\n\nWe want to be just like her when we grow up, Perry told the crowd.\n\nBrooks and his wife Trisha Yearwood teamed up on Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle To You, sealing it with a kiss.\n\nHenley and Vince Gill strummed guitars on Eagle When She Flies.\n\nBacked by a choir, Leon Bridges and Mavis Staples took the crowd to church on Not Enough. Bridges got into the spirit of the evening with white cowboy boots and a denim jacket with his name and a white horse on the back and red barn patch on the front.\n\nDOLLY PARTON SPEAKS OUT ON BROTHER FLOYD'S DEATH\n\nIt's been such a thrill for me tonight to see all these great artists singing songs I've written or been a part of, Parton said. Watching them is sort of like watching porn. You're not personally involved but you still get off on it.\n\nThe crowd roared and Parton said, Hey, don't blame me. At my age you'll take anything you can get.\n\nShe closed the evening by performing Coat of Many Colors.\n\nI had my nails too long to pick tonight because I'm gettin' ready for the Grammys, Parton explained in having Linda Perry play guitar.\n\nMILEY CYRUS ON THE BEST PART OF HAVING DOLLY PARTON AS A GODMOTHER\n\nFriday's dinner and auction at the Los Angeles Convention Center generated more than $6.7 million, Recording Academy president Neil Portnow said.\n\nMusiCares, run by the Recording Academy, provides financial assistance to individuals in the music industry during times of financial, medical and personal need.\n\nOf course you know we hillbillies need MusiCares too, Parton said. We may not have sex, drugs and rock 'n roll, but two out of three ain't bad.
Iman is still grieving the loss of her true love, David Bowie.\n\nThe 65-year-old supermodel told Harper's Bazaar UK she thinks about the late singer all the time and will never marry again.\n\nDavid is in our hearts and minds on a daily basis, for all of us, she admitted in its February 2021 issue. You know, this was my true love.

A bluebird, above all things! she said.\n\nIman reflected on their marriage and how normal they were as a couple despite their celebrity statuses.\n\nIt was a really everyday marriage, she described. He was a very funny, warm gentleman – you know, everyone talks about him being futuristic, but no, he was not, he liked more than anything to wear a three-piece suit. It was a beautiful, ordinary life and that was what was great about it. We could live in New York, pick up our daughter from school, walk everywhere. ... You know, I wish we had had more years.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nThe couple shares a daughter, Alexandria Lexi Zahra Jones, who was born in 2000.

Bluebird, January 10th, the fashion icon wrote. #BowieForever #EternalLove.
Jon Gosselin opened up his scary battle with coronavirus.\n\nThe former reality TV star told Dr. Mehmet Oz on his talk show Thursday that he was almost put on a ventilator while in the hospital fighting for his life.\n\nI had a really bad COVID pneumonia based upon my numbers, Gosselin described.

I can't breathe.' I called the nurse and I felt guilty calling the nurse all the time. Like, 'Can you just help me get this? Can you help me do that?' Everything, you feel like an invalid.\n\nGosselin admitted he was surprised his health declined so quickly.\n\nYou go from perfectly healthy one week to you can't do anything the next week, he said.

Justin Timberlake is celebrating his relationship with wife Jessica Biel by taking a look back at their first year as a couple.\n\nThe actor and singer took to Instagram on Friday to share an adorable throwback pic of them together at an early point in their relationship.\n\nThrowback to our first year together. It ain't hard to tell from my face!!! When you know, you know, Timberlake captioned the Instagram post. I love you, my funny Valentine. Every day the 14th!!! Happy Love Day, y'all!!\n\nJUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, JESSICA BIEL SPOTTED FOR THE FIRST TIME TOGETHER SINCE HIS HAND-HOLDING INCIDENT\n\nHis wife of seven years also shared her own tribute to her two leading men by posting a picture of Timberlake and their son, Silas, 4.\n\nMy valentines, the Sinner star captioned the post. Love you guys to the [moon].\n\nThe two social media shout-outs come just two months after Timberlake and Biel's marriage was mired by rumors after the Suit and Tie crooner was photographed holding hands with his Palmer co-star Alicia Wainwright.\n\nJUSTIN TIMBERLAKE 'KNOWS HE MESSED UP' WITH JESSICA BIEL FOLLOWING ALISHA WAINWRIGHT SCANDAL: REPORT\n\nTimberlake would issue a public apology to Biel, 37, in December 2019 via a lengthy Instagram note.\n\nI stay away from gossip as much as I can, but for my family I feel it is important to address recent rumors that are hurting the people that I love, he began.\n\nA few weeks ago I displayed a strong lapse in judgement - but let me be clear - nothing happened between me and my costar, he continued.

Rumors of a royal rift between Duchesses Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton have led many to believe that their husbands, Princes William and Harry, have also grown apart — but Princess Diana's former royal butler insists that is far from the truth.\n\nI do not believe that William and Harry are growing apart, Paul Burrell told Closer Weekly Tuesday. They may have differences, as they are two very different personalities, [but] I think that her life bond was forged at the time of their mother's death and they are inseparable.\n\nThe 60-year-old served as a footman to Queen Elizabeth II before he began working for their mother, the late Princess of Wales.\n\nBurrell described Harry, 34, as fiery and impulsive, while sibling William, 36, is more calm and considered. And with William being second in line to the British throne, Burrell said he is naturally more reserved.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE AND PRINCE HARRY MISSED KATE MIDDLETON'S BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION\n\nBurrell dismissed reports of an alleged feud between William and Harry.\n\nI have not noticed a rift between the two brothers, he said. They are independent young men who still forge ahead together as part of young team Windsor but have different roles and destinies.\n\nThis is exactly the press speculation [their grandmother Queen Elizabeth II] faced with her sister Princess Margaret, he added. The two were constantly compared yet they remained lifelong friends and were very close.\n\nAnd when it comes to their wives, Burrell insisted the women also likely have differences of opinion about their roles within the royal household.\n\nThey are different women with different roles from different cultures, he told the magazine. Kate knows that Meghan is no threat to her and Meghan is mature enough to realize that her role is vastly different to Kate's.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE'S FAMILY FEUD REVEALED\n\nThe first signs of distress came in November when The Telegraph reported that Markle made Middleton cry over an argument involving bridesmaid dresses for the former Suits star's wedding to Harry. The American actress said I do to the prince in a televised wedding ceremony in May 2018.\n\nThe alleged tension between the two duchesses, both 37 years old, has been widely rumored as the reason behind the announcement of Markle and Harry moving out of London's Kensington Palace, where Middleton resides with William.\n\nRoyal expert Leslie Carroll, who recently published a book titled American Princess: The Love Story of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, told Fox News that at the time of the purported bridesmaid dresses incident, Middleton was still recovering from giving birth to her third child, Prince Louis, on April 23. Therefore, she would have naturally been in a more emotional state while Markle was attempting to navigate her new life leading up to the royal wedding.\n\nKate was postpartum at that time, said Carroll. She's hormonal and sensitive. And the first thing anyone has said about Meghan was how kind she was. Her sorority sisters, her former teachers – the first word that came to anyone's mind was 'kind.' So the fact that Meghan was not kind implies other things were going on… She had so much on her plate, it wouldn't have been surprising if she did snap.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIngrid Seward, the editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, has been covering the royal family since the 1980s and has written over 20 books on the subject. Her latest one, My Husband and I, analyzes the marriage of Elizabeth and Prince Philip.\n\nEVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT MEGHAN MARKLE'S ROYAL BABY\n\nSeward told Fox News Markle and Harry's plans to live in Frogmore Cottage has nothing to do with a so-called feud rocking the monarchy. She shared Harry has always yearned to leave London for quieter, more private pastures.\n\nI don't think Harry moving out has anything to do about a fallout with his brother, said Seward. Kensington Palace is a huge enclave. It's like a village. And Harry always felt very restrictive living there. He has said as much. And I think he wanted to be away from Kensington Palace and the royals there. Maybe he wasn't getting on with his brother as he used to, but families are like that. You don't have to get on with your sibling all the time.
Beloved Hollywood icon Kirk Douglas, who died on Wednesday at the age of 103, lived a long and prosperous life -- but there was one day he said changed the course of it forever.\n\nThe golden age era icon released a memoir back in 2000 titled Climbing the Mountain: My Search for Meaning, in which he described in detail the fateful day of Feb. 13, 1991, when he survived a helicopter crash that took the lives of two.\n\nIn the memoir, Douglas wrote that he was a passenger in a helicopter flown by his pilot friend Noel Blanc and co-pilot Michael Carra, according to People. The three were taking off at Santa Paula Airport in Calif. when their helicopter collided with a Pitts aerobatic plane flown by Lee Manelski, 47, and student pilot David Tomlinson, 18, who did not survive.\n\nKIRK DOUGLAS RECEIVES TRIBUTES FROM HOLLYWOOD STARS\n\nDouglas wrote that Feb. 13, 1991, was a date he'd never forget and also called it the most important day of my life.\n\nIn that horrible fraction of a second, the rotating blades of Noel's Bell Ranger helicopter slice into the wing of David and Lee's Pitts, ripping it open and exposing its fuel to air, Douglas wrote via People. Carried by its fateful momentum, the little plane continued to rise forward into the blue sky. An instant later, the fuel caught fire. The Pitts exploded in a fireball.\n\nDouglas shared that he was unconscious when the helicopter he was flying in fell 20 to 40 feet from the sky and crashed into the tarmac.\n\n'YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS' STAR KRISTOFF ST. JOHN REMEMBERED BY EX-WIFE MIA ONE YEAR AFTER TRAGIC DEATH\n\nI didn't know that from this day forward I would be asking: Why did they die? Why was I alive? the famed actor and producer wrote.\n\nDouglas wrote that he had no memory of being pulled from the wreckage and brought to the emergency room via an ambulance, according to People. He did, however, remember the names of the victims.\n\nSomewhere out there, not too far from where I lay, the lives of the people who loved them were forever changed...and now mine had as well, the actor wrote.\n\nOn Wednesday, Douglas' son, actor Michael Douglas, confirmed his father's death in a statement shared on social media.\n\nKIRK DOUGLAS' DAUGHTER-IN-LAW CATHERINE ZETA-JONES REACTS TO HIS DEATH\n\nIt is with tremendous sadness that my brothers and I announce that Kirk Douglas left us today at the age of 103, Michael Douglas wrote.\n\nHe continued: To the world he was a legend, an actor from the golden age of movies who lived well into his golden years, a humanitarian whose commitment to justice and the causes he believed in set a standard for all of us to aspire to.\n\nBut to me and my brothers Joel and Peter he was simply Dad, to Catherine, a wonderful father-in-law, to his grandchildren and great-grandchild their loving grandfather, and to his wife Anne, a wonderful husband, he added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMichael concluded his post by writing: Kirk's life was well lived, and he leaves a legacy in film that will endure for generations to come, and a history as a renowned philanthropist who worked to aid the public and bring peace to the planet. Let me end with the words I told him on his last birthday and which will always remain true. Dad- I love you so much and I am so proud to be your son.\n\nThe statement did not indicate how or where he died. Dozens of stars reacted to the news on Wednesday with tributes and memories of the Spartacus actor, who had celebrated his 103rd birthday in December.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 65 years (married May 29, 1954) Anne Buydens, their son Peter Douglas, two sons from his first marriage -- Michael and Joel Douglas -- and seven grandchildren.\n\nFox News' Mariah Haas contributed to this report.

Prince Harry has no interest in having his life with Meghan Markle play out for all to see on the The Crown and would likely spurn any attempt to have their narrative written for a script, according to biographer Angela Levin.\n\nLevin, who penned the 2018 book Harry: A Biography of a Prince, spoke to BBC Breakfast on Monday and she shared a tidbit from an interview she did with the Duke of Sussex in which Harry jokingly vowed to stop any production of the popular Netflix series should they move to make a season centered on his marriage to Markle.\n\nHarry, when I went to interview him in the palace, the first thing he said to me when he shook my hand was, 'Are you watching 'The Crown'?' said Levin. And I hadn't been at the time, I felt very embarrassed.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE STEPS OUT WITH BABY ARCHIE AFTER 'MEGXIT' ANNOUNCEMENTS\n\nHarry then joked: I'm going to make sure I stop it before they get to me, according to Levin.\n\nDespite teasing that it's his mission to never be featured on the series, Suzanne Mackie, executive producer of The Crown, said the show might not even make it to Harry and Markle's era, so the couple might be in the clear.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY NOT 'BEING VERY REALISTIC' IN HOPES FOR CALMER FUTURE, AUTHOR SAYS\n\nTo be honest, whatever the life of 'The Crown' is after where we are now, I doubt we'll ever go as far into the present day, Mackie told the BBC News in an interview last week. I think we'll probably ... we don't travel into the present day.\n\nThe series currently takes place between 1964 and 1977 and portrays the life of the royal family from the time when the queen was crowned.\n\nThe show's creator, Peter Morgan, also echoed Mackie's sentiment in 2018, telling Entertainment Weekly that Markle's likeness was unlikely to be featured in the series simply because it's too close to the moment.\n\nPRINCE HARRY ARRIVES IN CANADA, REUNITES WITH MEGHAN MARKLE: REPORT\n\nI feel uncomfortable writing about events within a certain time period, he said.\n\nOn Jan. 8, Harry and Meghan announced they would take a step back as senior members of the royal family and instead work independently, splitting their time between the United Kingdom and North America, specifically Canada.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nQueen Elizabeth II accepted the couple's desire on Saturday, with Buckingham Palace releasing a statement that the duo will no longer be referred to as his or her royal highness.

Cloris Leachman, known for her decades-long career in film, television and beyond, has died at the age of 94.\n\nShe died on Wednesday of natural causes, her rep told Fox News.\n\nLeachman was a history-making actress, having racked up more Emmy award wins than any other performer in the business with eight awards for primetime programming and an additional Daytime Emmy for appearing in ABC Afterschool Specials.\n\nHowever, her career was stuffed to the gills outside of television as well, having appeared in a number of high-profile movies and even earning an Oscar in 1972 for her supporting role in The Last Picture Show.\n\nCLORIS LEACHMAN, LEGENDARY ACTRESS, DEAD AT 94\n\nHere's a look at Leachman's most famous roles:\n\nThe Mary Tyler Moore Show (1970-1977)\n\nLeachman first achieved widespread success and fame when she appeared on The Mary Tyler Moore Show as the self-centered landlady to Moore's Mary Richards. She often traded jabs with other ladies of the neighborhood.\n\nThe star appeared in 35 episodes of the iconic sitcom, skipping out only on the show's sixth season, though her role became greatly reduced by the third.\n\nCELEBRITIES REACT TO CLORIS LEACHMAN'S DEATH: 'ALWAYS LEFT US SMILING'\n\nLeachman's first Emmy nomination came in 1972 for her work on the show, and she'd go on to win two Emmys and be nominated for another for The Mary Tyler Moore Show alone.\n\nShe would later star in a spin-off of the show called Phyllis.\n\nThe Last Picture Show (1971)\n\nNot long after showing the world just how funny she could be, Leachman appeared in The Last Picture Show, based on the 1966 Larry McMurtry novel of the same name.\n\nIn the flick, the actress plays Ruth Popper, the depressed wife of a high school football coach, who strikes up an affair with one of her husband's students.

The wife of a University of Central Florida faculty member was arrested Wednesday after she allegedly stabbed her 65-year-old spouse to death in January and attempted to cover up the murder by saying he stabbed himself, court records showed.\n\nDanielle Justine Redlick, 45, was arrested on charges of second-degree murder and tampering with evidence more than three weeks after her husband, Michael Redlick, was found dead inside their home in Winter Park, Fla., the Orlando Sentinel reported.

Andy had a heart attack while Chaina had been battling lung cancer.\n\nThe veteran talk show host was moved to the ICU on New Year's Eve and was receiving oxygen but is now breathing on his own, said David Theall, a spokesman for Ora Media, a production company formed by King.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe broadcaster has had numerous health issues in recent years, including heart trouble, diabetes and lung cancer, the Associated Press reported.\n\nOra Media plans to announce a memorial service later in coordination with the King family.\n\nFox News' Brian Flood contributed to this report.
Dr. Dre has reached a temporary agreement with his estranged wife, Nicole Young, as their divorce is ongoing in court.\n\nThe hip-hop star -- born Andre Young -- has agreed to pay $2 million in spousal support to Young, 51, according to The Blast, citing court documents.\n\nThe money will cover Young's living expenses until April 2021, the outlet reports.\n\nThe business mogul and Young have been married for 24 years. In June, Young filed for divorce.\n\nDR. DRE HOSPITALIZED FOR REPORTED BRAIN ANEURYSM\n\nEarly reports claimed there was tension between the pair after Young claimed the two did not have a prenup. Dre, however, filed a prenup with the court in late December, according to TMZ. His filing states that all property acquired between the couple from the beginning of their marriage is separate.\n\nThe temporary financial agreement comes days after Dre was hospitalized in Los Angeles for a possible brain aneurysm.\n\nThe star revealed on Instagram that he'd been admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Tuesday, alongside a black-and-white photo of himself sitting in front of a soundboard.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nThanks to my family, friends and fans for their interest and well wishes, he wrote in the caption. I'm doing great and getting excellent care from my medical team. I will be out of the hospital and back home soon.\n\nHe concluded: Shout out to all the great medical professionals at Cedars. One Love!!\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile the music mogul, 55, didn't reveal the reason for his hospitalization, the Los Angeles Times reported he was admitted to the center after signs of a possible brain aneurysm. His hospitalization garnered well wishes from his fellow N.W.A. alum Ice Cube and other artists including Ciara, LL Cool J and Charlie Puth.
This is a rush transcript from The Greg Gutfeld Show, January 12, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why not sign the other bills though, so some of these workers can get paid, the government --\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You think I should do that?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You --\n\nTRUMP: No, no. Do you think I should do that, John?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, it's not for me to say --\n\nTRUMP: And then I watch your one-side reporting, do you think I should do that? Hey, John. No, seriously, John, do you think I should just sign?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, the argument --\n\nTRUMP: No, tell me. Tell me.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you could sign the bill, it has nothing to do with border security.\n\nTRUMP: John, do you think I should just sign.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am saying that if you sign that, these workers can start getting paid. The government --\n\nTRUMP: So you would do that if you were in my position, you would do that?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am not in your position, I am asking you if that's something you --\n\nTRUMP: I am asking you, would you do that if you were in my position? Because if you would do that, you should never be in this position because you'd never get anything done.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGREG GUTFELD, HOST: I will never get tired of that. Yes, all right, after President Trump's address on the border, the Democratic Party sent out these two carnival cutouts as a rebuttal. All that's missing were the beanbags to toss through their pie holes.\n\nTalk about stiff, are we sure this wasn't a subtle promotion for the new season of The Walking Dead? Brought to you by the makers of formaldehyde. It's odorless, tasteless but keeps you in government for decades.\n\nLook at him. Now, I'm not talking about how they look. That's too easy. It's just how they are, like a couple of greeters at Cigar World, old people get that. You want a wall. That's a wall. There's - they are so rigid they make Mike Pence look like this guy.\n\n(VIDEO PLAYS)\n\nGUTFELD: To be that lawn, but it makes you wonder, what were they thinking?\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: On the very first day of this Congress, House Democrats passed Senate Republican legislation --\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where am I? Where do I look? Straight ahead?\n\nPELOSI: ... border security solutions.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Should I have worn my glasses? But they tickle my nose.\n\nPELOSI: ... which would reopen government.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why does she get to speak first? She always does? I hate her.\n\nPELOSI: ... to waste billions of dollars ...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: And I have better hair. I pay a lot for it.\n\nPELOSI: ... and while he always promised --\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Plus I'm a senator, so I get to stand on a little wooden box, do you know how many squirrels it took to make this weave?\n\nPELOSI: ... held hostage critical services.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I love squirrels. They have big fluffy tails. One covers my bald spot.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGUTFELD: True. Now if you're looking for proof of how truly screwed up government is, look no further. Trump's address wasn't earth-shattering. He colored within the lines. He stuck to the facts even repeating the same points that Democrats and the media had stated before. Still it didn't matter. The media was giddy with fact-checking.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBROOKE BALDWIN, ANCHOR, CNN: Fact checkers, eat your Wheaties today.\n\nJULIA AINSLEY, NATIONAL SECURITY AND JUSTICE REPORTER, NBC NEWS: Yes, we'll be fact-checking relentlessly.\n\nHEATHER MCGHEE, NBC: They have to have real-time fact checking.\n\nJIM ACOSTA, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Setting the scene for an address that will test the fact checkers later on tonight.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGUTFELD: Oh they're so excited. They're like grade school kids around free ice cream or Kevin Spacey at a high-school wrestling match, but when the time came, there wasn't much to fact-check. The crime stats were legit. The number of kids abandoned factual. The anecdotes Trump listed sadly were all too real, which is why they had to redefine fact-checking as disgruntled commentary.\n\nSeriously, I wonder what they were thinking.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y., SENATE MINORITY LEADER: We address you tonight for one reason only.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I could really go for a hoagie with ham, cheese, onions, lettuce, pickles, some mustard.\n\nSCHUMER: ... and unable to convince ...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Pastrami, salami, tomatoes, no, no tomatoes. More cheese. The cheese with holes.\n\nSCHUMER: ... work that way. We don't govern by temper tantrum.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why does cheese have holes? That seems looks like a rip-off. Talk about cheese with holes. Oh, god, what is that smell? Oh Chuck, not again. That is just deadly. See a doctor, please? I think something is dead inside you.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGUTFELD: And of course, the media made fools of themselves pretending there is no crisis when just weeks before, they were calling it a crisis themselves. Remember the caravan? Wasn't that a crisis? Not anymore.\n\nAINSLEY: The big scam of the whole address was that there's a crisis. There's not a crisis.\n\nRACHEL MADDOW, ANCHOR, MSNBC: The President's speech was a litany of scare stories about immigrants being terrible criminals.\n\nDON LEMON, ANCHOR, CNN: This is a crisis that he wants you to believe is worth shutting down, a manufactured crisis.\n\nACOSTA: So that address probably should have come with a Surgeon General's warning it was hazardous to the truth.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGUTFELD: You know that Acosta practiced that line in front of a CNN bathroom mirror and Don Lemon was like, Killer line, Jim. Don't forget to flush. But damn, if Jimmy doesn't make Trump's points for him.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nACOSTA: Here are some of the steel slats that the President has been talking about, right here, and as we're walking along here, we're not seeing any kind of imminent danger. There are no migrants trying to rush toward this fence here in the McAllen, Texas area. No sign of the national emergency that the President has been talking about. As a matter of fact, it's pretty tranquil down here.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGUTFELD: Okay, so here I am in front of a wall and there are no illegals crossing it. Some people might call that cause and effect, but not Jim, they have nothing to do with each other. You know he should do more of this. You know, Here I am holding an umbrella in the rain and my god I am dry. Clearly, there's no rain. Now, when I put on these sunglasses, suddenly the sun's glare is gone. Obviously, the sun has gone missing, but I wonder if Trump appreciated the sales pitch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: Good job yesterday. I appreciate your sales pitch. I appreciate your sales pitch.\n\nACOSTA: I didn't see an invasion at the border.\n\nTRUMP: Oh, you didn't, I now. That's because we had a wall.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGUTFELD: Oh my god. I don't care. I don't care what you think of Trump. You could put him on Rushmore for that alone. As for poor Jim, that wasn't even the worst part of his week.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nACOSTA: Can you promise that the President will tell the truth tonight? Will he tell the truth?\n\nKELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSEL TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yes, Jim, and do you promise that you will? The whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God --\n\nACOSTA: I'm not the one who has the alternative facts problem like you do.\n\nCONWAY: Well, you know, Jim, I know that's a -- make sure that goes viral. This is why, by the way, this is why I am one of the only people around here who even gives you the time of day.\n\nACOSTA: Okay, can you guarantee that the President's speech will pass a fact check? Could you guarantee that he President's speech will pass a fact check?\n\nCONWAY: Let me get back in your face because you're such a smart ass (inaudible), but let me just be respectful to the media at large because I always am. I explained that that was alternative information and additional facts, and I explain it many times and don't you put it back in my face for all the corrections that your networking has issued.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGUTFELD: I have a public service announcement.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: And now a public service announcement.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGUTFELD: If you happen to come across two fleshy prune sized orbs rolling down Pennsylvania Avenue, please put them on ice and promptly returned them to Jim Acosta.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: This has been a public service announcement.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGUTFELD: So the crisis is now a circus. How did this happen? Well, we know that the media makes everything worse, including even politics which is already the worst thing ever. Politics is the invisible gas that seeps into any discussion, removing nuance and compromise and replacing both with what I call the prison of two ideas and each side must pick their cell and never leave.\n\nSo even if Chuck agreed with Trump on immigration just a few years ago, it doesn't really matter. He's got to stay in his cell and the media makes it worse by turning these prisons into business models. There's no way MSNBC or the New York Times can make any money if Chuck and Nancy agree with Trump. Compromise doesn't sell advertising.\n\nMeanwhile, this is all made possible by two years of peace and prosperity. Seriously, the only way we can endure this kind of idiotic malfeasance is if all the big stuff is taken care of -- jobs, terror, economy -- because Trump has gone down his list and ticked off all the big things, the Dems can afford to indulge this lunacy, holding workers hostage and pretending walls are some immoral phenomenon that Trump somehow just invented.\n\nIt's quite a spectacle. It makes you hate our government. It makes you want to turn off the news and God forbid, go talk to your family. Most of all, it makes you see things as they really are or rather who they really are and what they're really thinking.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPELOSI: He promised to keep government shutdown for months or years.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where am? I am I still here? I should be home by now.\n\nThe Greg Gutfeld Show is on. He always has a good take on things.\n\nPELOSI: ... our borders, while honoring our values.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure he can be rude, but I usually find him to be spot-on in his analysis.\n\nPELOSI: ... the kind of strong new technology ...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a shame they canceled Sarah Silverman's show, maybe she can get a job writing for Greg Gutfeld.\n\nPELOSI: ... to facilitate trade.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's that smell? Is that me? I've got to get out of here. Look out below.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGUTFELD: Let's welcome tonight's guests. All right, his jokes are so good it almost makes you forget that he got dressed in the dark. Comedian Jimmy Failla. His jokes are so dry, each punchline comes with a bottle of water, comedian, David Angelo. She's had more bad dates than a stale fruitcake, National Review reporter, Kat Timpf. He's no muss, no fuss and likes to cuss, former WWE Superstar and my massive sidekick, Tyrus, host of UnPC.\n\nAll right, Jimmy, how long do you think this is going to go on? What did\n\nyou make of the whole week?\n\nJIMMY FAILLA, AMERICAN COMEDIAN: Wow, I have a lot invested in this because I consider myself a Dreamer because I'm a Knicks fan and I will have you know that I did get a compliment on this jacket today.\n\nGUTFELD: Really? From who?\n\nFAILLA: I appreciated it so much I stood there and pet his seeing-eye dog for like 10 minutes and I said thank you. This shutdown and though it is, it is so stupid because it's personal, and I say it's stupid as someone who locks his keys in the car twice a year. I am aware of my contribution to the discussion, but in any other era, any other era, they would have ended this in three days. He would gladly give them a piece of DACA funding or DACA approval and they would give him wall funding and we'd all move on. But they can't give him a win.\n\nGUTFELD: No, they can't.\n\nFAILLA: This is personal.\n\nGUTFELD: No, it is. It is. It totally is.\n\nFAILLA: It is petty and stupid.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, what do you make of this, David? Thoughts?\n\nDAVID ANGELO, AMERICAN COMEDIAN: Well, they talk about this shutdown and what a tragedy it is. I had this week three letters from the IRS.\n\nGUTFELD: It's amazing how that part doesn't shutdown?\n\nANGELO: Yes, and then they're on TV like oh, think of the poor government workers. It's like - I don't care. Is that wrong? I don't know.\n\nGUTFELD: Well, I don't know. I mean, it might be wrong. It might be insensitive, right, but then again, to call you insensitive that means nothing to you because you're insensitive.\n\nANGELO: Yes, I'm kind of like a bad boy.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, you really are. I think you live by your own rules.\n\nANGELO: I do, yes.\n\nGUTFELD: You do.\n\nGEORGE TYRUS MURDOCH, HOST: Good luck going through TSA, Bris.\n\nANGELO: Well, that's the other thing. Everyone is like, Oh TSA, we miss TSA now. Listen, I am -- I hate them.\n\nGUTFELD: You are definitely not a flyer.\n\nANGELO: I am.\n\nFAILLA: I hate a letter from the IRS, but I've got an even shocking - more shocking letter this week.\n\nGUTFELD: What?\n\nFAILLA: And I don't mean to brag, but I went to Community College and I got a fundraising letter from Nassau Community College. I'm like, Dude, I went to Community College. I should be asking you for money. I'm like, you don't even know - you mailed this to a car, you don't even know if I have a house. Just sad.\n\nGUTFELD: That is true. All right, Kat, I know you're in the middle of a coughing spell.\n\nKATHERINE TIMPF, REPORTER, NATIONAL REVIEW: Doing my best to keep it under control, Greg.\n\nGUTFELD: You know what, you're America's hero.\n\nTIMPF: Thank you.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\nTIMPF: That is how I see myself. Is there a question? Do you want to hear about my cough? It started like two days ago. It's been getting progressively worse. I had a difficult time sleeping. Do you want to know about something else?\n\nGUTFELD: Let's go for something else.\n\nTIMPF: Okay, this shutdown?\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\nTIMPF: You want to talk about the wall?\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, the wall and the shutdown?\n\nTIMPF: Well, I am talking about the wall. Look, I'm not for the wall personally, but the thing about me is I've like never been for it, whereas a lot of these Democrats were for a physical barrier before Trump started saying he was for a physical barrier.\n\nSo it's not really about what they believe in, it's about them being so obsessed with the idea of being against Trump. They're completely obsessed with it. They say Trump's obsessed with the wall, but it's like if you have a friend who's like, Oh my ex-boyfriend is so obsessed with me, but that's all they talk about, like what do you want to get for dinner? Well, oh my yes, my ex-boyfriend is obsessed with me. He used to eat dinner, too and he's so obsessed with me. It's like, it sounds like you're obsessed, too, Sharon, you know.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, you should not be - you shouldn't use Sharon's name. She's in the green room.\n\nTIMPF: Well, she needs to know.\n\nGUTFELD: I don't know. I don't know. She's a bit unstable.\n\nTIMPF: I think that public shaming is very effective in a free society.\n\nGUTFELD: I agree. All right, Tyrus, I have to say, whether you have disagreements with Trump over 80%, 90%, just his expert trolling to me means that he might be the greatest President we've ever had.\n\nMURDOCH: I don't know about greatest President, but he damn sure is a Hall of Fame bully, like straight up, like, I'm a little worried I might not get in now because he sets the bar. I've got to start you know going back to Melvin's and shoving guys in lockers again.\n\nLike this is - seriously ...\n\nGUTFELD: You think that's bullying. I think it's hilarious.\n\nMURDOCH: All right, meet me in a locker room sometime. We'll play.\n\nGUTFELD: I don't know what that means.\n\nMURDOCH: I think that's - I think his ability to fire back is probably the worst part of the media's job because they usually write their stuff down. They're not improv guys, which is - what clearly is like on the fly, they've got nothing. Like Acosta with his little parent advisory, doctor advisory, that literally was written down and the guy was like, watch I hit him with this question you know, are you going to sign this just so they can get their jobs back? Would you? Huh? And the guy was like, Well, I'm not in -- Answer question? Would you?\n\nAnd then he pees and then like he starts to shake, you know what I'm saying? Like this was great. It was like it was literally - I thought I was watching a few good neighbors like, did you want a code red or not? And the reporters were like, No, please, stop. You know what I am saying? Like, I love the fact that he has like his way of doing things the same way. Mine is when I get caught and are in trouble or something, I turn around on you.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\nMURDOCH: You know what I am saying? And his ability to turn around is amazing, like he will never lose a debate, ever, and like foreign countries have got to just be terrorizing in a closed room with him because he's never going to be wrong and if you don't have your stuff together, he's going to make you cry and wet your pants like that reporter.\n\nI guarantee you. I guarantee you, they're like, Dude, you just peed your pants. Because he asked me to answer a question.\n\nGUTFELD: All right, we've got to move. We've got so much more, including a nude restaurant. Yes, a nude restaurant. I've been wanting to do this story all year. But first, what do you call an Oscars without a host? Maybe finally, watchable.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nGUTFELD: The host is toast, Variety - a magazine reports that the Academy Awards will move forward without a big-name emcee. By now you know that Kevin Hart was going to host, then dropped out because people dug up some old controversial tweets of his.\n\nSo apparently, it was Kevin or no one. A million famous people, Oscars couldn't get one of them to host. You had one job, Oscars and he just gave up the. Did you ask William Devane? No. And he's awesome. You need someone to keep the show moving, get my Uncle Carl. He runs Bingo Wednesday nights. He'd totally do it. What about Alf? Alf. He will insult you, but you won't feel threatened. He's like a furry Don Rickles. How about Ted Cruz's beard? Did you ask Ted Cruz's beard? Not Ted, just the beard. I love that beard.\n\nYou know, I understand it though you need an A-list person, squeaky clean, professional, no-nonsense, what you see is what you get. I know who should host.\n\n(VIDEO PLAYS)\n\nGUTFELD: But only if his wife co-host with him, right? That's it.\n\nFAILLA: I got it.\n\nGUTFELD: Thank you, Jimmy, somebody got that joke. David, Kevin Hart, should he have dropped out completely? What do you make of this?\n\nANGELO: No, I don't think so. The thing is people, have the - expectations are too high for comedians. A comedian --\n\nGUTFELD: Not for you.\n\nANGELO: It's true. A good comedian is a crazy person who can speak coherently for a short period of time, and when you need to do this whole thing with like, Oh you're past, and all of that. That's why no one will do the hosting because it's like, stop, we don't want you digging through.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, exactly.\n\nANGELO: And the best - the only good news is if you've been like in prison for the past 30 years, usually that's hard to get a job, but now they get out and they're like, you know employers are like, Well, this guy, he killed a family in Kansas in 1971, but he's never been on Twitter, he starts Monday.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, he left a bloody footprint, but he has no social media footprint.\n\nANGELO: Yes, perfect.\n\nGUTFELD: Tyrus, should Kevin Hart have stayed in and then destroyed the place? Wouldn't that have been the ultimate if he said, You know, I'll do it and then just completely let loose.\n\nMURDOCH: I think he destroyed the place by saying, Nah, I'm good.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, it's true.\n\nMURDOCH: I think he - you know, when it comes to being a comedian, censorship it's just as bad as telling reporters what they can and cannot report on. You know, the day they start saying what you can't report on when it's like anything can be the news, anything can be a joke and most of most - especially in American culture, joking is how we close the gaps.\n\nGUTFELD: Exactly.\n\nMURDOCH: Making - bringing up stuff is how we change the way we think. We're closer with people with differences because we can laugh about it because we make it normal and it's like, Oh, you're this way and I'm that way. Like, really you and me are a walking joke, but it works because in every other walk of life, if we didn't have humor between us --\n\nGUTFELD: You'd kill me.\n\nMURDOCH: Yes, probably. Or worse, you would have called the police on me when I went, Hey, what's wrong? Why are you acting that way?\n\nGUTFELD: I still may do that.\n\nMURDOCH: You know what I am saying? But the point is like, I applaud him for saying, No. Forget it.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, you're right though because the modern progressive movement is eliminating the lubrication that keeps people from killing each other. It's like if you remove humor, Jimmy, we're going to kill each other. The Oscars basically threw in the towel against the mob. They said, We're not going to do it.\n\nFAILLA: Yes, and to be honest with you, at first I thought it was a bad idea to have a show without a host and then I saw the host on the Golden Globes do their monologue, and I was like, yes, maybe, but I think the problem is, it is having a detrimental impact on society in a few ways.\n\nI mean, first of all, we've become so obsessed with words, you can't even call a moron, a moron anymore. You have to call them Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and moron was quicker. Moron was quicker.\n\nGUTFELD: But who should host? Who should host?\n\nFAILLA: Who should host? I'd agree with Alf at first, but he's an alien and Trump deported him. So he's gone.\n\nGUTFELD: Nicely done.\n\nFAILLA: He is on the other side, but again a lot of the PC stuff is you're right to say that we're caving into a group of insufferable people that we hate these people outside of Twitter. You know what I mean? No one would ever go to a party and bring up a joke you told 10 years ago and then shame you into leaving the party. You know why? Because those kind of people don't get invited to parties. That's the point.\n\nGUTFELD: Exactly.\n\nFAILLA: But all of these like PC things are having a negative impact on society, like I read a study the other day that 40% of elementary school children are obese and they're not doing anything about it because they don't know they're obese. Yes, that's what happens when you eliminate bullying, you know what I am saying?\n\nGUTFELD: Always with the positive aspect.\n\nFAILLA; Thank you.\n\nGUTFELD: All right, last word, Kat, we have this insatiable persecution complex that we just want to persecute anybody. What's next? What's going to happen? I don't know.\n\nTIMPF: What's going to happen?\n\nGUTFELD: I don't know.\n\nTIMPF: You know, I've got to be honest. I tried really, really hard to find something inside of me that cared about the Oscars.\n\nGUTFELD: Right, yes.\n\nTIMPF: I was not successful.\n\nGUTFELD: No, no.\n\nTIMPF: I see people - I see people get so emotional about it like all this, even the Golden Globes like Lady Gaga lost, like if you're so sad that one very rich person lost something else to another very rich person and that's emotionally affecting you, you need to calm down.\n\nGUTFELD: I think that's really good advice. Very good. I think - you know what? I think you could be a good therapist.\n\nTIMPF: Oh yes. That's clearly my calling.\n\nGUTFELD: It really is.\n\nTIMPF: Leading by example.\n\nGUTFELD: Exactly.\n\nMURDOCH: If they knew enough.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, all right. Up next, a nude restaurant - yes, we have pictures. This is called the long T's people. Believe me, huge spiders will descend from your ceiling. Choose wisely.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nLAUREN BLANCHARD, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Lauren Blanchard. President Trump reportedly concealed details about encounters with Vladimir Putin from senior officials in his administration, that's according to the Washington Post. This reportedly happened during five face-to-face meetings. During one encounter the President reportedly took the interpreter's notes. He then instructed that individual not to discuss the meeting with White House officials. The President called the article fake.\n\nAn American doctor possibly exposed to the Ebola virus while working in the Congo was released from the hospital today. He left the Nebraska Medical Center after completing a 21-day monitoring period. He has shown no symptoms of the disease. More than 350 people have died in the Ebola crisis currently affecting the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I'm Lauren Blanchard, now back to The Greg Gutfeld Show. For all your headlines, log on to foxnews.com.\n\nGUTFELD: Does the world fail at protecting the male? A new study finds that when it comes to gender equality, men face more discrimination globally than women do. Here's a sample of the news coverage on this landmark global study.\n\n(VIDEO PLAYS)\n\nGUTFELD: I guess, when it doesn't fit the narrative, it doesn't exist. Anyway, researchers evaluated billions of people in 134 countries for educational opportunities, life expectancy and overall life satisfaction. It turns out men are disadvantaged in 91 countries compared to 43 nations for women citing that men typically face harsher punishments for similar crimes, mandatory military service and more workplace deaths.\n\nThe leading discriminators are the U.S., the U.K. and Australia. In short, being a man on this planet sucks. There should be some kind of public service announcement to get the word out.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTOM SHILLUE, HOST, FOX NATION: Lately, I've had the urge to grill chicken, fish, steaks and create delicious dinners for my family, friends and neighbors. I take pride when they enjoy what I cook. It's kind of weird.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: For some reason, I find tremendous satisfaction assembling a treehouse for my kids. I can't stop reading directions and then putting things together that contribute to the well-being of my community. Last weekend, I helped build a school. It's creepy, I know.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I notice that I feel better knowing my family is well protected and secure. I take pains to make sure that's possible. I worry about my loved ones and I take self-defense classes. I have the best alarm system for my home. What's wrong with me?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It sounds like these men have a problem. In medical circles, we call this PMS: Persistent Masculinity Syndrome or in plainer terms, you're a dude. A typical man. See if you have any of these recurring symptoms.\n\nSHILLUE: I don't think twice about working overtime so I can afford a better life for my kids. I'd probably lie awake at night worrying about it, but I'm too tired at the end of the day.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I actually think opening a door for a woman or buying her dinner is the least I can do because women are [bleep] awesome. I mean where the hell do they come from?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I love it when I open a jar in front of other people. Come on here, give me a jar. I can't stop.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Every day, I'm more and more willing to risk my life to build a bridge or dig a tunnel to improve you and your family's lives. I almost lost a thumb last week. I found it in my bowling bag.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I you feel any of these symptoms, you may in fact be a man, which comes with a higher risk of industrial accidents, shorter lifespan, may be a stint in prison, but it also comes with the higher risk of being awesome.\n\nNow, you may ask, is there a cure for being a man? There is. Being a wuss. Apologizing, groveling, or you can embrace your affliction instead. Man-up today.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Side effects include being brave, wonderful, fatherly and sacrificing. Some male pattern baldness may occur. They lead to hobbies.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGUTFELD: Nice. Excellent. All right, Kat. Does this study make you sympathetic towards the plight of men or do you have the world's smallest violin when you heard this?\n\nTIMPF: It's [bleep]. Do you know how long it takes to strap all of this fake hair into my head? Do you know ...\n\nGUTFELD: I'd seen it.\n\nTIMPF: ... long it takes in the hair and makeup chair people like, Women live longer than men. Yes, and all those extra years, I'm spending getting someone else's hair strapped into my head to be acceptable to society.\n\nMURDOCH: I've seen it.\n\nTIMPF: Have you ever - have you ever had to sit at your desk and wait for no one to be looking at you so you can put a tampon up your sleeve and walk to the bathroom because you can't talk about having your period, no you have to whisper about having your period. It's like, Do you have a tampon? It's like you just murdered somebody because you have a functioning female body and apparently that's somehow disgusting.\n\nFAILLA: The part of that rant that I thought was the funniest that Kat said she's accepted in society, I think that that's amazing.\n\nTIMPF: I think I'm much more accepted with the fake hair than without.\n\nGUTFELD: All right, but next week's show, no fake hair and no glasses.\n\nTIMPF: Oh ...\n\nMURDOCH: Oh, hell no.\n\nTIMPF: Only my father can see me like that.\n\nMURDOCH: You know what, and I will hold a box of - I will one hundred percent hold a box of tampons in the show. And I will tell you, I will go buy them for you, ladies and I don't care. I'd rather buy tampons than Similac and diapers. I'll be the happiest dude juggling tampons in line instead of having to buy diapers and Similac and baby stuff. You were scared of a cockroach in the green room. Screaming for help and who came to save it? Did I ask questions? Did I say, Oh, equal rights, lady. You have to take care of this. I said, Hell no. Give me that. Walked it out. Walked this little punk ass out the door, boom.\n\nWhy? Because I am a healthy male.\n\nGUTFELD: Mr. Angelo.\n\nANGELO: Yes.\n\nGUTFELD: Please save me, you know, why this study is necessary, because I think the media created a fake antagonism between men and women, right? So it's always been about like men achieve at the expense of women, so finally we have to do something like this to say no, actually, we're complementary.\n\nANGELO: Yes, we - yes, you know and I would love to weigh in on the differences between men and women, but I'm trying to host the Oscars. I don't need this tape haunting me for the rest of my life. Women are great. Women are - that was already too far.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, it was.\n\nFAILLA: But that being said like, wouldn't you love to just drop this story on the set of The View and run out of the room. It'd be great.\n\nMURDOCH: There's be some head explosions\n\nFAILLA: Yes, by the way if anybody wants to see The View, I can get tickets. They are $10.00 to get in and $50.00 to get out.\n\nGUTFELD: We shall leave on that note. Up next, did I tell you about the nude restaurant we're doing a story on? It's a nude restaurant, so stick to your seats everyone because you know they did.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nGUTFELD: You know what we need more of?\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: User friendly, truth, tremendous, role model, reverse mortgage, patriot, noble --\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, yes, Greg's Heroes. It's all about people who inspire me because they make fearless choices and this week's hero turned a chicken soda into chicken salad. You may remember Alexa Greenfield who was ruthlessly berated on Twitter for doing nothing more than sitting at the U.S. Open dipping chicken fingers into a cup of Cola, oh, the holy hell that rained down on her dipping chicken in soda. Felony. Call the cops. Psychopath.\n\nBut did she let these haters win? No. Now Alexa is launching a cola flavored dipping sauce and she wants all the haters to try it saying quote, I think people will be surprised at how good it is. In 20 years, nobody will remember it was ever taboo to pair Cola in chicken. But the best part, she has now dropped a music video ahead of the launch of her new sauce.\n\n(VIDEO PLAYS)\n\nGUTFELD: I have to say that sticks in your head almost as much as this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGUTFELD: All right, Tyrus, this is what America is about taking something that originally was a source of embarrassment and turning it into an opportunity for profit.\n\nMURDOCH: I respect her hustle, not so much her music taste that was - I can't get that out of my head.\n\nGUTFELD: That's the chicken dance. You know that, right?\n\nMURDOCH: No, that's from like weddings, right? The whole --\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, it's the chicken dance.\n\nMURDOCH: Yes, I hate weddings, too, so I'm glad they found another thing for that horrible song. I think I'm threatened to punch somebody once they're like, Hey, do the chicken dance. Yo' mama, I'm not doing the chicken dance. Like this marriage ain't lasting six months, I'm not dancing for it. Like that's the type of guy I am - I think, like I said, the only problem I have with this, why would you need a sauce if you're just going to dip it in Coke anyways?\n\nYou know like - you know what I'm saying? Like, I hate to be the guy, but like, I'm going to make a sauce for $2.99, but the chicken thing just usually come with Coke.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, so you don't need the sauce.\n\nMURDOCH: You don't need the sauce.\n\nGUTFELD: You would be great on Shark Tank. I can hear you say like, I don't understand ...\n\nMURDOCH: I am not investing in this.\n\nGUTFELD: I don't understand why you need a sauce for this and for that reason, I'm out.\n\nMURDOCH: Yes, I'm out.\n\nFAILLA: Winner. Winner.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, David.\n\nANGELO: Can I go one step further? It's - why do you even need to dip it? Just drink the soda after you take a bite of the chicken.\n\nGUTFELD: And for that reason, I'm out.\n\nMURDOCH: Kat, would you invest?\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, what about - we haven't heard from you, Jimmy? Are you going to invest?\n\nFAILLA: I think she should host the Oscars. That's what I think. The only problem is she'll have to explain to the actresses what chicken fingers are. It's going to be a problem, like what's food? You know that song is annoying, but I am preoccupied by Baby Shark. Does anyone know Baby Shark?\n\nMURDOCH: My daughter knows it well. Yes, Baby Shark.\n\nFAILLA: We are screwing these kids over. We have a whole generation of kids now who think sharks are friendly and they're going to be jumping into the ocean and getting eaten because of this dumb song. Thank you, I'm done.\n\nMURDOCH: So are you buying? Are you investing or not?\n\nFAILLA: Oh, no. I'm all the way out.\n\nMURDOCH: Down to Kat.\n\nGUTFELD: I'm going to give you $20,000.00 for 97% of your business. That's that bald guy who always does that, Kat. Do you watch Shark Tank?\n\nTIMPF: Yes, sometimes.\n\nGUTFELD: Oh that's great.\n\nTIMPF: Yes, sometimes.\n\nGUTFELD: Okay, so do you find this woman to be a hero or an inspiration?\n\nTIMPF: I think she's an absolute genius. She understands how this country works. The only way to go more viral and become more famous in this country than being good at something is being very bad at something.\n\nGUTFELD: True.\n\nTIMPF: Look at Rebecca Black's Friday song. We all know who she is now because it was good, no because it was so bad. The music video was very bad and I had an idea for a new show.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\nTIMPF: We've got America's Got Talent. I want to start America's Got No Talent. Where everyone competes to see who's the worst comedian, the worst musician, the worst juggler magician, whatever. Everyone would watch that because we are a very hateful country.\n\nGUTFELD: We are.\n\nTIMPF: We love to make fun of people who are inferior so why not just broadcast that into everyone's living room rather than having to go to the mall to do it?\n\nGUTFELD: You just showed how young you are because it was called The Gong Show.\n\nMURDOCH: Yes.\n\nANGELO: Yes, it was called The Gong Show.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, there, it already happened.\n\nTIMPF: I am very young.\n\nMURDOCH: So do you invest?\n\nGUTFELD: Do you invest?\n\nTIMPF: I invest in the music video, in the sauce, the one benefit if I were her I would say is that the sauce would be the consistency of a sauce rather than a straight liquid which might make the chicken tender soggy. Sauces don't do that.\n\nGUTFELD: All right, you know, so you're going to be - you want to be --\n\nTIMPF: Physics, Chemistry.\n\nGUTFELD: You want to adopt the role in the advisory mode and - but you don't want to invest, so for that reason I'm out. No, it's too soon. It's too soon. It's too soon.\n\nANGELO: You're right. MURDOCH: The world is not ready for dipping Coke.\n\nFAILLA: But to Kat's point, being bad at something does get you famous, like look at Elizabeth Warren, it's unbelievable. Everybody --\n\nGUTFELD: Up next, a high-end French bistro that caters to nudists. Lousy business model or greatest thing ever? The debate you won't see on Cavuto.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nGUTFELD: They said enough to breakfast in the buff, Paris's first nudist friendly restaurant has shut down after 15 months due to lack of customers. The upscale Bistro called Eu Naturale opened in 2017 with a simple goal, create a dining experience where customers are completely naked.\n\nThe owners claim they're not nudists themselves, but thought they were reaching - around - an untapped market, but they overlooked a tiny flaw in the business model, where do naked customers keep their money? And few people want to see genitals while they're eating, at least I don't. Sometimes.\n\nAnyway, while the whole business model does seem weird, it's still a better idea than this.\n\n(VIDEO PLAYS)\n\nGUTFELD: I agree, Jimmy, nude restaurant invest or not invest? Are you in are you out?\n\nFAILLA: I am out. I will tell you why. At first, I thought this was kind of hip and it might catch on. But it turns out, nobody wants to eat steak in a place where you can also get crabs.\n\nMURDOCH: You can't say that.\n\nGUTFELD: Oh, you could say that. Kat, what - do you think this would ever come to America? It probably has.\n\nTIMPF: It already has, yes.\n\nGUTFELD: San Francisco.\n\nTIMPF: Nude restaurant, my apartment, hello. Have you ever eaten mozzarella sticks in the bathtub, Greg?\n\nGUTFELD: No.\n\nTIMPF: It's great. The little Tupperware, you can put marinara sauce in it, it actually floats in your tub with you.\n\nGUTFELD: That's fantastic. You know when the neighbors fought - after three or four days when they don't hear anything from your apartment and they come to find your body, it's going to be covered in mozzarella tubs.\n\nTIMPF: Marinara sauce. They'll think that I was murdered, but I would just have been someone enjoying some fast Italian.\n\nGUTFELD: Exactly. David, are you sad? I used to have it - this is going\n\naway.\n\nANGELO: You know this is going to never work from the beginning, you know, I've never been in a locker room like, Hey, you know this would be a great place to take a date. Not trying to eat French food while I'm looking at someone else's ratatouille. There you go.\n\nGUTFELD: Tyrus, to nudism is always disappointing because we always want to look and then we instantly regret looking because they're never the nudes you want to see.\n\nMURDOCH: No, it's always walking into a group full of guys with the same disappointed look that you have because there's no women there and the women who are there or on the other side of I don't give a damn anymore. So you know, things like gravity and cosmetic surgery is not really appealing to them.\n\nSo yes, it's a horrible sausage fest of guys who are all staring at the door and watching each other to make sure they're not looking at each other. It's like using the bathroom in a crowded urinal for guys. Everyone's eyes is right here. Every once in a while, there's a What are you looking at? Like it's you know what I'm saying, so I can't see how I want to sit down to a meal of food where all the sounds and I mean, where do you put the napkin?\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, that's true.\n\nMURDOCH: You know what I am saying?\n\nGUTFELD: Well, actually, where do you keep the wallet?\n\nMURDOCH: You can't have hot soup.\n\nGUTFELD: Actually, it's a question I don't want answered.\n\nMURDOCH: You imagine spilling your food and stuff, you know, like Oh, I'll get it. No. Like I just --\n\nGUTFELD: All right, I think we should probably wrap this up.\n\nMURDOCH: They didn't.\n\nGUTFELD: To go. They didn't. Nicely done. Don't forget, The Gutfeld Monologues Live is coming to Florida. Two shows, Saturday March 2nd in Tampa; Sunday March 3rd in West Palm Beach. Plus special guest, Tom Shillue. Tickets still available for both shows. Go to gutfeld.com for ticket information. Final Thoughts that's next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nGUTFELD: All right, just you, Kat. Final thought?\n\nTIMPF: Yes, I have a new podcast with Tyrus called Tyrus and Timpf podcast. It's available, foxnewspodcast.com. It's great. We talk about all kinds of fun, interesting news stories. I reveal too much about my personal life, generally.\n\nGUTFELD: Really?\n\nMURDOCH: Yes, and I do not.\n\nTIMPF: Yes, I don't know. He's - it's - I mean, people shouldn't listen to it because it's humiliating for me, but listen to it because it's also --\n\nMURDOCH: I have a blast.\n\nTIMPF: It's also how I grow.\n\nGUTFELD: Oh, that's good and that's important. We want you to grow. All right, that was an awesome show. Special thanks to Jimmy Failla, David Angelo, Kat Timpf, Tyrus, studio audience.

Italy's first Mormon temple opened its doors on Monday in Rome, just a few miles from the Vatican.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as the Mormon church is officially known, was founded in the state of New York in 1830 by Joseph Smith, who claimed to have a revelation of God. Almost two centuries later, the church is opening the Rome Italy Temple, with tours for non-Mormons to see inside.\n\nThis is a worldwide religion, said Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, who serves as chairman of the Temple and Family History Department. We have more than 16 million members and the church is recognized and established in over 170 nations, so it's only a matter of time before we have temples in most major cities in the world, but it is of particular significance to have a temple in Rome, the Eternal City.\n\nCHRISTIAN PERSECUTION CONTINUES TO RISE; WOMEN MOST EXPLOITED, GROUP SAYS\n\nUnlike churches where members gather for Sunday worship services, Latter-day Saints consider temples houses of the Lord and one of the central teachings of the Mormon church is that families can be together forever. This sacred union -- through marriage, baptism, and other ceremonies -- is only made possible in holy temples with members in good standing.\n\nIn the heart of the temple, is a full-immersion baptistry, where members will be able to baptize their dead ancestors by proxy in a ceremony. Showers and locker rooms are also provided in the building, where members must change into white garments and slippers before the ceremonies.\n\nThe Italian Mormon temple, which took nine years to build and is modeled after a Roman Catholic church in the predominantly-Catholic country, is part of a 15-acre religious and cultural center that includes a multifunctional meetinghouse, a visitors' center, a family history center, and housing for visitors.\n\nThe 40,000-square-foot temple will serve over 23,000 Latter-day Saint members living in Italy and in neighboring countries. Currently, there are more than 160 operating temples worldwide, including 12 in Europe.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMormons, much like other Christians, view Rome as one of the most important historic locations in the world, where ancient apostles Peter and Paul preached the gospel of Jesus Christ. They purchased the land in 1997, and while the cost is not made public, no expenses were spared, with Swarovski crystal and Murano glass chandeliers set in 24-carat gold filling its rooms.\n\nI'm just very humbled to be here, to think that we're walking in the footsteps of those original apostles, Elder Ronald A. Rasband said.\n\nCHURCH HELPS FEED GOVERNMENT WORKERS DURING SHUTDOWN: 'WHEN OUR COMMUNITY HURTS, WE HURT'\n\nThe temple will be open to any visitors through February, but once it has been formally dedicated in March, non-Mormon visitors will only be allowed into its outside spaces and visitors' center, where missionaries will be present if they have any questions.
Harry Brant, fashion model and the son of supermodel Stephanie Seymour and businessman Peter Brant, has died at age 24.\n\nHis family announced news of his untimely death with a statement to the New York Times revealing that the cause was an accidental overdose of prescription drugs.\n\nWe will forever be saddened that his life was cut short by this devastating disease, the family told the outlet. He achieved a lot in his 24 years, but we will never get the chance to see how much more Harry could have done.\n\nHe reportedly struggled with addiction for years.\n\nRONNIE SPECTOR REACTS TO PHIL SPECTOR'S DEATH: 'HE WAS A BRILLIANT PRODUCER, BUT A LOUSY HUSBAND'\n\nBorn to affluent parents, Harry spent his youth immersed in the world of arts and fashion. He was a staple at many fashion shows and even attended the famous Met Gala at age 16. He modeled for Italian Vogue and Balmain campaigns, according to People. However, he also dabbled in journalism, becoming a writer as a teenager for his father's Interview magazine. In addition, he and his brother, Peter, released a unisex makeup line with MAC in 2015 and 2016.\n\nHarry was committed to breaking barriers and challenging typical ideas of masculinity in the fashion world. Speaking to Vanity Fair in 2012, the then 15-year-old explained his early fashion sense.\n\nWhen I started really getting into fashion, I had, and still do, this obsession with mostly women's clothes, he explained. I think I just fell in love with the ideal of how iconic fashion is—especially how it used to be, the power that all the fashion people held and the glamour of traveling with, like, a Louis Vuitton steamer trunk, wearing the New Look Dior dress with the big hats—so fantastic, I just became obsessed.\n\nACTOR ARCHIE LYNDHURST'S CAUSE OF DEATH REVEALED\n\nHarry and his brother were often heralded for their unapologetic willingness to own their immense privilege. Vanity Fair called him Little Lord Fauntleroy and New York Magazine once heralded the two brothers as NYC's Most Beautiful Teenage Brothers.\n\nThe Times reports that in 2016, Harry was arrested in Greenwich, Conn., for refusing to pay a cab fare and was charged at the time with larceny, interfering with an officer and drug possession.\n\nDespite a few blemishes on his reputation, Harry was considered a trailblazer in the fashion world prior to his death. Many were quick to take to social media to eulogize him after his family announced he had died.\n\n#HarryBrant was a true icon in the making. A fashion darling. a cultural muse. And a lovely soul. I'm sadden for his family and I'm sadden for the world. We never truly got to see what the future held. RIP sweet prince, wrote one fan.\n\nRIP fashion icon Harry Brant. Broken heart, another added.\n\nRIP @harrybrant. Gone too soon, a third wrote.\n\nI was so obsessed with Harry and Peter Brant at once point in my life - it's so sad that he lost his battle with drugs Disappointed face you never know when a little more will be the last and that's what's scary #RIPHarryBrant, another person wrote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nIn addition to his brother, Harry is survived by a younger sister, an older half-brother from his mother's previous marriage and four half-siblings on his father's side. Another half-sibling, Ryan Brant, died in 2019 at age 49.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHarry was not just our son, the family concluded in their statement. He was also a wonderful brother, loving grandson, favorite uncle and a caring friend. He was a creative, loving and powerful soul that brought light into so many people's hearts. He was truly a beautiful person inside and out.
Prince Harry cut some close friends out of his life while Meghan Markle was pregnant with their son, according to a new report.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex turned heads last week after dropping the bombshell that the couple is in favor of reduced roles in the royal family. Now, sources tell People that long before their shocking plan was out, Harry axed pals from his life about six months into Markle's pregnancy.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE'S FATHER COULD TESTIFY IN ROYAL LAWSUIT OVER PRIVATE LETTER, DOCUMENTS SHOW\n\nHarry and Markle's eight-month-old son, Archie, was born on May 6. According to the magazine, the friends of Harry's who got the ax no longer even have the prince's cell phone number. This has left Harry's former friend group up in arms about his recent behavior.\n\nThey totally understand that men often drift from their friends after marriage, but there's still a lot of resentment because they had been so close for so long, said the source.\n\nThe news comes at a sour time for Prince Harry and his brother, Prince William. Royal experts this week told Fox News that the siblings' relationship has never been more fractured.\n\nPRINCES HARRY AND WILLIAM'S RELATIONSHIP IS 'AT AN ALL-TIME LOW' FOLLOWING 'MEGXIT,' EXPERTS SAY\n\nThere is no doubt that the relationship between Princes Harry and William are at an all-time low, Nick Bullen, editor-in-chief of True Royalty TV, told Fox News.\n\nHowever, Bullen seemed optimistic that the brothers will end up working out their differences despite Harry and Markle's growing distance.\n\nEveryone around them is working flat out to try and repair things, he explained. The next few weeks and months will be fascinating for anyone interested in the royal family.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY: WHY HAS THEIR EXIT CAUSED A CRISIS?\n\nOne pal of Harry's spoke out this week following news of the intense Megxit. JJ Chalmers, who served in the military with the prince, revealed on The One Show that he has noticed some changes in the prince since he became a husband and father.\n\nChalmers said he believed Prince Harry's tough decision of reducing his role as a senior royal member was with Markle and Archie's safety in mind.\n\nWhen you look at the decision that he's made, I think at the forefront of that is to protect his family because the number one rule is to be a father and be a husband, said the pal.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, a recent report claimed Markle's jewelry designer pal Jennifer Meyer was ordered by Buckingham Palace to remove photos of the duchess from her successful jewelry brand's social media pages and website.\n\nFox News' Stephanie Nolasco contributed to this report.
Vice President Mike Pence defended his wife Karen's new job at a private Christian elementary school Thursday, calling for an end to the attacks on Christian education.\n\nPence came to the Second Lady's defense after it was announced she would be teaching art part-time at Immanuel Christian School in Springfield, Virginia earlier this week. LGBT activists immediately started targeting her and the school for adhering to Christian beliefs.\n\nKAREN PENCE SLAMMED BY LGBT ACTIVISTS FOR TAKING JOB AT SCHOOL THAT BANS GAY TEACHERS\n\nWe'll let the critics roll off our back, Pence tweeted Thursday night. But the criticism of Christian education in America must stop.\n\nSeveral groups, including the NOH8 Campaign, the Human Rights Campaign, and The Trevor Project, were upset because the school requires employees to pledge they believe marriage is monogamous and heterosexual and they won't engage in homosexual or lesbian sexual activity or adopt or promote transgender identity, as well as an agreement that the school can deny admission or remove a student whose behavior is in opposition to the biblical lifestyle the school teaches.\n\nCNN anchor Chris Cuomo compared her job to GOP Iowa Rep. Steve King's remarks. The Trevor Project also announced it plans to send 100 copies of John Oliver's pro-gay book about the Pences' pet rabbit to the school.\n\nCNN'S CHRIS CUOMO LINKS KAREN PENCE'S JOB AT IMMANUEL CHRISTIAN TO STEVE KING'S WHITE SUPREMACY REMARKS\n\nKaren and I have been in and around public life for almost two decades, so to be honest with you, we're used to the criticism, but the attacks on Christian education by the mainstream media have got to stop, Pence told Washington Watch with Tony Perkins Thursday night.\n\nHe characterized the criticism as an attack on the First Amendment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIf we cherish the freedom of religion in this country, this administration stands foursquare for the freedom of religion for people of all faiths, and to see the mainstream media criticize my wife cause she's choosing to return to the classroom of an elementary Christian school is wrong, Pence said. Again, the attacks on Christian education must end.\n\nThe vice president also called out the media for its lack of coverage of the annual March for Life taking place Friday in the nation's capital.\n\nMARCH FOR LIFE: A LOOK AT THE LARGEST PRO-LIFE RALLY IN THE US\n\nPence told Perkins participating in the March for Life has been one of his favorite memories, especially alongside President Trump, the most pro-life president in history.

Hollywood became dimmer on Feb. 10, 2014 when Shirley Temple, the dimpled, curly-haired child star who brought joy to Americans during the Depression died at age 85.\n\nAs a tot, Temple was the country's top box office draw from 1935 until 1938, and beat out Clark Gable, Bing Crosby and Joan Crawford — just to name a few. In 1999 the American Film Institute ranked Temple as No. 18 among their top 25 actresses and she is credited with helping save 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy with films such as 1935's Curly Top and The Littlest Rebel.\n\n'A CHRISTMAS STORY' FACTS YOU SHOULD KNOW\n\nAnd even though Temple retired from films at age 21, she later became active in politics and held several diplomatic posts in Republican administrations. In 1972, she raised awareness of breast cancer after having successful surgery to combat the disease. She wrote a best-selling memoir, raised a family of her own and continued to captivate audiences with a life made fit for the big screen.\n\nHere are some facts about Temple you probably don't know.\n\nHer (racy) big break\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Temple was spotted by an agent when she was 4-years-old in 1932 and was chosen to appear in Baby Burlesks, which the newspaper described as a series of sexually suggestive one-reel shorts in which children played all the roles. Temple, wearing skin-baring costumes, imitated adult screen sirens Marlene Dietrich, Mae West and Dolores Rio.\n\nMARLENE DIETRICH'S GRANDSON TELLS ALL\n\nThe Times also shared that if any of the two dozen children misbehaved on set, they were locked in a windowless sound box with only a block of ice to sit on. So far as I can tell, the black box did no lasting damage to my psyche, claimed Temple in her memoir. Its lesson of life, however, was profound and unforgettable. Time is money. Wasted time means wasted money means trouble.\n\nGetting ready for her close-up\n\nBeing Temple was no easy task, she once claimed. People magazine reported each night her mother would coil her hair into 56 perfect pin curls. And once Temple was tucked in, her bedtime story was actually the next day's script. The magazine shared that her mother Gertrude would read the lines and Temple parroted them until she fell asleep. By the morning, Temple had memorized everyone's lines, including her own.\n\nWhat pushy stage mother?\n\nOver the years, it's been reported Temple's rise to stardom was orchestrated by a ruthless momager who forced her toddler to bring home the paycheck. Temple herself insisted it was far from the truth. She was quite shy, but she always believed that if a door opens for you, go through it, she said about her mother, as reported by People magazine. She did not push me into anything. I loved what I did. I remember cruel mothers who would pinch their children to make them cry in a scene, but my mother encircled me with affection.\n\nCHRISTINA RICCI: I DON'T REGRET MY CHILD STAR YEARS\n\nShe celebrated in a big way\n\nOn Temple's eighth birthday — she was actually turning 9, but the studio wanted her to be younger — she received more than 135,000 presents from around the world. The gifts included a baby kangaroo from Australia and a prize Jersey calf from schoolchildren in Oregon.\n\nEven Santa Claus was impressed\n\nTemple stopped believing in Santa Claus at age 6 — and her fame had something to do with it. Mother took me to see him in a department store and he asked for my autograph, she once said.\n\nShe was nearly assassinated\n\nIn 1939, a woman tried to assassinate Temple while she was singing Silent Night on a live radio show under the logic that the 10-year-old had swiped her daughter's soul and shooting her would unleash it. She recalled the event during a 1998 news conference at the American Booksellers Association in Anaheim, Calif., according to Deseret News. She said a woman pulled out a rather big gun and started to point it at her while she was singing during the radio appearance at CBS in Hollywood. Temple said at the time police grabbed the woman and removed her from the studio.\n\nPutting a rumor to rest\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter shared that during Temple's reign in Hollywood, there was a lingering rumor in Europe that she was not a child, but instead an adult dwarf in disguise. That rumor was put to rest after the Vatican dispatched Father Silvio Massante to verify that Temple was indeed a child who just happened to have loads of talent.\n\n'THE WIZARD OF OZ' SECRETS YOU PROBABLY HAVEN'T HEARD\n\nShirley Temple was the people's choice\n\nWhile Judy Garland was the ideal choice for the role of Dorothy Gale in 1939's The Wizard of Oz, it was Temple who won the popular vote by fans of the original 1900 book. Judy Garland was not the popular choice among book fans, historian and collector Jay Scarfone, who co-authored The Road to Oz, told Fox News. [Judy] was 15 years old, which was considered too old for the role. She was vivacious and over the top. The Dorothy in 'The Wizard of Oz' has a very different personality from what is seen in the film. But there was never a serious contender except for Judy Garland.\n\nEnduring sexual harassment\n\nIn her memoir Child Star, Temple claimed that an MGM producer, who was known to have an adventuresome casting couch, unzipped his trousers and exposed himself to her during their first meeting in 1940. She was 12. Being innocent of male anatomy, she responded with nervous laughter and he threw her out of his office. Fortunately, she had already signed her contract with MGM.\n\nKiss and tell\n\nIn 1988, Temple revealed in an interview televised on Entertainment Tonight that Ronald Reagan was really a good kisser. He was one of the best kissers, she declared. The two performed together in the 1947 film That Hagen Girl where her character feared that the teacher played by the future president was her illegitimate father. Despite the on-screen chemistry, the film was probably one of the worst movies either one of us ever made, said Temple.\n\nPuberty came with a price\n\nLike with many other child stars, as Temple grew older, the work in Hollywood diminished. The New York Times previously reported that her once-signature golden tresses had turned brown. Film historian David Thomson said she had become an unremarkable teenager. And after nearly four dozen films, the public lost interest. By then she was a strong-willed, chain-smoking 17-year-old. And determined to be the first in her class to become engaged, she accepted a ring from 24-year-old Army Air Corps sergeant John Agar a few days before her 17th birthday.\n\nGetting unlucky (and then lucky) in love\n\nIn her lifetime, Temple enjoyed a loving relationship with California businessman Charles Alden Black, who claimed he never saw any of her films. The marriage lasted from 1950 until his death in 2005 at age 86. But her first marriage to Agar wasn't as blissful. That union lasted from 1945 until 1950. I was 17, recalled Temple to Larry King. I was way too young. He was 24. But they didn't talk about alcohol then. It was something you hid… So we didn't talk about it.\n\nHe also liked to dance with other gals and kiss them on the dance floor and all that, she continued And I thought to myself, 'I can make this marriage work. I love him. I'm gonna do it.' And I tried for four years. And it didn't work. It was partly my fault. And his fault. But I still wish him nothing but the best.\n\nAgar's son, Martin Agar, told Fox News his father never discussed his marriage to Temple.\n\n… He never did despite encouragement from family, he said. He told me practically everything about his life that I wanted to know… but he would never say a word about her.\n\nNearly losing it all\n\nDespite becoming a Hollywood icon before turning double digits, Temple later admitted she nearly lost it all after her father mismanaged her finances over the years. It was fine until I was 22 and I asked my dad and his business partner, Temple recalled to Larry King. I said, 'You know, I was 21 and I didn't get the money. I'm 22, where's the money?'… It was a two and a half hour meeting in our house and finally, I said, 'Give me the bottom line. What do I have?' Well, they said out of $3,400,000 or so that I earned, I had $44,000 in my trust fund. That was it. And that was a shock.\n\nWhen King asked Temple if she was still mad at her father, she surprisingly said no.\n\nI think I would have paid the studio for the privilege of working and I think I did, she explained. [And] I didn't blame him. Dad left school when he was in seventh grade. He was a banker during the Depression. And when he managed my money, it was just overwhelming, I think. And he was like an innocent led to slaughter. I think the people who counseled him did the bad job. I don't blame him a bit.\n\nNo Shirley Temples for Shirley Temple\n\nIt turns out Temple was not a fan of the mocktail made of ginger ale, lemon-lime soda and grenadine topped with a maraschino cherry that was named in her honor. One night we were waiting in line to get drinks and I said, 'You're obviously not drinking a Shirley Temple,' her longtime friend Barry Barsamian, who met the star in 1996 when she was 68, recalled to Closer Weekly. She looked up and said, 'No! I'm having a Black Russian with vodka. I'll call it a Shirley Temple Black!\n\nShe told me if you drink [Shirley Temples] then you'd get diabetes because of all the sugar, added Barsamian.\n\nHer greatest role\n\nOne of Temple's proudest roles was that of hands-on mom to three children, including Lori Black, who would later play bass for the Melvins. Being a wife and mom is the greatest of her achievements, daughter Susan Black told Closer Weekly in 2018. We were shopping and travel buddings. We went to many places together. She was one of my very best friends.\n\nThe only time I noticed her star quality was when someone else would ask for her autograph, added son Charles Black Jr. She was wonderful — and normal. We had dinner at the table every night all together.\n\nShe was devoted and generous, and she could be a little stern if we didn't behave, said Susan. But she was also a lot of fun. Very inventive and imaginative. She was all about her children and her husband.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

Alex Trebek has one regret in life — not meeting his wife sooner.\n\nI'm pretty satisfied with my life, the longtime Jeopardy! host told People magazine in this week's issue. But my wife Jean and I have been together almost 29 years, and I was thinking about President Bush when he died, and all the comments about his life, about what a nice guy he is, and how he and his wife had been together 73 years.

But there was something that just kept drawing me to him.\n\nAnd while the pair has been happily married for nearly 30 years, they do have their ups and downs just like any other couple.\n\nWe have our challenges, she said. And then we have our really beautiful times, where we're just so blessed to know that we're in each other's courtyard.\n\nBut after all this time, Currivan has learned what makes Trebek really click.\n\nHe's got a great sense of humor, she said. He takes his job very seriously, but won't take himself too seriously. He's also youthful. He's just an intelligent human being. Part of Alex's staying youthful is his staying curious.
One of Robert Saleh's former defensive stars is advocating for Deshaun Watson to find his way to the Jets.\n\nIf I was Deshaun, I'd get out of there as quickly as possible. I'd head to New York. … The Jets, 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman said on The Cris Collinsworth Podcast, which Sherman co-hosts.\n\nIt would be the most beautiful. Decent offensive line. They'd have to find some threats, they'd have to find some offensive weapons, but I think there would be a lot more people excited to be there. I think the free-agency market this year is gonna be oversaturated because of the salary cap, but that's what I would do. I'd be out of there on the first thing smokin'.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nWatson, 25, earned his third straight Pro Bowl nod in 2020 after throwing for an NFL-best 4,823 yards, 33 touchdowns and seven interceptions along with 444 yards rushing and three rushing scores. He's played in all but one game over the past three seasons despite being sacked 155 times during that span.\n\nAnd yet the Texans took a huge step back and went 4-12 this season. After a misguided trade last offseason that sent DeAndre Hopkins to the Cardinals, Bill O'Brien was fired as coach and general manager after an 0-4 start.\n\nWatson's frustration was on a 2 then I took it to 10, he tweeted last week, nearly word for word confirming an ESPN report those were his anger levels between the Hopkins trade and now. He wanted input on the Texans' searches for a general manager and head coach.\n\nBut the team dragged its feet in setting up an interview with Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy, about whom Watson has heard good things from Patrick Mahomes. Then, the team hired the Patriots' Nick Caserio as its general manager instead of Korn Ferry's recommended finalists, Omar Khan of the Steelers and ESPN's Louis Riddick, a move that had much-maligned executive Jack Easterby's fingerprints all over it.\n\nThey're saying [Watson is] not answering any calls or any texts — I wouldn't either, Sherman said. He's done everything. He's taken a beating for you guys and played efficiently.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWatson offered Jets fans some hope by liking an Instagram post that featured The Post's Watever It Takes back page advocating for the Jets to pursue the quarterback.\n\nSherman has raved about Saleh since the Jets hired him, and seems to think a Saleh-Watson marriage would steer the Jets back into contention.\n\nGreat pick up! Sherman previously told The MMQB of Saleh. He's gonna turn that entire culture around!

The Debtor is incapable of realizing and understanding the repercussions of the bankrupcty filings pending against him and his law firm Girardi Keese.\n\n'HOUSEWIVES' STAR ERIKA JAYNE'S HUSBAND TOM GIRARDI HIT WITH ANOTHER LAWSUIT FOR FAILURE TO PAY $800G: REPORT\n\nRobert Girardi also states that his brother is incompetent and unable to act for himself.\n\nAn attorney for Tom Girardi did not respond to Fox News' reqeust for comment.

A 60 Minutes profile of former Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher is attracting a lot of attention, as some critics accused the program of glorifying a war criminal.\n\nHowever, extensive Fox Nation coverage of Gallagher's cases suggests that there is much more to this story then the objections of CBS' detractors would suggest.\n\nWe warn you it's a story of combat at its ugliest and military justice at its worst, said CBS News' David Martin introducing the segment on Sunday night, as he largely focused on the military's handling of Gallagher's case.\n\nGallagher was acquitted in 2019 of charges of premeditated murder in the death of a 19-year-old Islamic State fighter in Iraq in 2017, during his eighth deployment.\n\nThe jury found him not guilty after the prosecution's key witness, who was testifying under a grant of immunity, confessed on the stand that he -- not Gallagher -- killed the enemy fighter.\n\nGallagher was found guilty of posing with the corpse of the dead ISIS member, resulting in loss of rank and pay. President Donald Trump intervened, issuing an order reversing the sentence and restoring Gallagher's rank.\n\nYet, the Navy continued to go after Gallagher, attempting to strip him of his Trident pin, which is a symbol of a SEAL's service. The president stepped in again, and Gallagher ultimately kept his Trident.\n\nIn the 60 Minutes piece, Martin highlighted how military prosecutors were pulled off the case over allegations of misconduct, namely by attempting to track the communications of Gallagher's legal defense team.\n\nIn an interview on Fox Nation in November, Sean Gallagher, Eddie's brother, raised serious concerns over the military prosecutors.\n\nThe prosecutors in Eddie's case spied on the defense team. They hid evidence, said Sean Gallagher on Fox Nation's Deep Dive.\n\nThe judge in our case had to fire the prosecutors weeks before trial. It was a failure of epic proportions, something that you wouldn't even think could happen in this country. And yet we lived through it.\n\nGallagher served nine months in prison, including time in solitary confinement, before his release.\n\nEddie never should have gone to trial, he continued. If people had done their due diligence and investigators had done right and good work, they would have said that this is a farce of a case to begin with.\n\nFOX NATION PANEL DEBATES FAIRNESS OF MILITARY JUSTICE SYSTEM\n\nOn Fox Nation's Deep Dive, Eric Gang, founding partner at Gang and Associates, a law firm representing disabled veterans, said that Gallagher's case and others like it highlight larger concerns with the military justice system.\n\nWhat needs to be done is that the military needs to take a holistic approach towards examining these veterans and their conduct to understand what their state of mind may have been based upon their time, place and circumstances of service, said Gang.\n\nEvan Hafer, a former Green Beret and co-founder of the veteran-run company Black Rifle Coffee, argued that more must be done to support war-fighters who have carried the burden and the psychological and physical weight of the global war on terror for over almost two decades now.\n\nYou cannot continue to deploy tens, if not hundreds of times for some of these guys. I know some of these guys, they're 50, 60-years old now. They've been at war their entire adult lives. They entered a combat zone at the age of 18. And they're still not done carrying the work of this country, said Hafer on Deep Dive.\n\nAlso on 60 Minutes on Sunday, Andrea Gallagher, wife of Eddie, described how dozens of Naval Criminal Investigative Service agents raided Gallagher's home, terrifying his children, who were home at the time.\n\nEDDIE GALLAGHER'S WIFE: 'THEY RAIDED OUR HOUSE, THREW MY RIDES OUT ON THE STREET IN THEIR UNDERWEAR\n\nIn an interview with Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren, she went into greater detail. My son sees men on his porch with assault rifles, and this is what began a seven-hour raid. They pulled them out at gunpoint in their underwear and put them in the street.\n\nWe were betrayed by these individuals that were so zealous to execute this horrific act against my husband and take him down, she said. All those years sacrificing my husband, every holiday, every birthday willingly giving our family to the cause to fight the war on terror. This is not something we took lightly. We've committed our entire life, our children's lives and our marriage to the cause.\n\nTo watch all of Fox Nation's coverage of the Eddie Gallagher case and issues of military justice go to Fox Nation and sign up today.\n\nLIMITED TIME ONLY!

Larry King's sons reacted to their father's death in an emotional statement on social media.\n\nLarry King, Jr., Chance King, and Cannon King took to Facebook to pen a lengthy note about how much their father meant to them.\n\nWe are heartbroken over our father's death, and together with our extended family mourn his passing. The world knew Larry King as a great broadcaster and interviewer, but to us he was 'dad.' He was the man who lovingly obsessed over our daily schedules and our well-being, and who took such immense pride in our accomplishments -- large, small, or imagined. And, through it all, we knew without a doubt in the world that he loved us more than life itself. He was an amazing father, and he was fiercely loyal to those lucky enough to call him a friend. We will miss him every single day of our lives, the brother said.\n\nThey also thanked fans for the outpouring of love and tributes to King's remarkable career. They asked that in lieu of flowers, please consider donations to the American Heart Association or the Beverly Hills Fire Department EMS.\n\nLARRY KING, TV TALK-SHOW ICON, DIES AT 87\n\nA debt of gratitude is owed for the wonderful care they provided to our dad in his final years. With deep appreciation, they concluded.\n\nKing and wife Shawn Southwick King married in 1997 and split in 2019. They share Cannon, 20, and Chance, 21, while Larry King Jr., 59, is from King's marriage with ex-wife Annette Kaye.\n\nThe broadcasting legend died on Jan. 23 at 87 years old. No cause of death was given, but he had been hospitalized with COVID-19, according to several media reports.\n\nKing also had a myriad of other health issues. He battled lung cancer, lived with Type 2 diabetes, survived multiple heart attacks, and underwent quintuple bypass surgery in 1987.\n\nCELEBRITIES REACT TO LARRY KING'S DEATH: 'A TRUE LEGEND GONE'\n\nKing's death comes after the radio icon lost two children in 2020 -- Andy, 65, and Chaia, 51, died within weeks of each other over the summer. Andy had a heart attack, while Chaia had been battling lung cancer.\n\nKing was best known for CNN's award-winning Larry King Live for 25 years.\n\nHe interviewed everyone from world leaders and celebrities to criminals and conspiracy theorists during 6,000-plus episodes of the evening show from 1985 through 2010.\n\nKing then co-founded Ora TV in 2012.\n\nOver his career, King conducted an estimated 50,000 on-air interviews. Political figures and people mired in high-profile controversies would seek out his show, but he also had success landing famously elusive guests, such as Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando.\n\nJOURNALISTS, TV HOSTS MOURN THE LOSS OF BROADCASTING GIANT LARRY KING\n\nKing was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 1989 and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Among his many honors and accolades are a pair of Peabody Awards for excellence in broadcasting and 10 Cable ACE awards.\n\nFox News' Brian Flood contributed to this report.
Born Again Feminism for the 21st Century\n\nTuesday , March 07, 2006\n\nBy Wendy McElroy\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMarch is Women's History Month, with a focus on the past raising questions about the future. Gender or left-wing feminism has defined the mainstream movement for decades, but can it carry feminism into the 21st century and away from the accusation of irrelevancy?\n\n2006 is a fine year in which to ask that question. It is far enough into the new century for gender feminists to have provided a rough answer if one is coming. I believe the answer has arrived.\n\nOn a personal level, you may not care. You may be fed up with decades-long arguments that all seem to run in an endless loop toward the same conclusion: Women as a class are oppressed by men as a class through the institutions of society such as the free market and the family.\n\nOn a political level, however, you should pay attention. Those same tiresome arguments have dramatically reshaped the institutions with which you and your children live every day.\n\nFor example, in 1980, the term sexual harassment was virtually unknown. Today, it is a legal reality that every campus and workplace confronts. If gender feminism successfully recreates itself, then your day-to-day life may continue to reflect its vision, not yours. Linda R. Hirshman, co-author of the book Hard Bargains: The Politics of Sex, offers a glimpse of that vision. She recently published an article titled Homeward Bound in the liberal magazine American Prospect (12/20/05).\n\nHome does not refer to the hearth. Quite the opposite. Home is the ideological starting point to which Hirshman believes feminism must return in order to become effective. The much discussed article is a clear snapshot of gender feminism's present dilemma over irrelevancy and the need for redefinition.\n\nHirshman bluntly acknowledges the failure of feminism by pointing to one phenomenon. Many educated women are rejecting successful careers to become mothers and embrace the domesticity that Betty Friedan compared to animal life and a Nazi concentration camp in her 1953 bestseller The Feminine Mystique. How did this happen? In a word, choice is to blame.\n\n[L]iberal feminists abandoned the judgmental starting point…in favor of offering women 'choices'. The choice talk spilled over from…'abortion', and it provided an irresistible solution to feminists trying to duck the mommy wars. A woman could work, stay home, have 10 children or one, marry or stay single. It all counted as 'feminist' as long as she chose it.\n\nHirshman dismisses what she calls choice feminism. Instead, she argues for a return to a judgmental starting point by which incorrect choices are to be shunned, choices like the traditional role of wife and mother.\n\nHirshman writes, Now the glass ceiling begins at home. Although it is harder to shatter a ceiling that is also the roof over your head, there is no other choice.\n\nThe 20th century gender war was fought largely in the workplace and on campuses; the 21st century's battleground is the traditional family. According to Hirshman, failure to deconstruct that one institution is the explanation for feminism's failures elsewhere.\n\nI profoundly disagree with Hirshman's conclusions and many of her particulars. For example, I don't believe all of women's choices have been sanctioned as 'feminist'; sex work is a counter-example.\n\nI also don't believe feminism ever ceased being judgmental. Nevertheless, the article is a fascinating glimpse into gender feminism's struggle to reinvent itself. The broad themes of this reinvention are: a rejection of the 'c-word' (choice) as the standard of feminism; the substitution of correct choices as feminism's touchstone; a renewed focus on deconstructing the traditional family; and, a reaching backward into the golden age of feminism in order to understand and correct mistakes.\n\nAs the reinvention occurs, the gender feminist approach to specific issues will inevitably shift as well.\n\nWithout a crystal ball and with recognition that feminism is not a monolith, the following are some of the changes (or not) in approach that I expect to see:\n\nOn abortion. The words choice and pro-choice will be de-emphasized. Instead, stress will be placed on weighing the rights and health of the woman against those of the unborn with the clear message that the woman takes precedence.\n\nOn sexual harassment. The argument will not change because it has proven successful but the approach will be broadened to include male victims, especially boys. For example, the latest survey from the American Association of University Women on school and campus harassment reports on male victims.\n\nI believe the shift is largely strategic. It is no longer possible to ignore male victims of harassment. Thus, the championing of boys will be co-opted and recast within gender feminism's established framework of sexual harassment.\n\nOn domestic violence. The argument will not change and the approach will not be broadened significantly. In gender feminist theory, domestic violence is key to establishing that traditional marriage is a dangerous place for women.\n\nStaying the course is not only an ideological matter, it is also strategic. To the extent male victims are acknowledged, the focus will be on gay male victims. A lot of funding is on the line.\n\nWhat do I think is the real feminist line for the 21st century? Your peaceful choices are yours alone and no one else's business. Be a housewife, love your children without a time schedule…or dive into a 24/7 job that you get on merit. Live your own dream. Be your own woman.\n\nAnd, yes, that makes me a choice feminist.\n\nWendy McElroy is the editor of ifeminists.com and a research fellow for The Independent Institute in Oakland, Calif.

One of Lena Dunham's latest tweets has left her fans scratching their heads.\n\nDunham, 34, took to Twitter on Thursday to share one of her fantasies, and it involves striking up a romance with President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden.\n\nI cannot wait to spend holidays at the White House when I am Hunter Biden's beautiful wife, Dunham tweeted.\n\nHunter was primarily out of the spotlight during Biden's presidential campaign as he is currently under investigation by the Justice Department, which is probing his finances, including some of his alleged Chinese business dealings. President Biden's 50-year-old son has also come under fire in recent years for developments related to his personal life and his marriage.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN, UNDER FEDERAL INVESTIGATION, APPEARS AT WHITE HOUSE PRAYER SERVICE\n\nThe Golden Globe-winning star's followers trolled both her and Hunter in their replies, with a majority claiming she is much too old for Biden's son and others questioning if she was kidding.\n\nInteresting brand move for you, one of her followers replied.\n\nNot sure he's exactly a desirable partner..., another reacted.\n\nLENA DUNHAM SAYS HER BODY 'REVOLTED' DURING MONTH-LONG BATTLE WITH COVID-19\n\nThere is so much wrong to unpack in that sentence, another said.\n\nYou're about 25 years too old, another quipped.\n\n& if he's your dream husband, your standards are WAY to (sic) low, wrote another.\n\nWhy even joke about this? He's absolutely disgusting, said another.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nOthers reminded the Girls creator that Hunter is married.\n\nWell sure if there's ever a movie version about them, one fan wrote. But in real life, I think he's very much taken.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe currently has a wife, although I don't know if that's ever stopped him before, another reacted.
Russian President Vladimir Putin practically has been in office for more than 20 years — and he is not ruling out staying a little longer.\n\nPutin, whose current term ends in 2024, served two presidential terms in 2000-2008, before shifting to the Russian prime minister's office while protégé Dmitry Medvedev served as a placeholder president.\n\nHe reclaimed the presidency in 2012 and won another election in 2018. He would need to step down in four years after having two consecutive terms - according to the current constitution.\n\nRUSSIA'S VLADIMIR PUTIN PROPOSES CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS MENTIONING GOD, TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE\n\nBut lawmakers in the Kremlin-controlled State Duma are considering a proposal submitted this week to amend the constitution and basically allow resetting to zero the number of presidential terms.\n\nI propose to either lift the presidential term limit or add a clause that after the revised constitution enters force, the incumbent president, just like any other citizen, has the right to seek the presidency, lawmaker Valentina Tereshkova said to raucous applause.\n\nOn Tuesday, Putin gave his support to the amendment put forward by Tereshkova, who as a Soviet cosmonaut in 1963 became the first woman to fly to space.\n\nIn a speech, the 67-year-old Putin, who is Russia's longest-serving leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, spoke against scrapping presidential term limits altogether. But he backed the idea that if the constitution is revised, a two-term limit should only apply from 2024 on.\n\nTHOUSANDS IN MOSCOW PROTEST CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES SEEN AS PUTIN POWER GRAB\n\nHe said he is aware of public calls for him to stay on as president and emphasized that Russia needs stability above all.\n\nThe president is a guarantor of security of our state, its internal stability and evolutionary development, Putin said. We have had enough revolutions.\n\nThen he said he supported Tereshkova's alternate proposal to restart the term count when the revamped constitution enters force.\n\nAs for the proposal to lift restrictions for any person, including the incumbent, to allow running in elections, this option is possible, Putin said.\n\nVLADIMIR PUTIN'S STRANGEST PROPAGANDA MOMENTS\n\nHe added that the Constitutional Court would need to judge if the move would be legal, although the court's assent is all but guaranteed.\n\nA series of constitutional amendments Putin proposed in January was widely seen by Kremlin foes as part of his efforts to stay in power. However, it wasn't clear until Tuesday how Putin could achieve that goal.\n\nObservers had speculated that Putin could use the changes to scrap term limits; move into the prime minister's seat with strengthened powers; or continue calling the shots as the head of the State Council.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe amendment, as well as others proposed, was approved by the Duma. A nationwide vote is set for April 22.
Chrissy Teigen opened up about what irks her on social media, and how she and husband John Legend get through their disagreements.\n\nThe supermodel and author of Cravings: Hungry for More spoke to Good Housekeeping in an interview published on Tuesday, and spilled the beans on what it takes for her to slam social media commenters who criticize her every day.\n\nCHRISSY TEIGEN SHUTS DOWN INSTAGRAM TROLL WHO OFFERED HAIRSTYLE TIP\n\nI have moods like anybody else. Some days, I'll wake up and I'll read something and it'll totally not affect me, she told the magazine.\n\nBut if I read that same thing the next day—after a night of no sleep and a really rough day with Luna—it naturally gets to you because you're in a sh--tier mood. If I wake up, and I'm like, Ugh, I feel bloated, I haven't worked out for a few days and I read something about my body? That's the day that I'm gonna speak up. It's just crazy how judgmental people can be.\n\nThe 33-year-old co-host of Lip Sync Battle and mother of two wed her multi-faceted husband in 2013 and explained that their marriage isn't without its share of bumps in the road.\n\nA big thing that helps us is the two different ways that we fight. I get very passionate, I get very loud, and he's very much a diffuser. But in the end, we're both apologizers; we don't like to dwell on the same thing, Teigen said.\n\nNBC'S NEW YEAR'S EVE SHOW WITH CARSON DALY, CHRISSY TEIGEN, LESLIE JONES HAS VIEWERS CRYING 'COMPLETE DISASTER' AND 'TRAINWRECK'\n\nThe self-deprecating social media maven went on to explain how motherhood has allowed her to focus more on accepting herself as she is in spite of what many may say about her on the Internet.\n\nEvery morning when I look at myself in the mirror, I'm like, Oh my gosh, how did it get here? My baby was, like, four pounds and I gained, like, sixty pounds, and that seems off!, she said.\n\nBut, you know, I think everyone's body is just really different. That's why, my posts of real mom s---, and wearing the diaper, and having that mesh thing, and real postpartum business? I think as important as it is for people to see me do that, it's also really important for me.\n\nShe continued: I think, in a way, we've forgotten what a regular body looks like. There are people out there who are struggling and I'm struggling, and it's okay to come to terms with that being okay, to realize that it's gonna be a bit of a journey.\n\nCHRISSY TEIGEN REVEALS SPORTS ILLUSTRATED CONTRACT ONCE INCLUDED UNUSUAL RULE ABOUT HER FEET\n\nWith her Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue days behind her, Teigen said she enjoys motherhood for what it is — an opportunity to share memories with her children, 2-year-old daughter Luna and son Miles, 8 months, every day.\n\nIt's all about trying to be happy with myself. Because I'm not blind: I see my body, I see the difference in shape, I see that I gained weight, she explained. But I also see with those same eyes that I have a beautiful baby boy, and this little girl that's relentless and amazing, and I am very happy.\n\nThis is a new thing that I can change within my mind, that I don't have to be swimsuit model anymore. I get to be a mommy, and I get to cook, and I get to meet incredible people, and I'm happy to be going through this transition.
Video vixen Bobbie Brown can poke fun at her love life today, but things weren't always a laughing matter for the Cherry Pie star.\n\nThe model and Sunset Strip sex symbol recently released her second book titled Cherry on Top after experiencing a devastating fall that could have ended her life.\n\nThe 50-year-old insisted the horrifying experience inspired her to check off her bucket list, including pursuing an unlikely career in stand-up comedy. She also reflected on her past experiences, including her former marriage to Warrant rocker Jani Lane, who passed away in 2011 at age 47 from alcohol intoxication.\n\nBrown spoke to Fox News about her life-changing injury, pursuing comedy, how Lane could have benefitted from the #MeToo movement in his lifetime and what dating is really like today.\n\nRONNIE WOOD'S EX-WIFE JO WOOD RECALLS PHOTOGRAPHING THE ROLLING STONES OVER THE YEARS: 'THEY DIDN'T NOTICE'\n\nACTRESS GABRIELLE STONE EXPLAINS WHY SHE LEFT THE COUNTRY AFTER HUSBAND'S AFFAIR, HEARTBREAKING RELATIONSHIP\n\nFox News: Was there ever a point where you wanted to escape the Cherry Pie girl persona?\n\nBobbie Brown: There was a time when I would go, Oh God, not that again. I had done so many other things beyond just being in a music video and yet I was just the Cherry Pie girl. It was bulls--t, I thought. But the older I got, the more I embraced it.\n\nThe reality is that this is how most people know me. This is why most people are interested in me. And frankly, this is probably why we're talking right now. It's gotta be something I need to embrace. And it was never a negative experience in my life so there's no need to have negative feelings towards it. I don't need to make it a negative experience. I've embraced it. I'm totally OK with it today.\n\nFox News: What inspired you to write this book?\n\nBrown: I had just gone through a devastating life change. I've fallen down the stairs [in 2018] and almost killed myself. I literally was like, What am I doing with my life? I had a rude awakening. The doctors said 50 percent of people who've had my type of fall and hit their head die instantly. I landed headfirst into a table. So I was very lucky.\n\n'THREE'S COMPANY' STAR SUZANNE SOMERS RECALLS HER CANCER DIAGNOSIS: 'YOU THINK OF YOUR MORTALITY FOR THE FIRST TIME'\n\nRISQUÉ STORIES WRITTEN BY ED WOOD REVEALED DECADES AFTER FILMMAKER'S TRAGIC DEATH\n\nI was looking like the Elephant Man for the next three months. I would look in the mirror every day and say, What am I doing? What's my purpose? What's my point? What am I doing for joy? I just came to a decision that I needed to make a change and check off my bucket list. I had so many fans who wrote to me about my first book Dirty Rocker Boys. I just felt I needed a second book. There were more stories to tell. So I picked up where I left off.\n\nFox News: How are you doing today?\n\nBrown: My head's OK *laughs*. I had a permanent dent in my forehead for a really long time. No permanent damage, thank God. But it made me question everything. It made me realize I wasn't living really. I was just going through the motions. I needed to make some major decisions and fulfill myself.\n\nI feel like we sometimes get stuck in a rut and just live day-to-day without really being happy. Nothing's really happening and there's no joy. So I just pushed myself to live. I started doing stand-up comedy. I wrote this second book. I started a podcast. Dating is probably the last thing on my list. But I don't really have time. So it's kind of good *laughs*.\n\nHUMPHREY BOGART'S EX-WIFE MAYO METHOT STRUGGLED TO BOUNCE BACK IN HOLLYWOOD AFTER DIVORCE, BOOK CLAIMS\n\nMARIE OSMOND RECALLS HER WEIGHT STRUGGLES, BEING TOLD SHE NEEDED TO 'KEEP THE FOOD OUT OF MY FAT FACE'\n\nFox News: How difficult was it to relive some of your memories with ex Jani Lane in this book?\n\nBrown: It's always cathartic. Usually, when I'm talking about it, it's because I still have those feelings of non-closure with him on so many levels. To be able to talk about it gives me some closure. And it's therapeutic in the same sense.\n\nI also feel like it will help other people out there who might be feeling the same way or have had the same experience with their spouses, their friends, whoever. It's good for me to be honest because somebody out there is going through the same type of feelings I'm experiencing. It's comforting for people to know they're not alone in their thoughts and experiences. They're not crazy. I feel like it gives people a sense of a connection that we're all the same.\n\nFox News: You describe there was no #MeToo movement during the time when Jani could have used it the most.\n\nBrown: At the moment that he admitted [he was drugged and raped by a member of a famous heavy metal band and their manager], it was devastating to hear. He admitted this to me before his death. It was traumatizing to watch him reveal those things and how much it had affected his life up to that point. When we were married I had no clue. This occurred when he was just starting out on the Strip. So when I'm hearing all of this with him, I'm crying with him. I was going, We have to do something, we have to say something. He was like, No! No! It was a humiliation for a man to be in that position.\n\nDEAN MARTIN'S DAUGHTER DEANA RECALLS GROWING UP WITH 'THE KING OF COOL,' THE RAT PACK AND JERRY LEWIS\n\nMICHAEL HUTCHENCE'S SISTER RECALLS GROWING UP WITH INXS SINGER, FINAL TRAGIC YEARS FOLLOWING BRAIN INJURY\n\nIt's so emasculating and humiliating. It would have been humiliating for him. So we couldn't say anything. Instead he lived with this anger inside. He felt like he couldn't say anything because he was a man. He was raised to be a man, not to cry. It was all mind-f--king. I could see how it would have been devastating and humiliating for him to speak up. I got his perspective from it, but at the same time, I felt so hopeless for him, knowing that he felt he couldn't say anything. And wouldn't. That affected him greatly his whole life. It was part of the reason he drank. It's sad really.\n\nFox News: You wrote how you considered comedy professionally after your fiancé got high and married another blonde.\n\nBrown: So that's referring to Tommy Lee marrying Pamela Anderson. At the moment, it seemed like the most tragic, bulls--t to ever happen to somebody. But when I look back at it today, just like with a lot of my experiences, I have to laugh at it. I mean, who the f--k does that? Who marries somebody after four days? Why does that kind of s--t happen to me?\n\nIt's funny now. It's not really funny, haha. It's more like, who does that? I have a lot of moments in my life that make me question things. Like doing laundry and then falling down the stairs headfirst. Who does that? My life is kind of laughable, in a way. I have to make light of it. Otherwise, it could be pretty tragic. If I don't make light of it, I will probably go down a dark path.\n\nMARLON BRANDO AND MYSTERIOUS FIRST WIFE ANNA KASHFI HAD VIOLENT RELATIONSHIP, BOOK CLAIMS\n\nJANIS JOPLIN ENJOYED 'THE MANY PLEASURES THAT CAME HER WAY' TO COPE WITH INSECURITIES, BOOK CLAIMS\n\nFox News: A lot of comics poke fun at their personal lives. You initially didn't. Why?\n\nBrown: I am self-deprecating in my stand-up. I'm starting to use more of my personal life in my stand-up. In the beginning, I just felt like I touched on everything I needed to share in my first book. My comedy wasn't a continuation of that. I just didn't think it was really funny.\n\nThe only thing my comedy really revolves around is my love life, or lack thereof, specifically what it's like to actually pursue dating in this day and age with dating apps. How weird it is for people to meet through dating apps. And what that does to a guy. It's all shocking what they really think and say to you. I make jokes about that, the comments I get and the dates I've had.\n\nJUDY GARLAND'S EX-LOVER JOHN MEYER RECALLS THE STAR'S FINAL TUMULTUOUS MONTHS\n\nFox News: What do you make of modern dating?\n\nBrown: It's annoying. To have to keep up with that type of interaction, just dating apps in itself – it's ridiculous to me. It blows my mind. It's frustrating to have to keep up with that stuff just to maintain relevance in the dating world… I think at this point, I just might die alone. I don't know if I want to go through all this trouble to have a boyfriend or date somebody. It's kind of ridiculous. Can't we just do things like we used to? I guess not.\n\nFox News: Are you still pursuing stand-up?\n\nBrown: I am! I'm not as heavily into it as I was in the beginning. I have other projects in the works. But I still go up about twice a month now… But my podcast is freaking hilarious. Sharise Neil and I have been friends for over 30 years. She was previously married to Vince Neil. That's how we all met.\n\nMARGARET, DUCHESS OF ARGYLL, WAS A VICTIM OF REVENGE PORN THAT FOLLOWED HER UNTIL DEATH, BOOK CLAIMS\n\nI am considering turning Dirty Rocker Boys into a movie right now. I'm pitching that right now… Nobody served me in the first book as far as attorneys go. You can't be sued for telling the truth. I've heard people say, She's lucky I don't sue her. Well, try to. I didn't lie about anything. If anything, I omitted a lot of things you should be grateful that I didn't mention.\n\nFox News: Who would play you in a film?\n\nBrown: God, people ask that all the time. I can honestly say there's not one person that makes me go, Her for sure. People say Jennifer Lawrence a lot. I think it's her personality… But I haven't thought about it on that level yet. I'm not sure. But there's a new famous somebody every week now. So who the hell knows?\n\nMISS AMERICA 2016 BETTY MAXWELL SAYS SHE MET HER HUSBAND ON TINDER: 'GOD HAS A PLAN'\n\nTODD RUNDGREN EXPLAINS WHY HE'S NEVER TAKEN THE ROCK & ROLL HALL OF FAME SERIOUSLY\n\n\n\nFox News: What's your relationship like with your daughter today?\n\nBrown: She and I are very close. I've been very honest with her my whole life. Of course, I wasn't able to be the mom that I wanted to be. I do have regrets when it comes to that. But she is a wonderful, well-developed child who is forgiving, loving — all the things I instilled in her. I'm just so proud of her. I'm incredibly lucky.\n\nFox News: How important has it been to been for you to be completely open and honest with her?\n\nBrown: That's my motto with everyone in my life. I'm so honest that it's too much sometimes. I tell too much of the truth. That can be loved or hated. There's no gray area with that kind of personality trait. Some people are offended by it and some people totally cherish it. That's just who I am. I've always been this way. And I thought it was a good way to be with my child.\n\nBILL HALEY'S SON CLAIMS 'ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK' SINGER HAD A DARK SIDE, STRUGGLED FROM ALCOHOLISM IN MEMOIR\n\nIt kept her from having to experience a lot of the things that I did growing up. My mom and I just didn't have that kind of relationship. I feel like it's really important to have that with your children. That way, they don't have to go through so much s--t growing up. It's hard being a kid. Other kids are hateful. Society is crazy. So I think it's very important to have that type of level of communication with your children and your family. At the end of the day, they're the ones who love you the most.
YouTube influencers Tana Mongeau and Jake Paul have split after just six months of marriage, which multiple news outlets say was not legally binding.\n\nMongeau, 21, announced the split on her Instagram late Thursday days after opening up about her happiness with the state of their relationship.\n\nok i don't rly know how to do a 'we're taking a break' post & this is weird as f--k...i'm happy to still be able to sit with Jake and laugh as we do this- but for right now we both are taking a break to focus on our own very crazy lives..., she captioned a selfie of the pair lying down on a bed.\n\nTANA MONGEAU SAYS SHE'S 'LOST HERSELF' 4 MONTHS AFTER TYING THE KNOT TO JAKE PAUL\n\ni'll never know what the future holds and i will always love Jake and everything we did. i'm grateful to know throughout this i've made a best friend for life & found someone to do life with when no one understood me, the 21-year-old continued.\n\nMongeau then said 2020 is to working on us, before joking that she also has inherited Paul's Lamborghini because i get half of everything! Mongeau and Paul, 22, did not make any mention of actually filing for divorce.\n\nThe split may not come as a shock to their fans since Mongeau opened up about her unhappiness with their relationship in a 40-minute-long video posted to her account on Monday. Titled the truth about everything, the influencer revealed that she agreed to have an open relationship with Paul.\n\nTANA MONGEAU SAYS WEDDING TO JAKE PAUL WAS JUST FOR 'FUN AND FOR CONTENT'\n\nShe also claimed everything changed once they tied the knot.\n\nHowever, at the time of their nuptials, the two YouTube influencers left fans confused about whether or not the ceremony was legal. In an episode of her MTV YouTube show Tana Turns 21, Mongeau confirmed in August that their wedding was merely a publicity stunt.\n\nDon't get me wrong I think a wedding is a very serious thing but at the same time I don't think Jake and I take things very seriously. I have a lot of love for him but it's still something fun and lighthearted that we're obviously doing for fun and for content, the YouTuber said at the time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn the video, the seemingly fake couple discussed whether the marriage would be legal or not.\n\nThis wedding is 100 percent legal on paper, right? Mongeau asked an uncomfortable-looking Paul, who answered, I don't know if we can talk about that though because we should make it seem like it is. Per Page Six, the pair did not file a marriage license.
Prince Harry and Prince William are reconnecting after their reported fallout.\n\nRoyal expert and Vanity Fair correspondent Katie Nicholl recently told Entertainment Tonight that the relationship between the royal siblings got stronger over the holidays. The brothers have reportedly been distant since Harry, 36, announced last year that he and his wife Meghan Markle were stepping back as senior royals.\n\nThere were phone and video calls over the Christmas and New Year holiday and the Sussexes sent presents to the Cambridges and vice versa, Nicholl told the outlet. 'It was an opportunity in an otherwise very busy and chaotic year for both of the families to come together and connect, albeit virtually.\n\nThings are a lot better between William and Harry, Nicholl continued. If you go back a year at that stage, these brothers were barely on talking terms. When William went to the Sandringham Summit, he was so angry with his brother. He couldn't even face going to that lunch with the Queen. He only went for the meetings, such was his frustration and feeling of disappointment about what his brother had done and how Harry was handling the situation.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY ENDURED A 'PAINFUL' YEAR DURING ROYAL EXIT, INSIDER SAYS: THEY FELT 'DISPLACED'\n\nStill, Nicholl noted that it's questionable whether the relationship will ever be as close as it was before.\n\nThe relationship is much better than it was, she shared. For a start, they are on talking terms, and not only on talking terms, they do speak relatively regularly. They were very much in touch over the holidays. But there is an ocean between them, there is a time difference and as Harry [has] said… they are two brothers on different paths.\n\nThe brothers are expected to be reunited later this year.\n\nThe much-awaited statute tribute to [their mother] Princess Diana will be unveiled in Kensington Palace gardens on what would have been her 60th birthday, said Nicholl. And it is Harry's intention, and Meghan's also, to be here in the U.K. for that opening. It may possibly be the first time we see the brothers together, but I think that we will probably see them together in the spring around the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh's birthday celebrations. COVID travel plans permitting.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY TO REUNITE WITH ROYAL FAMILY THIS SPRING: REPORT\n\nRumors of an alleged royal feud came to light in 2019, when Nicholl claimed that since Markle, 39, and Harry announced their engagement in 2017, William, 38, grew increasingly worried for his brother and his whirlwind romance with the American actress.\n\nWilliam was quite concerned that the relationship had moved so quickly, Nicholl claimed in the TLC documentary Kate V. Meghan: Princesses at War? And being close to Harry, you know, probably the only person close enough to say to Harry, 'This seems to be moving quickly. Are you sure?' And I think what was meant as well intended brotherly advice just riled Harry.\n\nHarry is hugely protective of Meghan, Nicholl continued. He saw that as criticism, he interpreted that as his brother not really being behind this marriage, this union. And I don't think things have been quite right ever since.\n\nHarry hinted at an alleged rift with his older brother in ITV's 2019 documentary Harry & Meghan: An African Journey.\n\nWHY MEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY LIKELY WON'T RETURN TO ROYAL LIFE: EXPERT\n\nPart of this role and part of this job, this family, being under the pressure that it's under, inevitably stuff happens, he said at the time. But look, we're brothers, we'll always be brothers. We're certainly on different paths at the moment but I'll always be there for him and I know he'll always be there for me.\n\nIn November 2020, royal historian and biographer Robert Lacey told Fox News that William had reason to be concerned about his sibling's whirlwind romance with the former American actress.\n\nLet's make clear that William's reservation wasn't whether Meghan was right for Harry, but whether she was right for the royal family and royal life, Lacey explained at the time. When it came to Kate [Middleton], William was slow and cautious. He followed duty. Harry immediately fell in love and discovered a new destiny for himself, a new meaning in his life. William saw Meghan as a self-made woman who created her own celebrity and wealth in the process. The royal family, on the other hand, is in the business of representing values.\n\nRoyals are expected to know their place, Lacey continued. And Harry, of course, was expected to marry a nice girl named Henrietta or Gabriella who lived in the provinces of Britain in the countryside and settle down. But Meghan and Harry both made it clear they wanted to do so much more than that. And let's just say there are things that you can and cannot do when it comes to running the royal family and what it stands for.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLacey said that while William and Harry speak on the phone from time to time, it will take a while for their relationship to heal.\n\nI think it would always have happened that Meghan and Harry would live on the other side of the world, he explained. I think Meghan and Harry will remain based in North America. Unless the brothers can find a way to reconcile, they will have to go their separate ways and keep mutual respect for each other.\n\nWe do know that in July 2021, both brothers have committed to being in Kensington Gardens for the unveiling of the statue dedicated to their late mother, Princess Diana, he pointed out. The world will judge then. But there is a lot of work to be done.

Bridgerton fans may have to wait a little while longer for any news about another season.\n\nWhile Netflix hasn't officially confirmed that the hit show will be back for Season 2, its star Phoebe Dynevor admitted she was unsure how filming would be possible due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe period drama, based on Julia Quinn's bestselling novels, follows families of British high society and how they're taking on Regency London's competitive marriage market. Along the way, a mysterious gossip columnist, known as Lady Whistledown, seems to see – and tell – all. The scandalous writer is voiced by Julie Andrews.\n\nRegé-Jean Page plays Simon Basset, the brooding Duke of Hastings, while Dynevor, 25, stars as Daphne Bridgerton.\n\n'BRIDGERTON' STAR REVEALS GETTING THROUGH SHOW'S RACY SCENES WHILE WATCHING WITH MOM\n\nI can't imagine how it would be possible to film under these circumstances, Dynevor recently told Deadline. There are so many extras and so many crew members, and it's a very intimate show.\n\nIt just baffles how we would film it under COVID rules unless there was a vaccine beforehand, she added.\n\nAccording to the actress, Season 1 wrapped filming in the U.K. last February – just days before the pandemic prompted production companies to hit pause.\n\nWe just managed to finish, she told the outlet. It was amazing.\n\nDREW BARRYMORE SAYS 'BRIDGERTON' INSPIRED HER TO CONTINUE USING DATING APPS\n\nThe first season of Bridgerton focused on the steamy courtship between Daphne and the Duke of Hastings. Dynevor insisted she isn't sure if Season 2 will chronicle their relationship as closely.\n\nI genuinely have no idea what they're going to do with the second season, but I imagine if they're following the books, then it would be Anthony's journey, said Dynevor, referring to her on-screen brother played by Jonathan Bailey.\n\nQuinn's novels are known for taking turns following different members of the aristocratic family.\n\nI'm sure Daphne will end up getting involved, said Dynevor. I do wonder what it looks like. I'm excited to find out.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBridgerton, produced by Shonda Rhimes of Grey's Anatomy fame, made its debut on the streaming platform Christmas Day and quickly became one of the most-watched shows on Netflix.\n\nNetflix also claimed Bridgerton is the fifth most-watched show in the company's history, Observer reported.\n\nPage, 31, has captivated the hearts of many admirers on social media as the sought-after bachelor in the series.\n\nProduction Weekly previously reported that filming for a project titled Bridgerton 02 will begin sometime in March 2021.\n\nBridgerton is currently streaming on Netflix.
Norm Pattis, attorney for accused wife killer Fotis Dulos, said that he was having a difficult time coming to grips with the suicide of his client.\n\nOn Jan. 28, 2020, Connecticut police discovered Fotis Dulos unresponsive inside his car in the garage of his home.\n\nHis estranged wife and the mother to their five children, Jennifer Dulos, had been missing for more than 100 days.\n\nHow are you feeling? Fox News correspondent Laura Ingle asked Pattis.\n\nNumb and I think I'm having a hard time processing it all. This was not foreseeable, said the veteran criminal defense attorney.\n\nIn the Fox Nation show Murder in Connecticut, Ingle re-examined every detail of this bizarre case, which she covered for the Fox News Channel from its beginning to its tragic end.\n\n5 TRUE CRIME SHOW TO BINGE-WATCH ON FOX NATION\n\nJennifer met Fotis at Brown University. Years later, they reconnected following a chance meeting.\n\nI remember that they ran into one another at the Aspen airport, said Jennifer's friend Carrie Luft. They reencountered one another at a time when she was single and wasn't even really looking for love. Their courtship was a fast one. ... Jennifer seemed very, very happy. Fotis was charming and funny.\n\nThe marriage was not a good one, and after a series of ups and downs, it ended in 2017.\n\nThat's when Jennifer discovered Fotis had been having a yearlong affair with a woman from work named Michelle Traconis, Ingle reported.\n\nIn an exclusive interview in December 2019, Ingle sat down across from Fotis and pressed him for answers on the whereabouts of his wife. Fotis declined to give any specific, citing a judge's gag order.\n\nThen, a bombshell exploded in the case. One hundred and thirty seven days after Jennifer was last seen alive, Connecticut State Police arrested Fotis for a third time, charging him with murder.\n\nSeveral weeks later, another bombshell: Dulos was dead.\n\n3 MOVIES TO WATCH RIGHT NOW ON FOX NATION\n\nHours before the suicide attempt, Fotis was due in court for an emergency bond hearing where he would learn if his bail would be revoked. When he was late, police were called to his house for a welfare check, narrated Ingle.\n\nEmergency responders got a pulse and raced him to UConn medical center in Farmington. He was then airlifted to another medical facility to be treated in a hyperbaric chamber for carbon monoxide poisoning, she continued. Two days later, Fotis Dolus was declared dead at Jacoby Medical Center in New York City. After an eight-month search for Jennifer, the prime suspect in her disappearance was dead.\n\nPattis was one of the last people to speak to Dulos.\n\nYou talked to him that day? Ingle asked Pattis.\n\nYes, he answered. It was a difficult conversation. It was foreseeable to me that he would be incarcerated again. And that was not news that he wanted to hear.\n\nJennifer's body has still not been found but her family and friends are not giving up.\n\nThe priority is still to find Jennifer. The investigation is ongoing, said Luft. Fotis is not a victim. He chose a course of action and as a consequence, these kids are left without either parent.\n\nTo watch Murder in Connecticut, go to Fox Nation and sign up today.\n\nLIMITED TIME OFFER, GET YOUR FIRST MONTH OF FOX NATION FOR 99 CENTS\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only for Fox Nation subscribers.

After the last year appeared to test Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's marriage, multiple reports say the reality star-turned-prison-reform-advocate is ready to call it quits from the rapper once and for all.\n\nReports circulated Tuesday afternoon that Kardashian, 40, has been planning her exit from her husband of six years, beginning with an insider claiming to Page Six that she's hired high-powered divorce attorney Laura Wasser. The source insisted divorce is imminent for the pair but Kardashian has yet to officially file divorce papers in court.\n\nKardashian's failure to file has less to do with her happiness in her marriage to West and much more about the four children they share, a source now claims to E! News.\n\nIt's gotten to the point where they haven't spent time together as a married couple in months, an insider told the outlet.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN, KANYE WEST DIVORCE 'IMMINENT': REPORT\n\nKim knows the marriage is over. She's known for a while, the source continued, noting that they've only physically seen each other for the sake of the kids.\n\nKardashian's stalling is because she wants to do what's right for their four children -- North, 7, Saint, 5, Chicago, 2, and Psalm, 1.\n\nShe wants to make sure she's making the right decision for the kids, the source said.\n\nThe insider noted that while the Skims founder will always care for Kanye, it's over between them. Kim is only focused on what's best for the kids. It's a tough decision for her and she's figuring it out.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA REACTS TO KIM KARDASHIAN, KANYE WEST SPLIT REPORTS: 'REALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOALS'\n\nRepresentatives for Kardashian, West and Wasser did not immediately respond to Fox News' requests for comment on Tuesday.\n\nWhile the couple's apparent separation has already sent eagle-eyed KUWTK viewers into a frenzy, most would agree that news of their impending divorce doesn't come as much of a shock.\n\nKardashian and West's marital troubles were first reported over the summer when West announced his candidacy for president in the 2020 election.\n\nDuring what Kardashian later implied was an episode brought on by his bipolar disorder, West brought up the possibility of divorcing his wife at a campaign event while claiming they considered aborting their first child.\n\nEven if my wife wants to divorce me after this speech, she brought North into the world even when I didn't want to, West told a crowd while crying, according to People magazine.\n\nWHAT WOULD BE AT STAKE IF KANYE WEST, KIM KARDASHIAN WERE TO DIVORCE? EXPERT WEIGHS IN\n\nIn a since-deleted tweet, the Power rapper also claimed that he'd been trying to divorce Kardashian ever since she attended a prison reform event with rapper Meek Mill in 2018.\n\nHe later apologized for the Twitter rant but the ordeal reportedly left Kardashian furious.\n\nIn July, it was reported that the couple had been considering divorce for weeks and that Kardashian and her famous family were shielding her children from their father's public outbursts.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLater that month, the stars were spotted having an emotional conversation in Wyoming, where the Yeezy founder owns a ranch and had been staying for a time over the summer.\n\nMore recently, the pair reportedly grew even more distant, with sources claiming the two were essentially leading separate lives.\n\nAn insider told Page Six that West attended Kardashian's 40th birthday extravaganza in November for just one day.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nHe showed up late and left early, he wouldn't appear in any of their Instagram shots. All he did was bring over the hologram of her father Robert Kardashian, then got out of there as fast as he could, the source explained to Page Six.\n\nThe 40-year-old reality star married the hip-hop icon, 43, in May 2014.\n\nFox News' Nate Day contributed to this report.
Kyra Sedgwick proved she trusts her husband, Kevin Bacon, implicitly during the pandemic.\n\nThe Closer actress enlisted the Footloose star to give her an at-home bikini wax since salons were closed because of the coronavirus.\n\nIt became clear at one point to me, to both of us, that I needed a bikini line wax, the 55-year-old actress recalled while making an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live.\n\nPart of me was like, 'How hard could it be?' You know, I've watched these amazing ladies do it all these years, and like, I've always really appreciated them and appreciated their attention to detail, but I didn't really think it would be that hard, Sedgwick added.\n\nKEVIN BACON OPENS UP ON HIS MARRIAGE TO KYRA SEDGWICK\n\nKevin, is like, incredibly handy. Like he's really good with a lot of things… So we both figured, 'How hard could it be?' she reasoned.\n\nBut the Call Your Mother star admitted it was a miracle she didn't end up in the emergency room.\n\nI mean there were moments where I was like, 'I thought you knew how to do this! My god, what are you doing? That's such a huge piece!' she laughed.\n\nKYRA SEDGWICK SHARES HOW SHE AND KEVIN BACON ARE SPENDING THEIR TIME DURING CORONAVIRUS QUARANTINE\n\nBacon, 62, and Sedgwick married in 1988 and share daughter Sosie, 28, and son Travis, 31.\n\nShe told Kimmel the secret to their 32-year marriage is not to spend 24/7 together.\n\nBut the amazing thing is, and a surprise even to me, that like after 32 years, he always wakes up before I do in the morning and I come downstairs during this COVID time and I'm like, 'How'd you sleep? How's your morning been so far?' And I really care. I really want to know, Sedgwick said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBacon previously told People magazine that his wife's partnership is invaluable, especially during the COVID crisis.\n\nI found someone I was meant to be with, he gushed.
One California firefighter went all-out in staging a dramatic scene to pop the question to his longtime girlfriend, faking a fire in their home during a family party before getting down on one knee.\n\nZach Steele and Maddison Ridgik recently welcomed family and friends for a party at their Ventura home, Inside Edition reports, when the playful groom-to-be put his romantic plan into motion. According to the outlet, the 30-year-old firefighter always planned to incorporate his colleagues and a fire engine into his marriage proposal to Ridgik.\n\nOriginally I got one smoke machine, he told the outlet. I went to test it and there was barely any smoke. One was not going to work, so I had to get more smoke machines.\n\nEXPECTANT MOTHER UPSET AFTER FRIEND TELLS HER BABY'S 'UNIQUE' NAME IS ACTUALLY COMMON\n\nSteele ultimately set up six smoke machines in the attic, to create faux-smolder at just the right moment during the soiree.\n\nWhile the party was in full swing, the firefighter exited the gathering under the guise of picking up more groceries; though in reality, he headed to the Ventura Fire County Department station.\n\nMoments later, Ridgik's stepdad, Johnny Jenson, turned on the smoke machines, creating a terrifying faux-blaze that spooked guests into evacuating the home and prompting the bride-to-be to panic and call her beau seven times.\n\nA fire truck soon rushed around the corner as Jenson pretended to put out the fire with a hose — and Steele made his move.\n\nThere was way too much smoke, it was crazy. It filled up the attic and the entire garage, he later told SWNS, as per Metro. Everyone was in the front yard and I could see Maddison was on the phone panicking. I had seven missed calls [from her]. All the other guys hopped out but I stayed in the engine for about a minute.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nI could see her back to me as I approached, but I had my mask on so she didn't recognize me. When I grabbed her waist, she spun around and I took off my mask. She had a look of pure shock and confusion on her face, he said of his fiancée, a teacher.\n\nHer hands were shaking as she tried to figure it all out. She turned away from me and [when] she turned back around I was on one knee. I asked her to marry me and thank God she said yes.\n\nRidgik, also 30, shared her side of the story.\n\nA group of us were standing in the kitchen enjoying a glass of wine and some hors-d'oeuvres when my stepdad came into the room and frantically told us we had to get out, she told SWNS. I grabbed the dogs and went out front. When we got out there was smoke coming out of all the vents from the attic.\n\nWhen I got outside I saw the smoke coming out of the vent on the front of our house and coming out of the vent on the top of our house, she continued. I started to cry the moment I saw the firefighters jump out of the truck with their gear.\n\n\n\nWhen Zach walked up to me he had his mask on so I really couldn't tell. He then took his mask off and walked me into the middle of the yard. I was so confused and I honestly could not sort through my emotions enough to really comprehend what was happening, she says, as Steele dropped to one knee.\n\nI was still shaking and crying yet so excited. It was truly the best most indescribable moment of my life, Ridgik says.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to the bride-to-be, she and her fiancé have been together for seven and a half years, and she's been dreaming of this day since they first met.\n\nMeanwhile, cheeky Steele says that he couldn't have pulled off the slightly terrifying stunt without the help of his friends and colleagues at the Ventura County Fire Department — though he claims he has no hijinks planned for the big day.\n\nI'm not planning any pranks or surprises for our wedding. It will be much less drama, Steele said.\n\nA March 30, 2019 wedding is planned.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved Monday to an intensive care unit in a London hospital after suffering worsening coronavirus symptoms.\n\nJohnson had been quarantined at his home since being diagnosed with COVID-19 late last month. The United Kingdom has 52,276 known COVID-19 cases, including 5,373 deaths.\n\nLike many Britons, his health care is being provided by the National Health Service, a comprehensive government-run health provider. The agency is one of the most sacrosanct facets of British life and can be a touchy subject among politicians.\n\nHere is a brief breakdown of the NHS.\n\nWhat is the National Health Service?\n\nThe NHS was established after World War II with the premise that health care should be made available to the masses no matter if they can afford to pay or not. It is made up of four separate systems that serve each of the four countries that make up the United Kingdom -- England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\n\nEach operates independently. In total, the four agencies employ around 1.7 million people, the BBC reported, making it one of the Top 10 largest employers in the world. In 2017, the NHS spent more than $170 billion across Britain.\n\nServices offered\n\nBritain's health system provides a variety of services ranging from primary and urgent care to cancer treatment and child care. Other programs include diabetes prevention and help with learning disabilities.\n\nIs health care free?\n\nThe NHS offers services to everyone living in the U.K. without being asked to pay for the full cost of what's being provided. The agency is funded through general taxation, rather than costs coming directly from sick or injured patients.\n\nMost services are free up to the point of use, meaning patients generally don't pay for doctor visits and other services. In contrast, millions in the United States remain uninsured and health care costs are some of the most expensive in the world. (The marriage between the two has also led to mass innovation that fosters excellent care for those who can afford it.)\n\nJohnson previously called for patients to be charged to use the British system to prevent abuse from people who can afford to pay, according to Business Insider, which unearthed a 1995 column he wrote.\n\nIf NHS services continue to be free in this way, they will continue to be abused, like any free service, he wrote in the Spectator magazine. If people have to pay for them, they will value them more.\n\nHow is the service?\n\nWaiting times have been an issue with NHS. More than 4 million people were waiting for non-urgent treatment in England as of May 2018, the Guardian reported, with 3,000 of those waiting longer than a year.\n\nNearly a quarter of a million people were waiting for more than six months for planned medical treatment, according to an April 2019 report from the Royal College of Surgeons. In January 2019, almost 25 percent of cancer patients didn't start treatment on time despite urgent referrals from doctors, according to Forbes.\n\nThe agency is also struggling to keep up with the demand for mental health services and is dealing with a shortage of hospital beds.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHow have demographic shifts impacted the NHS?\n\nBritain's population has grown substantially since the National Health Service's inception, to roughly 66 million. In addition, as life expectancy has increased 13 years, so has the number of elderly patients dependant on the system.\n\nPeople are living longer with chronic health problems like dementia and heart disease, putting a strain on the health system. The BBC cited figures that showed it costs more than twice the amount to care for the average 65-year-old than it does for someone in their 30s.

They want the government to follow the example of many other nations in guaranteeing marital freedom.\n\nTen Japanese municipalities have enacted partnership ordinances for same-sex couples to make it easier for them to rent apartments together, among other things, but they are not legally binding.\n\nMany LGBT people hide their sexuality, fearing prejudice at home, school or work.\n\nThe obstacles are worse for transgender people, who face extra difficulties including a requirement they be sterilized to marry someone of the same birth sex.
The Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco issued a scathing statement Thursday in which he accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of impugning the motives of anti-abortion voters -- and described her remarks on abortion as in direct contradiction of Church teaching.\n\nTo begin with the obvious: Nancy Pelosi does not speak for the Catholic Church. She speaks as a high-level important government leader, and as a private citizen,' Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone said in a statement. And on the question of the equal dignity of human life in the womb, she also speaks in direct contradiction to a fundamental human right that Catholic teaching has consistently championed for 2,000 years.\n\nPELOSI DEFENDS IMPEACHMENT IN FACE OF BIDEN'S CALL FOR UNITY: 'WE MUST DO IT'\n\nPelosi told Hillary Clinton in a podcast that Donald Trump became president because of opposition to what she called a woman's right to choose, and said his promise to appoint anti-abortion judges was a dogwhistle to Evangelicals and Catholics -- something she says gives me great grief as a Catholic.\n\nShe went on to claim that the abortion issue was one of the reasons some Trump supporters opposed impeachment despite still thinking he did something wrong.\n\nWhen you take the greed of those who want their tax cut, that's probably a small number, but nonetheless a number, and then you take the abortion issue -- and many of these people are very good people, that's just their point of view, she said. But they were willing to sell the whole democracy down the river for that one issue.\n\nCordileone re-asserted Catholic teaching on abortion and noted that that teaching had been affirmed by Pope Francis, the Second Vatican Council and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). He then accused Pelosi of impugning the motives of Catholic and others.\n\nThis is not the language of unity and healing, he said. She owes these voters an apology.\n\nWhile Cordileone noted that there are many issues Catholic must weigh when casting their vote in November, he said that no Catholic in good conscience can favor abortion.\n\n'Right to choose' is a smokescreen for perpetuating an entire industry that profits from one of the most heinous evils imaginable, he said. Our land is soaked with the blood of the innocent, and it must stop.\n\nBoth President Biden and Speaker Pelosi are Catholics, with Biden becoming the second Catholic president in U.S. history this week. But their promotion of pro-choice policies have brought them into conflict with members of the Church hierarchy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile the USCCB has welcomed a number of Biden's first moves as president, including on immigration and climate change, it also issued a statement expressing concern about his stance on abortion and other matters.\n\nSo, I must point out that our new President has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender, USCCB Chairman Jose Gomez said. Of deep concern is the liberty of the Church and the freedom of believers to live according to their consciences.
The man millions around the world would come to know as Kirk Douglas was born Issur Danielovitch on Dec. 9, 1916 – the only boy in a poor Russian Jewish family of seven children in Amsterdam, N.Y., near Albany.\n\nLong before he changed his name to Kirk Douglas, the boy's family changed their last name to Demsky and changed his first name to Isadore. His nickname was Izzy.\n\nIn the 103 years between his birth and his death that was announced Wednesday, the chiseled-jaw leading man endeared himself to generations of movie fans – not just for his well-played roles but also for his philanthropic and justice-oriented convictions.\n\nKIRK DOUGLAS, ACTOR AND HOLLYWOOD LEGEND, DEAD AT 103, FAMILY SAYS\n\nConsidered to be one of the last of Hollywood's Golden Era stars, Kirk Douglas' accomplishments spanned the century, ranging from roles in classic films including, Spartacus, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and Lust for Life.\n\nAccording to the American Film Institute, Douglas was one of the greatest male screen legends of all time – and received plenty of awards and nominations to support such a distinction. But sadly, even legends must die – just like the rest of us.\n\nIt's become popular in some circles to suggest that it takes a village to raise a child, and surely every single one of us is the product of the many lives that touch ours – including the neighborhoods and influential people of our past.\n\nBut if Douglas had followed the lead of those within his community, he may very well have never made it to Hollywood and all the success he enjoyed on the silver screen.\n\nGrowing up, Douglas recalled that he excelled in the basic teachings of Judaism and the Hebrew language – no small feat for a young boy of modest means.\n\nThe Jews of our community thought they would do a wonderful thing and collect enough money to send me to a yeshiva to become a rabbi, he recalled. Holy Moses! That scared … me. I didn't want to be a rabbi. I wanted to be an actor. Believe me, the members of the Sons of Israel were persistent. I had nightmares – wearing long payos and a black hat. I had to work very hard to get out of it.\n\nAs a 7-year-old, Izzy landed his first role in a school play as a shoemaker. Wearing a homemade black apron courtesy of his mother's stitching, Izzy was moved to discover that his father Herschel (known as Harry), who hadn't paid much attention to his only son's interests, was in the audience.\n\nAfter the performance, he gave me my first Oscar, Douglas recalled fondly years later. An ice cream cone. I've never forgotten that.\n\nHarry Demsky could never get a job in Amsterdam's mills, which at the time refused to hire Jews. So he became a ragman – someone who collected and sold discarded items. No doubt he never dreamed that his only would son would literally go from rags to riches.\n\nOnce young Izzy had been bitten by the acting bug, he never escaped its grasp.\n\nThe rise of the man who became Kirk Douglas was classic Americana – grit and gumption, hard work and heavy lifting. It didn't come easy, which made it all the more satisfying in the end.\n\nTo put himself through St. Lawrence University, Izzy worked as a janitor. He was a varsity wrestler but no fraternity would admit him because he was Jewish. Despite anti-Semitism, he was elected the first Jewish president of his student body when he was a junior.\n\nFollowing graduation, he got a summer job as a stagehand at the Tamarack Playhouse in New York's Adirondack Mountains and was given some minor roles in plays. Determined to become an actor, he changed his name once again from Isadore Demsky to Kirk Douglas.\n\nWhen World War II began, Douglas enlisted in the Navy and ultimately received a commission, serving on a submarine in the Pacific before being honorably discharged with the rank of lieutenant in 1944 after he was injured in an accidental explosion.\n\nKirk Douglas' first marriage to actress Diana Dill produced two sons, including Michael, who in time would earn his own Hollywood fame. Kirk and Diana divorced in 1951. Douglas' second marriage to Anne Buydens would go the distance, lasting 65 years until his death. She survives him and is 100.\n\nCentenarians often lament that one of the downsides of long life is outliving all your friends – but there are plenty of upsides too, of course. Laying a legacy and living long enough to see its fruits and taste its sweetness is a gift that not everybody gets to enjoy.\n\nKirk Douglas' unlikely American journey was the product of a boyhood dream and a tireless pursuit – a magnificent obsession that matured and multiplied with every role he took, and where he learned countless lessons along the way.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThere was another secret to the legendary actor's success, though, beyond the raw effort and hard work.\n\nIf I like a picture, I do it, he once reflected. I don't stop to wonder if it'll be successful or not.\n\nIn a world full of too many people who seem to calculate and choreograph their every move ad nauseum, there's something refreshing about that, don't you think?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn the end, Kirk Douglas followed his heart and his instincts, doing what he loved with the people he loved to be with – and the result was a legendary career and a boyhood dream that ultimately came true.\n\nMillions of us enjoyed his great films, and no doubt millions more will enjoy them far into the future. It was quite a journey from Issur Danielovitch, to Isadore Demsky, to the great Kirk Douglas. We should all be grateful that he made it and was with us all these 103 years.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY PAUL BATURA

Sign up here.\n\nKody Brown and his wives Christine, Meri, Robyn and Janelle Brown are all trying to make it work while living in quarantine during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe 51-year-old and his unconventional family are the stars of TLC's Sister Wives, which shows how they navigate life in a world that seems to shun their lifestyle. The series has been airing since 2010.\n\nNormal life has ceased for me, my wives and our family, Brown told Us Weekly on Tuesday. We're all working from home, however, some of us are not able to do necessary travel for work, and some of our entire industries are shut down. Two of my wives run an online business so they are still working remotely but they aren't able to do some of the in-person tasks they normally do. Overall there have been some setbacks and some things have slowed down significantly.\n\nThe reality TV star and his wives share a combined 18 children, nine who are 18 or younger.\n\nQUEEN ELIZABETH THANKS HEALTH CARE WORKERS DURING CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\nOLIVIA JADE SHARES BATHROBE SELFIE DURING CORONAVIRUS QUARANTINE AT HOME\n\nWe're still in contact and talking a lot, but because nothing is going on in our lives, life has gotten a bit boring, he said. There's not much to discuss other than checking in on the kids, who are doing school from home. There's no new news within our family but obviously we're keeping updated about the news of the world. Instead of talking about the weather we're talking about coronavirus.\n\nThe discussions have shifted to obsession! he admitted. We've been asking each other, 'Do you have any friends or know anybody who has it?' Other than that, there's not much else to talk about.\n\nChristine, 47, said she's been coming up with activities to keep the family busy while practicing social distancing.\n\nWe've been doing embroidery, cross-stitching and crocheting, she said. I'm teaching the girls how to do more handiwork. Kody crafting? Not yet, I can't imagine him holding a glue gun. We've been making our own products with raw ingredients, we've been really trying not to go to the store, so I even made my own face moisturizer.\n\nJanelle, 50, shared it hasn't been easy being quarantined without their entire family being together.\n\nJ.K. ROWLING REVEALS SHE EXPERIENCED 'ALL SYMPTOMS' OF CORONAVIRUS\n\nROSEANNE BARR SAYS CORONAVIRUS IS A PLOY TO 'GET RID' OF HER GENERATION, IS PLANNING LAWSUIT OVER TV SHOW CANCELLATION\n\nI really think it would have been easier to deal with being quarantined if we were all under one roof because we're having to be so separate, she said. We have to limit family gatherings, and if we were together, our exposure would be one less person going to the grocery store instead of doing it for separate households. There would be more camaraderie.\n\nSince we're staying so distant from each other we need to make phone calls and find other ways to stay in touch as much as possible, like video chat or sending care packages, chimed Robyn, 41. That's one of the things I'm noticing. I'm talking to my family more because I have the time and because we're all worried now.\n\nAs for Meri, 49, she's grateful her job allows her to work from home.\n\nMy typical schedule involves a lot of travel and I always feel blessed when I get to be at home more than a little bit of time, she said. Luckily, I'm able to work from home so this doesn't feel out of the norm for me, at this point. I've limited where I go and my daily errand running. I'm not seeing much of the rest of the family because we're all quarantining, so it's a little weird that we can't get together but we know it's best to stay in our own individual homes.\n\nBack in February 2019, Robyn told Fox News that faith has been essential in keeping the peace within the union.\n\nKATHARINE MCPHEE RE-WEARS 'AMERICAN IDOL' DRESS FROM 14 YEARS AGO: 'DAY 26 OF QUARANTINE'\n\nMATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY PLAYS VIRTUAL BINGO WITH TEXAS SENIOR LIVING FACILITY RESIDENTS IN QUARANTINE\n\nIt absolutely guides us in everything that we do, she explained. You don't see a lot of catfights in our family, and a lot of that is because culturally and spiritually we are taught that we treat each other with charity and with love and we… go forward with a Christ-like type of attitude towards each other.\n\nIf we didn't have the guidance of faith, religion or spirituality in our lives, I don't think we'd ever be able to be functional in this kind of lifestyle, said Kody Brown.
Crystal Hefner is opening up about a nearly fatal experience that occurred during a 2019 cosmetic surgery.\n\nHugh Hefner's widow, who is 34, explained on social media Wednesday that she suffered complications during a fat transfer surgery. She shared the scary details of the event on Instagram along with a selfie showing her chest wrapped in bandages.\n\nI had a fat transfer surgery October 16 and almost didn't make it through. I lost half the blood in my body and ended up in the hospital needing a blood transfusion, the Playboy model begins in her caption.\n\nHefner said she's been slowly eating my way back to health and is finally feeling ok.\n\nHUGH HEFNER'S WIFE CRYSTAL PAYS TRIBUTE TO THE 'LEGEND' ON 3RD ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH\n\nHugh Hefner's third wife went on to say she's become an advocate for being natural in recent years, recalling her decision to remove her breast implants in 2016 as well as everything else toxic in my body.\n\nI should have learned my lesson the first time but I guess the universe keeps sending you the same lesson until you learn it, she shared.\n\nShe went on to condemn the expectations placed on women in today's culture and shared the damage that overly sexualizing women has caused.\n\nOur culture is a trap and makes women feel terrible about themselves. Movies (84.9% directed by men) make it worse. Social media makes it worse. Advertisements make it worse. Physically fake people make it worse (I was one of them), she wrote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nWithout going into specifics, the former Playmate seemed to suggest her past modeling career and connections to Playboy took a toll on her self-confidence.\n\nI know from the worst kind of experience. For ten years my value was based on how good my physical body looked. I was rewarded and made a living based on my outer apperance. To this day I need to write reminders of why I'm worthy that have nothign to do with my physical appearance to convince myself I'm enough, she wrote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHefner said she's given herself a slap on the wrist for caving into this pressure into her 30s.\n\nIn addition to her modeling career, she is known for her marriage to Hugh Hefner. She first became engaged to the late Playboy founder in 2010 when she was 25 and he was 85. They called it quits days before their wedding in 2011 although they later reconciled and got married in 2012. Hefner died of natural causes at age 91.

Kelleth Cuthbert a.k.a. Fiji Water Girl, who went viral at the 2019 Golden Globes for photobombing celebs as she handed out water bottles, didn't watch the 2020 Golden Globes.\n\nI am hanging out with my two rescue puppies tonight, the 32-year-old actress/model told Page Six on Sunday. I'm not [watching], but I am curious about a couple of the categories. I've just been googling it here and there to see what's been announced.\n\nWHO IS GOLDEN GLOBES' FIJI WATER GIRL, KELLETH CUTHBERT? WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRAL PHOTO-BOMBING MODEL\n\nCuthbert, whose real name is Kelly Steinbach, sued Fiji Water Company and The Wonderful Company in January 2019 for using her viral fame to market their product without permission. The company quickly countersued, saying her claims were false and that she breached her contract.\n\nCuthbert told us the lawsuits are still ongoing a year later.\n\nI can't really talk about any details, she explained. But I'm proud of myself for standing up for myself. Their actions that they took were super hurtful with everything that happened.\n\nShe added, I'm really hopeful it will be resolved in the near future. It's a long process, but it's moving in the direction of being solved and I'm hopeful.\n\nFIJI WATER GIRL LITERALLY STEALS GOLDEN GLOBES SPOTLIGHT: 'YOU'VE GOT TO ANGLE'\n\nCuthbert told us the initial craziness of her viral fame has calmed down over the last year, although it's been renewed the past couple of days because of the award show.\n\nIt's still been an exciting year full of very unusual opportunities, she said. As well as continuing to audition for roles and various modeling jobs, she explained that she's working with Pacific Pups Rescue and fostered 40 dogs in the past year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs for which celebrities she's rooting for to take home a Golden Globe, I loved Adam Driver's performance [in 'Marriage Story'], so I'm super curious if he's going to win something for that.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Post.
Welcome to FOX News First. Not signed up yet? Click here.\n\n\n\nDeveloping now, Friday, Jan. 11, 2019\n\nTRUMP'S 'ABSOLUTE RIGHT' AS PRESIDENT: In an exclusive interview with FOX News' Sean Hannity, President Trump said he has the absolute right to declare a national emergency if he can't reach an agreement with congressional Democrats to provide funding for his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border ... The law is very clear. I mean, we have the absolute right to declare a national emergency, Trump said. This is a national emergency, if you look what's happening.\n\nTrump did not lay out a specific timetable for when he might take such a step, saying: I think we're going to see what happens over the next few days.\n\nThe president spoke to FOX News in Texas, on the banks of the Rio Grande, where he visited the border region to argue that a barrier would deter drug and human trafficking into the United States. Back in Washington, Democrats in the Senate on Thursday failed to proceed with House-passed spending bills that would fund the government and end the partial shutdown without new border-wall money.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSHUTDOWN REALITY SETS IN: Approximately 8,000 federal workers on Friday will face their first payday without a paycheck due to the ongoing government shutdown ... Roughly 420,000 employees have been deemed essential and are working unpaid. An additional 380,000 are staying home without pay. Democratic senators and union leaders led federal workers in rallies at the White House and across the country on Thursday to end the shutdown.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, the Senate passed legislation to provide back pay for federal workers furloughed during the shutdown. According to statistics provided by the Department of Labor, 4,760 federal employees filed for unemployment benefits in the last week of December, an increase of 3,831 from the 929 who applied the week before.\n\nThe shutdown, which enters its 21st day Friday, will be the longest in history by this weekend. Most of the government workers received their last paycheck two weeks ago.\n\nPatrick Walsh: The Democratic Party is running on fumes (and Trump knows it)\n\nCNN's Jim Acosta tries to show that walls don't work - and it backfires on him\n\nMISSING WISCONSIN TEEN FOUND ALIVE: Jayme Closs, a teenager who hadn't been seen since her parents were found dead last October, has been discovered alive and a suspect has been taken into custody, officials said ... Many questions surround Closs, 13, who was found about 70 miles north of where she was last seen. She was discovered Thursday in the town of Gordon in Douglas County, Wis., after she approached a woman who was out walking her dog.\n\nAuthorities are planning a news briefing for approximately 10 a.m. local time Friday.\n\nTRUMP'S EX-'FIXER' TO TESTIFY: Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney, has agreed to testify before the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Feb. 7, almost exactly one month before he starts serving prison time for campaign finance violations, tax evasion and lying to Congress about Trump's past business dealings in Russia ... In a statement, Cohen said he accepted the invitation to appear from Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the committee's chairman, [i]n furtherance of my commitment to cooperate and provide the American people with answers. Cummings said the committee was in the process of consulting with Special Counsel [Robert] Mueller's office to ensure that Cohen's scheduled testimony would not interfere with the ongoing investigation into interactions between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.\n\nWILL BEZOS' DIVORCE AFFECT AMAZON? - The divorce of the world's richest man, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie Bezos, could leave the fate of the pair's massive fortune - and Amazon itself - potentially in the hands of Washington state courts ... TMZ reported Thursday that the couple did not have a prenuptial agreement detailing terms of a possible split. That does not preclude the possibility there was some type of post-nuptial agreement put in place.\n\nWashington state – where the pair live and where Amazon is based – is a community property state, as opposed to an equitable distribution state, like New York. In a community property state, all assets acquired during the marriage are considered marital property and subject to a 50-50 split. That means MacKenzie Bezos could be entitled to half of the entrepreneur's $137 billion fortune.\n\nBezos' most prized asset is Amazon. He is Amazon's largest shareholder with a 16.3 percent stake. If his wife gets half of that ownership, it could change the company's dynamics.\n\n\n\nTHE SOUNDBITE\n\nBORDER SWING - The number one reason they will vote 'for' him is because of his stance on border security – Brad Parscale, President Trump's 2020 campaign manager, on The Story with Martha MacCallum, arguing that swing voters are inclined to vote for Trump in the next presidential election because of his crusade for strengthened border security and construction of a wall.

It turns out Meghan Markle and the rest of the fab four may miss out on the next royal wedding.\n\nUK's Mirror reported Sunday that many senior British royals, including Markle, Kate Middleton, their spouses Princes Harry and William, and even Queen Elizabeth II may reportedly skip Lady Gabriella Windsor's spring nuptials to boyfriend Thomas Kingstone.\n\nWindsor, who is 51st in line to the throne, is the daughter of Elizabeth's cousin Prince Michael of Kent. Her grandfather, Prince George of Kent, is also the 92-year-old's younger brother.\n\nRoyal expert Richard Fitzwilliam told UK's Express that while the news may come as a surprise to many, it's not exactly a huge shocker within the palace.\n\nSenior members of the royal family were absent from the marriage of her brother Lord Frederick Windsor to the actress Sophie Winkelman in 2009, said Fitzwilliam. There will be speculation as to which senior royals will attend this. It's a relatively low profile occasion as royal weddings go but given the insatiable appetite for royal news, there was more buzz around [Princess] Eugenie's wedding than expected, there will undoubtedly be interest in it.\n\nAccording to the publication, Windsor, known to friends as Ella, graduated from Brown and Oxford with degrees in comparative literature and social anthropology. The 37-year-old now works as a senior director at a branding company where she specializes in travel and art.\n\nKingstone reportedly dated Natalie Hicks-Loebbecke, an ex of William's, before he met Windsor.\n\nUK's Daily Mail reported the wedding will be privately paid by Prince Michael of Kent along with his wife, Princess Michael of Kent. The wedding will be held at St. George's Chapel in Windsor, the same royal venue where Markle and Harry, as well as Eugenie and husband Jack Brooksbank tied the knot.\n\nIt is likely Markle, 37, may not be able to attend Windsor's wedding because she is also expecting her first child with Harry, 34, in the spring.\n\nBut when it comes to weddings, Markle knows how to add a special touch.\n\nPeople magazine also reported that for her own May 2018 marriage to Harry, she gifted six of her best friends, as well as new sister-in-law Middleton, 37, a solid gold disc bracelet by jewelry Lisette Polny, founder of Zofia Day, called the Kensington.\n\nAccording to the magazine, the bracelet in yellow gold was made specifically for the royal wedding and approved by Markle herself. The piece is available to the public to buy for $450.\n\nIt's an overwhelming honor to be part of history and for my pieces to be given as a keepsake for this momentous occasion, Polny told People. It's a really simple, elegant piece that's just very true to her personal style.\n\nThe publication noted that it was Markle's wish that her closest confidantes received something significant to remember the big day. Markle, now the Duchess of Cambridge, has been a fan of the California-based brand long before she became a royal.\n\nHer friend Benita Litt's two daughters, Rylan and Remi, were also given necklaces designed by Polny, the Windsor Heart Pendant Necklace and the Charlotte Bow Necklace.\n\nI have always wanted to create a petite line, and my daughter loves to wear my designs, explained Polny. So I decided to make Benita's girls some special pieces for their special day.
Meghan King is wishing she could speed up the divorce process.\n\nThe 36-year-old Real Housewives of Orange County alum opened up in a blog post on Thursday about her ongoing divorce from her estranged husband, former MLB player Jim Edmonds, partially blaming the extended timeline on coronavirus.\n\nIn the post, titled Your 2021 New Years Resolution, King said that she felt writing about her expectations for the new year felt so passé.\n\nGoals for the year don't work anymore because now we know those goals can be stolen from us just. like. that, she said in reference to the oddities that were brought about in 2020.\n\nMEGHAN KING REVEALS CORONAVIRUS DIAGNOSIS, SYMPTOMS INCLUDE 'EXTREME LETHARGY'\n\nThe former reality star then reflected on the goals she had set for 2020.\n\nMy main [goal] was to get divorced but here I am married as ever, she wrote. Dude, Covid courts won't even let me get divorced.\n\nShe added that her inability to carry out a task as unpleasant as divorce is rather on-brand for the year 2020.\n\nThe star said that she's feeling apathetic about 2021 after being dejected by 2020.\n\nMEGHAN KING ANNOUNCES SPLIT FROM CHRISTIAN SCHAUF, WISHES HIM 'ABUNDANCE OF LOVE AND HAPPINESS'\n\nI found out after my failed marriage that dejection and apathy are best friends, King explained, then revealing that it has taken her an entire 6 months ... to even think about another man.\n\nShe then dove into her own goals for the year, and while getting divorced wasn't on the list, what she's focusing on will certainly help her in the year ahead.\n\nHere's my new goals: listen to my intuition more, stop planning so rigidly, live my life out loud, and use less punctuation (this one's not going well so far), she wrote. Life is short but a lifetime is long. Please, love your neighbor and love your planet.

Luke Bryan and his wife, Caroline, have faced countless highs and lows in their 12-year-marriage, including a miscarriage. Caroline opens up about the loss in a revealing new podcast interview for Get Real.\n\nWhen Bo was born, he was a surprise, she says. I got pregnant when we had been married for six months. I was not expecting that at all, and then we had a miscarriage.\n\nLUKE BRYAN SAYS HE'S PROUD HIS SONS AND NEPHEW HAVE GOOD MANNERS\n\nMuch like the countless couples who find themselves facing the same strife, Caroline and Luke had to navigate through the pain.\n\nLuke didn't really know how to comfort me because, you know, he didn't get it, Caroline recalls. As girls, when you go through it and you lose it, there is a loss and it sucks and it hurts. It's awful physically. Guys, I don't think they know because they haven't felt it or seen it. For girls, it's a true loss and for guys, I don't know if it's a true loss.\n\nLuckily, a healthy son named Tate arrived just a few years later.\n\nLUKE BRYAN JOKES THAT HE HASN'T GIVEN BLAKE SHELTON HIS NEW PHONE NUMBER: 'I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT HIM'\n\nSometimes, I'm kidding but I will tell people (that Luke) and I ... that's the one easy part of our life, she says. If we want to get pregnant, I got pregnant instantly. We are so fertile I wash our underwear separately. I don't, but that's just what I say.\n\nIn true Caroline fashion, she laughs, but it's as if you can still hear the pain surrounding the miscarriage. He and I get pregnant very easily, she says. I've only lost one, but it does — it just sucks because it just hurts as a lady. It just hurts.\n\nLUKE BRYAN SAYS ELVIS PRESLEY INSPIRES HIS PERFORMANCES\n\nThe couple are now raising sons Bo and Tate, as well as their teenaged nephew, Til.
Tennessee authorities are investigating after Sherrilyn Kenyon, a best-selling fantasy author, accused her estranged husband of poisoning her.\n\nKenyon, known for her Dark Hunter series, said a recent medical test revealed she had high levels of lithium, tin, barium, platinum and thorium in her body, The Tennessean reported Tuesday. The chemicals caused hampered breathing, hair loss, broken teeth and nausea, she said.\n\nTAD CUMMINS, TENNESSEE TEACHER CONVICTED IN TEEN'S STUDENT'S KIDNAPPING, SENTENCED TO DECADES IN PRISON\n\n[The doctor] said there's no way this could have happened naturally or environmentally, she told the newspaper.\n\nKenyon, 53, accused her estranged husband, Lawrence Kenyon, and his assistant, Kerrie Ann Plump, of giving her tainted food over the last three years, the newspaper reported. Kenyon believes her husband is trying to kill her in order for him to inherit her estate. The two are also in the middle of a divorce.\n\nI thought I had a happy marriage. Compared to what I was used to, he was awesome, Kenyon told The Tennessean. No marriage is without problems, but it wasn't like my mother and father, where they threw furniture at each other.\n\nKenyon filed a civil lawsuit against her husband and assistant in Williamson County alleging assault by poisoning and other wrongful acts. She is asking for up to $20 million in damages, The Tennessean reported. The Willamson County Sheriff's Office also assigned a detective to look into her allegations.\n\nSean Aiello, Lawrence Kenyon's lawyer, dismissed the allegations, in a statement to Fox News.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWe trust that if any substantiated factual basis for the conspiracy claims alleged by Ms. Kenyon existed, she would have provided the same to law enforcement and charges would have been brought against Mr. Kenyon and Ms. Kenyon's employees. Williamson County, Tennessee has an excellent district attorney's office and incomparable law enforcement investigative agencies. To date, no agency has brought charges, and no investigation has resulted in criminal action against any individual, Aiello said in an emailed statement.\n\n​​​​Sherrilyn Kenyon is known for her urban fantasy and paranormal romance novels. Her books Devil May Cry and No Mercy were both featured on The New York Times' Best Sellers list.

When Val Kilmer was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2015, it was Cher who stood by his side.\n\nThe 60-year-old opened up about his health battle in a new memoir, titled I'm Your Huckleberry, which is scheduled to be released on April 21.\n\nIn the book, the actor opened up about how the singer, whom he dated in the 1980s, shined a light during his darkest days.\n\nAccording to Kilmer, the 73-year-old invited him to stay in her guest house while his health was declining.\n\nOne night, I suddenly awoke vomiting blood that covered the bed like a scene out of 'The Godfather,' Kilmer wrote, as reported by People magazine on Wednesday.\n\n'BIGGEST LOSER' HOST BOB HARPER SHARES THE ONE WORKOUT HE'S EAGER TO TRY DURING QUARANTINE\n\nLEE GREENWOOD REFLECTS ON 'GOD BLESS THE U.S.A.'

Only in Hollywood, right? Despite the fact that I was covered in blood, I caught her eye and bounced my brows like Groucho Marx. Hubba hubba. Cher was bashful to be busted but then couldn't help laughing out loud at the audacity.\n\nHere we were, joking about beauty and desire, while I looked like a stunt man from Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs' and, yes, while my life seemed to be in mortal danger, added Kilmer.

As a candidate for governor in 2015, Matt Bevin said he absolutely supported a Kentucky county clerk who stopped issuing marriage licenses because of her opposition to gay marriage.\n\nBut four years later, after a court ordered Kentucky taxpayers to pay more than $222,000 in legal fees for the gay and straight couples who sued, outside lawyers for now Gov. Bevin say former Rowan County clerk Kim Davis broke the law and taxpayers should not have to collectively bear the financial responsibility for Davis' intransigence.\n\nOnly Davis refused to comply with the law as was her obligation and as required by the oath of office she took, Bevin attorney Palmer G. Vance II wrote in a brief filed with the court.\n\nBevin has been a staunch supporter of Davis, who spent five days in jail for refusing a court order to issue marriage licenses following the historic U.S. Supreme Court ruling that effectively legalized gay marriage. Davis even switched parties, registering as a Republican because she said the Democratic Party abandoned her. But now, Davis and Bevin will oppose each other in federal court on Thursday as lawyers argue who should have to pay for the lawsuit that stemmed from Davis' actions.\n\nBevin and Davis, who lost her re-election bid in November, have asked the court not to award legal fees. But if they do, they disagree on who should pay. Davis' attorneys argue she acted on behalf of the state.\n\nBut in an interview with The Associated Press, Davis' attorney Mat Staver said he does not attribute those arguments to Bevin, but to the attorneys who represent him. Those attorneys, Palmer G. Vance II and William M. Lear Jr., are the same ones who represented former Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear on the case before Bevin took office.\n\n(Bevin) led the charge on that religious liberty accommodation, which is what we asked for from the very beginning, Staver said.\n\nBevin's in-house attorney, Steve Pitt, also noted the lawyers were hired by Beshear and said they have taken no position as to whether Ms. Davis acted unconstitutionally.\n\nGovernor Bevin does not believe that she has done so and continues to support Ms. Davis's actions, Pitt said. Our outside counsel have only argued, given the court's ruling, that if constitutional rights were violated, the taxpayers of Kentucky are not responsible to pay the ACLU's attorney fees.\n\nVance and Lear did not return a phone call seeking comment.\n\nThe case dates to the summer of 2015 when same-sex marriage became legal nationwide. At the time, the county clerk's name appeared on all marriage licenses in Kentucky. Davis, a devout Apostolic Christian who says gay marriage is contrary to her religious beliefs, viewed this as her endorsement of same-sex marriage. She stopped issuing all marriage licenses.\n\nSeveral gay and straight couples sued her with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union. A federal judge ordered her to issue the licenses, but Davis refused. The judge then found her in contempt of court and jailed her for five days. The case was resolved when the state legislature passed a law removing the names of county clerks from Kentucky marriage licenses.\n\nIn 2017, a federal judge ruled that Davis was acting as an agent for the state, making Kentucky taxpayers responsible for paying the legal fees of the gay and straight couples who filed suit. Bevin objected. His lawyers argue no one should have to pay the legal fees, because the gay and straight couples did not technically win the lawsuit since it was dismissed.\n\nHowever, Bevin's lawyers also argued if legal fees are awarded, either Rowan County or Davis herself should be responsible to pay them. Bevin's lawyer Palmer Vance II, noted the purpose of requiring losers to pay for attorneys' fees is to deter conduct that violates civil rights.\n\nThat purpose is not vindicated if the offending office (the Rowan County Clerk's Office) suffers no liability, Vance wrote. Indeed, there is little to deter the Rowan County Clerk's Office from developing policies that violate the Kentucky or United States Constitutions.\n\nJeffrey C. Mando, an attorney for Rowan County, dismissed that argument. He said clerks are elected officials and not county employees. He also added that all procedures relating to marriage licenses are governed solely by the state. He said that's why former Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear ordered county clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and it's why Bevin issued later issued an executive order removing clerks' names from the licenses.\n\nThe Commonwealth exercised a great deal of control over Davis, while the County enjoyed none, Mando wrote.

Jennifer Aniston couldn't help but laugh when her ex Brad Pitt made fun of his own high-profile dating life at the 77th Golden Globe Awards on Sunday.\n\nThe 56-year-old actor took home the award for best supporting actor in a motion picture for his part in the film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. During his acceptance speech, he cracked a joke about his dating life being incredibly potent media fodder, prompting a laugh from both the crowd and his ex.\n\nBRAD PITT CALLS JENNIFER ANISTON 'A GOOD FRIEND' AT GOLDEN GLOBE AWARDS\n\nI wanted to bring my mom, but I couldn't because, any woman I stand next to, they say I'm dating… and it would just be awkward, the star joked.\n\nThe camera was fixed on Aniston, 50, who was nominated -- but lost -- for her role on Apple TV's The Morning Show. She could be seen laughing at the joke along with her co-star Reese Witherspoon and others.\n\nThe two seem to be particularly friendly as of late and even went to the same post-show after-party, according to EOnline. Although they reportedly didn't spend too much time together at the party, they were spotted briefly interacting in a very non-romantic way.\n\nPitt and Aniston were married for nearly five years from 2000, to 2005 before they broke up and he began a relationship with Angelina Jolie. However, despite the split, the duo have remained civil over the years. Speaking to Entertainment Tonight on the Globes red carpet Sunday, he even commented on their friendship.\n\nBRAD PITT ATTENDS JENNIFER ANISTON'S CHRISTMAS PARTY: REPORTS\n\nI'll run into Jen, she's a good friend.

Kim Kardashian is at a crossroads.\n\nMultiple sources have said the reality TV star has been struggling in her decision of whether or not to end her nearly seven-year marriage to Kanye West, People magazine reported on Wednesday.\n\nKim and Kanye's marriage is beyond repair, an insider close to the family told the outlet. Kim is over Kanye's chaos, and at this point, she just wants to focus on the kids and her own life.\n\nOne source revealed that despite social media posts depicting a seemingly happy union, the 40-year-old has endured a difficult year in her relationship with the rapper, 43.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN, SISTERS MARK LAST DAY OF FILMING 'KEEPING UP WITH THE KARDASHIANS': 'OFFICIALLY SOBBING'\n\nIf I had to say the final straw, I believe it was a combination of the presidential run and his Twitter rants, explained the source to the outlet. It created havoc at home. And though Kim is well aware of his issues, and tried to help him, she realized it was futile.\n\nKim knows what she wants to do with her life and Kanye is constantly all over the place, said a pal of the couple. She isn't in a rush to file for divorce. But it is on her mind.\n\nThe Keeping Up With the Kardashians star has remained in Los Angeles with the couple's four children while the Grammy winner allegedly prefers to live in his Wyoming ranch, Page Six previously reported.\n\nA source recently claimed to the outlet that divorce is imminent for the two.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN ATTENDS BIBLE STUDY WITH SISTER KOURTNEY AMID RUMORS OF 'IMMINENT' DIVORCE FROM KANYE WEST\n\nThey are keeping it low-key but they are done, the source further claimed. Kim has hired Laura Wasser and they are in settlement talks.\n\nWasser is a well-known divorce attorney in Hollywood and frequently oversees starry splits.\n\nRepresentatives for Kardashian, West and Wasser did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\n\nThe couple tied the knot in May 2014 and share four children: North, 7, Saint, 5, Chicago, 2, and Psalm, who will turn 2 in May.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN REPORTED DIVORCE FROM KANYE WEST WOULD BE SUPPORTED BY LATE FATHER, FORMER NANNY SAYS\n\nTrouble in paradise between the two was first reported over the summer when West announced his candidacy for president in the 2020 election.\n\nDuring what Kardashian later implied was an episode brought on by his bipolar disorder, West brought up the possibility of divorcing his wife at a campaign event while claiming they considered aborting their first child.\n\nEven if my wife wants to divorce me after this speech, she brought North into the world even when I didn't want to, West told a crowd while crying, according to People magazine.\n\nIn a since-deleted tweet, the Power rapper also claimed that he'd been trying to divorce Kardashian ever since she attended a prison reform event with Meek Mill in 2018.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN, KANYE WEST: A LOOK BACK AT THEIR RELATIONSHIP\n\nIn the same rant, he also shaded Kardashian's past Playboy spread and claimed that the reality star's mother, Kris Jenner, was no longer allowed to see his children.\n\nHe later apologized for the Twitter rant but the ordeal reportedly left Kardashian furious.\n\nIn July, it was reported that the couple had been considering divorce for weeks and that Kardashian and her famous family were shielding her children from their father's public outbursts. Later that month, the stars were spotted having an emotional conversation in Wyoming.\n\nThings seemed to be better between the two as Kardashian showed support for her husband at one of his Sunday Service events in August and was also seen laughing with West in a family video that same month.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN DETAILS HER NEW DOC, SAYS SHE'S NOT WORRIED ABOUT JUSTICE REFORM CRITICS\n\nLast month, however, it seems things may have taken a turn for the worse as reports surfaced that the two were leading separate lives and had been spending a lot of time apart.\n\nThe marriage is West's first and Kardashian's third. She was previously married to Damon Thomas from 2000 to 2004 and to basketball pro Kris Humphries from 2011 to 2013, though she filed for divorce after just 72 days of marriage.\n\nKardashian and West began dating in 2012 while she was still legally married and became engaged just months after her divorce was finalized.\n\nKardashian has voiced interest in becoming a lawyer and has devoted a relatively large amount of attention to prison reform. She's recently visited death row inmates Julius Jones and Brandon Bernard, even calling on President Trump to commute the latter's execution.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKardashian became Hollywood royalty alongside her mother Kris and sisters: Kourtney, 41, Khloé, 36, Kendall Jenner, 25, and Kylie Jenner, 23, as well as her 33-year-old brother, Rob.\n\nSeveral prominent figures have been a part of the famous family as well, including Caitlyn Jenner, Blac Chyna, Scott Disick and Tristan Thompson.\n\nWest rose to prominence via his rap music and has been regarded as an innovator in the industry.

Do you feel lonely? You are not alone.\n\nOne in 10 Americans say they feel isolated from those around them all or most of the time; Half-a-million Japanese report suffering from social isolation and the United Kingdom appointed a minister for loneliness -- the first of its kind -- prompting leaders at the Davos World Economic Forum to discuss the growing global health concern last week.\n\nOne U.S. scientist says she might have the answer -- in the form of a pill.\n\nNURSE TRAINING FOR LONDON MARATHON AFTER DONATING KIDNEY TO STRANGER\n\nStephanie Cacioppo, director of the Brain Dynamics Lab at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, is researching a pill that she hopes will prevent at-risk individuals from experiencing chronic loneliness -- an undertaking that has been met with both interest and criticism in the scientific world.\n\nBeing lonely increases the risk of dying earlier by 26 percent, which is actually more than obesity, Cacioppo told Fox News. Loneliness is widespread and contagious. It is an epidemic.\n\nIn response to critics who cite the nation's increasing dependency on prescription drug medication, Cacioppo says this: A quick-fix might be helpful if it's going to prevent a suicide. And it is in no way a substitute for healthy social connections.\n\nCacioppo defines loneliness as the difference between what you want in a relationship and what you have in a relationship and notes that being alone is not necessarily synonymous with being lonely.\n\nNYC WOMAN SUES HOSPITAL AFTER REPORTED CONFUSION OVER END OF LIFE SUPPORT\n\nIt's all about how we perceive our relationships, Cacioppo said. You can feel extremely lonely in a marriage or among friends or in a family.\n\nThe lonely brain also believes it has more foes than friends, she said. And it constantly surveils for potential threats or dangers.\n\nCacioppo is focusing on normalizing the levels of allopregnanolone -- a naturally produced neurosteroid in the body -- that as a result could address some of the loneliness-related biological changes in the brain. The pill, she says, is different from commonly used anti-depressants in that we are targeting loneliness more specifically.\n\nFinancial stress, living alone, unhappy family life and a lack of communal bonds are among the leading causes of loneliness. Loneliness has an equivalent risk factor to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, according to a widely-cited 2010 study by Dr. Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a professor at Brigham Young University.\n\nWe see a peak of loneliness of individuals who tend to feel this social pressure to be connected, said Cacioppo, noting that feelings of loneliness increase during certain times of the year, like during holidays such as New Year's or Valentine's Day, when we have the biggest societal expectations.\n\nResearchers also note that social media presents a double-edged sword -- it can at times help us feel connected and at others, lead to greater feelings of isolation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSocial media tried to promote social gathering but in reality it might increase the feelings of loneliness, Cacioppo said. It all depends how we use it. If you use social media to only watch others having fun, you might feel extremely lonely. But if you use it as a way to talk to your own friends and be really authentic and then schedule face-to-face meetings then you may feel less lonely.\n\nOn her website, Gretchen Rubin, author of The Happiness Project, outlines practical steps to fight off loneliness that don't involve medication. Making a habit of nurturing others, notes Rubin -- like teaching a class or volunteering -- can lead to a greater sense of purpose and self-worth. It's just as important to give support as to get support, she writes. Other behaviors include seeking out a group -- such a book club or workout class -- as well as improving an individual's quality of sleep.\n\nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline number: 800-273-TALK

Thankful for the laughs, kisses, talks, hikes, love and care.\n\nPratt previously told the Associated Press he's not shy about discussing his faith at awards shows and social media.\n\nThat kind of message, it might not be for everybody, he explained. But there is a group of people for whom that message is designed. And nothing files my soul more than to think that maybe some kid watching that would say, 'Hey, I've been thinking about praying. Let me try that out.'\n\nPratt added faith became important to him when he was 19 and he met a man who was sent by God. Pratt also declared he's unashamed to share his Christianity in Hollywood and has never been ridiculed about it.\n\nI think that there's this narrative that exists out there that Hollywood is anti-Christian or anti-religious, but it's just not the case, he said. They are kind of not anti-anything. … I've never had anyone try to same me, to my face. Maybe they go say it behind my back. But if that's the case, go ahead. You can say whatever you want about me — to my face or behind my back. I'm not going to change.\n\nPeople magazine previously reported Schwarzenegger was raised Catholic but has been attending nondenominational Christian churches for the past few years. She has posted religious verses on social media.\n\nFox News' Caleb Parke, Gerren Keith Gaynor and the Associated Press contributed to this report.
Jennifer Garner is opening up about what it was like starting a family with Ben Affleck.\n\nThe 46-year-old actress is a featured columnist in WSJ. Magazine's March Women's Style Issue, in which she was asked to weigh in on the topic of adaptation. Throughout the piece, Garner references her ex-husband, as well as the three children they share, Violet, 13, Seraphina, 10, and Samuel, 6.\n\nHow do you adapt your career to your life? That's a big question, Garner writes. Becoming someone who is well known requires an enormous adaptation. Who am I now? How do I go through the world? Then there's having children and, in my case, a career that's a very selfish one. The combination of those things is the largest adaptation of all.\n\nJennifer Garner Has 'Gotten Serious' With John Miller and Sees Ben Affleck Less Frequently, Source Says\n\nWhen I had kids, I started considering how jobs worked for my family, she adds. How much am I going to ask of my partner and kids? What's worth it and what isn't? Something Ben and I used to say to each other all the time is, 'We have to adapt.'\n\nGarner continues on, bringing up the fact that she and Affleck were constantly surrounded by the paparazzi.\n\nThere were so many things you wouldn't expect, she explains. We'd be left alone more at Disneyland than we would at a park in Santa Monica. But if you love something, you'll do whatever you need to do.\n\nBen Affleck and Jennifer Garner Chat Together After Family Church Service: Pics\n\nGarner and Affleck tied the knot in 2005. But after 10 years of marriage, the two announced in June 2015 that they were separating, and finalized their divorce in late 2018. Since then, they have remained amicable for their three children.\n\nA source told ET earlier this month that Garner has been seeing Affleck less frequently, however, since her relationship with John Miller has gotten serious.\n\nJennifer Garner Cleans Out Her Junk Drawer With Marie Kondo's Inspiration\n\nJen feels so lucky to have met John and their relationship only continues to grow, the source said. They both wanted to take it slow, but it has gotten serious and they couldn't be happier.\n\n[Garner and Miller are] in a true honeymoon phase in their relationship and while they've spoken about a future together, neither of them are ready to plan a wedding or get engaged, the source added. Jen has no interest in jumping into marriage quickly. She only just solidified her divorce so right now she just loves all their time together.
Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones are still head over heels for each other.\n\nThe 51-year-old actress posted a new photo on social media kissing her longtime love, 76, as they enjoyed the sunset on a beach.\n\nI can express no kinder sign of love, than this kind kiss William Shakespeare....... 💋, Zeta-Jones captioned the photo.\n\nThe Oscar winners celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary in November. The pair share two kids, a son Dylan, 20, and a daughter, Carys, 17.\n\nMICHAEL DOUGLAS, CATHERINE ZETA-JONES REMEMBER THE LATE KIRK DOUGLAS: 'THERE WASN'T ANYONE LIKE HIM'\n\nZeta-Jones told People magazine in July that they won't be celebrating the milestone with any big party this year.\n\nNot that I'm a big party fan anyway, she said. It would be nice to get all our friends together in one space, but we're not doing that until we're completely out of the woods. So I will raise my mask and let my husband passionately kiss me, then I will put it firmly back on.\n\nThe longtime couple just became grandparents again. Douglas' son from a previous marriage, Cameron, welcomed a son named Ryder with his longtime partner Viviane Thibes. They are already parents to 3-year-old Lua.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Wall Street star commented on his son's social media announcement. So happy for Vivian and you. Don't think Lua is sure about this yet! What a holiday present.\n\nThe Zorro actress added, Lua's Face! like.....'whatever..........' Hilarious! Congrats!!
The Blurred Lines muse left little to the imagination.\n\nEmily Ratajkowski, who isn't shy about flaunting her famous figure to her 21 million followers, took to Instagram wearing a white bikini paired with a matching high-waisted thong bottom.\n\nThe 27-year-old married model and actress stood in front of a three-way mirror which expertly captured all of her angles.\n\nASHLEY GRAHAM'S SECRET TO A LASTING MARRIAGE IS 'JUST HAVE SEX ALL THE TIME'\n\nRatajkowski did not caption the jaw-dropping photo. Instead, she just credited the swimwear brand Inamorata, which she launched in late 2017.\n\nUK's Independent previously reported the collection, which is inspired by vintage issues of Sports Illustrated, as well as Helmut Newton photographs, is a medley of reworked '70s prints enriched by Instagram-friendly silhouettes.\n\nRatajkowski, who calls herself a beach baby, said it felt natural to create Inamorata.\n\nI grew up in San Diego and I basically wore a bathing suit every day on the beach, she told Vogue at the time of the launch. When I was 16, sometimes I would literally wake up, not put on any clothes, and I'd put on a bathing suit and get coffees and burritos for the day.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBefore Ratajkowski took on the role of designer, she told Allure for their August 2017 issue that she wanted to change the way the world views sexuality onscreen.\n\nIt really bothers me that people are so offended by breasts, she said at the time. That's when I realized how f----- our culture is. When we see breasts, we don't think of beauty and femininity. We think of vulgar, oversexualized images.\n\nRatajkowski, the daughter of a former art teacher and a retired English professor, also revealed she identifies as a feminist and believes every woman should celebrate their bodies.\n\nTo me, any expression that is empowered and is your own as a woman is feminist, she explained. If a woman decides to dress sexy, it doesn't mean she's not a feminist. [We] should be doing things for ourselves. If that is the woman's choice, and it makes her feel good, then that's great. Good for her.\n\nI found my sexuality and my identity, she added. I found empowerment through that.\n\nBut Ratajkowski credited her thriving modeling career to her ability to observe the world around her and get audiences to really pay attention.\n\nWe don't really look at things, said Ratajkowski. Especially now with the Internet and our phones. To look at something and take it in and really understand… it's a huge gift.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, appeared to accuse fellow Democrats of stoking religious bigotry this week for their questioning of a Trump judicial pick's Knights of Columbus membership.\n\nWhile I oppose the nomination of Brian Buescher to the U.S. District Court in Nebraska, I stand strongly against those who are fomenting religious bigotry, citing as disqualifiers Buescher's Catholicism and his affiliation with the Knights of Columbus, Gabbard said in an op-ed for The Hill on Tuesday.\n\nSens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, raised concerns about lawyer Buescher's membership in the Catholic organization as part of the Senate Judiciary Committee's review of his nomination by President Trump to sit on the U.S. District Court in Nebraska.\n\nDEMS CHALLENGE TRUMP JUDICIAL NOMINEE OVER KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS MEMBERSHIP\n\nAs first reported by the Catholic News Agency, Hirono asked whether his membership in the Knights of Columbus would prevent him from hearing cases fairly and impartially and, if confirmed, whether he would end his membership in the charitable organization.\n\nThe Knights of Columbus has taken a number of extreme positions, Hirono said in the questionnaire. For example, it was reportedly one of the top contributors to California's Proposition 8 campaign to ban same-sex marriage.\n\nHarris, in her questions to the nominee, called the Knights of Columbus an all-male society and asked the Nebraska lawyer if he was aware that the group was anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage when he joined. The Catholic Church has opposed both abortion and gay marriage for centuries.\n\nThe Knights of Columbus, which was founded in the U.S. in 1882 as a society for working-class and immigrant Catholics, said the questions were a reminder of America's sad history of anti-Catholic bigotry.\n\nWe were extremely disappointed to see that one's commitment to Catholic principles through membership in the Knights of Columbus—a charitable organization that adheres to and promotes Catholic teachings—would be viewed as a disqualifier from public service in this day and age, a spokesperson said.\n\nIn her op-ed, Gabbard noted that the standard her fellow Democrats were using would have disqualified members of the Kennedy family from serving.\n\nIf Buescher is 'unqualified' because of his Catholicism and affiliation with the Knights of Columbus, then President John F. Kennedy, and the 'liberal lion of the Senate' Ted Kennedy would have been 'unqualified' for the same reasons, she said.\n\nDEMS ACCUSED OF RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY FOR QUESTIONING TRUMP COURT PICK'S KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS TIES\n\nShe also noted that Article 6 of the Constitution says there shall be no religious test for any seeking to serve.\n\nThe party that worked so hard to convince people that Catholics and Knights of Columbus like Al Smith and John F. Kennedy could be both good Catholics and good public servants shows an alarming disregard of its own history in making such attacks today, she added.\n\nA spokesman for Hirono pointed Fox News to a statement in Hawaii NewsNow, in which he said Gabbard was expressing a misguided opinion.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSenator Hirono asks all judicial nominees – particularly those who have expressed very strong personal ideological views in conflict with Supreme Court precedent – if they can be fair. She asked Mr. Buescher, who has a clear record of anti-choice activism, whether he could separate his personal beliefs from decisions he would make if confirmed for a lifetime appointment on the federal bench, spokesperson Will Dempster said.\n\nOver the past two years, the Senator has been attacked by right wing ideologues for her examination of Donald Trump's ideologically-driven nominees to the courts. It is unfortunate that Congresswoman Gabbard based her misguided opinion on the far-right wing manipulation of these straightforward questions.
Jenny Graubart in 2015\n\nI'm starting 2019 without my mother, Jenny Graubart, who died a week ago. And I'm thinking about the valuable lesson she taught me about life – not with words, but by the way she lived.\n\nMy mother was 82 and at the end she was just a shadow of the strong and vibrant woman she once was. She had Alzheimer's disease for years and had suffered a stroke that limited her mobility. But even though she was badly impaired, she never lost her positive attitude.\n\nMy mom never had it easy. She was born in Belgium in 1936 to Jewish parents who had left Poland to find a better life. When World War II begin in 1939 with the Nazi invasion of Poland, her father recognized that it would be wise to get out of Europe.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MICHAEL LEVIN: THE REAL MEANING OF YOM KIPPUR\n\nMy grandparents and my mother fled first to France, where my aunt was born, and then Spain. They sailed to Havana, Cuba where they spent the next six years, fortunate to escape the Holocaust. They were a close-knit family, lacking the material basics we take for granted, but always optimistic.\n\nIn 1946, after the war ended, the family settled in New York, where my mother grew up. That year, she saw my grandmother receive a postcard from the Red Cross informing her that her parents and six siblings had all been murdered by the Nazis.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMy mother says that my grandmother cried for one day and then never mentioned it again.\n\nThe family adapted to the new land. At age 10, my mother was learning English – her fourth language after French, Spanish and Yiddish.\n\nMy mom married and raised me and my two sisters, but her life didn't get any easier. Her father was murdered in a mob hit. Her marriage disintegrated. We three children had our own struggles.\n\nThe people of my mother's generation were made of tough stuff. They didn't let small things take them down, and they didn't let even the most horrific, unimaginable events cause them to break their stride.\n\nAnd yet, through all of that, I can remember my mother being depressed only once, right around the time of her divorce. The rest of the time, she maintained not just a positive attitude but a truly happy one.\n\nMy mother came from a world – or at least a family – where people didn't wallow in their problems and mope around. They didn't allow their life stories of misfortune – the narrative they had constructed about Why me? or Why now? – overwhelm and them and drown them in misery.\n\nMy mother made a new life for herself after her divorce. She had boyfriends. She had fun. She studied French literature in a class that she attended for years. She would spend summers at Oxford University in England taking courses. She would go to the U.S. Open and watch the tennis. She was always up for anything.\n\nAnd in her final days she lived peacefully, calmly, with no drama and no apparent fear.\n\nThe people of my mother's generation were made of tough stuff. They didn't let small things take them down, and they didn't let even the most horrific, unimaginable events cause them to break their stride.\n\nInstead, as my mother said, they pulled up their socks and kept going.\n\nSo if you ask me what the main lesson my mother taught me was – aside from love and family and friendship and culture and optimism – it's this: Don't let your story take you down.\n\nEverybody goes through something hard in life, or many such somethings. But we don't have to be defined, or debilitated, by those events.\n\nI'm sure there are people out there who have been through more challenges and more suffering than my mother went through. But I sure know a lot of people who are pretty miserable in life, even though they have been through a whole lot less than my mother.\n\nYou don't have to deny the existence of your story, or minimize its power, unfairness, or overall effect on you or your loved ones.\n\nBut the one thing that my mother taught me and everyone she knew is that you don't have to give your story – your negative narrative – so much power that it transcends the love, the beauty, the kindness, and the joy that life can still afford.\n\nIn the end, my mother was surrounded by love and by positive people. And you know why?\n\nShe saw to that.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY MICHAEL LEVIN
Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, on Sunday decided to take a shot at the president – calling out Donald Trump and blaming the president for stirring a racial divide in the country, amid the mounting scandal over Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's medical school yearbook photo.\n\nBrown – who is mulling a 2020 presidential bid – said during an interview on NBC's Meet the Press that Trump has built his political career on playing racial politics and that his business empire, and that of Trump's father, employed widespread housing discrimination.\n\nWe have a president who's a racist, Brown said. He built his political career knowing what he was doing, questioning the legitimacy and the birthplace of the president of the United States. I know early there have been all kinds of news reports about what he did early in his career with housing.\n\nNORTHAM APOLOGIZES FOR MEDICAL SCHOOL YEARBOOK PHOTO WITH BLACKFACE, KKK ROBE\n\nBrown's comments come amid controversy over a photograph in the Virginia governor's 1984 medical school yearbook page that featured a man in blackface and a second person in a Ku Klux Klan hood and robe. While Northam on Friday apologized for appearing in a photograph, on Saturday the governor reversed course and said he wasn't in the picture after all.\n\nBrown has been one of Trump's biggest critics in the Senate and has been testing the waters ahead of the 2020 primary season.\n\nDuring a stop in the early caucus state of Iowa last week, Brown argued that working-class voters who backed Trump have been betrayed, notably by the Republican-signed tax bill that benefited wealthy Americans more.\n\nIt's not just the middle class, it's the broad spectrum of people who work hard and just simply don't get a break these days, Brown told the audience, who turned out in sub-zero weather in the town of 3,800 where manufacturing jobs have sharply waned over the past decade.\n\nVIRGINIA GOV. NORTHAM FACES BACKLASH FOR COMMENTS ON 3RD-TRIMESTER ABORTION BILL: 'MORALLY REPUGNANT'\n\nLike Ohio, where Trump won in 2016 on the strength of working-class voters, Brown's other stops on his three-day Iowa itinerary underscore his central argument as a potential 2020 presidential contender: That he understands economically challenged Midwestern voters who helped make Trump president.\n\nI represent a state where Trump's promises of bringing back jobs and re-industrialization and opening up new factories have clearly just fallen flat, Brown said on Sunday's appearance on Meet the Press. He's done nothing about these promises, so I know a whole lot about a president over promising and breaking those promises and selling out and betraying workers.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBrown has said some Democrats wrongly divide the party into its liberal base and working-class voters, chiefly those non-college-educated white voters who lifted Trump not just in Ohio, but also in swing states Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nDuring more than 25 years in Congress, Brown has championed worker-friendly trade and tax policies. He is also a close ally of labor unions, and has also supported liberal causes such as abortion rights, same-sex marriage and opposition to the Iraq war.\n\nBrown attributes his re-election to a third Senate term last year to the resonance of a message to workers who feel left behind, while also embracing his party's liberal base, including its growing racial and ethnic diversity.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
British actor Albert Finney, known for his starring roles on Tom Jones, Erin Brockovich and the James Bond thriller Skyfall, has died at age 82.\n\nThe actor's family confirmed Finney's death to the Associated Press on Friday morning saying he passed away peacefully after a short illness with those closest to him by his side.\n\nFinney was a rare star who managed to avoid the Hollywood limelight for more than five decades after bursting to international fame in 1963 in the title role of Tom Jones.\n\nThe film gained him the first of five Oscar nominations. Others followed for Murder on the Orient Express, ''The Dresser, ''Under the Volcano and Erin Brockovich.\n\nALBERT FINNEY, BRITISH ACTOR DEAD AT 82, HAILED AS 'KING OF KITCHEN SINK' AND 'ACTING GENIUS'\n\nIn later years he brought authority to action movies, including the James Bond thriller Skyfall and two of the Bourne films. He also memorably played Daddy Warbucks in the 1982 film Annie.\n\nDisplaying the versatility of a virtuoso, Finney portrayed Winston Churchill, Pope John Paul II, a southern American lawyer, an Irish gangster and an 18th-century rogue, among dozens of other roles over the years. There was no Albert Finney-type character that he returned to again and again.\n\nIn one of his final roles, as the gruff Scotsman Kincade in Skyfall, he shared significant screen time with Daniel Craig as Bond and Judi Dench as M, turning the film's final scenes into a master class of character acting.\n\nBRITISH COMEDIAN JEREMY HARDY DIES FROM CANCER AT AGE 57\n\nAlthough Finney rarely discussed his personal life, he told the Manchester Evening News in 2012 that he had been treated for kidney cancer for five years, undergoing surgery and chemotherapy.\n\nHe also explained why he had not attended the Academy Awards even when he was nominated for the film world's top prize.\n\nIt seems silly to go over there and beg for an award, he told the paper.\n\nThe son of a bookmaker, Finney was born May 9, 1936, and grew up in northern England on the outskirts of Manchester. He took to the stage at an early age, doing a number of school plays and — despite his lack of connections and his working-class roots — earning a place at London's prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts.\n\nHe credited the headmaster of his local school, Eric Simms, for recommending that he attend the renowned drama school.\n\n'YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS' ACTOR KRISTOFF ST. JOHN DEAD AT 52\n\nHe's the reason I am an actor, Finney said in 2012.\n\nFinney made his first professional turn at 19 and appeared in several TV movies, including She Stoops to Conquer in 1956 and The Claverdon Road Job the following year.\n\nSoon some critics were hailing him as the next Laurence Olivier — a commanding presence who would light up the British stage. Britain's pre-eminent theater critic, Kenneth Tynan, called the young Finney a smoldering young Spencer Tracy and warned established star Richard Burton about his prowess. In London, Finney excelled both in Shakespeare's plays and in more contemporary offerings.\n\nStill, the young man seemed determined not to pursue conventional Hollywood stardom. After an extensive screen test, he turned down the chance to play the title role in director David Lean's epic Lawrence of Arabia, clearing the way for fellow RADA graduate Peter O'Toole to take what became a career-defining role.\n\nBut stardom came to Finney anyway in Tom Jones, where he won over audiences worldwide with his good-natured, funny and sensual portrayal of an 18th-century English rogue.\n\nThat was the role that introduced Finney to American audiences, and few would forget the lusty, blue-eyed leading man who helped the film win a Best Picture Oscar. Finney also earned his first Best Actor nomination for his efforts and the smash hit turned him into a Hollywood leading man.\n\n'GREMLINS,' 'TERMINATOR' STAR DICK MILLER DEAD AT 90\n\nDirector Tony Richardson said his goal for Tom Jones was simply to produce an enjoyable romp.\n\nNo social significance for once, he said. No contemporary problems to lay bare. Just a lot of colorful, sexy fun.\n\nFinney had the good fortune to receive a healthy percentage of the profits from the surprise hit, giving him financial security while he was still in his 20s.\n\nThis is a man from very humble origins who became rich when he was very young, said Quentin Falk, author of an unauthorized biography of Finney. It brought him a lot of side benefits. He's a man who likes to live as well as to act. He enjoys his fine wine and cigars. He's his own man, I find that rather admirable.\n\nThe actor maintained a healthy skepticism about the British establishment and even turned down a knighthood when it was offered, declining to become Sir Albert. Finney once said he did not believe in such honors.\n\nMaybe people in America think being a 'Sir' is a big deal, he said. But I think we should all be misters together. I think the 'Sir' thing slightly perpetuates one of our diseases in England, which is snobbery. And it also helps keep us 'quaint,' which I'm not a great fan of.\n\nJAMES INGRAM, R&B STAR AND 'ONE HUNDRED WAYS' SINGER, DEAD AT 66\n\nInstead of cashing in by taking lucrative film roles after Tom Jones, Finney took a long sabbatical, traveling slowly through the United States, Mexico and the Pacific islands, then returned to the London stage to act in Shakespeare productions and other plays. He won wide acclaim and many awards before returning to film in 1967 to co-star with Audrey Hepburn in Two for the Road.\n\nThis was to be a familiar pattern, with Finney alternating between film work and stage productions in London and New York.\n\nFinney tackled Charles Dickens in Scrooge in 1970, then played Agatha Christie's super-sleuth Hercule Poirot in Murder on the Orient Express — earning his second Best Actor nomination— and even played a werewolf hunter in the cult film Wolfen in 1981.\n\nHe earned more Best Actor Oscar nominations for his roles in the searing marital drama Shoot the Moon in 1982, co-starring with Diane Keaton, and The Dresser in 1983. He was nominated again in 1984 for his role as a self-destructive alcoholic in director John Huston's Under the Volcano.\n\nEven during this extraordinary run of great roles, and his critically acclaimed television portrayal of the pope, Finney's life was not chronicled in People Weekly or other magazines, although the British press was fascinated with his marriage to the sultry French film star Anouk Aimee.\n\nLOUISA MORITZ, ACTRESS AND BILL COSBY ACCUSER, DEAD AT 72\n\nHe played in a series of smaller, independent films for a number of years before returning to prominence in 2000 as a southern lawyer in the film Erin Brockovich, which starred Julia Roberts. The film helped introduce Finney to a new generation of moviegoers, and the chemistry between the aging lawyer and his young, aggressive assistant earned him yet another Oscar nomination, this time for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nHis work also helped propel Roberts to her first Best Actress Oscar. Still, Finney declined to attend the Academy Awards ceremony — possibly damaging his chances at future wins by snubbing Hollywood's elite.\n\nHe went on to star in director Tim Burton's Big Fish and portrayed Britain's wartime leader, Winston Churchill, in The Gathering Storm.\n\nFinney also tried his hand at directing and producing and played a vital role in sustaining British theater.\n\nDetails of survivors and funeral arrangements were not immediately available.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
This is a rush transcript from Fox News Sunday, February 16, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nCHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Chris Wallace.\n\nAttorney General William Barr takes an unusual public swipe at President Trump over his criticism of the Justice Department.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me.\n\nWALLACE: The attorney general, who's been a close ally of Mr. Trump, says he won't be bullied, while the president says he has the right to intervene even in cases like the one involving his long-time advisor, Roger Stone.\n\nNow, House Democrats have Barr squarely in their sights.\n\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Remember, the attorney general can be impeached.\n\nWALLACE: We'll discuss the fallout with counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway. It's a FOX News Sunday exclusive.\n\nThen, there are two new front runners in the Democratic race.\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're getting the establishment just a little bit nervous.\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I ask you to join us in taking a stand for a better tomorrow.\n\nWALLACE: We'll ask Mayor Pete Buttigieg about his pitch to voters in Nevada, South Carolina, and the Super Tuesday states.\n\nPlus, we'll ask our Sunday panel about Michael Bloomberg's rise in the polls, and accusations of sexism in the workplace.\n\nAnd our Power Player of the Week, a fixture of the late '90s alt rock scene goes classical.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: And it's about un-formalizing the symphony orchestra in a way that doesn't intimidate people.\n\nWALLACE: All, right now, on FOX News Sunday.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.\n\nEver since William Barr became attorney general, critics have complained he acts more like the president's personal lawyer than the nation's top law enforcement officer. But this week, Barr said Mr. Trump's comments and tweets about criminal cases make it impossible for him to do his job.\n\nMeanwhile, prosecutors dropped a tough sentencing recommendation for a long time Trump advisor Roger Stone, but decided not to pursue criminal charges against a favorite Trump target, former FBI official Andrew McCabe.\n\nIn a moment, we'll speak with counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway.\n\nBut first, let's bring in Mark Meredith, reporting from the president's retreat at Mar-a-Lago with the latest -- Mark.\n\nMARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, the White House as the president still has confidence and faith in his attorney general even has multiple congressional Democrats are calling for Bill Barr to resign, amid multiple controversies facing his department.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nBARR: I'm not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody.\n\nMEREDITH: Attorney General Bill Barr is raising eyebrows for selecting an outside prosecutor to review the case against former national security advisor Michael Flynn.\n\nIn 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, recently asked to withdraw that plea and is still awaiting sentencing. Meantime, the Justice Department says it's no longer pursuing a case against former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.\n\nANDREW MCCABE, FORMER FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR: It is an absolute disgrace that they took two years before they finally drew the obvious conclusion.\n\nMEREDITH: President Trump repeatedly criticized McCabe over his role in the Russia probe and tweeted Saturday that McCabe, quote, authorized media links to advance personal interest.\n\nLast week, the president praised the Justice Department for changing the way it's handling the case against former Trump associate Roger Stone. Stone was convicted in November on multiple counts of lying to Congress. Prosecutors plan to ask for a 7 to 9-year sentence, but senior Justice officials overruled their recommendation and planned to push for a shorter sentence.\n\nBARR: I have not discussed the Roger Stone case at the White House.\n\nMEREDITH: Democrats don't buy it and are calling for Barr to step down.\n\nWARREN: Everything that Bill Barr is about right now is just about loyalty to Donald Trump. And we just can't have that. He should not be the attorney general.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nMEREDITH: Barr will be forced to explain some of his decisions. He's expected to head up to the House Judiciary Committee for a hearing at the end of March -- Chris.\n\nWALLACE: Mark Meredith reporting from Mar-a-Lago -- Mark, thank you.\n\nAnd joining us now, counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway.\n\nWelcome back to FOX News Sunday.\n\nKELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: Good morning.\n\nWALLACE: What does the president think of the decision to drop the criminal investigation of former FBI official Andrew McCabe? Does he think that McCabe should be prosecuted?\n\nCONWAY: Well, the president recognizes, as many people do, that it feels like there's a two -- two-tiered criminal justice system. If your President Trump or people associated with him, this prosecution would have gone one way.\n\nFor you're someone like Andy McCabe, who wasn't just a garden-variety FBI agent just starting out, he was the number two and for a while the acting director of the whole FBI after Comey was fired. No one, including Andy McCabe, his FBI counsel, Lisa Page, familiar name, has denied that he lied, and he didn't lie once, he lied multiple times.\n\nWhat did he lie about? Well, on about October -- at the end of October, 2016, he authorized a leak to Devin Bartlett, then a reporter at The Wall Street Journal. And the leak was about the ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.\n\nSo he authorizes the leak and then he lies about even knowing about the leak, then he is able to correct that on tape in and on the record, under oath interview in July --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCONWAY: This is important -- July 2017, and lies again.\n\nAnd so, this is somebody -- he will still be a serial liar whether he's prosecuted or not --\n\nWALLACE: Well, here, let's get to the bottom line, does the president think --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: -- does the president think the McCabe case should be reopened and he should be prosecuted?\n\nCONWAY: The president appreciates the fact that this Department of Justice and Attorney General Barr works on any number of issues at this White House that doesn't get any kind of coverage. Sanctuary cities, Texas versus Azar --\n\nWALLACE: Please answer my question.\n\nCONWAY: -- trafficking drugs, humans and guns, for example. Any number of issues you work on with the Department of Justice, this is small potatoes. But people see it from what it is.\n\nWALLACE: The McCabe case is small potatoes?\n\nCONWAY: He is small potatoes. He will always be seen as a serial liar and a leaker, as will those who covered for him.\n\nAnd what we're most concerned about is making sure that the 35,000 rank- and-file FBI men and women who bravely do their job every day with integrity and fidelity and bravery don't -- aren't being put in that same big toxic stew with those, including Andy McCabe, who are at the top levels of the FBI in 2016 trying to prevent Donald Trump from being president.\n\nWALLACE: Simple question. Does the president think the McCabe case should be reopened?\n\nCONWAY: The president thinks that Andy McCabe should have been punished because he lied and he lied several times to the investigators and many people feel the same way.\n\nWALLACE: OK.\n\nCONWAY: I'm not going to spend a lot more of my life on Andy McCabe.\n\nWALLACE: OK, and I'm not going to spend anymore of this interview on that.\n\nAttorney General Barr said this week the president has never asked him to do anything in a criminal case. But Mr. Trump tweeted: This doesn't mean that I do not have as president the legal right to do so. I do. But I have so far chosen not to.\n\nWhat does the president think is his legal authority to intervene in criminal cases and to order who should be prosecuted and who should not be prosecuted?\n\nCONWAY: He didn't say he's ordering who should be prosecuted and who should not be prosecuted. Article II --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: I didn't say he didn't. I'm saying, what does he think is his authority?\n\nCONWAY: Article II provides our president, yes, ladies and gentlemen, including President Trump vast powers. And the president is making a point, and the Attorney General Bill Barr is backing him up on this, that he has not interfered in any criminal case.\n\nI know people who are trying to bully Bill Barr out of his job, like Elizabeth Warren. Her campaign is dwindling. She is practically disappearing as a viable candidate, so she's got to pick on Bill Barr.\n\nHe's not going to be bullied by people like Elizabeth Warren. Steve Cohen, the congressman who put a bucket of chicken (INAUDIBLE) didn't show up to the State of the Union.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: What does he think is his authority to get involved in criminal cases under Article II?\n\nCONWAY: The president could weigh in, but you see how the president weighs in. The president weighs into the whole world.\n\nHe didn't have a conversation with Bill Barr about the Roger Stone case. He had a conversation with the whole world. He put it, as he is want to do, on his Twitter feed, on social media. And he expresses himself, cuts at the middlemen -- I know the middlemen don't like that -- in the democratization of information where he tells everybody what he thinks it and a number of issues, including the Stone case.\n\nWALLACE: But Bill Barr -- wait a minute -- Bill Barr says that that kind of conversation, even if it's to the whole world, not getting on the phone with Bill Barr undercuts his authority and makes it impossible for him, Bill Barr, to do his job.\n\nListen to what Barr said in that interview with ABC. Here he is.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: If he were to say, you know, go investigate somebody because -- and you sense it's because they're political opponent, then an attorney general shouldn't carry that out, wouldn't carry that out.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Since Watergate, presidents have generally, perhaps not always, but generally stayed away from involvement in criminal investigations.\n\nWill Mr. Trump, going forward, respect Barr's request for him to stop commenting on current cases, whether it's -- whether it's in terms of on the air, you know, public statements, or tweets?\n\nCONWAY: Well, a couple things, very different to pick up the phone and ask your attorney general to do something in a criminal case, the president hasn't done that. He had -- he says he hasn't done it, Bill Barr said he hasn't done it, he hasn't done it.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: But Barr said the tweets are making it impossible to do his job.\n\nCONWAY: But no -- and let me say something. It's not correct to say that presidents have not interfered. Bill Clinton pardoned a relative. He pardoned someone who refused to testify against him, that's involving yourself in criminal matters --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: Wait, pardoning is different. Wait. It's different, it's after the criminal process has been completed and clearly the --\n\nCONWAY: President Obama spoke up in the Freddie Gray case in Baltimore. President George Herbert Walker Bush, Bush 41, I think commented on the case in L.A., probably the Rodney King case.\n\nSo, it's not -- it's disingenuous to say that people -- presidents don't comment on criminal matters.\n\nWhat is most important here -- two things, one is the president of the United States has not asked or directed his attorney general privately to do anything in any criminal matter including Roger Stone. Number two, he works hand and glove with the attorney general, as we all are privileged to do on a number of matters that affect this country. I --\n\nWALLACE: Policy is different than criminal cases. Policy is different than criminal cases.\n\nCONWAY: No policy -- well, the attorney general and Department of Justice cover a lot of territory in this country, Chris --\n\nWALLACE: OK.\n\nCONWAY: -- and we work very well with them.\n\nAgain, let me repeat, drug trafficking, human trafficking, gun trafficking, sanctuary cities, Texas versus Azar, eldercare now we do (ph), elder fraud we're doing.\n\nI just went to something about law enforcement, a new commission they have. Our law enforcement feel more deeply respected and better resourced because of Donald Trump and Bill Barr.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: Can you and I talk about Michael -- can we talk about Michael Bloomberg?\n\nCONWAY: Sure.\n\nWALLACE: There's been a war of --\n\nCONWAY: Speaking of purity\n\nWALLACE: There's been a war of words over the past week certainly between the president and former New York City --\n\nCONWAY: But the war of words is between Michael Bloomberg and the African- American community.\n\nWALLACE: Well --\n\nCONWAY: The way he feels about people is so demeaning. The policy may have been stop-and-frisk, but the philosophy was to castigate and denigrate people of color and it's a disgrace.\n\nWALLACE: You were -- you've anticipated where we're going to go because one of the statements back and forth had to do with these comments that Michael Bloomberg made about stop and frisk in 2015. Take a look.\n\n(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP, FEBRUARY 5, 2015)\n\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: The way you should get the guns out of the kids' hands is to throw them up against the wall and frisk them.\n\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: The president tweeted right after that came out: Wow, Bloomberg is a total racist, and he expanded on that in a radio interview with Geraldo Rivera.\n\n(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You couldn't go to your house. They were stopping you every day. What Bloomberg did to black -- to the black community was a disgrace.\n\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: But, Kellyanne, candidate Donald Trump supported what Bloomberg did with stop-and-frisk. Here he is in the first debate in 2016 with Hillary Clinton.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: It was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg, and it was terminated by a current mayor. But stop-and-frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City, tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: So why was stop-and-frisk tremendous then, and it's racist now?\n\nCONWAY: Well, he is -- the president is toying with everybody by saying, oh, had he said something like that, had you unearthed a videotape like that of him, everybody would say racist, racist.\n\nBut look at all the people who were saying, you know what, I think Michael Bloomberg learned his lesson, he's apologized, that was so long ago. Chris, it was a few years ago as mayor of New York. And it wasn't just stop-and- frisk. He said redlining -- canceling redlining started the financial crisis.\n\nThe African-American community weren't the perpetrators of that financial crisis, many of them were the victims. What is he talking about?\n\nThis billionaire who's made his life's wealth in the financial services industry is now saying that and, look, this is not -- it's not that Michael Bloomberg was burning a bra or burning the flag at Woodstock when he was a teenager. He said these several years ago, a few short years ago as mayor of New York and it's the way he said it.\n\nHe said, you can basically Xerox the description of male minorities between the ages of 16 and 25, and hand it over to the cops.\n\nThat is somebody who looks at people beneath him differently and we can't have that. And I -- I cannot -- I literally this week -- I got pretty big shock absorbers, my friend, I cannot believe all the prominent African- Americans I've seen publicly say, I think we can support Bloomberg because after all, he's electable, he's the one who can beat Donald Trump.\n\nElectability was the calling card for Hillary Clinton four years ago, for Joe Biden this entire year. Electability means nothing if the person looks at a large constituency of your electorate, let alone this country that -- wait, look what he said about women. I mean, all this coming out, women and lawsuits --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: Let me ask about women, because there's a long story in The Washington Post today.\n\nCONWAY: Read it.\n\nWALLACE: I did read it.\n\nCONWAY: I did too\n\nWALLACE: OK. About Bloomberg's history of sexist comments, about women who work for him at his company.\n\nCan -- will President Trump, if it's a Bloomberg-Trump race, will he be able to make an issue of that given President Trump's own long history of sexist comments?\n\nCONWAY: It should be an issue here and now, today. You don't have to wait for an election to be offended by the fact that Michael Bloomberg, according to other Bloomberg employees, said to a woman who announced she was pregnant, she's been congratulated by her coworkers, says, aren't you going to kill it?\n\nThis is a woman who relied upon her employment, relied upon Michael Bloomberg for employment, and one would imagine her maternity benefits as she found out the good news. The comments he's made about women -- I mean, The Washington Post had to bleep out some of the actual words.\n\nThe comments he's made about women in lawsuits, that is all fair game. And it's fair game because we want to know the person behind the half a billion dollars worth of ads --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: But is it fair game for President Trump when he's made sexist comments too?\n\nCONWAY: Oh, please. First of all, I've been working by his side for four years. He's the best boss I've ever had.\n\nWALLACE: There are plenty women who would say the same thing about Michael Bloomberg.\n\nCONWAY: Let them come forward.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: Is this any worse -- is this any worse than the Access Hollywood tapes?\n\nCONWAY: It's far worse. Oh, my goodness, it's far worse. And, by the way, that was fully litigated. That happened in October 7th. He won a month a later. And --\n\nWALLACE: That doesn't mean -- that doesn't mean it's not an issue.\n\nNo, here's -- if you're going to do that -- you know what? I'll take that on any time. I'll take a leave of absence from the White House and talk all day long about that stuff.\n\nLet me tell you something: the way Michael Bloomberg treated employees, female employees who were under his wing, who were relying on him for their -- for their livelihood, for their health benefits, for their 401(k)s, to have created that kind of culture, that unsafe workplace, to feel that you're being harassed because of your gender, that is problematic, and I think you're going to hear more of it.\n\nThe other thing is, I don't understand how the Democratic Party is going to sit back and take it. Is it really worth it to this Democratic Party in the age of the #metoo movement, Black Lives Matter, you had the first African- American president, you have completely squeezed out and spat out the candidates of color this time, Cory Booker. Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, they are out of the race. You're left -- you're left with a bunch of white people, old white people at that with the exception of your next guest, Mayor Buttigieg, and you're going to go backwards because Michael Bloomberg will spend money and will take and will consult Donald Trump?\n\nThat's why the Bernie voters are not going to take that. I predict. He'll keep winning contests. He's like President Trump in that he's got a committed base of loyal voters who aren't going to go elsewhere.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: All right. Thank you very much.\n\nCONWAY: Voters care about what affects them --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: We'll pass your comments later to the Democratic candidates, I'm sure they'll be happy to hear them.\n\nCONWAY: Voters talk about what offends them, but they vote on what affects them. And they have a big decision to make. If you want -- if you want to elevate somebody who has treated people that are less than him, people of color and women, that's a big decision to make. It's a serious consequence in 2020 when our country has such great progress. This president has --\n\nWALLACE: OK, we're done. Timeout.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCONWAY: -- African-Americans out of jobs (ph) and now out of prison --\n\nWALLACE: All right. Kellyanne Conway, thank you. Always good to talk with you.\n\nCONWAY: You got it. Thank you.\n\nWALLACE: Wish (ph) you could be talking to the commercial.\n\nCONWAY: I'll be back.\n\nWALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the new tension between President Trump and his attorney general.\n\nPlus, what would you like us the panel about Democrats' calls to investigate political interference at the Department of Justice? Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARR: I cannot do my job here at the department with constant background commentary that undercuts me.\n\nMCCABE: We are seeing things happen every day in this country that many of us never, ever thought we'd see here -- the pursuit of political enemies and the use of the criminal justice system.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Attorney General Barr and former FBI official Andrew McCabe finding one thing they can agree on as both complain about President Trump weighing in on Justice Department investigations.\n\nAnd it's time now for our Sunday group.\n\nGuy Benson of FOX News Radio; Charles Lane from The Washington Post; former DNC chair, Donna Brazile; and former Trump National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton.\n\nMichael, let me start with you. You now have the attorney general calling on the president to stop commenting on criminal cases.\n\nShould the president listen to Bill Barr, will he listen to Bill Barr?\n\nMICHAEL ANTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: Well, look, I think he should listen to Bill Barr. The president obviously has confidence in Bill Barr. He appointed him.\n\nHe has said over the weekend that, you know, he was asked, does this mean there's a rift? Would seem that he had a rift with his prior attorney general and he said, no. So, I think he should listen.\n\nBut I think this controversy is still overblown in a sense that if the president were really intervening, we know what the president thinks. The president thinks Andrew McCabe probably should have been charged and he thinks Roger Stone is getting railroaded. If he were really intervening, the charges against Roger Stone would have been dropped and Andrew McCabe would be facing charges or maybe have already been tried by now.\n\nSo, I take Bill Barr's word when he says that the president has never intervened, but that, you know, he finds the comments unhelpful.\n\nSo, you know, back off a little with the tweets and the comments and take the advice of your attorney general, sure. But the fact of the matter is I think that the president is right in the opinions that he expresses and he's right to be concerned about unequal justice.\n\nWALLACE: Good luck with getting him to back off on the tweets.\n\nWe asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of Democratic calls to investigate political interference at the Department of Justice, we got this on Facebook from Mark Davis.\n\nHow can you interfere in an organization you oversee? It's rhetorical. You can't.\n\nChuck, as I discussed with Kellyanne, under Article Two, the president has tremendous powers to oversee the Justice Department and specifically criminal investigations. So how do you answer Mark?\n\nCHUCK LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: It's a fair question. There is a paradox built into our constitutional order.\n\nThe president is the head of the executive branch and furthermore has the power to pardon, which sort of implies the power to pick and choose who gets prosecuted and put into prison. And that's why since Watergate, we have developed a strong norm, along with a lot of procedural protections, that try to distance presidential political self-interest from the operation of the Justice Department. And broadly speaking, notwithstanding the examples Kellyanne mentioned, that had been respected.\n\nHere we have a president who doesn't really I think even know about it, and flouts it through social media, broadcasting his desire to see this or that person benefited by justice, somebody else should go to jail, and that, as Bill Barr said is totally threatening to that norm.\n\nBut he does it because the base loves it. I'm not even sure he really wants these threats and orders carried out, but the base loves it and that is why he will keep doing it.\n\nWALLACE: Meanwhile, Democrats are now calling for an investigation of Attorney General Barr. Or even more. Take a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWARREN: What the attorney general has done, we should all be calling for the resignation of the attorney general. If he won't resign, remember, the attorney general can be impeached.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Donna, haven't Democrats learned their lesson? Move on from impeachment and investigations?\n\nDONNA BRAZILE, FORMER DNC CHAIR: Has President Trump learned in any lesson over the last couple of months? He's on a retribution tour. He's on a revenge tour.\n\nWhen career professionals walk out of their job, we all should take notice. What happened?\n\nWhen the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, the largest U.S. attorney office, is removed and then a replacement is putting in, and then the sentencing charges are either meddled with -- yes, there needs to be a comprehensive investigation as to what is happening.\n\nI want to mention something, Kellyanne talked about George Herbert Walker Bush in the Rodney King case, as well as Barack Obama in the Freddie --\n\nWALLACE: Gray case.\n\nBRAZILE: -- Gray case.\n\nIn both instances, the communities erupted because they were concerned about overzealous policing and what happened in those cases. That's what they got involved.\n\nThey didn't get in -- they didn't try to tip the scales of justice. They were trying to calm the community after, you know, two very horrific things occurred. So, we shouldn't put the two together.\n\nBut the president's -- what he's doing with his tweets, he's revealing what's going on in the Justice Department. And I think the House should get to the bottom of it.\n\nWALLACE: Guy, first of all, your reaction to Donna, but also, how do you see this playing out? Do you think this is a real rift between the president and his attorney general? Or is it a bit of theater as some people have suggested, where Barr is saying this because he needs to shore up his position at the Justice Department and there's kind of an inside agreement, tacit agreement between the White House and Justice?\n\nGUY BENSON, FOX NEWS RADIO: Well, first, I would just say to Donna, it's a fair point that she makes about the two examples that she gave. I would also note, that President Obama did make public comments about the Hillary Clinton emails investigation, which was a far cry from Rodney King, right? So there has been some precedent for presidents weighing in.\n\nOn this broader issue of Barr and the Democratic reaction, I think your question was good. Have the Democrats learned their lesson? We have people talking about impeachment of Bill Barr, which I think is ludicrous.\n\nWe have heard over and over again from Democrats, people on the left saying, why won't anyone stand up to President Trump? Why won't any of his people stand up to President Trump? Then Bill Barr does that with a brush back pitch that I think was needed and was correct, and people immediately jumped to the conclusion, well, it's fake, it's theater, it's not real.\n\nI'm not sure I would call it a rift, but between Bill Barr saying what he said on ABC News, and then his Justice Department declining to prosecute Andrew McCabe, an outcome that I think it's very clear the president wants, to Michael's point -- I think it's been about few days for the narrative that Bill Barr is just a hatchet man for President Trump who will do his bidding.\n\nWALLACE: So what to expect? Do you -- I mean, going forward you expect the president to stay out of these cases?\n\nBENSON: No.\n\nWALLACE: No?\n\nBENSON: No, he'll tweet. There's a chance that he'll tweet a little bit less. I think that Mitch McConnell sat in the studio, the Senate majority leader, just a few days ago and urge the president to take the advice of his attorney general. I hope the president does it, even if he just calibrates it slightly differently.\n\nWhat will be interesting is if Trump dials it up and continues to do this even more aggressively, what does Barr do then? Having lay down a marker on this point?\n\nWALLACE: All right. Panel, we have to take a break here.\n\nBut up next, one of the Democratic front runners, Pete Buttigieg, joins us to discuss the upcoming contest in Nevada and South Carolina, and whether he can build on his early momentum straight through Super Tuesday.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: Coming up, Bernie Sanders' win in New Hampshire put new pressure on Democrats fighting to be the moderate candidate in the race for the White House.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: A fresh outlook is what makes new beginnings possible. It is how we build a new majority.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: We'll ask Pete Buttigieg how he plans to stand out in the crowded center.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: The Democratic race for the White House is gearing up with the votes in Iowa and New Hampshire starting to winnow the field of candidates and establish new frontrunners, but upcoming contest in Nevada and South Carolina, much more diverse states, could reshuffle the race again.\n\nJoining us now from Las Vegas, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nMayor, let's start with the numbers from the two states which are going to be holding contests over the next few weeks, put them up on the screen. In Nevada, you're in fifth place with 10 percent support. In South Carolina, you're also in fifth place with 7.5 percent support. You're trailing Tom Steyer in both states.\n\nHow important is it for you to do well, much better than those numbers, in both of those states to show that you can get support in states with a big minority voting bloc?\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, it's very important for us to do well, and we're on the ground working to earn those good results here in Nevada and we'll be campaigning hard for every vote in South Carolina as well.\n\nWe've see how fluid it is. Of course I don't have billions of dollars of my own money to pour into the airwaves. But what we do have is a vision that as we've demonstrated in New Hampshire and Iowa, can bring people together in a commitment, as we come to more racially diverse states to speak to the concerns of voters who are here.\n\nHere in Nevada, for example, we've got over 100 organizers on the ground, volunteers as we speak getting ready to go out and talk to fellow Nevadans in a state that looks to the future and in a state where I'm encountering a lot of workers concerned about how these political decisions are going to affect them. Whether it's workers who are concerned about health care and how to preserve the health care choice that is so important to them, people concerned about immigration reform and wanting to know that we're seriously going to get something done. And a lot of people looking to the future worried about climate.\n\nThis is a state that is in many ways reflective of the future of America and I'm really excited to be on the ground here working to earn that support in the week that remains.\n\nWALLACE: How damaging, if you don't show strong support among Latinos in Nevada, African-Americans in South Carolina -- because that question of whether or not you can get support from those minorities, of course, is the big knock on your campaign?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, I'll leave it to pundits due to the political analysis.\n\nWhat I will say is, of course it is extremely important to earn support from voters across the board. And when you look at the way that Latino voters here in Nevada know that they are under siege in this administration, talking to black voters who are sick and tired of the economic disempowerment among the injustices of systemic racism and looking for a president who can actually bring change to Washington and, more than anything, looking for a nominee who can defeat Donald Trump. We are ready to go out and have that conversation.\n\nYou know, this, more than anything else, I think for so many voters and certainly a lot of voters that -- of color that I talked to across the Latino, the black in the AEPi (ph) communities is about making sure that we get this right.\n\nYou know, the Senate demonstrated that it's not going to hold this president accountable. It is up to us in 2020. It is our only shot. And as we see this president, as he's demonstrated, interfering in criminal prosecutions, growing more and more emboldened, so much is on the line. We dare not get this wrong. And that means nominating a candidate who can challenge this president on his own terms and put together a big enough winning coalition that we can have some coattails too and make gains in the Senate.\n\nWALLACE: I want to talk about how this race is beginning to shape up because after Tuesday it is beginning to shape up.\n\nIn New Hampshire, the so-called moderate candidates won more than 50 percent of the vote of voters in that state, but -- which was double what Bernie Sanders got, but he won in New Hampshire because he had that left lane, the more liberal lane, all to himself while the so-called more moderate lane was kind of clogged up by you and -- and Biden and Klobuchar, all of whom split up the votes.\n\nHow concerned are you that the -- that the moderate lane, if you will, is getting so crowded that you could be leaving the -- the road to the nomination open to Bernie Sanders?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, I think that's what voters right now are in the process of settling. Look, there are a lot of different candidacies with a lot of different visions. But the vision of my candidacy is that we're going to have to bring change to Washington, that we can't confront the most disruptive president in modern times by falling back on the same playbook, just as we also can't do it by telling people that their only options are between a revolution or the status quo.\n\nWe've been able to demonstrate our ability to get diehard Democrats, yes, but also independents and even some Republicans to cross over a support my vision and what our campaign stands for. And I believe that's going to serve us well here in Nevada, South Carolina and beyond.\n\nWALLACE: And then, despite -- if you're able to winnow your way through all of those folks, that on Super Tuesday you face another centrist candidate in Mayor Mike Bloomberg. And over really the last week, week and a half, there have been a series of stories about his comments on stop and frisk and redlining and, as I discussed with Kellyanne Conway, a big story in The Washington Post today about a long history of him king sexist, profane comments to women who work for his company and some of whom said that it created a hostile workplace.\n\nHow troubled are you by these allegations and this evidence of alleged sexism and racism?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, I think he's going to have to answer for that and speak to it.\n\nLook, this is a time where voters are looking for a president who can lead us out of the days when it was just commonplace, or accepted to have these kinds of sexist and discriminatory attitudes. And, you know, right now, this is our chance to do something different.\n\nObviously, there is no comparison to this president and the way that he has treated and talked about women and people of color and continues to do so to this day. But we, in our party, hold ourselves to the highest standard. And it is going to be critical for us to have a nominee who cannot authentically lead and who can show growth on these challenges.\n\nLook, some of these are issues that our country's about to face are among the most intractable we've ever had, but you've got to arrive at those -- at those challenges with -- with the ability to explain your record and with an ability to explain how you're going to raise the bar at a time when we are finally asking a lot more from our elected leaders.\n\nWALLACE: Well, let me follow up on that because Kellyanne Conway was, I think, trolling Democrats and saying, boy, this part that talks about all of these principles in the Me Too era, are they going to nominate somebody like Michael Bloomberg with his record of things he's done, for instance, towards women in the workplace, just because they think he can beat Donald Trump? What would that say about what the Democratic Party really stands for?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: For a representative of this White House to speak about misogyny, to speak about sexism, to speak about racism is comical. And, you're right, I think it amounts to trolling.\n\nLook, the American people are not going to be fooled by anybody from the Trump White House when it comes to these issues. So I'll leave it to my competitors in this race to speak for themselves, but one thing we can all agree on is that we can do a lot better than this president.\n\nAnd, you know, one of the reasons why I'm seeing a lot of folks from the Republican Party or formally from the Republican Party ready to cross over is that they can no longer look their children in the eye and explain the behavior of the current president of the United States.\n\nWALLACE: Mayor, you have been very open about the fact that you're gay. And it hasn't been much of an issue in this campaign until now. This week, two conservative supporters of President Trump, Rush Limbaugh and Sebastian Gorka, talked about it on their shows.\n\nTake a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRUSH LIMBAUGH, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: A gay guy, 37 years old, loves kissing his husband on debate stages. Can you see Trump have fun with that?\n\nSEBASTIAN GORKA, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT: Why is a homosexual man lecturing us about the sanctity of life in the womb? Just a little curious there. Strange.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Mayor, what's your reaction to those comments?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, I am in a faithful, loving, committed marriage. I'm -- I'm proud of my marriage. And I'm proud of my husband. And I'm not going to be lectured on family values from the likes of Rush Limbaugh or anybody who supports Donald J. Trump as the moral as well as political leader of the United States.\n\nAmerica has moved on and we should have politics of belonging that welcomes everybody. That's what the American people are for. And I am saddened for what the Republican Party has become if they embrace that kind of homophobic rhetoric.\n\nWALLACE: And how big an issue do you think this would be in a general election? Clearly they think it would be an issue. The idea that -- that you would need -- and you have reached out to social conservatives, many of whose votes you'd need -- but who might have concerns about your sexual orientation?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, here's my generational -- or general election experience on this. You know, I came out during a general election in south Bend. And this was at a time when Mike Pence was the governor of Indiana. And we didn't know what would happen.\n\nI'll tell you what happened, I got re-elected with 80 percent of the vote in my generally Democratic, but socially conservative community. More than I had the first time that I ran for office.\n\nThis election isn't about any of us candidates. It is about voters' lives. And we're the ones trying to get voters a raise. We're the ones trying to make sure that there is paid family leave, working to end endless war, serious about climate change --\n\nWALLACE: Right.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Actually prepared to do something on gun violence.\n\nAnd when it comes to LGBTQ issues, this is, I think, the most important thing is not the treatment of candidates, it's what's happening to individuals and families across the country from brave service members who have their careers threatened --\n\nWALLACE: Right.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: By this president, two kids experiencing bullying right now in this climate. We can do better and you don't have to be a diehard Democrat to know that we can do better when it comes to inclusion and equality in this country.\n\nWALLACE: Mayor, thank you. Thanks for joining us. We'll be watching developments next week out of Nevada.\n\nGood to have you.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Thanks. Good to be with you.\n\nWALLACE: When we come back, as former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg rises in the polls, troubling comments from his past are resurfacing. The Sunday panel will tackle that, next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He sees our poll numbers and I think it's fair to say he is scared because he knows I have the record and the resources to defeat him.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Mike Bloomberg reacting to President Trump's barrage of attacks this week, but the former New York City mayor also facing incoming about his long record in public life.\n\nAnd we're back now with the panel.\n\nDonna, as we've been saying, Mayor Bloomberg rising in the polls, news stories coming out, old tapes coming out about his record on race and, as we've said several times, a -- a big story, a takeout in The Washington Post today about his -- and you can see it there, about his long history of sexist comments going back decades at his company and women saying that they believed he created a hostile workplace.\n\nHow damaging to his campaign?\n\nDONNA BRAZILE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Extremely.\n\nLook, I think there are many people in the Democratic Party who are looking at Mr. Bloomberg because he has the resources to take on President Trump. But the question in my judgment is his record. I mean, I am uncomfortable with his policies in New York. I understand he's apologized. I get that. I'm for forgiveness. But I am extremely dismayed at the information I read over the weekend about his sexist -- the sexist work environment.\n\nYou know, it's one thing to have this so-called top law enforcement policy of stop and frisk. It was ruled unconstitutional. And it has taken him years to say I'm sorry about that. He has the -- he has the resources, but I'm -- I am very uncomfortable with -- with his record. Very comfortable.\n\nWALLACE: Guy, you could tell that Kellyanne Conway was thoroughly enjoying the predicament, not just for Bloomberg, but for the Democratic Party.\n\nCan they nominate -- will they perhaps nominate someone who's got Bloomberg's record? And we should point out, it's a mixed record because there's a lot of things he did in New York, crime did go down. He's given tremendous amounts of money on a lot of issues that Democrats like, climate change, a lot of women's groups. Can, in the Me Too era, the Democratic Party nominate somebody, though, with this downside?\n\nGUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM: No, it could be a gut check moment coming up for the Democratic Party, right? Here is a New York billionaire with potential vulnerabilities on race and sexism, right, which sounds familiar if you're a Democrat, and Mike Bloomberg is the human embodiment of money in politics. All right, this is a party that at least pretends to abhor the influence of money in politics and here's someone who is doing the closest thing you can do to buying a nomination. That combination, is that going to sit well with the Democratic electric? Are they willing to swallow hard and go for it because they think that he's got the money and maybe the moderation relatively to beat President Trump? That's a decision they're going to have to make, but there are no shortage of ironies here.\n\nWALLACE: Then there is -- I guess you have to call him the former frontrunner now, Joe Biden, who took it drubbing in Iowa, an even worse drubbing in New Hampshire and is now counting on the votes of minorities, Latinos, African-Americans in South Carolina and Nevada, to -- to rescue him.\n\nTake a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I've said many times, you can't be the Democratic nominee and you can't win a general election as a Democrat unless you have overwhelming support from black and brown voters.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Chuck, how much trouble is Biden in with the performance in those other states? Even his one-time overwhelming lead in South Carolina is now beginning to slip away.\n\nCHARLES LANE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, obviously, he's in a lot of trouble. And let's be candid here, a lot of people foresaw this kind of downward spiral if Biden was unable to up his game on the campaign trail and present as a more dynamic candidate. And he, so far, has not delivered.\n\nSouth Carolina, with its large base of African-American voters is and was his firewall and it will be tested now in a way that is vital to the future of his candidacy.\n\nYou know, he is not that strong among Latino voters. It's Bernie Sanders who seems to be polling among Latino voters in Nevada, which only heightens the importance of South Carolina. If Biden goes down and we're left with this sort of spread of several candidates, none of whom with a clear majority, then you could be looking at somebody -- or the primary season ending with no one having a majority and then things get really complicated.\n\nWALLACE: No, they get really great because you're talking about a brokered convention, which all of us have been looking towards for our entire political lives.\n\nBut, you know, let me pick up with you, Michael, on the point I was making with Mayor Buttigieg. You've got Bernie Sanders over here on the left and with Elizabeth Warren starting to fade, seeming to have a pretty clear shot in his path. And, meanwhile, you've got this center lane all clogged up with Buttigieg and Klobuchar and Biden and Bloomberg about to get into it.\n\nHow well is this setting up for Bernie Sanders to be the Democratic nominee?\n\nMICHAEL ANTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: Well, the fundamental problem the Democrats have is they have a big gap between enthusiasm and electability. So it seems like all the energy on the basis is for Bernie or for somebody on the left side of the party, but then you have an establishment and a leadership in the party who really worries that going that far to the left just guarantees a Trump re-election and we need some more moderate person to play nationwide, but they can't settle on who that more moderate person is.\n\nSo that lane remains clogged up. I think it's -- it's amazing to me that a -- a mayor of a town of 100,000 is actually in the top two in the Democratic nomination. Keep in mind that no mayor of New York City, population 8 million, the capital of the world, has gone on to higher office, of any higher office, since 1840. Not 1940, but 1840. So that sort of tells against Mike Bloomberg, but it shows that there is still a hunger from at least -- I don't think amongst the voters necessarily so much, but for part of the party to just -- we just need some kind of moderate voice in there. And even if it's the mayor of a small town, you know, we'll take it because they think Bernie's a disaster.\n\nWALLACE: Donna?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, the race is far from over. And I know everyone is focused on the four states that ultimately help us to winnow the field.\n\nThe field has been whittled. And I think what we're left with now is not just left versus right, we're trying to make sure that we elect someone who will give us the kind of country that we deserve, not someone like Donald Trump. And, therefore, it is clogged. It is clogged.\n\nBut I do believe that we are going to see a clarifying moment that occurs over the next two weeks. And by the time we get to super Tuesday -- I've been to four of the Super Tuesday states. Let me just tell you, Michael Bloomberg is dominating the airwaves. But you're right, I don't know where the energy is on the ground for Michael Bloomberg, but he is dominating the airwaves.\n\nAt the end of the day, Chris, we're going to have a nominee by the end of March.\n\nWALLACE: By the end of March?\n\nBRAZILE: Yes.\n\nWALLACE: No -- no brokered convention?\n\nBRAZILE: Sixty -- 60 percent of the delegates. We're going to have a clear shot at figuring out where the last two or three candidates will be. Yes, we're going to have a nominee.\n\nWALLACE: And -- and in 30 seconds, is Bernie Sanders a suicide pact?\n\nBRAZILE: Bernie Sanders is a strong, viable candidate with a lot of support out there.\n\nWALLACE: So you think you could legitimately beat Donald Trump?\n\nBRAZILE: I'm not there yet because I -- I'm not sure he's going to be the nominee.\n\nWALLACE: No, but I'm not asking you that. I'm asking you --\n\nBRAZILE: Don't try to get me in trouble on a Sunday (ph).\n\nWALLACE: That's my job.\n\nBRAZILE: I should be a mess right now.\n\nWALLACE: Thank you, panel. See you Sunday.\n\nUp next, our Power Player of the Week. He is known for merging punk with piano. Now he's trying to bring a new union between classical and pop.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: It's a constant test for symphony orchestra's, how to bring in fresh ideas and fans without alienating the diehards. Well now the guy who brought piano to the punk scene is taking on that challenge. He's our Power Player of the Week.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nBEN FOLDS, MUSICIAN AND AUTHOR: Because there seems to be a hierarchy, which you would think exists where the symphony is the great thing and the -- the -- the rockers of the dumb ones. But it's not that simple and each have something to offer the other.\n\nWALLACE (voice over): Ben Folds is all about breaking down barriers. Musical barriers between pop and classical.\n\nAs artistic adviser to the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, his late night sold out declassified concerts are the platform for his special mix.\n\nFOLDS: It's about unformalizing the symphony orchestra in a way that doesn't intimidate people. People go to the symphony and they think, oh, how do I dress? They don't even know. So, you know, we make it informal in a way for them to feel comfortable to be there.\n\nThe next artist that you're about to hear, I just discovered her on YouTube.\n\nWALLACE: He took us backstage as he oversaw his classical pop matchup. Folds admits it can be an uneasy balance.\n\nFOLDS: Orchestral musicians are demoralized by loud music that covers up what they normally do. They're having to do a dumbed down version of it. The rock band goes out thinking, wow, that wasn't loud enough, didn't feel it.\n\nWALLACE: Declassified as a means of de-confliction, and it's working.\n\nFOLDS: We've sold out every show we've -- we've done here. People have walked away with a Spotify playlist of classical music, which we can see that they are listening to.\n\nWALLACE: He's been blending genres since the '90s, when he started Ben Folds Five, which hit the charts with the ballad Brick.\n\nFOLDS: She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly.\n\nWALLACE (on camera): No guitar?\n\nFOLDS: No guitar. No. In an -- in an era that was all about the guitar. That was the grunge era.\n\nWALLACE: You called it punk rock for sissies.\n\nFOLDS: Yes, maybe nerds would have been a little better word.\n\nI realized that everyone could relate to piano music, but it just wasn't cool at the moment.\n\nWALLACE: Walk us through, when you're sitting at a piano, how you come up with an idea.\n\nFOLDS: I don't know. You know, like I'm -- if I was going to say, hello, Chris Wallace, you know, then I find it. So it would be, hello, Chris Wallace, how are you today. You know, like then I would -- I would find it on the piano.\n\nWALLACE: That's the Chris Wallace song?\n\nFOLDS: That's the Chris Wallace song.\n\nWALLACE: Well, let -- let me hear that again.\n\nFOLDS: Here's the happy version. Hello, Chris Wallace, how are you today? We make it minor and it becomes sad because he has more work to do.\n\nYou know, I just -- you find it.\n\nWALLACE: I love that.\n\nWALLACE: (voice over): Folds shares his creative process in this memoir. The title refers to a childhood dream where he spread joy by catching lightning bugs for others.\n\nFOLDS: As an artist, what I do is I capture the thing that I see, the thing that interests me. My job is putting that idea in a bottle, which I've taken my whole life to do, and to share that with other people.\n\nWALLACE: He's still sharing his lightning bugs and spreading joy.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWALLACE: Folds is also an advocate for music education. His next project is a show with The Mister Rogers Foundation, writing songs with kids.\n\nAnd that's it for today.

If there's one person who will be watching a new documentary on Lorena Bobbitt, it's her ex-husband.\n\nLorena, a four-part docuseries from Amazon Studios, aims to shed light on the notorious case that quickly became tabloid fodder and a late-night punchline — on June 23, 1993, the then-24-year-old cut off the penis of her sleeping husband John Wayne Bobbitt, 26, in small-town Manassas, Va., and fled the scene, organ in hand. She drove off from their home and flung the penis out of the driver's side window into a field.\n\nPolice later went digging through the overgrown roadside grass for the missing member, The New York Times reported, found it, and put it on ice in a Big Bite hot dog box from a nearby 7-Eleven, and then rushed it to the hospital for the bleeding spouse. Bobbitt then underwent surgery for nearly 10 hours and had it reattached.\n\nLORENA BOBBITT SPEAKS OUT ON HOWARD STERN HATE\n\nAt the time, a distraught Lorena, who now goes by her maiden name Gallo, claimed she endured years of domestic violence and was raped by her drunk husband on that fateful night, causing her to snap.\n\nFrom what I saw, it was clear to me that Lorena Bobbitt had been abused by her husband, said state forensic psychologist Dr. Evan Nelson in the film. But from a legal and mental health perspective... What matters is whether she was so mentally ill that she knew what she was doing but she was incapable of stopping that impulse. That was the issue [with this case].\n\nNeighbors told filmmakers they felt something sinister was occurring within the marriage and that at one point, Gallo's makeup was thicker than usual.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, filmmaker Joshua Rofé said: Lorena, John Wayne and more than 40 other witnesses, attorneys, jurors and experts were interviewed over the course of a year to give this docuseries a complete picture of events that took place. This is something Lorena Gallo was not afforded 25 years ago when the story was misconstrued and unfairly sensationalized in the public eye.\n\nIt was our expressed intention to right the wrongs of the past by giving her a platform to tell her side of the story as a survivor of domestic violence, added Rofé.\n\nThe docuseries, executive produced by Jordan Peele, is available Friday for streaming on Amazon — the same night Reelz will air their documentary Lorena Bobbitt: What Happened?\n\nWhile all these years Gallo has avoided turning the high-profile tale into a film or TV series, she agreed to participate in the Amazon project in hopes of finally telling her story. Bobbitt also agreed to participate.\n\nJOHN WAYNE BOBBITT RECALLS NIGHTMARE\n\nDespite Bobbitt's involvement, the 51-year-old told Fox News the creators of Lorena had allegedly set him up to make him look bad.\n\n[The filmmakers] came from LA, they didn't tell me what it was for and that it was a non-titled documentary, Bobbitt alleged. They didn't want… to tell me that it's for Lorena. … They're trying to paint this picture of a bad boy, you know? This violent mean guy. They brought me out up to the shooting range, shooting with all these different types of weapons and riding in my Harley, wearing a skull mask and all that. They want to get this video, obviously this visual of this bad guy, you know? … I have never talked to Jordan Peele, and Jordan Peele has never seen my transcripts [from my trial].\n\nIn response to the allegations, a rep for Amazon said they were sticking with their initial statement from director and executive producer Rofé.\n\nA rep for Peele did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.\n\nBobbitt insisted he has never harmed Gallo during their turbulent marriage.\n\nLorena lied and made this all up, he alleged. She just went with it, and she's still going with it. And it sucks. … [You] stick up for battered women and children, why not stick up for battered men too? Because men are also battered by women. I was battered by Lorena. My penis was cut off. … I woke up without a penis. … I was upset, I was embarrassed. … She wanted it all and nothing was going to stand in her way.\n\nIn the film, Gallo described her union with the former Marine as a living nightmare.\n\nI felt like I was in hell, she recalled. I felt a sense of peace when he wasn't in the house. … I was suffering from anxiety. I couldn't eat anything… I couldn't even sleep. My health was deteriorating.\n\nStill, Gallo admitted she still tried to make things work and believed that having a family of her own to love would change everything.\n\nI was a virgin when I married John, she described. To me, divorce was a failure. ... I had hopes things were going to change. This could be the family I always wanted. It's the beginning of a new life. It could be the end of sadness.\n\nAfter the infamous night, Gallo and Bobbitt were initially charged in separate trials, Rolling Stone reported. For her, it was malicious wounding and for him, it was martial sexual assault. However, both were acquitted. Gallo, whose trial was televised by Court TV, successfully pleaded not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. The couple officially divorced in 1995.\n\n'TWILIGHT ZONE' REBOOT IN THE WORKS WITH JORDAN PEELE\n\nGallo has consistently avoided the spotlight. The magazine reported that at one point, the young woman – who was born in Ecuador but raised in Venezuela – turned down a million dollar offer to pose for Playboy at a time when she was the sole provider for her parents, who joined her in the U.S. after the divorce. Instead, she has focused on launching the Lorena Gallo Foundation, which is dedicated to raising awareness on domestic violence and offering support to loved ones.\n\nIn 1998, she did briefly stir headlines when she was accused of attacking her mother in a fight reportedly over family bills. Deseret News reported her mother Elvia Gallo testified she was the one who started the fight and denied her daughter hit her. Gallo was acquitted.\n\nAs for Bobbitt, he and his reattached manhood skyrocketed to fame. He went on to star in adult films, became a fixture on The Howard Stern Show and served as a greeter at the Bunny Ranch in Las Vegas.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBobbitt said that abandonment from his part was the real reason Gallo snapped that night. Bobbitt maintained he originally wanted out of the unhappy marriage and was not ready to become a father at that point in his life.\n\nThe thing is that she was devastated when I said that I wanted a divorce, that I was moving out, he alleged. She was never the one leaving. I always left and she always wanted to get back together. Apparently, I was her everything. I was her American dream. [But] I wasn't deep in the marriage like she was. … A woman scorned and all that bulls—-t, I guess is the old saying because Lorena got evil.\n\nLorena, however, also chronicles the numerous charges Bobbitt has been faced with over the years. In particular, it includes an interview with a tearful ex-girlfriend who claimed she was tied up and raped repeatedly by Bobbitt. He denied the allegations to The New York Times.\n\nGallo and the filmmakers behind Lorena said they hope conversations concerning domestic violence will be taken more seriously.\n\nWhen we hear the name 'Bobbitt,' we think of one of the most sensational incidents to ever be catapulted into a full-blown media spectacle, Peele said in a release sent to Fox News. With this project, Lorena has a platform to tell her truth as well as engage in a critical conversation about gender dynamics, abuse, and her demand for justice. This is Lorena's story and we're honored to help her tell it.\n\nAs for Bobbitt, Rolling Stone reported that since 2014, he has lived on disability after breaking his neck in a car accident. Most recently, Bobbitt appeared on The Dr. Oz Show, where he described being suicidal after being mutilated.\n\nThe thing is, my story was told many different ways, he said. But it was never told accurately, thoroughly from beginning to end. … The truth of the story, anybody can figure it out.\n\nLorena will be available for streaming on Amazon Feb. 15. Lorena Bobbitt: What Happened? airs Feb. 15 at 8 P.M. on Reelz.
A federal appeals court upheld a life prison sentence Monday for an influential Iowa youth basketball coach who used his position to sexually exploit more than 400 boys over 20 years.\n\nA panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Gregory Stephen's argument that his 180-year sentence was excessive because he did not kill or physically injure his victims.\n\nFEDERAL JUDGE SLAMS GHISLAINE MAXWELL FOR MISLEADING COURT ON WEALTH, MARRIAGE\n\nStephen, 45, worked with Iowa's most promising youth players as a coach of the Iowa Barnstormers, which was sponsored by Adidas and competed nationally. Many of the teenagers he coached earned college scholarships, including to play at universities such as Iowa, Northern Iowa and Wisconsin.\n\nStephen amassed a digital collection of thousands of sexual images of his players and their friends. He did so by pretending to be a teenage girl and enticing them to provide videos and photos of themselves masturbating — relationships that went on for years in some cases. He secretly recorded others undressing in bathrooms in hotels and his home.\n\nOn at least 15 occasions between 1999 and 2018, prosecutors say Stephen molested boys, often as he shared a hotel bed with them during trips to tournaments and professional basketball games.\n\nStephen pleaded guilty to sexual exploitation and pornography charges but argued his sentence was excessive because his conduct was primarily as a voyeur.\n\nCircuit Judge Raymond Gruender wrote in Monday's opinion that Stephen's argument grossly downplays the seriousness and magnitude of his offense. He agreed with U.S. District Judge C.J. Williams, who sentenced Stephen in 2019 to the maximum possible sentence, that the harm to the children was 'incalculable and profound' and radiated to their families.\n\nFurther, the district court acknowledged that Stephen's use of his position as a youth basketball coach to carry out his offense made it even more sinister, Gruender wrote.\n\nStephen is serving his sentence at the federal penitentiary in Tucson, Arizona.\n\nCLEANING CREW MISTAKE ALLOWED PORTLAND ATTEMPTED MURDER SUSPECT TO ESCAPE FROM HOLDING CELL, POLICE SAY\n\nInvestigators uncovered his crimes after Stephen's former brother-in-law found a secret recording device while performing remodeling work at Stephen's home in Monticello and gave it to police.\n\nInvestigators raided Stephen's homes and found a hard drive that contained more than 400 file folders, each with the name of a different boy, and thousands of images. A trove of additional pornographic material was waiting to be organized.\n\nThe appeals court found that the seizure of the recording device did not violate Stephen's rights. His former brother-in-law was not acting as a government agent when he discovered the hidden camera and ultimately gave it to police out of a concern that Stephen was recording boys, the court concluded.\n\nNot every Good Samaritan is a government agent, Gruender wrote.\n\nA police chief who accepted the device without a warrant did not commit an illegal search, and the Division of Criminal Investigation did not exceed the scope of a court-authorized search when examining its contents, he added.\n\nPlayers who suffered abuse are pursuing a lawsuit against the Barnstormers; the Amateur Athletic Union, which sponsored tournaments in which they played; and Adidas, alleging they were negligent in supervising Stephen.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe victimization of these youth athletes doesn't happen but for the lack of reasonable safety structures, said their attorney, Guy Cook.\n\nCook said Monday's decision could clear the way for Stephen to face a deposition in which he answers questions under oath. The lawsuit is set for trial in January 2022, absent a settlement.
Kim Kardashian is trying to kick off the New Year on the right foot despite a divorce from Kanye West that reportedly looms ahead.\n\nThe KKW Beauty mogul, 40, shared a note to her fans on Tuesday -- via her Instagram Stories -- that she and her sisters are launching into an intense workout regimen for the next 30 days.\n\nSister Boot Camp starts this month! Plant Based and Two workouts a day for 30 days to get our mind and body right for this year! Kardashian captioned the Story, in which two pairs of sneakers are featured – one a pair of Yeezy's, created by her husband and the second from a competing brand, which West used to design for in years past.\n\nNews that Kardashian is preparing to divorce the rapper and fashion designer, 43, came on the heels of an announcement from Kardashian that she had sold a 20% stake in her company to Coty for $200 million.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA REACTS TO KIM KARDASHIAN, KANYE WEST SPLIT REPORTS: 'REALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOALS'\n\nKardashian has not yet filed for divorce from West and a source relayed to People magazine on Wednesday that the mother of four is trying to stay positive for the sake of the couple's children: daughters North, 7, and Chicago, 2, and sons Saint, 5, and Psalm, who turns 2 in May.\n\nDecember was a rough month for Kim. She has been living separately from Kanye. Over the holidays, it was hard for her to stay positive, said the insider. She has been trying her best, though, for the kids. She stayed in Los Angeles for New Year's [Eve]. Kourtney and Khloé [Kardashian] were around to support her. She is very grateful to have her sisters to lean on.\n\nWHAT WOULD BE AT STAKE IF KANYE WEST, KIM KARDASHIAN WERE TO DIVORCE? EXPERT WEIGHS IN\n\nKardashian is also said to besad about the growing prospect of a divorce from West, the source said.\n\nShe just feels she has done everything in her power to make her marriage work, the source told People. Even though she has been thinking about divorce for months, she hasn't filed because she feels terrible for the kids.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nFor the time being, Kardashian and the children are reportedly remaining at the family's home in their gated community in Calabasas, Calif., which West owns the rights to, while Kardashian owns the adjoining plots of land near the home.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe provides a safe and stable environment for the kids, the source said. She is a great mom and the kids will be fine.
Two months into an arranged marriage, Fozia Sadiq, a young Pakistani immigrant, found herself trapped in the suburbs of Dallas, Texas, with a violent husband.\n\nShe says he routinely beat her and intimidated her into never going anywhere in public without him.\n\nMy neck had so many bruises, and I had scratches all over my arms, Sadiq told FOXNews.com through an interpreter.\n\nA practicing Muslim, Sadiq finally escaped in 2006, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\nShe says she stayed up all night reading the Koran and was physically abused by her husband for not cleaning up the kitchen the next morning.\n\nHe yelled at her, kicked her and punished her, says Mazna Hussain, an attorney who is helping Sadiq remain in the United States.\n\nAnd when she was on the ground [during the beating], at that point she finally decided to leave before he killed her.\n\nThere are no solid statistics on the rate of domestic violence within the Muslim-American community, and it is difficult to determine whether Muslim women are victimized more than women in the general population.\n\nBut advocacy groups say Sadiq's story is not an isolated case.\n\nOn New Year's Day, two teenage Egyptian-American sisters, Amina and Sarah Said, were shot dead in Irving, Texas. Police are searching for their father, Yaser Abdel Said, who reportedly was angry with their American-like behavior, which included dating.\n\nAccording to the girls' great-aunt, their father had been abusing them for years. She says they, along with their mother, fled after he threatened to kill the girls.\n\nThe great-aunt called the murders honor killings for bringing shame to the family, a charge Islam Said, the girls' brother, denies. Police say they are looking into motives.\n\nAllegations that the girls were killed for dishonoring the family's name has brought greater focus on all forms of abuse in the Muslim-American community in what some say is a bigger problem than is reported because, they say, it is veiled in secrecy.\n\nI suspect it's happening a lot more than we think, says Hussain, who works with battered Muslim women at the Tahirih Justice Center in Northern Virginia.\n\nWe hear again and again from [abused] women who say, 'I can't tell my parents back home because if they find out, my younger sister can't get married,' says Meghna Gozwami, client services coordinator for DAYA, a South-Asian immigrant group that provides legal and financial assistance for abused families. The name DAYA means compassion in Sanskrit.\n\nDAYA, which runs a domestic violence hotline, has seen a dramatic increase in distress calls --almost 20 times more -- in the last five years (from 189 calls in 2003 to 3,308 last year).\n\nClick here to read more about DAYA.\n\nIt isn't clear if the increase in calls is due to more abuse or whether more immigrant women, exposed to America's open culture, have felt the freedom to seek help.\n\nBut Gozwami says she is sure that the women who call the hotline are afraid not only for their own safety but for fear that reporting the abuse will shame their families.\n\nThose working to stop the violence say part of the problem is that women, often recent immigrants, face intense family and religious pressure to keep quiet.\n\nMany Muslim immigrant women do not even know that they are victims of a crime. That's because in their home country it may be legal or acceptable for men to physically punish or even kill their wives and daughters for dishonoring the family.\n\nAnd when an immigrant woman tries to get help, advocates say, an abusive husband often will threaten to have her deported.\n\nWithin our community we are still struggling with the issue of domestic abuse, says Hadayai Majeed, who runs the Baitul Salaam shelter in Atlanta, which caters to Muslim women.\n\nShe says women and girls who come to the shelter sometimes have been physically punished for what their fathers, husbands and brothers believe is behavior that dishonors the family.\n\nDating a non-Muslim or not wearing a traditional head scarf can trigger a beating.\n\nThis can be interpreted as being extremely rebellious or be an excuse for abuse, Majeed says.\n\nNot only is this behavior culturally accepted in many Islamic countries, but it is encouraged. Last year a prominent Saudi cleric went on television to tell Muslim men how to properly beat their wives.\n\nIn the video he instructs viewers: Beating in the face is forbidden ... even if you want your camel or donkey to start walking, you are not allowed to beat it in the face. If this is true for animals, it is all the more true when it comes to humans\n\nClick here to play the video.\n\nHere in America, advocacy groups say those who turn to their community for help do not always find it, in particular from some religious leaders who, although they are in the United States, still hold to cultural traditions of their homeland and do not clearly reject violence against women.\n\nI had another client facing severe domestic violence from her husband, and her Imam kept going to the woman and persuading her to go back to her abuser, Hussain says.\n\nAuthor Phyllis Chesler, who writes about Islamic gender issues in the United States, believes domestic violence against Muslim-American women, not just immigrants, is covered up by an Islamic culture that treats women as second-class citizens.\n\nI'm not saying every Muslim family does it or that every Imam encourages it or that only Muslim men beat their wives, but Muslim men have control over their wives, she says.\n\nAnd monitoring the chastity of their women is an obsession, because if she loses it, or has a boyfriend or wants to marry who she wants to marry, this could be a death sentence.\n\nThe practice of murdering a woman or girl who is believed to have damaged the family honor is culturally accepted in countries including Jordan, Pakistan and the Palestinian territories.\n\nAccording to a 2000 report by the United Nations Population Fund, as many as 5,000 women worldwide are murdered each year in so-called honor killings. But reported killings in Europe and North America have raised concerns that Muslim women in the West are becoming increasingly vulnerable.\n\nThe most recent case came in December when a Canadian teenager died after an alleged attack by her father over a dispute about whether she should wear a traditional Muslim head scarf.\n\nTo date, there officially are no documented cases of honor killings in the United States. The recent slayings of Amina and Sarah Said, however, have triggered a debate over whether this is the first, and if the deadly ritual has been exported to America and more killings are on the way.\n\nMembers of groups such as the Tahirih Justice Center say they are watching the case closely.\n\nThere is a very conservative, twisted view out there about Islam, Hussain says.\n\nShariq Siddiqui, the executive director of the Muslim Alliance of Indiana, says some Muslims manipulate their faith and culture to justify abuse.\n\nI hate to use him as an example, but Usama bin Laden is doing this at a macro level, and Muslim-American men who abuse women are doing it at a micro level, says Siddiqui, who works with Muslim domestic violence victims through the Julian Center, a non-profit agency in Indianapolis.\n\nBut many are reluctant to quantify to what degree Muslim faith perpetuates the problem.\n\nPracticing Muslims, even battered women, do not want to portray Islam as an abusive religion or demonize all Muslim men.\n\nThere's domestic abuse in every community, says Rafia Zakaria, an Indiana University scholar and writer who is working to educate Muslims about spousal abuse.\n\nLike American women, Muslim women who are abused face psychological pressure from their abusers, and they're afraid to speak out.\n\nMuslim-Americans just recently have started to confront the problem. Some domestic violence shelters have opened for Muslim women, mostly in big cities. And activists are beginning to reach out to sympathetic Imams who will teach Muslims in the United States that domestic violence is unacceptable.\n\nZakaria has launched a legal defense fund to support Muslim victims of abuse.\n\nI won't lie, it's a controversial problem to talk about, Zakaria says. But the problem is within.\n\nFozia Sadiq knows that all too well. She was one of the lucky ones who got out of her abusive relationship.\n\nIn my culture there are men like this, even well-educated men, who call women ignorant and backwards, she says. But they are the ignorant ones.

Conservatives ripped The New York Times for describing President Biden as perhaps the most religiously observant commander in chief in half a century in a story published Saturday.\n\nPundits were quick to point out former presidents George W. Bush and Jimmy Carter for their outspoken faith.\n\nWHITE HOUSE SAYS BIDEN IS A 'DEVOUT CATHOLIC' WHEN ASKED ABOUT ABORTION POLICIES\n\nGeorge W Bush said Jesus Christ was his favorite philosopher and credited Billy Graham with changing his life. Jimmy Carter taught Sunday School. Cmon, pastor and author Daniel Darling wrote on Twitter.\n\nI think it is fair to say that Biden is sincere in a version of liberal Christianity, but the most religiously observant in a half century? Not even the most religiously observant liberal in that stretch (Carter), the Washington Examiner's Jim Antle wrote on Twitter.\n\nHe's more religiously observant than the Republicans you told us were turning the country into a Christian theocracy? the Washington Examiner's Seth Mandel wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe Times article claims Biden was reflecting Pope Francis' focus on environmental protection, poverty and migration by recommitting to the Paris climate accord and abandoning construction of a border wall. However, the author goes on to note that Biden faced criticism from other Catholic leaders for policies 'that would advance moral evils,' especially 'in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender.'\n\nHEAD OF US BISHOPS' CONFERENCE WARNS BIDEN WOULD 'ADVANCE MORAL EVILS AND THREATEN HUMAN LIFE'\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation's Mary Margaret Olohan pointed out that coverage of Biden was starkly different from coverage of his fellow Catholic, Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nLest we forget, the media roundly mocked Amy Coney Barrett's Catholicism. Her adherence to Catholic principle was used to suggest that she was unfit to be a Supreme Court justice. People suggested her large family was extreme and that she adopted her children for show, Olohan wrote on Twitter.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, Roman Catholic bishops recently criticized Biden's executive order on applying anti-discrimination protections to certain groups, arguing it didn't properly account for religious liberty and furthered false theories on human sexuality.\n\nFox News' Sam Dorman contributed to this report.

I would have really liked it better had I not gained 117 pounds during quarantine, he told DeGeneres at the time. I thought it made me look younger, but I was still just as fat. Now I'm actually trying to lose weight.\n\nDespite how he might feel about his current weight, the 6-foot-5-tall singer said he is confident that Stefani will marry him.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nShelton and Stefani went public with their engagement in October after five years of dating.\n\nThe country singer is two-times divorced, having been married to singer Miranda Lambert and school teacher Kaynette Williams.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nStefani divorced husband Gavin Rossdale after 14 years of marriage in 2016.

Minutes after Chief Justice John Roberts gaveled out President Trump's impeachment trial, which had consumed the Senate for almost three weeks, Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., got right back to what he's said is his top priority -- confirming judges.\n\nLess than half-an-hour after TV networks cut away from the Senate to dive into the ramifications of the body acquitting Trump, McConnell filed cloture on the nomination of Judge Andrew Brasher to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, a procedural step that moved the controversial nominee one step closer to confirmation. The Senate took the next step to confirming Brasher with a 46-41 cloture vote Monday, then confirmed him 52-43 on Tuesday.\n\nProgressive groups, which have opposed many Trump nominees, cried foul over the move.\n\nLast Wednesday, a narrow majority of the Senate voted to cover up the president's actions. Immediately after the vote to betray our democracy, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell turned right back to nominations, said Lena Zwarensteyn, the Fair Courts campaign director for The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. McConnell is staying the course on shielding the president's actions from checks and balances and stacking the courts with nominees who have records of hostility to civil and human rights, particularly voting rights.\n\nTHREE DEMOCRATIC ATTORNEYS GENERAL FILE SUIT TO FORCE THE US TO RATIFY EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT\n\nOthers on Monday a conference call with reporters that was organized by the liberal group included Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., former Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum and NAACP Alabama State Conference President Bernard Simelton. They said Brasher has a history of fighting against voting rights, gay rights, women's health care and environmental protection.\n\nVoting rights are at the very foundation of civil liberties and civil rights in our society, and we should be doing everything possible to protect and defend them, Coons said. I'm gravely concerned that Judge Andrew Brasher, if confirmed to the Eleventh Circuit, would only continue the efforts to roll them back. Judge Brasher's record and lack of candor during his confirmation hearing show that he is unfit for this appellate judgeship in the Eleventh Circuit, and I will be voting no.\n\nThe 38-year-old Brasher is Trump's 51st judge confirmed to the appeals courts and 188th overall, according to a Heritage Foundation count. He was confirmed to the Middle District Court of Alabama last year and was previously the Alabama Solicitor General, a job in which he argued before the Supreme Court and the 11th Circuit, the bench Trump and Senate Republicans would like him to join. Also a former white-collar criminal defense lawyer and civil litigator, Brasher received a unanimous Well-Qualified rating from the American Bar Association for his nomination to the 11th Circuit.\n\n'Immediately after the vote to betray our democracy, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell turned right back to nominations.' — Lena Zwarensteyn, Fair Courts campaign director, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights\n\nRepublicans have been supportive of Brasher's nomination, which saw a cloture vote split on party lines with no defections either way.\n\nAndrew Brasher is an outstanding choice to serve as a district judge for the Middle District of Alabama, Sen. Richard Shelby said when Brasher was confirmed to his district court post in May. His judicial temperament and vast legal experience make him well-suited to assume this new role.\n\nShelby was just as supportive of the judge when Trump nominated him to the 11th Circuit in November.\n\nWHO IS LEV PARNAS? A 'CONMAN'? A 'GROUPIE'? OR IS HE CREDIBLE?\n\nThe Leadership Conference cites several issues, chiefly Brasher's work to restrict voting rights, as reasons why it asked Senators to oppose the judge's nomination.\n\nIn 2013, in the infamous Shelby County v. Holder decision, five right-wing justices on the Supreme Court gutted the landmark Voting Rights Act, which had been repeatedly reauthorized by strong bipartisan majorities in Congress, the organization wrote in a letter. Mr. Brasher filed an amicus brief asking the Court to do just that. He asserted that 'Congress violated the Constitution' when it reauthorized the Voting Rights Act in 2006.\n\nShelby County, Ala., was challenging a provision in the Voting Rights Act (VRA) that required certain jurisdictions to prove to the federal government that any election law they implemented was nondiscriminatory, a rule it said was an overreach by Congress. The majority agreed with Brasher in the case that Congress did, in fact, exceed its constitutional authority. But his amicus brief -- or friend of the court brief -- put him at odds with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who wrote in a dissent that the VRA provision was still relevant because Alabama had been found to violate the VRA more often than almost all other states between 1982 and 2005.\n\nBeyond voting rights, critics point to an amicus brief Brasher filed on behalf of Alabama that opposed federally mandated marriage equality in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case, arguing that Sexual relationships between men and women – and only such relationships – have the ability to provide children with both their biological mother and their biological father in a stable family unit. Brasher would also not explicitly say that Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court case that mandated public schools be racially integrated, was correctly decided.\n\nPROSECUTORS WANT ROGER STONE TO SERVE MORE THAN 7 YEARS IN PRISON\n\nThe judge said the fact he might one day face a case with Brown v. Board of Education as a precedent meant he should not publicly take a position on it, a stance several Trump judicial nominees have taken in Senate hearings.\n\nBrasher also didn't receive what's called a blue slip, from Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., the traditional name for approval from a judge's home-state senators. The Senate typically would not move forward with a nomination without blue slips, but McConnell has done away with that precedent, particularly for nominations to the California-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals with Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., staunchly opposing Trump's picks.\n\nBrasher is Trump's sixth appointment to the 11th Circuit, meaning the president has filled half the court's bench in his just over three years in office. Trump's and McConnell's focus on confirming judges has allowed them to change the balance on the 11th Circuit from a majority of Democrat-appointed judges to a majority of Republican-appointed judges. The same is the case on the 3rd Circuit and the 2nd Circuit.\n\nCONFIRMATION OF LATEST TRUMP JUDICIAL PICK TILTS BALANCE OF 11TH CIRCUIT COURT\n\nMcConnell boasted about that accomplishment at a dinner for the Federalist Society, a powerful organization of conservative and libertarian lawyers, late last year.\n\nBrasher's confirmation vote Tuesday afternoon was immediately be followed by a batch of cloture votes on four district court nominees, setting them up to likely be confirmed later this week.\n\nMcConnell's redoubled effort to shepherd one young conservative judge after another into lifetime appointments is sure to please conservatives like Carrie Severino, the president of the Judicial Crisis Network.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs an appellate advocate, Judge Brasher argued three times before the Supreme Court and seventeen times before the Eleventh Circuit, Severino said in a statement to Fox News Tuesday morning. Yet despite Brasher's impressive credentials and experience, the left persists in its sad and tiresome smear campaign against President Trump's outstanding nominees.\n\nShe continued: I am hopeful the Senate will once again see through the baseless smears, and vote to confirm a great judge.
Director Jeff Kanew had no doubt that Kirk Douglas was crazy in love with his wife Anne Buydens.\n\nThe filmmaker and the Hollywood titan worked together on the 1986 film, Tough Guys.\n\nI've been married several times and I certainly didn't experience anything like what they did, the 75-year-old recently told Closer Weekly.\n\nThey were married for like 65 years, he continued. They met in Paris and it was love at first sight, although they didn't get together for a year or so because he was engaged to another actress at the time. He was seeing Anne and this actress at the same time but realized he wanted to be with Anne so broke off his engagement to this other actress and they've been together ever since.\n\nDouglas, one of the last stars from Hollywood's golden era, passed away on Feb. 5 at age 103.\n\nLORETTA YOUNG'S SON SAYS '40S STAR REMAINED DEVOTED TO HER FAITH DURING FINAL YEARS: 'SHE HAD A MORAL COMPASS'\n\nJANE SEYMOUR TURNS 69 — THE 'DR.

Buydens, 100, was doing publicity at the time.\n\nHe would later owe his very life to Buydens, with whom he remained for more than 60 years. In 1958, the film producer Michael Todd, then the husband of actress Elizabeth Taylor, offered Douglas a ride on his private yet named Lucky Liz. Buydens insisted that he not go, worrying about a private plane. Douglas eventually gave in. The plane crashed, killing everyone on board.\n\nDouglas and Buydens went on to become one of Hollywood's leading philanthropists and together, they launched The Douglas Foundation, which has donated millions to a wide range of institutions, including the Children's Hospital Los Angeles and the Motion Picture & Television Fund.\n\nIn 2017, the couple published a book about their decades-long romance titled Kirk and Anne: Letters of Love, Laughter, and a Lifetime in Hollywood.\n\nThey were always close, even though he was on location a lot and that's why they wrote so many letters together, Kanew explained to the outlet.

As friends. As husband and wife. As business partners and it went on and on. There's no dark side to [the] marriage like most of us have.\n\nKanew said he developed a close relationship with Buydens while he worked on the Oscar winner's documentary with his family titled Kirk Douglas: Before I Forget.\n\nShe's very smart and has a very dry sense of humor, and she's very protective of her family and husband, he said. Most of the time I've known them she was really running the production company and would deal with publicity and made sure things were done the right way. She runs the household and takes care of the staff and makes sure the staff is treated well. They call her the boss. She's a very strong woman.\n\nIn 2017, Douglas told Fox News he found a way to get close to Buydens despite her hesitations in being charmed by the movie star.\n\nI couldn't convince her to go out with me, but I finally convinced her to do my publicity on the film 'Act of Love,' he explained at the time. I knew it would be strictly business, yet she still fascinated me and I wanted to know all about her. She had a wicked sense of humor, spoke four languages and was the most sophisticated and elegant woman I had ever met. So I fell in love with her.\n\n'THE SINNER' STAR BILL PULLMAN REFLECTS ON HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH JOHN CANDY: 'HE TOOK ME UNDER HIS WING'\n\n'I DREAM OF JEANNIE' STAR BARBARA EDEN SHARES THE SECRET BEHIND HER 29-YEAR MARRIAGE: 'IT'S NOT EASY'\n\nDouglas also told Fox News that he credited date night for sparking the romance every day over the years.\n\n[Date night is] the same as it's been throughout our marriage, he said.

Toni Tennille will always have a special place in her heart for Daryl Dragon.\n\nWhen Dragon, the cap-wearing Captain of the Captain and Tennille duo, passed away earlier this month at age 76 of renal failure at a hospice in Prescott, Ariz., Tennille, his longtime musical partner and ex-wife, was by his side.\n\nDARYL DRAGON, 'CAPTAIN' OF POP BAND THE CAPTAIN AND TENNILLE, DEAD AT 76\n\nHe was a brilliant musician with many friends who loved him greatly, the 78-year-old told Fox News in a statement at the time. I was at my most creative in my life when I was with him.\n\nIn the latest issue of Closer Weekly currently on newsstands, Tennille revealed that after their 2014 divorce, she left their Prescott home to live in Florida, where she spent two years writing her memoir. However, Tennille couldn't stop thinking about Dragon.\n\nI still had medical power of attorney, and when I finished the book, something said to me, 'I need to go back to Prescott. I should be nearer to him,' Tennille told Closer Weekly.\n\nDespite a painful breakup after nearly 40 years of marriage, Tennille was determined to help her longtime love however possible. According to the magazine, once she returned to Prescott, Tennille fired home health aides whom she said kept him drugged at night. Tennille also found Dragon a new place to live that offered better care and visited him regularly.\n\nBEACH BOYS' MIKE LOVE REMEMBERS THE LATE DARYL DRAGON\n\nAnd Tennille remained by Dragon's side until the end.\n\nI was waiting in the room with him, he and I alone, she recalled about their final moments together. I said, 'I know you're there and want you to know that I loved you anyway,' she said. Then the paramedics came, and he passed away.\n\nShe also fulfilled Dragon's final wish, which was to have his ashes scattered around Granite Mountain in Prescott.\n\nHe was a brilliant man, she said. And I loved him with all my heart.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd their musical hits will forever capture how much Tennille really adored Dragon.\n\nThey were my love letters to him, she said.\n\nIn 2016, while promoting her memoir on the Today show, Tennille revealed what caused the seemingly fairytale marriage to end. At the time, she said their relationship ultimately failed due to intimacy issues.\n\nSex is not love, sex is not intimacy, she explained at the time. He just couldn't be affectionate, he couldn't just give me a hug. … And I don't blame him because he came from a very, very difficult family and he had a famous, but overbearing father (conductor and composer Carmen Dragon).\n\nHe was raised quite differently then I was, she added. None of this is his fault.\n\nTennille said the childless marriage lasted for as long as it did because she attempted to fix things over the years.\n\nI kept trying and trying and thinking I could bring this man who has so much to give into the light, she said. I wanted him to experience the joy that I had with my very loving family.\n\nIn the end, Tennille walked away. But there was no bad blood between the former couple. In fact, Dragon even gave the book his blessing.\n\nTennille told Closer Weekly that Dragon was also aware of the Today appearance.\n\n… He said, 'I thought you were great — I'm very proud of you,' she said. Those were things he hardly ever said to me, but it was lovely to hear. And just a few days ago, our bandmate Rusty Higgins sent the last email he had from Daryl right after our divorce that said, 'Toni left me, as well she should have.' It was heartbreaking — that's when I found out he knew I had to leave because I was going down with him.\n\nIn 1967, Dragon – a classically trained musician – started playing keyboard for The Beach Boys, which led to him being given the nickname Captain by lead singer Mike Love because of his affinity for wearing a captain's hat while on stage.\n\nFour years later, Dragon met Tennille, and the pair soon began performing together, with Tennille singing and Dragon on keyboards — he also later served as a producer for Captain and Tennille.\n\nThe duo went on to top the 1970s music charts with hits including Muskrat Love, Shop Around and Love Will Keep Us Together.\n\nLove Will Keep Us Together catapulted the couple to fame with their breakthrough coming in 1975, when they covered the Neil Sedaka-Howard Greenfield song.\n\nThe Captain and Tennille version topped the charts – and acknowledged Sedaka's authorship by singing Sedaka's back at the end of the song – and won a Grammy for record of the year.\n\nThey followed with a mix of covers such as Muskrat Love and Shop Around and original songs, including Tennille's Do That to Me One More Time, which hit No. 1 in 1980. They also briefly starred in their own television variety show.\n\nDragon is survived by his older brother, Doug Dragon, and two nieces, Kelly Arbout and Renee Henn.\n\nThe Beach Boys' Mike Love previously paid tribute to Dragon.\n\nLove – Beach Boys co-founder with his cousins Brian, Dennis and Carl Wilson – gave Dragon the nickname Captain after the musician started playing keyboard for the band in 1967 and showed his affinity for wearing a captain's hat onstage.\n\nDaryl Dragon affectionately known as Captain Keyboard was a cherished member of our touring band, Love told Fox News in a statement at the time of Dragon's death. He was the modest genius whose penchant for sporting a captain's cap earned him the moniker Captain Keyboard.\n\nWhether in the studio, on stage or just hanging out, he was loved by all of us who had the pleasure of knowing him, the Beach Boys lead singer, 77, continued. He was a genius of the keyboard and along with Toni Tennille achieved great success as Captain and Tennille.\n\nIt's a sad way to start the New Year hearing of his passing. He gave us 'Love Will Keep Us Together': a great thing to remember when we think of him. He left us a great legacy through his music. RIP Captain.\n\nFox News' Mariah Haas and the Associated Press contributed to this report.
Lynda Carter, who famously played Diana Prince in the hit '70s series Wonder Woman, is grateful she has overcome one battle — alcoholism.\n\nI've been in recovery for 23 years, the 69-year-old told the U.K.'s DailyMail on Thursday.\n\nAnd I didn't even start drinking till I was in my mid-20s, the former pageant star continued. I would stop drinking for two or three years, then start again and it just felt terrible. That was a long time ago and now I'm very happy.\n\nAccording to the outlet, there is a history of alcoholism in the actress' family. And during the time Carter began drinking, she was unhappily married to her first husband, talent manager Ron Samuels.\n\nMOTHER DOLORES HART EXPLAINS WHY SHE LEFT HOLLYWOOD TO BECOME A NUN: 'GOD CALLED ME'\n\nThat union lasted from 1977 until 1982.\n\nSince then, Carter has found love again. She and her current husband, lawyer and business Robert A. Altman, tied the knot in 1984. They share two children.\n\nCarter also decamped from Hollywood more than 30 years ago with Altman and currently resides in Potomac, Md.\n\nIt works because we have different personalities, she explained about her lasting marriage. He's very smart, very charming and very even-tempered, and while he's a lot of fun and has a great sense of humor, around people he's more self-contained. I have always been… attention-seeking!\n\nShe's also grateful for her time in Wonder Woman, which aired from 1975 until 1979. The outlet noted Carter was struggling to pay the rent when she got the life-changing role. Carter has since kept busying acting and most recently, appeared in Wonder Woman 1984 alongside Gal Gadot as the beloved superhero.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCarter told Fox News in 2016 she gave Gadot, 35, her blessing.\n\nI want it to move to the next generation of women, and inspire the next generation of women, she said. There is some visceral identity that people have with the character that I played because they went in their backyards and they pretended to be her. We share that goddess within, maybe, and I enjoy hearing those stories. So I don't really tire of it.\n\nAnd whatever happened to Carter's iconic suit? She kept one of the original costumes from the show's first season and one from the second.\n\nThey're falling apart in a closet somewhere, she chuckled.\n\nINGRID BERGMAN'S GRANDSON RECALLS GROWING UP WITH THE 'CASABLANCA' STAR, HOW SHE ENDURED ROMANTIC SCANDAL\n\nIn addition to spending time with her family, Carter has also been pursuing her first love: music. Carter first embarked on her career as an artist before taking part in a beauty pageant and eventually signing up for acting classes.\n\nPeople are always trying to put me in a box, she said. Either I'm too tall, I'm too pretty, [or] I'm too this… or 'You're Wonder Woman,' or 'You're an actress,' or 'You're a singer, so you can't do that.' I think that people like to put you down to one line – a synopsis of some kind. And I just don't pay any attention to it.
Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are barely communicating, according to a new report, as the couple's marriage of nearly seven years appears to be coming to an end.\n\nThe reality TV star and rapper, who tied the knot in May 2014, are completely done and no longer speaking, a source told E!

She has reportedly hired Laura Wasse, a well-known divorce attorney in Hollywood who frequently oversees starry splits.\n\nPeople's insider claimed the 43-year-old rapper was set to begin discussions with divorce lawyers.\n\nReps for Kardashian and West did not respond to Fox News' multiple requests for comment.\n\nWest, a Grammy-winning musician, has been noticeably silent regarding the divorce rumors, was last active on social media during the 2020 presidential election.

While many celebrities opt to keep their relationships private, a handful have been candid about choices they've made in their personal lives — even when certain issues may not be easy to talk about.\n\nThe latest Bachelor star Colton Underwood, a former linebacker for the San Diego Chargers, was thrust into the spotlight after admitting on camera that he was saving himself. And the topic has followed him around ever since.\n\nIn fact, during the first episode of the 23rd season of The Bachelor, Colton's abstinence surfaced dozens of times, according to The Washington Post, which pointed out its the first time a virgin has been in the lead role on the show. Chris Harrison, a longtime host of the show, even helped sell the most dramatic season ever by reportedly asking viewers if he will lose his virginity.\n\nCOLTON UNDERWOOD NAMED THE NEW 'BACHELOR': 'HOPEFULLY I'LL COME OUT OF IT ENGAGED'\n\nThe reality star acknowledged it took him a long time to gain the confidence to truly be himself — but he's happy he did.\n\n[Being a virgin] needs to be normalized, he previously told People. It's just who I am and what I believe in. I hold a lot of value in it and I hold it to a high standard. I'm just waiting for the right heart.\n\n[Being a virgin] needs to be normalized. It's just who I am and what I believe in. I hold a lot of value in it and I hold it to a high standard. I'm just waiting for the right heart. — Colton Underwood\n\nHere's a look at some celebrities — like Underwood — who have publicly discussed saving themselves.\n\nTim Tebow\n\nFormer NFL player Tim Tebow, who is currently an outfielder with the New York Mets organization in the minor leagues, has been clear about his desire to have a proper engagement and a church wedding.\n\nTebow is known for standing by his strong Christian beliefs — and even trademarked his signature move the Tebow, which resembles kneeling down for prayer.\n\nWe have to let our faith make decisions, Tebow once said in an interview on Fox & Friends. We have to let our dreams, we have to let our passions, we have to let our purpose lead us into the right decisions.\n\nTIM TEBOW ENGAGED TO FORMER MISS UNIVERSE DEMI-LEIGH NEL-PETERS\n\nAnd he hopes his future wife has the same values. The former quarterback just recently announced his engagement to former Miss Universe Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters.\n\nOf course I want a woman who I'm attracted to, a previously single Tebow once told People. That's a very big part of it. But I'm looking for someone who loves Jesus and loves people. Someone who makes me want to be a better person for her. And she has to want kids and has to want to adopt. That's a requirement.\n\nColton Underwood\n\nUnlike Tebow, Colton Underwood doesn't just cite faith for his reasoning to hold off on having sex.\n\nRather than waiting for marriage, Underwood says he's simply waiting for the right person.\n\nIt's just a lot of things that go into it. It's not a simple answer, he told Entertainment Tonight. People ask me the question and they expect this, 'Boom, this is why,' and I can't give them that, because that's not how it is ... That's just the facts.\n\nI really hope that throughout all of this, you get to see different sides of me than just the label of virgin. — Colton Underwood\n\nFor Underwood, it's important that he's truly in love and it's meaningful.\n\nI really hope that throughout all of this, you get to see different sides of me than just the label of virgin, he told the site.\n\nLet's hope that there's more to it than just the virginity thing, he added, noting that the topic will continue to come up throughout this season. But it's not up for me to prove anything or to have to defend it, but I think if people are looking for more clarity on it, or more background on it, they're definitely going to get that.\n\nCarrie Underwood\n\nCountry darling Carrie Underwood shocked fans in 2007 when she revealed to Slate magazine that she was planning on waiting to have sex until her wedding night.\n\nThe American Idol veteran didn't have to wait long to find the one. Three years later, she married hockey player Mike Fisher.\n\nTamera Mowry\n\nSister, Sister star Tamera Mowry revealed that she was 29 years old when she lost her virginity, according to The Daily Mail.\n\nI don't know how to explain this. I'm religious, so I waited until I was 29 to lose my virginity, she told HOT97NY in 2013, per the publication.\n\nShe later explained that she regretted not initially waiting for marriage, so she decided to become abstinent once again until her wedding day.\n\n'You may not understand this [but] I did it, then I felt guilty, then I became celibate until I got married, she explained.\n\nMowry married Adam Housley, a former senior correspondent for Fox News. He departed the network in 2017 after 17 years.\n\nJessica Simpson\n\nJessica Simpson, too, decided to wait.\n\nA minister's daughter, Simpson was given a purity ring at the age of 12 and agreed to stay abstinent until she found the one. And she kept her promise.\n\nThe singer waited for marriage with her now-ex-husband Nick Lachey. She's now married to former NFL player Eric Johnson.\n\nI'm so lucky I didn't lose my virginity in the back of a Jeep or something. — Jessica Simpson\n\nIt was the most amazing moment of my life, Simpson told Blender about her special night, per E! News. I'm so lucky I didn't lose my virginity in the back of a Jeep or something. Instead, I had this amazing, elaborate wedding and I topped it off with that.
The subliminal messages keep coming from 90 Day Fiancé couple Jonathan Rivera and Fernanda Flores.\n\nAfter announcing her return to social media on Monday following the pair's split, Flores drew the attention of her estranged husband when she shared a crestfallen image of herself on Instagram and paired it with an eyebrow-raising message.\n\n'90 DAY FIANCE' STAR JONATHAN RIVERA, 32, ON WHY HIS MARRIAGE TO TEEN WIFE FAILED\n\nSome of the kindest souls I know have lived in a world that was not so kind to them, Flores, 20, captioned the portrait. Some of the best human beings I know, have been through so much at the hands of others, and the will still love deeply, they still care. Sometimes, it's people who have been hurt the most, who refuse to be hardened in this world, because they would never want to make another person feel the same way they themselves have felt.\n\nRivera, 32, appeared to respond to his wife on Tuesday with a quote transposed over a couple embracing each other while walking, which read, Be good to people for no reason. Rivera subtitled the image with #nocaptionneeded.\n\n'90 DAY FIANCE' STAR FERNANDA FLORES SHARES CRYPTIC POST AFTER SPLIT FROM OLDER HUSBAND: 'NOW FEELING NOTHING'\n\nSuddenly, it was Flores' turn to respond – and the model shared a photo of herself topless and standing behind a gate wearing only a biker jacket and jeans. Don't judge someone without knowing the whole story. You may think you understand, but you don't, she captioned the black and white image.\n\nFlores, who wed Rivera when she was just 19, has been largely silent on her separation from Rivera. The pair's relationship and wedding were detailed on Season 6 of the TLC show.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJust one day after Rivera took to Instagram Live to confirm the split, Flores admitted to feeling nothing at all in a sexy Instagram post.\n\nRivera and Flores met while he was traveling in Mexico on vacation when Flores was just 18 and they married a year later.\n\nFox News' Sasha Savitsky contributed to this report.
Alan Alda is still feeling the love.\n\nThe 82-year-old actor, a Golden Globe and Emmy-winner, became the 55th recipient of Screen Actors Guild (SAG) lifetime achievement award in late January 2018. The award was handed by Tom Hanks in the televised ceremony.\n\nALAN ALDA OPENS UP ABOUT PARKINSON'S DIAGNOSIS\n\nThroughout a career that has spanned seven decades, Alda has appeared in The West Wing, The Aviator and Manhattan Murder Mystery, just to name a few. However, he is best known for his role as Hawkeye Pierce in the hit TV series M*A*S*H. That series aired from 1972 until 1983.\n\nAlda has since won six Emmy Awards and was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 2004 for his role in The Aviator.\n\nAll I can tell you is that I was smiling all night, Alda told Fox News. Nothing bothered me. No mattered what happened, I was very happy. It makes you very, very happy. I recommend it to everybody.\n\nBut Alda isn't just sitting back and savoring the fruits of his decades-long labor. In fact, the surviving cast members of M*A*S*H, which followed the staff of a mobile Army surgical hospital during the Korean War, have reunited for Alda's Clear + Vivid podcast. The reunion was supposed to happen earlier in 2017 but was postponed after Jamie Farr, who starred as Max Klinger, nearly lost his home in the California wildfires.\n\nALAN ALDA GETS EMOTIONAL\n\nThe reason why I wanted to bring them together was not just for the reunion — we have reunions all the time, explained Alda. We get together for dinner at least once a year. What I realized was that the experience with them on M*A*S*H taught me something that really led in part to the podcast in itself.\n\nIn July 2018, the National Press Club reported Alda was launching a podcast to encourage meaningful conversations that lead to better understanding of one another. At the time, he cited his experience as the host of PBS's Scientific American Frontiers during the '90s, where he interviewed scientists about how they can use language that the general public could understand, as inspiration.\n\nAlda said he and his M*A*S*H castmates were always determined to better understand each other over the years.\n\nWe figured out how to relay to one another off camera by sitting in a circle of chairs and just kidding with one another and laughing together, recalled Alda. So we had this connection when cameras turned on. And it turned our performances into something much more alive than it would have been otherwise. It was the essence of the show. Once we began talking to each other, we quickly got past that experience of sitting in chairs and sharing stories.\n\nAlda said that even now, he's still learning some surprising facts about the making of M*A*S*H.\n\nLORETTA SWIT TELLS ALL\n\nMike Farrell tells a story really well about a series of practical jokes that everybody played on one another, Alda chuckled. It started with a hilarious joke that got even more hilarious when the other person got revenge. I wasn't in on the practical jokes. So I didn't know what happened. But it's a really wonderful story and Mike tells it very well on the podcast.\n\nAlda also recalled filming the show's final episode, titled Goodbye, Farewell and Amen, which he also directed. The Washington Post reported more than 106 million viewers watched the series finale. The newspaper shared the episode was so highly anticipated that 30-second advertising slots sold for $50,000, more than some slots for the 1983 Super Bowl.\n\nIn addition to this, the United Press International reported an estimated million viewers in New York City alone used the toilet after the show ended, pouring 6.7 million gallons of water through the city's sewers.\n\nAlda said the pressure was on to deliver a final goodbye that fans wouldn't forget.\n\nI wanted to end it in a way that showed that everybody was going home with some kind of wound from the war, said Alda. That the war didn't leave anybody the way they were when they started. Sometimes it was physical wounds and sometimes it was emotional. We wanted to be authentic about that and genuine.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI also wanted to give everybody a goodbye, including the extras, Alda continued. You know, the audience got to know the extras on the show. So I gave them all speeches about what they were all going to do when they got home. Which didn't always go well with them because they weren't used to acting, they were all used to being in the background.\n\nThe star admitted he was faced with even bigger obstacles.\n\nThe other challenge directing the final episode was the outdoor location that we used in the mountains of Malibu, said Alda. It caught fire on a Friday night or Saturday morning and the entire set burned to the ground. I still had a lot of scenes to shoot there. So I spent the weekend rewriting the script and wrote a fire into it. And the rest of the show took place in another location. But that's what one of the fun things that happen when you're acting. You have everything prepared. Everything is all set up to go, and then at the last minute, you have to improvise, which is exciting.\n\nAlan said it was wonderful to revisit the past, but his focus is now on the future. The TV star told CBS's This Morning in July 2018 that he's been battling Parkinson's disease for over three years. Still, he told People magazine that not much has changed since he made the shocking revelation. In fact, he's as excited as ever to raise awareness on better communication to spark one's curiosity on his podcast.\n\nIt takes up most of my life now, he said. I act whenever I find something fun to act in, but an awful lot of my time is devoted to this. … I went in with curiosity. … I want to help people communicate better in every part of their lives. Between couples and diplomacy, business, sports — it's important to communicate and relate to one another as well so we can move on with what we're trying to accomplish with people.\n\nHe has also learned many lessons personally with the help of his wife, Arlene Alda. The couple has been married since 1957 and share three daughters.\n\nArlene says that the secret to a long marriage is a short memory, said Alda. So far it works! I think it's really good to remember. Two people can't live together unless they occasionally have a difference of opinion or a different way of doing things. And as you're working that out, no matter how strongly you feel, I think it's good to remember that you love this person. It's easy to forget when you get upset about something. And it shortens up the conversation a lot.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
Any minute now we will hear the result of another lawsuit about same-sex marriage.\n\nThis month a federal judge in Massachusetts threw out a Congressional law which defined marriage as the union of man and woman.\n\nSoon a federal judge in California is going to rule in a lawsuit challenging Proposition 8, the referendum by which California's voters kept the traditional meaning of marriage in their law.\n\nIf the pending ruling throws out Prop. 8 – as it very likely will – it would be the biggest victory so far for those promoting same-sex marriage in the United States.\n\nThese high stakes have attracted a lot of attention to the California case of Perry v. Schwarzenegger. But not enough attention – in fact, almost none – has been paid to one very troubling aspect of the case.\n\nThis is the question of the judge's bias due to his possible interest in which side wins the case.\n\nJudge Vaughan Walker has surprised just about everyone with his unorthodox handling of the Prop. 8 trial.\n\nSupporters describe him as iconoclastic and creative. Those less enamored have charged him with turning the proceedings into a sensationalized show-trial.\n\nBoth sets of observers could probably agree with the explanation offered by conservative commentator Ed Whelan who has observed that Walker has been determined from the outset to use the case to advance the cause of same-sex marriage.\n\nI do not doubt that Judge Walker made up his mind about Prop 8 before the trial began.\n\nBut that is not the bias that has received too little attention.\n\nBattalions of commentators have wondered about his bizarre handling of the case, and many have attributed it to Walker's belief that it is unjust for the law to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples.\n\nNor is the neglected bias related to the fact that (as several newspapers have reported) the judge is openly gay.\n\nOf course, Walker's opinions about marriage and sexual preference could be related to his own homosexuality.\n\nBut even if they are, it does not follow that he would be incapable of being impartial and of rendering a judgment in accord with the law in the Prop. 8 case – any more than a happily married heterosexual would necessarily be.\n\nIn fact, all judges have beliefs and personal habits which intersect from time to time with the matters in dispute before them. We do not require judges to be blank slates without a personal life. Judges are not automatons.\n\nAll we ask and what we rightly expect is that judges put aside those things insofar as they might interfere with deciding a case fairly and in accord with the law.\n\nBut no one is immune to all conflicts of interest or of belief.\n\nSo our law rightly requires that public officials – judges included – stay out of matters in which they have a financial stake. It is not that everyone would be corrupted by the prospect of financial gain. Not at all.\n\nBut some people would be corrupted. And everyone can have greater confidence in the outcome of public deliberations when they know that at least one temptation towards corruption has been removed.\n\n\n\nThe neglected bias in the Prop. 8 trial has instead to do with the fact that – as reported in The Los Angeles Times last month – Judge Walker attends bar functions with a companion, a physician.\n\nIf (as The Times suggests) Judge Walker is in a stable same-sex relationship, then he might wish or even expect to wed should same-sex marriage become legally available in California.\n\nThis raises an important and serious question about his fitness to preside over the case. Yet it is a question that received almost no attention.\n\nWhen a judge is obliged to withdraw from a case due to a conflicting interest we call it recusal.\n\nFederal law requires that, whenever a judge knows that he has any other interest [ that is, besides a financial interest] that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding at hand, or when his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, he must recuse himself.\n\nI am not saying that Judge Walker should have refused himself in Perry v. Schwarzenegger.\n\nI am not saying so because nowhere (as far as I know) has Judge Walker volunteered or been made to answer questions about how the outcome of that case would affect his interest (whatever it is) in marrying, and thus his interest in the manifold tangible and intangible benefits of doing so.\n\nThat is a conversation worth having.\n\nAnd, sadly, it is quite too late to have it.\n\nGerard V. Bradley is a Professor of Law at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nFox Forum is on Twitter. Follow us @fxnopinion.
My wife and I had only been dating for six weeks when we said I love you for the first time.\n\nIt happened on an emotionally charged night when we both shared some hard things from our pasts. When we both responded with unconditional grace; the momentum carried us away, and the next thing we knew, we were both putting our hearts on the line.\n\nOur feelings took on even more momentum and only four months after we met, I surprised Raquel on the River Terrace of the Kennedy Center and asked her to marry me. She said yes and we celebrated with family members that night. It couldn't have been more idyllic -- until the next morning.\n\nJOSHUA ROGERS: I KISSED MY WIFE, MY DAUGHTER SAW ME AND SAID ONE WORD I WON'T EVER FORGET\n\nAlmost instantly, we went from extending unconditional grace to wrestling for control over the wedding budget. For example, I insisted that we string up Christmas lights in someone's back yard and cater the event with Subway sandwich trays. Raquel did not appreciate this particularly absurd request (and many others), but at the same time, she often provoked fights with her tendency to be unnecessarily hypercritical.\n\nThings quieted down in the two weeks before the wedding -- I guess we were too exhausted from wedding planning to keep bickering. But we didn't even make it past the honeymoon before we started going at it again.\n\nIn the 12 years since then, we haven't arrived when it comes to conflict resolution, but we've come a long way. Our conflicts have gradually become more constructive and less petty; and in a few cases, conflict has ceased.\n\nAs I think about the incremental improvements we've made, I've been contemplating our growth. What are we getting right, and how can we do more of that? What has changed? There are three things that come to mind:\n\nWe're more willing to genuinely apologize. In the words of Elton John, sorry seems to be the hardest word. It's the hardest word because it's an admission that I'm wrong. My pride can't handle that. When I give in, however, there's a freedom I discover. I don't have to carry the weight of my precious image. I can, with an apology, actually eliminate the momentum of a fight because an apology often resolves the heart of a conflict.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nI've begun to accept the fact that Raquel's actually right a lot of the time. When we first got married, every one of Raquel's contradictory stances called for my opposition. In my view, my perspective was the clearest and rightest one. Yet, as I started reflecting on the times when I had written off her opinion during decision making, I saw that things often didn't go well. I've since done a better job of honoring both of our perspectives. As a result, Raquel feels more respected, we make better decisions and both of us win.\n\nAs we work through conflict, we're learning what always works (humility) and what never works (pridefulness).\n\nWe're picking our battles more carefully. Earlier in our relationship, I was willing to go to the mat about anything -- chores, church, restaurant choices -- you name it. So much of it wasn't worth it, and even if it was worth it (like working through wedding budgeting) we went about it the wrong way. Being willing to give up the fight -- or at least the way we fight -- reduces stress, brings peace, makes our relationship more loving, and with all of that, naturally strengthens our marriage.\n\nWhen I think about it, actually, our fights haven't been totally useless. As we work through conflict, we're learning what always works (humility) and what never works (pridefulness). For example, last night, Raquel and I sat down to talk through our budget -- something I was dreading. Our financial discussions have often been as bad during our marriage as they were during our engagement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut something happened: There was grace. We agreed on many things, and where there was disagreement, we were able to move on without necessarily getting everything resolved. (Speaking of being gracious, Raquel even cut me some slack when I almost fell asleep in the middle of our conversation!)\n\nThere's hope for you and for us. With a little humility, we can continue to make progress -- even if it happens one fight at a time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JOSHUA ROGERS
Oh, baby.\n\nOne pregnant woman recently took to Reddit to voice her alleged baby-naming woes, as her husband reportedly – and shockingly – wants to name their new daughter after his ex-girlfriend. The exchange, which has since gone viral, has reportedly left the woman feeling broken, while outraged Redditors urge her to seek a divorce.\n\nEarlier this week, Redditor @Throwaway01928351 took to the social platform to air her supposed troubles in a post that has since sparked over 15,000 upvotes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDivorce on table because husband and I can't agree on baby's name, she begins. Detailing that she is 23 years old and that her husband is 24, the woman reveals that they've been a couple for several years and that she is now seven months pregnant with a little girl.\n\nLogically, she claims the two have begun discussing names for the baby, prompting the drama to unfold.\n\nEver since we found out its gonna be a girl my husband wants to name it like his exes name, the author writes. Its not any ex but the one he dated for long period of time and loved the most.\n\nIn the beginning of our relationship we had [many] problems because of her but she moved away so the problems went away. He really loved her and he never hid that from me but I thought it was over once she moved away, she continues. Now he made it clear that he wants the baby to have that name and I can name the second child. When I asked him why does he want that name so badly he said just because he and his ex didn't work out doesn't mean he doesn't want something to keep reminding him of her.\n\nHe doesn't understand how much its affecting me and keeps saying its just the hormones. Is he still in love with the ex or its normal that he wants to name OUR child like that [?] Thank you! the woman concludes.\n\nFITNESS GURU DEFENDS 'SAGGY, WRINKLY' POST-PREGNANCY SKIN FROM INSTAGRAM TROLLS\n\nThe question evidently struck a nerve with many stunned Redditors, sparking more than 3,000 comments on the post.\n\nI'm more concerned about his lack of respect for you as his partner, his number one, his wife. You might try relationship counseling but I suspect his disrespect extends beyond the baby naming issue, one commenter exclaimed.\n\nI hope you get out of this disrespectful marriage before you start believing this is all you're worth, another agreed.\n\nPut your foot down hard and be prepared to go it on your own if you have to. He is not respecting you or his child, he wants to name your daughter after a woman he used to have sex with! She's going to mortified about that one day, another agreed.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nLikewise, many women chimed in to similarly lament being (purportedly) named after their own father's former lovers or girlfriends.\n\nI'm a girl who was named after my dad's lover (mom had no idea) and I ABSOLUTELY DESPISE my name, one user confessed. He just casually told me on one occasion. In general, the name is beautiful but when I think about the reason why was I named like that it makes me puke. So for the love of God don't ever name your child by your ex-partner, it will bring a bitter taste to your child's mouth (pondering of renaming myself in the future, yes it's that dreadful for me).\n\nMy dad named me after his ex before my mother. My name makes me sick to my stomach still at 33.... another said.\n\nFor better or worse, as the original poster reportedly has two months until her due date, hopefully she and her partner will be able to settle on a less contentious moniker.

That's a long time. When there are tough times like these, all of a sudden we're totally a unified front and talk and email multiple times a day, Anstead told People magazine in its latest issue.\n\nCORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK: WHAT TO DO IF YOU THINK YOU'VE CONTRACTED THE NOVEL VIRUS\n\nThe HGTV star also noted that they're continuing to have a healthy working relationship on their show as well.\n\nWork is going really well, Anstead explained.\n\nWe're on a break right now, obviously, with everything that's happening, but prior to that it was great, she said of the COVID-19 pandemic. We're filming season 9, which seems crazy! Who would have thought? But our crew, everyone, we're all very close.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: 5 UNUSUAL WAYS PEOPLE REACTED\n\nThe famous former couple finalized their divorce in January 2018.

Harry Connick Jr. believes his passion for performing is heaven-sent.\n\nI was always naturally inclined to play, the 51-year-old singer and pianist told Fox News. That was something that I was given by God I think, a talent to play the piano. Not everybody has that but everybody has the ability to play the piano and to improve, to enjoy it and have it be a special occasion with friends and family or just by yourself. I don't think there's any reason [you can't learn], be it thinking you're tone-deaf or you can't read music or you're not naturally musically gifted.\n\nHARRY CONNICK JR. GETS CANDID ON HIS LASTING MARRIAGE\n\nConnick has always found a way to expand his creativity, whether it be writing music, acting or guiding other aspiring artists as a judge on American Idol. Most recently, he attempted to pursue the role of daytime TV host for his talk show Harry. The show launched in 2016 and aimed to be a family-friendly blend of celebrity interviews, games and inspirational segments. But Harry was canceled in 2018 after two seasons.\n\nThese days, Connick is going back to his musical roots. But this time, he wants to encourage others to take on the piano. The Grammy and Emmy Award-winning musician recently partnered with Quincy Jones' ed tech company, Playground Sessions, a piano learning software and app.\n\nConnick himself offers online piano lessons through Playground Sessions. USA Today previously reported the app, which costs $9.99 a month, uses gamification techniques to entice users into learning to play the piano. For example, Connick teaches users how to play the classic New Orleans standard When the Saints Go Marching In by assigning numbers to each musical note, encouraging viewers to get through the song. The publication added that along the way, users get bonuses for making it through.\n\nHARRY CONNICK JR.'S WIFE REVEALS SECRET FIGHT WITH BREAST CANCER\n\nConnick hopes to demystify the process of learning to play the piano through the power of technology.\n\nI've been the beneficiary of music education my whole life and I think it's important to pay it forward, he explained. Anything I can do to get people interested in music and to beat the drum literally and figuratively for music education. It's infinitely beneficial to people of all ages to learn about music and have music be a part of their lives.\n\nThere's no reason that you can't learn how to play and learn how to play very quickly, he added.\n\nAnd one person who doesn't mind hearing the New Orleans native tickle the ivories is his wife, former Victoria's Secret model Jill Goodacre. The couple has been married since 1994 and shares three daughters.\n\nI don't normally just kind of play around the house, admitted Connick. I do practice a lot around the house and Jill, she tells me all the time she likes to hear me practice. Sometimes I wonder if it gets annoying because I might be working on technical things, but she doesn't seem to mind and that's nice. That goes for my kids too. They like to hear me play and I like having music in the house.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nConnick said that his daughters are even considering pursuing the arts in their own way.\n\nAll three of my daughters are completely different human beings and they all love music in a different way, said Connick. I don't think any of them is going to be a pianist like I am, but one of them might end up a singer and one of them might end up in entertainment. And the other one is interested in a different type of art, which is more visual art. Photography, editing and directing. But it's interesting. My being able to give them music sort of vicariously in the house and through my life, I think, has changed them for the better.\n\nNow Connick wants to show others how music can enhance their lives, whether it be personally or professionally.\n\nI am not an authority to talk [on] what is or isn't being done in terms of music education, said Connick. I'm on a slightly different path than that. And I know about what I know about, which is performing, making albums and trying to educate people myself through things like Playground Sessions.\n\nBut… on a global scale in terms of the general level, I think, I hear that a lot of music programs are being cut and not enough money's being spent and that's a problem. I think hopefully with things like Playground Sessions, people will start to realize how important music is to people of all ages and we'll be able to get back at the forefront of music education.\n\nConnick can't help but reflect on learning to play from James Booker, the piano prince of New Orleans.\n\nNew Orleans lore claims his father, District Attorney Harry Connick Sr. made a deal with Booker, making a prison sentence for drug possession disappear in exchange for piano lessons for his son.\n\nTrue or not, said Connick's website, Connick did receive a no-nonsense education from Booker, a story he recounted on the 2013 documentary Bayou Maharajah, which explored the troubled life of the jazz artist.\n\nBooker, who influenced New Orleans R&B in the '50s and '60s, passed away in 1983 at age 43 from a heart attack.\n\nConnick never forgot his time with Booker. Now Connick hopes he can inspire others, just as he became captivated by music as a child.\n\nJames Booker, who was a dear friend of mine, didn't really give too much advice, reflected Connick. He sort of showed me by example what he did and I paid very close attention. James wasn't a communicator in the sense of a traditional music teacher but he was an incredible leader by example and was very kind [to] me in showing me things one on one.\n\nTo me, music has a different purpose, he continued. Music for me is as common as breathing so I never thought of it as an escape because there was something much more challenging inherently in music for me that I had to overcome to become a professional musician. So I never thought of it as a way to sort of [getting] out of whatever circumstances I was in. But most people don't think like that.
Princess Diana's former love Hasnat Khan has come forward to defend the late royal.\n\nIn November, BBC journalist Martin Bashir was accused by Diana's brother, Charles Spencer, of allegedly using forged statements and false claims to convince the royal into doing a televised interview in 1995. According to Reuters, the sit-down was watched by 20 million people in Britain.\n\nIn the infamous interview, the Princess of Wales said there were three of us in this marriage, referring to Prince Charles' relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles, whom he married after Diana's death. Diana, who divorced Charles in 1996, died in a Paris car crash in 1997 as she was being pursued by paparazzi. She was 36.\n\nOne of her most attractive qualities was her vulnerability, Khan, 62, recently told the U.K.'s DailyMail. It was what endeared her to the public. I later realized that Martin picked on those vulnerabilities and exploited them.\n\n'THE CROWN' IS 'A TRAVESTY' BASED ON INACCURACIES, SAYS ROYAL EXPERT: 'THE FABRICATION IS QUITE UNBELIEVABLE'\n\nHe was very persuasive with Diana, Khan claimed. It was all about him being from the BBC, being respectable and very pious even. But he filled her head with rubbish.\n\nKhan alleged that after talking with Bashir, 57, Diana began to believe that Charles, now 72, was having an affair with their children's nanny, Tiggy Legge-Bourke, which made her paranoid with talks of bugs and phone-tapping.\n\nKhan, who met Bashir in a pub with Diana, allegedly told the princess to be careful.\n\nAlmost from the word go, he started asking me the most direct personal questions about Diana and our relationship, Khan told the outlet. Why didn't we get married? When were we going to get married? That kind of thing. There was something about Bashir I didn't like. I told her to be careful of him.\n\nKRISTEN STEWART DISCUSSES PLAYING THE LATE PRINCESS DIANA: 'IT'S HARD NOT TO FEEL PROTECTIVE'\n\nOf course I am not naïve, he shared. I knew that there was a part of Diana that wanted to get an interview but my question is if Martin Bashir had not been there persuading her, would she ever had done it?\n\nKhan, a heart surgeon, has rarely spoken publicly about his relationship with Diana. Their romance came to an end after Khan realized he was unable to cope with the intense media scrutiny that came to being involved with the world's most photographed woman, Reuters reported.\n\nAfter their breakup, Diana was romantically involved with Dodi Fayed, the son of Harrods department store owner Mohamed al-Fayed. The 42-year-old also perished in the Paris car crash.\n\nThe relationship between Diana and Khan was chronicled in the 2013 film Diana with Naomi Watts playing the title role. At the time, Khan accused the film of being based on gossip in an interview with the Mail on Sunday.\n\nPRINCE WILLIAM SAYS INVESTIGATION INTO BBC INTERVIEW WITH PRINCESS DIANA 'IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION'\n\nIn November 2020, Diana's eldest son Prince William spoke out following reports that the BBC is opening an investigation into the circumstances around the TV interview.\n\nThe independent investigation is a step in the right direction, said the Duke of Cambridge in a statement obtained by People magazine.\n\nIt should help establish the truth behind the actions that led to the Panorama interview and subsequent decisions taken by those in the BBC at the time, shared the 38-year-old.\n\nAccording to the outlet, William's younger brother, Prince Harry, is also aware of the ongoing controversy surrounding the 25-year-old special. However, his spokesperson had no comment.\n\nBBC APPOINTS FORMER JUDGE TO LEAD PROBE INTO 1995 PRINCESS DIANA INTERVIEW\n\nIt was also revealed that the BBC is moving forward with the appointment of a former senior judge, John Dyson, to lead an independent investigation.\n\nThe investigation will take a look to see if the steps taken by both the BBC and Bashir were appropriate, and to what extent those actions influenced Diana's decision to give the interview at the time.\n\nThe BBC described Dyson, a former Supreme Court judge, as an eminent and highly respected figure who will lead a thorough process.\n\nSpencer, 56, who is seeking an inquiry and an apology, is alleging that in the time leading up to the 1995 interview, Bashir made false and defamatory allegations about senior royals to gain Spencer's trust in addition to access to Diana.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe allegations include: Diana's phone was being bugged, her bodyguard was plotting against her and two senior royal aides were being paid to keep Diana under surveillance. Spencer alleged that Bashir showed him false bank statements to back up his allegations.\n\nWhen the complaints first came about, the BBC did an internal investigation and alleged that Bashir admitted to commissioning mocked-up documents, however, the broadcaster has said that the docs played no part in Diana's decision to do the interview.\n\nThe BBC's director-general, Tim Davie, said the broadcaster is determined to get to the truth about these events.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Bashir has not publicly commented to the press and the BBC said he is on sick leave from his position as religion editor.\n\nFox News' Mariah Haas and the Associated Press contributed to this report.
Jim Edmonds has no interest in engaging in a public spat with his ex-wife Meghan King Edmonds.\n\nThe former pair have been at a stalemate while going through their divorce and have also traded verbal blows as they attempt to move on with their respective lives.\n\nWhat I'm dealing with between this divorce and the nastiness of it, the back and forth between St. Louis and Los Angeles, my son's neurological issues and just being a mom of three little kids in general, it's heavy, Meghan explained on Thursday's episode of the Juicy Scoop with Heather McDonald podcast. It's a lot of heavy burdens to carry and sometimes I just have to say to God, 'Can you please help me carry these?'\n\nJIM EDMONDS RESPONDS TO EX MEGHAN KING EDMONDS' THREESOME ALLEGATIONS: 'TIRED OF THE LIES'\n\nThe Real Housewives of Orange County alum has been incredibly forthcoming about her personal life with Edmonds on her own iHeartRadio podcast, Intimate Knowledge that she hosts with Brooke Burke. While Meghan has been candid, Edmonds said he wants no part of any airing of dirty laundry.\n\nJim is not going to roll in the mud with anyone and has no interest in playing this out in the media. Meghan publicly broadcasts a 30-minute therapy session about her marriage and continues to tell stories to anyone who will listen as an opportunity to get attention for herself, his representative Steve Honig said in a statement to E! News. Publicly discussing private matters is not in the best interest of the children and he is not going to engage on that level.\n\nEdmonds' statement comes just two days after Meghan addressed her ebb-and-flow relationship with the former St. Louis Cardinals slugger in which she alleged during her podcast that Jim was in Cabo San Lucas with the same women they had a threesome with and who she described to be a friend of the former couple – which Jim said is completely false.\n\n'REAL HOUSEWIVES' STAR MEGHAN KING EDMONDS' HUSBAND ADMITS 'LAPSE IN JUDGMENT' BUT DENIES PHYSICAL INFIDELITY\n\nOn McDonald's show, Meghan also made it point to note that she would love for her kids to know that their father loves them and issued her own advice for dealing with divorce.\n\nPeople ask me this all the time. I don't know. I would say it sucks. How do you give advice for something like that? You literally just survive. Put one foot in front of the other, she explained. I personally try to connect with myself. I'm really spiritual so I do a lot of praying and fresh air is always good for me. Saying my feelings out loud—there's some power in that for me.\n\nMeghan said she saw the warning signs that their marriage was on the rocks but decided not to turn them into negatives and only focused on what she could do in order to make changes that would benefit them as a couple.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI really tried to keep my brain away from that because I'm big on manifestation and stuff. I wanted to keep it all positive so I wouldn't allow thoughts like that to enter my mind, she told McDonald. However, I did know there were massive red flags we needed to work on and work through in order to come out better on the other end. That's where I was focused.\n\nThe former pair share twin boys Hart and Hayes, 18 months, and daughter Aspen, 3.
Alex Trebek and his wife of nearly 30 years, Jean, are speaking out about his battle with stage 4 pancreatic cancer.\n\nThe longtime couple spoke with Michael Strahan for an upcoming special on Good Morning America and revealed the underlying challenges of dealing with the 79-year-old's diagnosis and the microcosm effect the illness has had on Jean, 55.\n\nSimply put, Jean feels helpless seeing the Jeopardy! host struggle to do everyday things.\n\n'JEOPARDY!' HOST ALEX TREBEK MAY LEAVE SHOW OVER CANCER BATTLE\n\nWhen I see him in pain and I can't help him, she said. When he doesn't eat right. When he has too much diet soda.\n\nTrebek said that even though he told his wife first, he waited to do so and didn't tell her as quickly as I could have because he couldn't come to grips with how demoralizing the news would be. It was not devastating news to me, Trebek recalled.\n\nI knew as soon as the doctor came back and mentioned the pancreas. I said, 'Uh-oh, it's going to be cancer,' Trebek said.\n\n'JEOPARDY!' HOST ALEX TREBEK RECORDS PANCREATIC CANCER PSA: 'I WISH I HAD KNOWN SOONER'\n\nThroughout my life, I've always wondered about how courageous a human being I was, Trebek said about his diagnosis. I just look at it as it's a part of life. Does that mean I'm courageous because I'm dealing with it? No. I could be scared to death and I'd still have to deal with it.\n\nDespite the toll the daily grind of hosting Jeopardy! could take on Trebek, Jean said that as much as she would love for him to take a break from his duties, she understands Trebek's love for his gig, pointing to the incredible sense of purpose it gives him.\n\nBut in 29 years of marriage, Trebek also acknowledged his wife's concerns about his health and noted that his diagnosis has been tough on Jean as well.\n\nIt's always tough for caretakers because she has to deal with her worrying about my well-being and also dealing with ... I'm not always the most pleasant person to be around when I'm experiencing severe pain or depression, and she has to tread lightly around me, he admitted.\n\n'JEOPARDY!' CHAMPION JAMES HOLZHAUER WINS AGAIN AFTER RETURNING FOR 'TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS'\n\nTrebek has been showered with love and support since he shocked the world when he revealed his cancer diagnosis in March in a video message to fans. After harrowing through months of chemotherapy treatment, the Emmy-winning host said he was on the mend and had completed his treatment, telling fans he was doing much better.\n\nHowever, just one month later Trebek, announced on Good Morning America that he had resumed chemotherapy. The esteemed host said not long after he filmed his message that he was finished with treatment, he lost a considerable amount of weight, spurring his doctors to order another round of the treatment.\n\n'JEOPARDY!' HOST ALEX TREBEK RENEWS CONTRACT THROUGH 2022 AFTER HINTING AT RETIREMENT\n\nThe affinity for Trebek has remained steadfast and recent Jeopardy! champion Avi Gupta, a first-year student at Columbia University who took home $100,000 on the show this summer, announced in November that he would be donating $10,000 to the Knight Cancer Institute in honor of Trebek.\n\nI am honored to be able to make this donation to the Knight Cancer Institute to support him and the millions of other people suffering from pancreatic cancer across the world, Gupta added. Our goal with this campaign is to support research into pancreatic cancer awareness and early detection.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn his Twitter post, Gupta put out a call to action in honor of Pancreatic Cancer Awareness month for others to join him in donating to the cause.
Sen. Joni Ernst was abused by her husband before their divorce, according to court filings.\n\nThe Republican from Iowa alleged her husband, Gail, physically assaulted her when she confronted him about an alleged affair he was having with a babysitter, Ernst said, according to the Des Moines Register. A victim's advocate sought to take her to the hospital after the assault, Ernst reportedly said.\n\nWe went through a very dark and troubling time in our marriage, Ernst, 48, said in the divorce filings. I very nearly filed for divorce after a night we argued, and it became physical.\n\nErnst reportedly took her daughter to her mother's house. She turned down advice to go a hospital because she was embarrassed and humiliated. Ernst and her husband sought counseling, but the pair reportedly didn't discuss the alleged assault.\n\nAfter that, according to the Des Moines Register, the couple's relationship was never the same.\n\nShe was also allegedly verbally and mentally abused by her husband, whom she called cruel. She said her husband was the catalyst behind her decision to turn down the chance to be President Trump's running mate in 2016 because he hated any successes I had and would belittle me and get angry any time I achieved a goal.\n\nKEITH ELLISON LOSES FIGHT TO DELAY DIVORCE PAPER RELEASE, REPORT SAYS\n\nIn the summer of 2016, I was interviewed by Candidate Trump to be vice president of the United States. I turned Candidate Trump down, knowing it wasn't the right thing for me or my family, Ernst said in the affidavit, according to The Guardian.\n\nShe added: I continued to make sacrifices and not soar higher out of concern for Gail and our family.\n\nErnst, then 46, reportedly met with Trump at his golf course in New Jersey in July 2016. After the meeting, Ernst told Politico she was just getting started in Iowa. She had first assumed office as a senator in 2015.\n\nThe senator's husband was also allegedly not supportive of her decision to run for re-election in 2020.\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA LAWMAKERS PUSH TO RAISE MINIMUM AGE FOR MARRIAGE\n\nAlthough Gail seems to think he can live off my salary for the rest of his life, he is doing everything he can to destroy me and ruin my chance for re-election, which would end the gravy train he apparently plans to ride, she wrote.\n\nGail Ernst said his wife's career was all-consuming and impacted the amount of time she spent with her family.\n\nI gave up all my aspirations and goals to be a good dad and husband so Joni could pursue her dreams, he said in the divorce filings.\n\nBoth Ernsts, who were married since the early 1990s, have accused one another of having affairs during their marriage. When the divorce was finalized this month, neither was granted alimony. Gail Ernst did receive their home in Red Oak, Iowa, and other properties.\n\nErnst's office announced the divorce in August 2018.\n\nThey remain committed to their children and family, and ask for respect for their privacy during this difficult time, her office said in a statement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe filing was made public since the two have settled their divorce.
Jason Aldean and Brittany Kerr began their relationship in quite the unconventional fashion, but now they are ringing in their five-year wedding anniversary in a similarly unconventional manner amid the worldwide developments surrounding the coronavirus.\n\nAldean, 43, and Kerr, 31, started their romance in 2012 and were marred by controversy after the country music star was photographed kissing the former Charlotte Bobcats dancer and American Idol star while still married to his high school sweetheart and first wife, Jessica Ussery, with whom he shares his two eldest daughters.\n\nAt the time, Aldean owned up to the mishap, taking to Facebook to explain that he embarrassed my family and myself, and explaining that he had too much to drink and let the party get out of hand and acted inappropriately. Aldean and Kerr now share two young children, son Memphis, 2, and daughter Navy Rome, 1.\n\nJASON ALDEAN AND BRITTANY KERR GET MARRIED IN MEXICO\n\nWhile Aldean maintained that he left before he caught the bus to our next show and that's the end of the story, his transgressions ultimately led to a divorce from his wife of 12 years in the spring of 2013. Aldean and Kerr would go public together in April 2014 at the CMT Music Awards.\n\nFour months later, Aldean would share an image of himself with Kerr and their French bulldog, Manny, and issued a strong stance for everyone to move on.\n\nJASON ALDEAN AND WIFE BRITTANY EXPECTING BABY NO. 2\n\nSo sick of people judging me and @brittanylkerr over things they know nothing about, the quadruple-platinum crooner wrote in a since-changed photo caption. I have made mistakes but I am a better person because of it, and wouldn't change a thing. Im happier than i have ever been, so thank u to all the people who support us. We are happy and life goes on. It's time to move on people. #aldeanarmy #oldnews #timetomoveon.\n\nSoon after, Aldean and Kerr would tie the knot on March 21, 2015, in Mexico, just six months after announcing their engagement.\n\nThis is the best day ever I've got my girl here, my friends, my family it's the best day ever! Aldean raved to US Weekly at the time.\n\nThe pair had to carve out a break in Aldean's touring schedule in order to make the ceremony in Cancun happen and his daughters, Keeley, now 17, and Kendyl, now 12, were both in attendance, as were other friends and family for the ceremony officiated by Duck Dynasty star Willie Robertson.\n\n'AMERICAN IDOL' ALUM BRITTANY KERR SAYS MAKING OUT WITH MARRIED JASON ALDEAN 'LAPSE IN JUDGMENT'\n\nHe was comparing marriage to building a house, Aldean said of Robertson, who had become a longtime pal and hunting companion. And saying what we do from here on out determines whether it's going to be a well-built home or one that could crumble. He said it's up to us to decide where we want our relationship to go.\n\nBrittany also gushed about Aldean to the outlet saying, We've been through so much, and we always wanted this to be the outcome. That we get to spend the rest of our lives together is really, really breathtaking.\n\nUssery also remarried the same year.\n\nIt wasn't until May 2017 that the couple announced to the world that they were expecting a baby boy. In an interview with sporting goods retailer Field and Stream, Aldean revealed that after the pair went back-and-forth on names, the newly expectant parents settled on the name Memphis for their son as a tribute to Elvis Presley's hometown.\n\nI just wanted him to have a name that wasn't common, he told Country Countdown USA at the time.\n\nJASON ALDEAN, WIFE BRITTANY KERR ANNOUNCE PREGNANCY\n\nHowever, shortly before Kerr was to deliver Memphis, she joined Aldean at the October 2017 Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, Nev., when tragedy struck after a man opened fire on the uncovered festival from the window of a nearby hotel as Aldean performed on stage.\n\nAs you can imagine, my first instinct was to run to him and his was the same, Kerr wrote in a shaken Instagram post of the incident that left 58 people deceased. As we laid behind equipment onstage with some of our road family, bullets flying past…all I could think was, 'I never even got to hold my baby.' We all made sure the others knew we loved them and then ran for cover where we stayed for the next couple hours.\n\nAldean would echo his wife's account of events in an interview with The Highway on SiriusXM.\n\nIt definitely took me a little time to wrap my head around it and I needed some downtime to kind of step away from it for a little bit and get home, he told the station on January 26.\n\nJASON ALDEAN'S WIFE BRITTANY UNVEILS 17-POUND WEIGHT LOSS IN A SWIMSUIT: 'I FELT COMFORTABLE IN MY SKIN AGAIN'\n\nAldean said the tragic event put his son's birth into perspective and allowed him to become in tune with his son's arrival in December 2018.\n\nWithin a couple months I saw the worst thing you could possibly experience and then I saw the best thing you could possibly experience, with him being born, he said.\n\nSince the terrible occurrence in Vegas, Aldean and Kerr welcomed their daughter Navy Rome, in February 2019 – and have remained busy as parents to two children under the age of three.\n\nIn a January interview with E! News, Aldean said they were gearing up to have the entire gang aboard the tour bus during the performer's next tour.\n\nJASON ALDEAN ON HAVING CRIBS IN HIS TOUR BUS: 'IT'S A LOT DIFFERENT NOW THAN THE EARLY PART OF MY CAREER'\n\nWe will have a 2-year-old and a 1-year-old on the bus this summer, he told the outlet. The kids go a little stir crazy on the bus so I kind of leave that up to my wife as to how much or how little she wants to come out with the babies. The bus was built with them in mind and it's ready to go whenever they want to come out.
Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston announced their separation almost one year ago — but that hasn't stopped a mutual level of respect to remain between the two.\n\nTheroux, 47, posted a birthday tribute to Instagram on Monday in honor of Aniston's 50th birthday.\n\nJENNIFER ANISTON SAYS SHE DOESN'T NEED MARRIAGE AND KIDS TO BE HAPPY\n\nHappy Birthday to this fierce Woman.

The decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year, Aniston's longtime publicist, Stephen Huvane, said at the time.\n\nThe couple said in the statement they made the announcement to avoid tabloid speculation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNormally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly, the statement read. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else's fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.\n\nTheroux said in September that his breakup with Aniston, whom he dated for four years before their wedding in 2015, was kind of the most gentle separation, in that there was no animosity.

Angie and Michael are willing to risk it all in the name of love — even if means being disowned by some family members and spending time behind bars.\n\nThe husband and wife from Eagle Mountain, Utah, are first cousins. Angie's father happens to be the older brother of Michael's mother. The couple, both 38, are the subjects of a new reality show on WETV titled Extreme Love, which explores how traditional ideas of love are reimagined across the country.\n\nBut the pair, who are expecting their first child together due in May, insist there isn't anything extreme about their relationship.\n\nWe're really like everyone else, Michael told Fox News. We're not parading it around. I think people get the idea that we are running down the street, like you know, making out, screaming, 'We're cousins!' We do the same thing that everyone else does. We put our pants on one leg at a time like everyone else. We're really just a normal couple and… worldwide it's quite common. I think it's just in our culture that it's taboo.\n\n'TINDER GRANNY' EXPLAINS WHY SHE'S QUITTING DATING APP FOR LOVE IN DOC: 'I'M REALLY OUT THERE AND DESIRABLE'\n\nThe legality of cousin marriages in the United States varies from state to state. Twenty-five states prohibit marriages between first cousins. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia allow first cousins to marry. And in six states, first-cousin marriages are allowed only under certain circumstances.\n\nANNA NICOLE SMITH'S EX-BOYFRIEND LARRY BIRKHEAD RECALLS LAST TIME HE SPOKE TO LATE PLAYMATE\n\nIn the case of Utah, marriages between first cousins are forbidden under most circumstances. It is only legal for couples 65 years or older, or if both are 55 or older and one is unable to reproduce.\n\nIn March 2019, Angie and Michael traveled to Colorado, where they could get legally married. They also began petitioning their home state to change its laws restricting marriages between first cousins. The online petition currently has 1,611 supporters.\n\nThere's a misconception that we are blatantly disregarding the law and just saying we don't care about the law, Angie explained. But we've done several things to show that we are working with the law. Driving to Colorado to get married was a way that we honored the law. Working with the senator. Talking, meeting with the senator. Petitioning, canvassing for signatures on our petition.\n\nAll the efforts that we've gone through to show that we do have respect for the law and we're trying to change the law, she continued. We're not just hiding out, doing our own thing. We've… done as much as we can within the law.\n\n'PRETTY WILD' STAR ALEXIS HAINES EXPLAINS HOW BLING RING ARREST CHANGED HER LIFE AFTER GETTING HIGH EVERY DAY\n\n'MY THREE SONS' STAR TINA COLE DITCHED TWIN BEDS WITH ON-SCREEN HUSBAND DON GRADY\n\nFor Michael, it was love at first sight when they met at age seven.\n\nI've always wanted to be with Angie, he explained. Point blank, period. I don't know if she ever knew that, but when I look at her, I've never been able to see that in any other woman in my life. I've had dreams about her since I can remember. I always had this weird feeling that there was no other woman that would ever make me feel like that. And it turns out I was right… For me, it was just natural.\n\nIt was also at age seven when the pair snuck off into a closet and shared their first kiss.\n\nI even stopped her mother in the hallway one morning, like after breakfast, Michael recalled. I said, 'I'm going to marry Angie.' This is my aunt, her mother… She goes, 'No, you can't, but you can be friends.' I just felt like… you don't even know what you're talking about. I've always felt that way about her.\n\nAngie also insisted that she realized their bond was unmistakable when they saw each other again at about 10 years old.\n\nI remember looking at him and it felt like I was looking at myself, she said. Like a part of my soul was reflecting back to me and we would just look at each other and say we love each other. It was understood. It was just a soul connection we've always had.\n\nFORMER TEEN IDOL LEIF GARRETT EXPLAINS DESCENT INTO HARD DRUGS: 'THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN MORE TO MY STORY'\n\nRONNIE WOOD'S EX-WIFE JO WOOD RECALLS PHOTOGRAPHING THE ROLLING STONES OVER THE YEARS: 'THEY DIDN'T NOTICE'\n\nAngie and Michael went on to live separate lives and even went on to marry other people, the New York Post said. Angie gave birth to two daughters, now 17 and 16, as well as a son, 12, with her ex-husband. Michael and his first wife were married for four years but had no children.\n\nAngie found herself single in 2010 and Michael two years later. According to the outlet, Angie settled in Utah in October 2018 and discovered on Facebook that Michael was also in the area. When they reunited at their grandmother's Christmas party, they soon started dating.\n\nSome family members were outraged when the duo posted a photo of themselves on Facebook French kissing. Their cousin Cathy, who appears on Extreme Love, made it clear she disowned them. Michael said other relatives eventually came around to the idea of the couple being openly together.\n\n'I remember looking at him and it felt like I was looking at myself. Like a part of my soul was reflecting back to me.' — Angie\n\nWith our extended family, it did part some controversy, said Angie. And a lot of the extended family just have chosen not to participate and not to get involved with our situation.\n\nMichael noted: Every year we have this white elephant gift part. That's how we reconnected… They are not having one this year. I don't think they're going to be having any future events involving the whole family… I think they're afraid that if they do hold it, that we'll show up and it's going to cause an uproar.\n\nAngie and Michael are aware that some viewers will immediately slam the couple, insisting their appearance on Extreme Love will only embarrass — and horrify — their family. They have a message for their critics.\n\nACTRESS GABRIELLE STONE EXPLAINS WHY SHE LEFT THE COUNTRY AFTER HUSBAND'S AFFAIR, HEARTBREAKING RELATIONSHIP\n\nRISQUÉ STORIES WRITTEN BY ED WOOD REVEALED DECADES AFTER FILMMAKER'S TRAGIC DEATH\n\nAre you ashamed of your marriage with your husband or wife? Michael pointed out. Are you ashamed of your relationship? Should you go hide in the corner and say, 'Well, we're not cousins.' That doesn't change the fact that we're together. I don't feel like I should have to, or Angie and I should have to keep it some kind of a secret as if no one can know about it. Or lie about it. That's the worst thing I want to do — is lie about it.\n\nIf the couple were to have children, the chance they will have a genetic disorder is 4 to 7 percent more likely, compared to 3-4 percent for non-related couples, KTVX-TV reported, citing researchers at Columbia University.\n\nAngie shared she sought genetic prenatal testing to ensure they would have a healthy baby — and their results are second to perfect.\n\nHe's not a carrier for anything and I'm only a carrier for one thing, which means that our son isn't going to have anything, she explained. He may be a carrier, but that's it…. If I wasn't a carrier for anything and he wasn't a carrier for anything, that would be perfect. This is the second to best results that you can get and so, we're very encouraged by it.\n\nThe couple shared they have no regrets about coming out with their relationship. They hope their appearance on Extreme Love will show audiences they're actually quite ordinary.\n\nI think that there's bigger fish to fry [in this country], said Michael. I think our state's resources and our country's resources could be better spent hunting down a criminal syndicate perhaps, or maybe like a drug-smuggling ring or a child smuggling ring — something severe. I think busting into a house to break up a family… I think they got better things to do with our taxpayer's money than do that, I would hope.\n\nExtreme Love airs Friday at 10 p.m. on WETV.
This is a rush transcript from The Story, January 18, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nED HENRY, HOST: Thanks, Shannon. Good to see you. Have a nice weekend. Happy birthday, May, by the way. We begin with the Fox New Alert. Brand new photos of a massive group of migrants that just now made a dubious bid of American history. The largest group ever to break into the United States successfully. 376 Central Americans digging tunnels under a weak portion of border fence near Yuma, Arizona where they were confronted by U.S. Border Patrol Agents and then immediately demanded asylum.\n\nGood evening everyone, I'm Ed Henry in for Martha MacCallum and this is The Story. Tonight, word that many of those migrants will be yes, released out into our country as the government about to enter day 29 of the shutdown struggles to process those claims for asylum. Well, that sounds an awful lot like a crisis not as defined by the president but is defined by Webster's. I looked it up right before the show. A turning point they say, a situation that has reached a critical phase. That's how the dictionary defines a crisis.\n\nSo one can't help but wonder, with the breach this massive, will Democrats be forced to finally change those talking points we've heard throughout the shutdown?\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y., SENATE MINORITY LEADER: This President just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The President does not want this shutdown to end. He manufactured this shutdown as a crisis.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: And it is absolutely a manufactured crisis. Everyone knows this is a man-made crisis made by one man in particular.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHENRY: Man-made crisis. OK. For his part, the President continues to insist Democrats get back to the bargaining table to reopen the government and secure that Southern Border. But so far Speaker Nancy Pelosi will not budge. Instead today she blasted the President for putting her own security at risk when he grounded air Pelosi canceling that seven-day excursion the White House dismissed as nothing more than a Pelosi P.R. stunt.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: The fact that they would leak the commercial -- that we were flying commercial isn't danger not only two us but two other people flying commercial. It is very irresponsible on the part of the President. We'll go again.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're essentially accusing the President of the United States of endangering Members of Congress and American --\n\nPELOSI: No, I'm just saying what the State Department reported to us.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHENRY: Well advisors to the President are denying all that. We'll discuss in a moment. To be sure, the security of Nancy Pelosi and every other government official is important. It should not be taken lightly. But why is it the Democrats tonight seem to be chirping so much about their security saying so little about the security at the border especially with another caravan of thousands heading our way.\n\nSo the President appears to be taking matters into his own hands tonight. He says he's planning a major announcement 3:00 p.m. tomorrow afternoon. Will he finally declare a state of emergency? All of that we'll get into in a moment, but first Steve Harrigan, our correspondent live in Mexico where the next Caravan is making its way north. Steve, what are you seeing on the ground?\n\nSTEVE HARRIGAN, CORRESPONDENT: Ed, if you wonder what it looks like when the caravan comes to town we can give you a little show-and-tell of what that is. This is Tapachula, Mexico where the first wave of that Caravan from Honduras has arrived after four days of hard walking and jumping in the back of pickup trucks. This is about a thousand people who've made it here. And you can see they basically take over the city square.\n\nThey're resting now. They'll probably sleep outside. It's been a rough route for them. There was some chaos on the border with Mexico this morning. The gates of the border were briefly thrown open in the pre-dawn hours about a thousand people crossed with no documentation. After that, summer order was reestablished. We saw documents being checked, people given wristbands and given five days to wait for a visa.\n\nThe attitude of Mexico's leftist president is to open these migrants -- is to welcome these migrants with open arms. To treat them humanely to allow them passage through Mexico. And when you talk to the people around here many of them say they are willing to work in Mexico but really, for the most part, their goal are one the same, to get to the U.S. and they get there to work, and to make money.\n\nThe real question is though is how the Mexican people feel about this. The President says to welcome them but you can see what this does to a small town. This is the second time this town has been hit by a caravan and there are two more still forming now in Honduras. Ed, back to you.\n\nHENRY: All right, Steve Harrigan, I appreciate your reporting. Moments ago the press secretary at the White House Sarah Sanders was asked if the President will use that announcement at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow to declare a national emergency. Her response, stay tuned.\n\nJoining me now former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, happens to be the dad of Sarah Sanders, a Fox News Contributor as well, Charlie Kirk Turning Point USA Founder and Jessica Tarlov here with me in New York, Bustle.com Senior Director of Research and a Fox News Contributor. Welcome, all.\n\nMike Huckabee, I want to start with you because all this talk about security as I said at the top, I remember around Christmas I was asking Ted Lieu and other California Democrats, why haven't you spoken out about Officer Singh who was gunned down on Christmas night. He, Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein, many other California Democrats did not speak out about that. And yet now we hear all about a security around a plane.\n\nMIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS: Well, first of all, I do wonder, you've got California people who have been killed by illegals, and when she talks about that her life was in danger, there's a couple of things I've note. Did they have commercial reservations? If so, show us the reservations because they were scheduled to be on an Air Force plane. There's no indication that they actually made commercials --\n\nHENRY: Yes, I understand they were trying to make them is what I understood they were using a non-classified computer system so this State Department Cable is laying out the idea, Governor, that if you're on a non- classified computer making commercial flight plans as you say, it's hardly a secret.\n\nHUCKABEE: Well, and that's not the President's fault. Let me tell you what would have been dangerous and if he had done this, the President would have been culpable. If he'd have waited till they got to Afghanistan and then taken the Air Force plane away, then they could have complained. But he did them the favor by telling them they weren't going to be able to use it before they ever got to the airport and I think that's incredibly appropriate because they need to be here.\n\nIf 800,000 federal workers out of work are so really important to Nancy Pelosi, then don't be gone the next several days pretending that --\n\nIt was a week contract, Governor.\n\nHENRY: Let's let Jessica get in here.\n\nHUCKABEE: I don't care how long it was, Jessica. They have no business going out of the country when they need to settle this and they're not doing it because they don't care --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHUCKABEE: This is not about the shutdown -- Jessica, let me finish -- this is about a showdown, and that's what they're trying to push.\n\nHENRY: OK, Jessica.\n\nJESSICA TARLOV, CONTRIBUTOR: Nancy Pelosi was clear that this wasn't a week-long P.R. stunt as the president said in his letter when he took away her military plane, but they were actually well overseas to talk to our men and women in uniform who I know are incredibly important to you as they are to all of us here on the panel and in this country. She was making a stop in Brussels to refuel and also to talk to our NATO allies, something that is also important even if you do think that they don't pay their fair share or whatever the talking point is on that front.\n\nWhen Nancy Pelosi was complaining about it is exactly what Republicans complained about when President Trump caught flak for his trip overseas over the Christmas holiday where people said oh is just a P.R. stunt and he was acting you know, oh I'm home alone etcetera. And then he made it clear that you don't announce these plans in advance, right? You go and you get on the plane and you fly overnight so that no one sees that you are doing that because it is dangerous for American officials to be in combat zones. So just think back to how upset you were a few weeks ago and then direct that towards the president.\n\nHENRY: OK, let Charlie jump in here as well and then we'll get to the, Governor, Charlie. Weigh in on that controversy, but I also want to get to the bigger question tonight which is how can Democrats continue to say this is a man-made crisis by the President at the border when you see those pictures of over 300 Central Americans breaking their way into America?\n\nCHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: Right. So first, Nancy Pelosi is the Speaker of the House. Her first duty is to first and foremost pass laws and legislation. She controls the purse. The Constitution says all spending bills must originate in the House. The President is the commander-in-chief. His first duty is to direct the Armed Forces and so when he goes overseas he's obeying his Constitutional duty.\n\nLook, I'm glad Nancy Pelosi wants to honor our troops and all of us. You know, I have no disagreement with that. Is this the best time to do it? Is it's the best time to go overseas while the government is shut down and there's a crisis on the border and 800,000 people are not getting their paychecks? And finally, to your point Ed, look, this is a crisis on the Southern Border, and what really hurts me to see is how our heart as a country is being taken advantage of.\n\nYou know, I'm sure we all want to take in a lot of people that are suffering, but what bothers me is that these migrants or these border jumpers that come across the border, they don't go to a port of entry to establish asylum. And then as soon as they're caught, then they -- then they say they want to seek asylum. Our laws are being taken advantage of and there's a whole industry created around this of lawyers and nonprofit organizations that unfortunately take advantage of our benevolence.\n\nHENRY: Governor, there's a Web site that's just been created I understand this afternoon urging people to contribute money. These are supporters of the President. Contribute money so that the public can help fund the wall. And they're saying, if you send money in, they'll -- and you can see it right there -- send a brick to Chuck and Nancy. They will send a brick to either the office of Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi to say build that wall brick by brick.\n\nHUCKABEE: Well, there's a better solution, and that is that there would be adults behaving like adults ought to behave in the Congress. They would recognize they're not going to get everything. The President is not going to get everything, but they ought to be able to sit down, work out a deal where they get DACA but they also get a real border security which they claim they all want but they really don't. If they did, they would have already done it. So let's get it done. There's no reason you can't.\n\nAnd they're at a prime moment where they could get more than they would have gotten and that's by bringing in the DACA portion of it. I think the President wants to resolve that and he will.\n\nHENRY: So 30 seconds each, Jessica and Charlie, starting with Jessica. What do we -- can you expect from the President? Is there anything he can say tomorrow that will get Democrats to the table?\n\nTARLOV: To the table, yes, I think we'll go to the table. Chuck Schumer has been clear they have appropriated tens of billions of dollars over the years for border security. Democrats are not against border security. What they object to is a crisis that doesn't reflect the data. If you look at Border Patrol data, it shows that we are down 90 percent in terms of illegal crossings from the year 2000. That shows the net outflow.\n\nSo again, I -- when you bring up an example, like a Kate Steinle or Officer Singh, it is a horrible tragedy but it doesn't mean that the President has the right to go out there and try to abuse and fear monger to get his way when the American public is not on his side.\n\nHENRY: Well, these images today suggest maybe he's not fear-mongering. Charlie, last point.\n\nKIRK: 20,000 minors were smuggled across the southern border last month. Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants will commit crime year after year, ICE data shows. And look, this is a crisis on the Southern Border but it's not one that Nancy Pelosi wants to solve. She went to Hawaii over Christmas and New Year's Eve. She could have been at the negotiating table.\n\nTARLOV: Charlie, that --\n\nKIRK: Democrats just went vacation in Puerto Rico with lobbyists. They are not -- they are not genuine in their -- in their pursuit to try to get a deal --\n\nTARLOV: The data that I have seen that show that illegal immigrants commit far fewer crimes than natural-born Americans. I'll be looking at your data for that but that sounds like an inflated number used again to fear monger.\n\nHENRY: All right, Jessica, Charlie, Governor, I appreciate you all coming in today.\n\nTARLOV: Happy weekend.\n\nHENRY: Yes, we started off right. Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, he is coming up live. He is next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHRIS WALLACE, ANCHOR: I don't know whether the story is true or not and I would take it with a giant grain of salt. I guess you can't have a giant grain, a giant block of salt.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHENRY: Well, you get the point. Chris Wallace is right. Some are not taking the advice. They're jumping whole hog on what they think is a new blockbuster. Tonight, Democrats pledging to probe President Trump over an unverified BuzzFeed report alleging he instructed his former lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. Some are even crying impeachment immediately they say if the report is true. But tonight the White House is firing back.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, PRESS SECRETARY, WHITE HOUSE: Like that's absolutely ridiculous. I think that the President's outside council addressed this best and said in a statement earlier today that's categorically false.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHENRY: Joining me now, Corey Lewandowski, he's the former Trump 2016 Campaign Manager of course and Jake MacCoby former Speechwriter for Attorney General Loretta Lynch. I appreciate you both coming in.\n\nJAKE MACCOBY, FORMER SPEECHWRITER, ATTORNEY GENERAL LORETTA LYNCH: Thanks, Ed. Good to be here.\n\nHENRY: Corey, it was just one week ago tonight in fact that the New York Times had the previous blockbuster that was going to blow the President out of the water saying that the FBI had a counterintelligence investigation to find out whether he was a Russian agent and some of the same people said, oh my gosh, it's all over, the walls are closing in. Where are we one week later?\n\nCOREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER, TRUMP CAMPAIGN: Well, look, this bud -- this BuzzFeed story is completely crazy. The fact that Michael Cohen has any credibility left to even be named as a potential source of the story should give everybody pause. This is an individual who's admitted to lying to Congress, who's admitted to embezzling his now a convicted felon, who's facing significant amount of jail time.\n\nAnd look, here's the very important part, Ed. I think I have testified in front of Congress more than any other staff from the campaign. I've been very open about it. I've volunteered. I've been in front of the House twice and the Senate once. Never ever did the White House asked for me to present my testimony ahead of time. Never ever did anybody asked me to say something that wouldn't -- wasn't anything other than the truth and I'd had candidly no communication with them. So this story is just cannot be true because Michael Cohen is borderline crazy.\n\nHENRY: OK, I hear what you're saying. On the other hand, Jake, what Democrats are hanging this on in part is that as you know, the BuzzFeed story is not just about Michael Cohen's word against the President, it suggests and they don't have the evidence yet, it suggest that there were e-mails, text messages, perhaps other evidence from the Trump Organization to back this up.\n\nMACCOBY: Yes. And in fact, the reporters of this story has said that Michael Cohen wasn't a source for their story. So this isn't just about -- isn't a he said he said kind of situation. They have named -- they've said that there are multiple witnesses, that their text messages, e-mails, documents, which means that we're not just talking about two different groups of people arguing. We could be talking about hard evidence that shows something really concerning, and that's concerning for two reasons.\n\nOne, is because telling a person to lie to Congress is a federal offense that carries a five-year prison term and because the President's own attorney general nominee has said that if the President told a witness to lie, then that would be obstruction of justice. But also because, if the President did carry out these actions, then Russia would know that he was lying and that gives them massive leverage over the President, massive leverage of the United States, and that is --\n\nHENRY: Absolutely. But, Jake, you've reference to all that with, if it's true, if it's true, when you were working for Loretta Lynch as Attorney General, she couldn't even decide whether she'd be called the Hillary Clinton e-mail -- it should be a matter or an investigation. It was almost a semantical debate. Now, all of a sudden Democrats are running with something that we simply don't know.\n\nOne of the reporters says they haven't seen the evidence. They've been told that this is true. So how do we know that it's true?\n\nMACCOBY: Well, that's why it's called a scoop and we find out. That's why we -- this not only deserves an investigation but it demands one because we should know if this is true or not. And the only way we find out if it's true or not is by conducting a thorough investigation and I think that's what we should do.\n\nHENRY: But Cory, it seems like story after story, it's sort of shoot first and get the facts later.\n\nLEWANDOWSKI: Well, Ed, look, let's go back to the story of Paul Manafort supposedly visiting you know, Assange in the embassy, you know, the Ecuadorian embassy which we now know never transpired. Let's go back to the fact that Michael Cohen supposedly was in Prague which we now know because of his own passport and the Mueller investigation never transpired. These stories are doing a disservice to the American people and what this President has pointed out for the last two years is it's fake news and the American people see through it.\n\nSo look, let's get the facts right. But making accusations which we know to be not truthful aren't helpful.\n\nHENRY: Last point, Jake.\n\nLEWANDOWSKI: And moreover, Michael Cohen -- hold on -- very important, Ed, it's very important. Michael Cohen audio recorded every conversation he had. Let's see if there's an audio. This doesn't exist because it never happened.\n\nHENRY: Jake, he went through a long list of stories where the walls are closing in. It's all over for Trump but then we find out well, maybe not.\n\nMACCOBY: Well, they went along with the stories where the walls have closed in further. And that's why you've had Rudy Giuliani yesterday saying that members of the President's campaign may indeed have colluded with Russian officials and that's their defense which is a little concerning. So at this point, the members of the President's team are getting ready to throw anybody overboard that they can in order to save the President. And by the way, Cory, I just want to point out. When you say that the American people trust the President on this, that's just not true.\n\nLast month a poll came out that had the American -- that had 35 percent of Americans, just 35 percent of Americans saying that they believed somewhat or totally the President's denial in Russia and there was a big majority --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHENRY: It's going to be the Mueller report. Does the Mueller report have evidence, yes or no? Last point, Cory, last point.\n\nLEWANDOWSKI: Well, what I said was this is fake news, and if you look at the empirical data 90 percent of the news coverage of this President has been negative towards the President and that's unfortunate because our economy is continuing to grow.\n\nHENRY: Cory, Jake, I appreciate you both get your points in.\n\nMACCOBY: Thank you.\n\nLEWANDOWSKI: Thank you.\n\nHENRY: Meanwhile, the White House scoring a big victory announcing round two with North Korea's Kim Jong-un. The details, the summit 2.0 next.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We'll probably need another summit. We'll probably need -- or meeting. We could use a different term. But we'll probably need another one. We're probably -- I will say this. We're much further along than I would have thought.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHENRY: President Trump today scoring a big win in the form of a summit sequel. The President set to hold a second meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un as the U.S. continues to seek fully verified denuclearization from the rogue regime. Details still a bit scarce though. It's expected to take place at the end of February. The precise date and location still unknown. Here now live Harry Kazianis. He's Director of Defense Studies at the Center for the National Interest. Harry, thanks for coming in.\n\nHARRY KAZIANIS, DIRECTOR OF DEFENSE, STUDIES AT THE CENTER FOR THE NATIONAL INTEREST: Thanks for having me.\n\nHENRY: So what was your biggest takeaway today in terms of what was new beyond them saying OK, because Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a meeting, then there was an Oval Office meeting with North Korean officials. What was your biggest takeaway?\n\nKAZIANIS: Well, I think that it's the personal diplomacy. I think the difference here that the President brings to the table is his own personal touch. He wants to try to get to know the North Korean leaders, understand how they tick. And we have to remember, he doesn't understand the normal foreign policy playbook. He doesn't understand all of the history.\n\nI think the President's advantage here is he's a businessman. He's pragmatic. And I think what he's going to try and do is get the best deal for the American people. And I think his approaches are bearing results. Keep in mind that it's been over 400 days since there's been a nuclear weapons test or missile test, that's results.\n\nHENRY: But I want to underscore that because you'll remember a year and a half ago, there were all these people, the mainstream media saying the President is reckless. He doesn't know what he's doing. He's leading us into nuclear war and he said what you see from Republican Senator Lindsey Graham sometimes a friend not always a friend to the President, tough critics sometimes saying today President Trump deserves great credit for getting us to this point. We have a long way to go and I'm hopeful that the engagement started by President Trump can finally end the North Korean problem in a win-win fashion.\n\nSo let's get beyond the credit, at least acknowledge that he's brought a fresh approach. What has to happen in Summit 2.0? What specifically two or three things that will tell us this is real?\n\nKAZIANIS: Well, you know, Ed, I think both sides need to get a win here. Because you have to remember, even Kim Jong-un has his own domestic political audience, elites in North Korea that he has to convince that it's worth dealing with the United States. So I think the deal on the table that's been floated makes sense.\n\nThe North Koreans would close down their young beyond nuclear facility which is one of their main nuclear testing facilities, facilities that builds fissile material for weapons and essentially the President would either give a political declaration that ends the Korean War or we would take off some sanctions. Both sides win in that deal. And if the North Koreans cheat, if they lie, if they don't let inspectors in, we don't -- we don't do the deal.\n\nHENRY: I've got 15 seconds. A sight we've heard about maybe it could be South Korea so that they'll go to the DMZ together. What's your sense?\n\nKAZIANIS: I think it's a Vietnam. The Vietnamese won a free trade agreement the United States. They want better relations. They're very eager to have it. I think that's where it is.\n\nHENRY: Harry, I appreciate you coming in.\n\nKAZIANIS: Thank you.\n\nHENRY: Still ahead, a 2020 Democratic candidate already in some hot water because of some past views that are being seen as anti-gay. Guy Benson and Marie Harf here live to weigh in, you see them there, next.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. TULSI GABBARD, D-HI: Aloha. In my past, I said and believe things that were wrong. And worse they were very hurtful to people in the LGBTQ community and to their loved ones.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGABBARD: I have decided to run and will be making a formal announcement within the next week.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHENRY: Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, officially throwing her name into the ring to become a presidential candidate in 2020. But she already hit a bit of a speed bump over past comments on civil union for same sex couples. Gabbard issuing an apology in response to that stance but listen closely as she appears to at least partially blamed her conservative upbringing.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGABBARD: I said and believed things that were wrong and worse they were very hurtful to people in the LGBTQ community and to their loved ones. I sincerely repeat my apology today. I also grew up in a socially conservative household, where I was raised to believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman. So, for a period of my life I didn't see the contradiction in those beliefs.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHENRY: Joining me now, Guy Benson and Marie Harf, host of course of Benson & Harf on Fox News Radio. Good evening to both of you.\n\nGUY BENSON, CO-HOST, BENSON & HARF RADIO SHOW: Hey, Ed.\n\nMARIE HARF CO-HOST, BENSON & HARF RADIO SHOW: Hey, Ed.\n\nHENRY: Guy, do you think it's a bit of a cop-out to say, well it's a conservative's fault?\n\nBENSON: Well, look as someone who is actually planning his own same-sex marriage right now, and by the way you guys were totally right, it is so ludicrously expensive. I welcome the Congresswoman's change of heart on this issue. And I think when you feel passionately about something and someone comes over to your side, you should celebrate that and thank them.\n\nAnd I think holding grudges or pointing fingers is probably the wrong approach. I think there's a lot of people who support gay marriage in this country, who had a different upbringing. I think she wasn't necessarily casting aspersions at her family or her parents or what have you. She was saying I've come to a different place.\n\nAnd I do think it's important to that end Ed, when we're having these conversations, not to malign people who believe differently. People who believe in a traditional definition of marriage as bigots or hateful people, which I think is grossly unfair to the vast majority of them. I don't think we can -- we can have a better conversation about these issues and I think that she generally did pretty well on this one.\n\nHENRY: Marie, do you see it that way, number one and those broaden (ph) out in 2020. There's obviously a lot of candidates already in, more coming as well. You see Joe Biden, who is largely seen as, oh the left will love him but now you hear people whispering, well, he didn't treat Anita Hill that well when he was Senate Judiciary Chairman. Maybe someone on the left won't be happy with that.\n\nBernie Sanders has women from his 2016 campaign who don't feel comfortable about what they believe was a bro culture there. So, talk about how these various Democrats navigate their past?\n\nHARF: For every political candidate there are challenges and certainly in the social media era where you can go back and find statements or interviews from decades ago. People's past are sort of right in front of them, especially when you are a political candidate. I think that politicians and people, frankly, should be able to evolve and have positions change over the years, as long as they seem genuine and honest as they discussed that.\n\nOn the last two issues Ed that you brought up, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden and women's issues I think to a lot of Democrats, those are certainly things they will consider. But when they look at that against someone like President Trump, right, there's really no comparison.\n\nThis primary for Democrats, Ed, is going to be a huge primary. It's going to be spirited and I think that's great for the party. These candidates will get to air out these issues on national stages on really important state-level stages. And the people that can answer questions well and honestly and connect with voters, they will rise to the top.\n\nHENRY: I'm sorry to interrupt. Let me interrupt real quick (ph), we had some breaking news. We got a Fox News Alert and I want both of you stand by for this. This is big because (ph) I want to get your reaction, see Michael Cohen there. A spokesperson for the Special Counsel is making a rare statement to dispute the BuzzFeed News report, alleging that the President directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress.\n\nBuzzFeed's description of specific statements to the Special Counsel's office in characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office regarding Michael Cohen's congressional testimony are not accurate. That is from Peter Carr, you see right there, Spokesperson for Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.\n\nSo, I apologize, Marie and Guy, to break in. But as you can imagine, doing a nightly -- a Fox News Radio Program, there's breaking news all the time in the Trump administration. So, I want to talk 2020 but react to that Guy first because we were talking about this early in the program. Week after week, we hear bombshell, the walls are closing in, that's it. We were just debating, is this one going to fall apart as well? And now the Special Counsel weighs in to say this is not accurate.\n\nBENSON: So, last night was a wow when the story broke and this is absolutely another wow. Because, as you say, in your introduction of the breaking news, Ed, it is extremely rare for the Special Counsel's office to come out and say anything or dispute any particular report that's flying out there and they felt the need to do so here tonight.\n\nThat is I think a problem for BuzzFeed and the reporting. And we'll see where this story goes from here but that is a significant development.\n\nHENRY: It really is and in fact we have Corey Lewandowski, who's on early. He's going to comment in a moment. We're going to go into breaking news mode here to make sure we stay on top of this. But, I want to get Marie's thoughts as a Democrat. There were democrats today as you know out there and we played a clip from Chris Wallace say, everybody take a breath.\n\nHe's been in this business a long time and he's talked about a grain of salt to a lot of these stories. And it -- I don't think a lot of Democrats listen to that.\n\nHARF: Actually, Ed, I think a lot of Democrats did. And the people I talked to today and that I saw out there were saying, OK, if this is true, it's a big deal but we still need to wait for Bob Mueller. And the question at the end of the day is, is every single piece of that BuzzFeed story wrong, are some parts of it right but not the main parts?\n\nWe said earlier on our radio show tonight Ed that if BuzzFeed went with the story and it turned out not to be true, that is a huge journalistic limb to go out on. If you're not confident in your sources, at the end of the day, all of this is speculation until we get the Mueller report.\n\nHENRY: It is but on the other hand Marie --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHARF: That's what we need to see.\n\nHENRY: You're right. There were some Democrats who were responsive, I want to be fair. On the other hand, there were Democrats saying, impeachment. This will lead to impeachment. You're right, some of them said, if true. But for those of us in our business, you're not supposed to go with stories that you're like, if it's true, this is a big deal.\n\nAnd shouldn't Democrats, real quick, and then I'll will get to Corey, Marie, shouldn't Democrats, especially now that they have got some power in the House, take a deep breath and wait for the facts?\n\nHARF: Everyone should wait for the facts, I agree with that. I would also say there were a lot of conservative and Republican commentators today saying, if true, this would be a serious crime and this would be impeachable. So, everyone needs to take a deep breath. They need to look at the facts and Bob Mueller is the person we are all waiting for Ed.\n\nHENRY: Corey Lewandowski, I want to bring you in live. I'm not sure I can name a previous time that you've cited Bob Mueller as a source that you agree with but this might be a case where -- Bob Mueller's office weighing in is a pretty darn big deal.\n\nLEWANDOWSKI: Well, this is a huge story, Ed, because it just goes to show that the intellectual integrity of the BuzzFeed people has none. Look, they think it's all fun and games to go after the President and say if the story is true. There had to be an enormous discussion inside the Mueller investigators that they had to come out and make a public statement on a Friday night to dispute this story.\n\nBecause, it was so egregious that they felt the need to keep the integrity in place of their investigation, to show that once again the facts that the media is putting out are not facts at all. It's conjecture and speculation and that does nobody any good.\n\nHENRY: Yes and Corey, I apologize. I'm looking down, I'm checking my phone, this is breaking as we speak. I want to repeat this statement because I want everyone to understand what we're talking about. I want to get more reaction.\n\nSo Peter Carr, he is a spokesperson for Bob Mueller, is saying, BuzzFeed's description of specific statements to the Special Counsel's office and the characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's congressional testimony, are not accurate. The reason why I'm reading that slowly and going over again, Corey, is I'm looking for daylight.\n\nAre they -- are they picking and choosing? Are they saying maybe one line in the story is not true but other parts are in fact true? And I'm reading it closely and it seems to me that second phrase there, about the characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office not being true is important.\n\nBecause, the whole story hung on the idea that this was not the testimony of a liar in Michael Cohen, against the President, man versus man. It was documents proving the President wrong. Now, the Special Counsel is saying, we don't have those documents.\n\nLEWANDOWSKI: Well Ed, it was supposed to be text messages and e-mails and other communications that they have either reviewed or thought to be in place, which now we know don't exist. And look, where is the accountability in the media, Ed?\n\nAnd I -- and look, the American people are tired of this. Is this reporter going to be fired? This is the same reporter who has had problems with intellectual honesty in the past. This source should have been vetted.\n\nThe story should have been vetted and the major outlet who picked it up and gave it credibility should have to take a step back and say, look if you're going to write a story, there had better be some integrity out of it because it's not fair to the American people. And for 24 hours, the political world was thrown into a dither for somebody who was having fun at the President's expense.\n\nHENRY: You're absolutely right. And I want to be fair to BuzzFeed because they have, I'm looking down again, they have updated and they sent out a tweet with the statement for the Special Counsel and are saying, update, a spokesperson for the Special Counsel is disputing BuzzFeed News's report.\n\nSo, they are acknowledging that there's a problem with the story, at least that the Special Counsel is disputing it. But this is my question tonight, why did they go with the story if it wasn't all there, number one? And number two, BuzzFeed is the same organization, as you alluded to a moment ago, that went with the unverified dossier a couple of years ago, didn't they?\n\nLEWANDOWSKI: That's exactly right. And look, Ed, this is an extraordinary step from the Mueller team. Never in the last two years have we seen someone from the Mueller investigation come out and say this is a factually inaccurate story, which is basically what they are saying.\n\nThey are saying that what BuzzFeed wrote about Michael Cohen was so wrong that they took the unprecedented step of coming out and saying that because we know that Michael Cohen is a serial liar. He's a convicted felon, he's a person with all kinds of problems and credibility issues. And BuzzFeed should have taken all of that into account before they published their story last night.\n\nHENRY: All right. Corey Lewandowski, we appreciate your live reaction. We'll be checking back with you. I'm going to be on Fox & Friends this week and I'm sure we're going to be wanting to get your reaction throughout the weekend. This story is breaking and is big. Corey, I appreciate it.\n\nLet's go back now to Marie Harf, as well as Guy Benson. Guy, we left off with Marie, I want to come back to you. As you process this, I don't want to make too big of a deal about one story in one direction. You know, last night we were all trying to process, is it really a bombshell.\n\nI don't want to overcorrect and say, oh boy, this means the President is in the clear because this investigation goes forward. But, it feels like a pretty darn big deal.\n\nBENSON: Right, it comes back to the three words, we don't know. We don't know what Mueller has or doesn't have except this rare window into what they don't have.\n\nHENRY: Right.\n\nBENSON: And the fact that the Office of the Special Counsel felt compelled, based on all of the chatter, to come out and say, actually this story that's making so many waves here in this town is not accurate. I don't think we can downplay that as anything other than very significant in this whole process.\n\nSo again, we don't have any knowledge that the President is totally in the clear or not. But BuzzFeed went out and last night they put out there and they said this morning, I believe, they were 100% confident of their sources here. Well, maybe they need to get some new sources because, I think, is a black eye, it appears, for BuzzFeed.\n\nAnd it's why, Ed, last night I was on Shannon Bream's show, Fox News @ Night, while this was all breaking. And I said, if it's true, it's a very significant deal but there had been a string of so-called bombshells that have detonated over the Mueller issue and the Russia probe that have turned out under further scrutiny to be underwhelming or untrue. Let's be careful, let's use caution and this exactly is why.\n\nHENRY: Yes, I suspect there are some producers at some other cable news channels are wondering, they have to change their rundowns because they were going with something from last night that may all wonder (ph).\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBENSON: Yes. Now, they're rewriting prime time right now.\n\nHENRY: Yes. Marie, I want to bring you in as well with your experience because you wear another hat which is when I was dealing with you as a reporter and you were at the State Department, you were maybe a little mad at me or other reporters, everyone as well. We went out on a --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHARF: I'm never mad at you, Ed, never mad at you.\n\nHENRY: -- yes, it was professional but in all seriousness, you dealt with this kind of thing, where you would tell news organizations, you better have your stories straight. A story about the Iran nuclear deal or something else where the details really mattered, really have impact.\n\nAnd in this case, we have a situation where this is a presidency, this is a presidency on the line. Democrats suggesting that he can be impeached. We heard about suborning perjury, obstruction of justice. These are serious, serious matters. And these stories have to be accurate if we're going to get to the bottom of the story, don't they?\n\nHARF: They do, Ed. And if this turns out to not be accurate, it will be a disservice to all of the other very good journalists who are running down real stories about what Bob Mueller is investigating. Many of which have been out there in the public and many of which have turned out to be true. So, they would actually do a disservice to journalism in that case.\n\nI would say team Trump, as representatives of the administration and the President, have at times gotten themselves into trouble and seemed untrustworthy in their denials because their stories on so many issues have changed, if you just look at Rudy Giuliani this week and his story changing on the issue of collusion.\n\nSo that's why for a lot of people, not just Democrats, for a lot of Americans when they hear a denial from team Trump, it doesn't always ring true, and I think that is something that has been a problem. When you're a government spokesperson like I was as you mentioned, all you have is your word.\n\nAnd what I would say to you something, it wasn't true, I was always telling the truth. Team trump has gotten themselves into trouble on that. Rudy Giuliani, people like him doing that, are actually also doing a disservice to the President.\n\nHENRY: Well, Marie makes a fair point. The administration has to look at its own credibility guy. On the other hand, that doesn't give news organizations a license to report, you know, whatever they want. Pardon me, who do we have on the phone?\n\nAll right, I will get to Byron York, is live on the phone right now. Byron, I want to get your reaction but I also wonder if -- as I think about this past week, I believe it was last Sunday that Jonathan Karl, a careful reporter, I believe, at ABC News, said that he was hearing the Mueller report was going to be anti-climactic and there wasn't necessarily going to be a bombshell.\n\nThen, this BuzzFeed report comes out a few days later suggesting there is a bombshell coming from Mueller. And now it looks like Mueller's office has put that in its track, to stop in its tracks tonight, Byron.\n\nBYRON YORK, CONTRIBUTOR: Very unusual for Robert Mueller's office to do that. But, this was really probably the most spectacular big, if true, story that we had all of this in the -- this whole Trump-Russia affair. So, it's not really super surprising that Mueller might take -- make an effort to correct the record here because he was the problem.\n\nWe do know some things that are going on in this Cohen case through the court filings. We've seen the charges against Michael Cohen. We've seen his plea. We've seen his sentencing memo which was from last December. And if you look at that, the lawyers for Michael Cohen came flat out and said, President Trump directed him to commit a campaign finance violation.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHENRY: Right.\n\nYORK: And -- but at the same time, they did not say that President Trump directed him to lie to Congress.\n\nHENRY: You're right.\n\nYORK: As a matter of fact if you read that, you get the idea that Cohen was in contact with the White House. And he kind of knew the party line, which is there was no collusion, no contact with Russia but we all knew that party line.\n\nHENRY: Right.\n\nYORK: Everybody heard Trump say there was no collusion.\n\nHENRY: And by the way, the President has denied that he directed Michael Cohen to commit a crime either in terms of lying to Congress or in terms of those campaign finance laws as well. Byron, I appreciate your insight.\n\nGuy, I want to go back to you. What say you about how all of this is playing out?\n\nBENSON: Well one thing, Ed, is I am looking forward to the next presidential tweet. Because, I think there's a man in the Oval Office right now who is very happy to really dunk on fake news. And guess what? This is something apparently that BuzzFeed has brought on itself here. Because one of the things that I wrote today at townhall.com, I wrote about this whole thing and tried to be even handed about it.\n\nAnd I raised a few concerns that I had about the report saying, let's be a little bit skeptical. And one of them was the fact that tou had anonymous sources talking about additional documentation that the journalists themselves apparently had not seen. So, they are reporting about characterizations of text messages and e-mails that others supposedly were giving them but they hadn't seen those particular items themselves.\n\nAlthough, there was some dispute between the two journalists who collaborated on the piece. One said they had seen it, the other said they hadn't. That was odd to me. That smelled a little bit fishy. So, this may not be, you know, the Mueller piece may not be here the statement, that every single thing in the story is false, but it was false enough, inaccurate enough that they had to come out and say no.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHENRY: Marie, quick point, then I got another live guest on the phone. Go ahead Marie.\n\nHARF: No, I agree. I mean was looking at the Mueller statement and when you read it, it was really listening closely. Did they leave any wiggle room for the fact that maybe some pieces of the story were accurate but other big pieces really weren't?\n\nAnd if -- in either case, Ed, I want to hear BuzzFeed's response because this is -- if it's true that they were really wrong here, it does a disservice to everyone including fellow journalists.\n\nHENRY: That is that phrase again, if true. I want to bring in Joe diGenova. A former U.S. Attorney of course, a sharp legal bi (ph). Let me read the statement and then get Joe's live reaction. This is breaking, a Fox News Alert.\n\nBuzzFeed's description, the Special Counsel's Office says, of specific statements to the Special Counsel's Office and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office regarding Michael Cohen's congressional testimony, the three words, are not accurate. Joe, your reaction, Joe diGenova.\n\nJOE DIGENOVA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Well, it's fairly obvious that the reporter who wrote this story should be fired but don't count on it. Number two, this is a stunning revelation by the Office of Special Counsel. They have never done anything like this before. They felt compelled to do so for one reason, there is a new sheriff on the block and his name is Bill Barr.\n\nAnd if they hadn't done this, he would have been so furious when he was sworn in. And let me say this to Marie Harf, Marie, if you don't think this is enough to tell people that somebody got the story wrong, let's have some honesty, OK? This is an outrageous act by BuzzFeed reporters. They should be fired.\n\nWhat they've done is, so you want to go after the President, go after him with something that's real. This is a fake story, it's outrageous. And I am very, very pleased that some professional prosecutors finally stood up to the liars in the media.\n\nHENRY: Right, Marie, your name was invoked. I want to give you a chance to respond to that.\n\nHARF: Yes, thanks Ed. I mean, look, I as a Democrat, have throughout this entire investigation tried to remain very measured in what we know and what we don't know. But, there are real facts that real journalists have uncovered about the Trump team's relationship with Russia.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDIGENOVA: How about this one?\n\nHENRY: Joe -- no, Joe, I'll let you talk. Go ahead Marie.\n\nHARF: So I am -- I, Joe, look I know you're happy that this story has been debunked. I don't want fake stories out there either but I don't like the way team Trump uses the label fake news on every story about Russia they don't like.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDIGENOVA: BuzzFeed just happened --\n\nHARF: No, I know and every story about Russia --\n\nHENRY: OK, let's get Joe in because many organizations have to stop doing fake stories, for team Trump maybe to stop calling it fake news. They have to actually accurately report and fairly report what is happening in this investigation, Joe.\n\nDIGENOVA: This is absolutely outrageous. What this is, this is journalistic piling on, a bad story, a false story, forget the word fake. This is utterly false.\n\nWhen you have the Special Counsel who has issued no statements at all at any time during this investigation, except statements in open court, that they felt compelled to deny this story is a sign of the tragic state of American journalism but I applaud the Special Counsel. I'd been an extreme critic of the hacks (ph) that he has on his staff and I must say, tonight, he has acted like a professional.\n\nHENRY: Sure -- OK, I want to say, Joe, quick point from you, CNN this morning, when you wake up, it was wall to wall impeachment, suborning perjury. Do other people owe the President an apology tonight?\n\nDIGENOVA: There -- well, first of all, CNN is a journalistic joke. MSNBC is a strong second. Their coverage tonight, which I was watching in anticipation of some other shows that I'm doing, was absolutely outrageous. These people are embarrassing from stem to stern, CNN, MSNBC, how sad. Where has journalism sunk? Tim Russert is rolling over in his grave.\n\nHENRY: OK, Joe diGenova, we appreciate you joining us live. You obviously have a strong point of view and you've made it. Guy and Marie --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDIGENOVA: Thanks, man (ph).\n\nHENRY: Guy and Marie, I appreciate you both coming in and providing your insights as well. I have some other important guests here and we have them scheduled -- we were going to -- we're laughing because we're going to talk about some lighter stories in the news but this is big breaking news. Nan Hayworth, Susan Li and Mattie Duppler.\n\nMattie, starting with you. What do you make of this news?\n\nMATTIE DUPPLER, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: Well, I think that everything that's mentioned today is really the point, which is that we need to be judicious. We need to have expectations of media and we need to be able to question when people are going to get the story wrong, why they got it wrong.\n\nNow the question of course moving forward is what does BuzzFeed do in the wake of this? Is it a mea culpa? Do they say that, you know, we got some things wrong and we'll do better or do they double down and continue to defend a story that they said just a few moments ago was true?\n\nHENRY: Susan, what are your thoughts of course bias (ph)?\n\nSUSAN LI, CORRESPONDENT: Well being a journalist -- yes, being a journalist you have to have your sources right. You have to depend on them. It's not just one source, you better have one, two, even three to back up the same story and there is reputational risk. I mean look what happened to BuzzFeed. Is anyone going to believe them from now on?\n\nHENRY: Yes. Nan?\n\nNAN HAYWORTH, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: Well speaking as a former member of Congress, I mean this reflects -- journalism has never been so biased, has never been so hair trigger in favor of one party and against another as they are now. And I'm just glad that there are journalists out there who will report the actual story --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHENRY: OK.\n\nHAYWORTH: -- instead of jumping on a bandwagon.\n\nHENRY: Let me just reset. This is Ed Henry filling in for Martha MacCallum tonight with the breaking news. The Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, authorized his office to issue a very, very rare statement.\n\nThey say this on the record, BuzzFeed's description of specific statements to the Special Counsel's Office in characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office regarding Michael Cohen's congressional testimony are not accurate.\n\nSo bottom line, you remember the BuzzFeed story which broke late last night and sparked countless news stories and news analysis that appears now to be untrue based on what the Special Counsel is saying that the President allegedly directed that man there, Michael Cohen, his former lawyer, to lie to Congress.\n\nThe White House sharply denied it. Rudy Giuliani, the President's Attorney, last night said, I got -- if you want to believe Michael Cohen, I have a bridge in Brooklyn that you can buy. And a lot of people in the media laughed at that statement and said he's not really denying it. There's a more forceful statement from Rudy Giuliani today, sharply denying it, saying this was not true.\n\nQuickly, I want to come back to my panel here and get everyone. Mattie, hearing that, I think it's very significant that it was not a statement saying some of the report is not true. It's saying specifically the documents, meaning the story hung on the idea that it was not Michael Cohen's word versus the President.\n\nIt hung on the idea that there were e-mails, text messages, documents that would prove the President is lying and Michael Cohen is telling the truth. The Special Counsel is saying no.\n\nDUPPLER: It was decisive and so now we need to see the report. How long has the Special Counsel been going on and for how many months have we been promised an end to it.\n\nI think the fact that the Special Counsel came out so brazenly with this -- with this statement shows that they really are -- they're producing a product that I think will be decisive in its own accord but we need to see it. Enough is enough to have this going on for months and months at a time.\n\nHENRY: All right, quick point, Susan first.\n\nLI: An ongoing questions to BuzzFeed because their journalist appeared on other stations today being asked over and over again, do you trust your sourcing, do you have the material to back it up? Over and over again, they said we have seen the e-mails, we have seen the text messages. Everything proves that our story is true.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHENRY: Well, they suggested that they hadn't seen all the evidence but that their sources were representing it to them. And Susan it seems like --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLI: But they're pretty adamant about it, right. We have to be sure.\n\nHAYWORTH: It's not journalism, it's rumor mongering, Ed, and all bear in mind that BuzzFeed was the first to publish the dossier.\n\nHENRY: Right.\n\nHAYWORTH: That has been thoroughly discredited.\n\nHENRY: Which was unverified then is largely unverified now as we report to you tonight, live from New York. Nan, Susan and Mattie, I appreciate you all coming in. This is Ed Henry. I had been sitting in, of course, for Martha MacCallum. We are going to be on top of this breaking news story all evening. I'll be back tomorrow morning, 6:00 a.m. Eastern for Fox & Friends as well.\n\nThis BuzzFeed story's suggestion that the President of the United States directed his former attorney, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress, has now been denied, by Robert Mueller. Someone, who the President is not usually on the same page with, instead tonight, again, we'll be watching for the President's reaction on Twitter or elsewhere, because he is a frequent critic of the Special Counsel.\n\nTonight, the Special Counsel saying that the President is right, at least on this one story and Michael -- BuzzFeed, about Michael Cohen is wrong. That's The Story this Friday night. Have a great weekend. Tucker is up next with his breaking story, next.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Even beauty pageant queens are subject to scandal.\n\nFrom cheating rumors to nude-photo pasts, pageant winners are sometimes stripped of their titles.\n\nHere are 13 times we found beauty pageant winners caught in a controversy:\n\n1. Genesis Davila\n\nGenesis Davila lost her crown after pageant organizers accused the former Miss Florida USA winner of cheating. Davila is fighting back, seeking $15 million from the pageant for defamation.\n\nShe was accused by the pageant's director, Grant Gravitt Jr., of violating the rules by getting her hair and makeup professionally done based on an Instagram post. However, Davila's lawyers argue that the photo was taken a week before the pageant and their client did not cheat.\n\n2. Karlie Hay\n\nKarlie Hay came under fire for controvesial tweets she made in 2013 and 2014 right after she was crowned Miss Teen USA 2016.\n\nScreen grabs of Hay's old tweets showed her referring to her followers with the N-word, in a joking manner.\n\nHay later apologized for those comments stating, Through hard work, education and thanks in large part to the sisterhood that I have come to know through pageants, I am proud to say that I am today a better person.\n\nShe got to keep her crown.\n\n3. Vanessa Williams\n\nVanessa Williams was the first ever African-American Miss America, but the victory was short-lived when Penthouse magazine published racy photos of the beauty taken several years prior.\n\nA humiliated Vanessa was forced to resign, but was able to triumph in the face of controversy with a highly successful career.\n\n4. Ashley Harder\n\nThe former Miss New Jersey 2007 was forced to turn in her crown after becoming pregnant, as the Miss USA rules don't allow contestants who are pregnant or have children.\n\n5. Katie Blair\n\nKatie Blair, Miss Teen USA 2006, came under fire after stories surfaced claiming she danced on tables and made out with Miss USA Tara Connor during a night of drinking and snorting cocaine.\n\nConnor took most of the heat for the incident, but Blair faced the wrath of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), who announced they would no longer use her as their spokeswoman against underage drinking.\n\nYes, we can see why that might happen.\n\n6. Crystle Stewart\n\nFollowing in the clumsy footsteps of Rachel Smith, crowned Miss USA the year before, Crystle Stewart fell flat on her tush during the evening gown competition in 2008.\n\nNot exactly a scandal, but embarrassing nonetheless!\n\n\n\n7. Katie Rees\n\nAfter compromising photos of Rees were posted on MySpace, the 2007 Miss Nevada USA was forced to give back her crown.\n\nShe found herself in hot water once again in 2008 after an altercation with a cop led to an arrest.\n\n8. Marjorie Wallace\n\nWallace, the first American to win Miss World, was stripped of her title after less than four months due to behavior that was deemed inappropriate for a beauty queen, such as purported dalliences with high-profile men such as Tom Jones and George Best.\n\n9. Oxana Fedorova\n\nWhen Fedorova gave up her Miss Universe crown, rumors swirled that she was pregnant. However, the beauty countered that the many responsibilities required of her interfered with her university studies.\n\n10. Leona Gage\n\nLeona was stripped of her crown one day after winning Miss USA in 1957 when her mother-in-law revealed that she was married with two children and that her real age was 18, not 21, which was written on her application.\n\n11. Danielle Lloyd\n\nDanielle was stripped of her Miss Great Britain 2006 title when it was revealed that she had posed for Playboy and had dated one of the judges during the time of the pageant.\n\n12. Carrie Prejean\n\nPrejean's scandalous ventures began when, in the Miss America 2009 competition, she was asked what her views were on same-sex marriage.\n\nShe answered stating that a marriage should be between a man and a woman, for which she received a lot of hate from the public.\n\nPrejean, after the pageant, fell into more controversy when she posted nude pictures of her online, and publicly claimed that the Miss USA pageant was rigged.\n\n13. Jenna Talackova\n\nTalackova was one of the hopefuls for winning the Miss Universe pageant in 2012, until the pageant organizers found out she was transgender, according to the National Post.\n\nThe Miss Universe rules required all contestants to be born female, and as a result she was disqualified.\n\nA grassroots petition signed by thousands of fans convinced the pageant to change the rules and let the Miss Canada compete.\n\nTalackova eventually made it to the Top 12.

MANCHESTER, N.H. – Former Vice President Joe Biden gave a full throttled defense of the politics of the past as he defended his record at Friday night's Democratic presidential primary debate.\n\nRival Pete Buttigieg – who at 38 is the youngest candidate in the White House race – once again targeted Biden and some of the other candidates on the debate stage with years of political experience in the nation's capital.\n\nButtigieg said at the debate that I just bring a different perspective. Look, I freely admit that if you're looking for the person with the most years of Washington establishment experience under their belt, you've got your candidate, and of course it's not me.\n\nBUTTIGIEG, SANDERS, COMER UNDER ATTACK AT 2020 DEBATE IN NH\n\nTouting his 8-year tenure as South Bend, Indiana mayor, Buttigieg said the perspective I'm bringing is that of somebody whose life has been shaped by the decisions that are made in those big, white buildings in Washington, D.C., somebody who has guided a community written off as dying just a decade ago through a historic transformation.\n\nWe need a perspective right now that will finally allow us to leave the politics of the past in the past, turn the page, and bring change to Washington before it's too late, he stressed.\n\nBiden – who's four decades older than Buttigieg – shot back that the politics of the past, I think, were not all that bad.\n\nHe then touted that I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. I managed the $900 billion Recovery Act, which, in fact, put millions and millions of dollars into his city before he came and helped save his city. I was able to do it -- I was able to pass the chemical weapons ban, arms control. And I was the first major leader holding public office to call for same-sex marriage.\n\nThe former vice president – reprising criticism of Buttigieg he first brought up two days earlier on the campaign trail in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire – said, I don't know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden was so bad. What happened? What is it that he wants to do away with? We were just beginning. It was just the beginning of what will be the future of moving this country beyond where it is now in significant ways.\n\nButtigieg – responding to Biden – agreed that those achievements were phenomenally important because they met the moment. But now we have to meet this moment, and this moment is different.

Like 2005's favorite freshman, Barack Obama, she arrived in Washington with great expectations.\n\n\n\nBack then, Harris handily won the Democratic primary for what initially promised to be a hyper-competitive race to replace the retiring Barbara Boxer. Harris breezed in (thanks in part to her long, highly successful alliance with then-Mayor now California Gov. Gavin Newsome.)\n\n\n\nAs state attorney general and previously a longtime San Francisco district attorney, Harris had the right credentials. But most of all, she was well suited to the new political realities of a one-party Golden State.\n\n\n\nHers was the first statewide contest that featured no Republican in the general election under a new jungle primary system. Harris ran as an unapologetic liberal but one who would maintain her tough-on-crime credibility earned as a prosecutor.\n\n\n\nHarris' real advantage, though, was she meant to be there. While as many as a dozen members of Congress, state lawmakers, mayors and others mulled a run, Harris got in early and did so with enough economic and institutional support to make her the frontrunner from the start.\n\n\n\nAnd like Obama, she drew national attention for her Senate run from the start. Young (yes, 54 is young by the standards of the Senate), attractive, media savvy, ambitious and of multi-ethnic origins, the Obama comparisons were instantaneous.\n\n\n\nNow, right on schedule and with an increasingly large number of backers, Harris is officially making her move. Her choice of Martin Luther King Day for the launch doubly emphasizes who she aims to be in the race: the candidate for an increasingly diverse party and one where women increasingly dominate.\n\n\n\nAlong with a similar path to power, Harris has also already inherited much of Obama's base within the party, particularly among the donor class and political professionals. Joe Biden could certainly change that with the flip of a switch, but as for today, Harris is the Obama legacy candidate. And given the depth of love Democrats again feel for Obama, that's a good place to be.\n\nThe other senators running, particularly Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, boast robust fundraising and scores of devoted supporters. But they are also candidates of limited spectrum and will be stuck much of the campaign duking it out over and over again for the same activist voters. Harris has appeal among a broader swath.\n\n\n\nKristen Gillibrand is also a legacy candidate, but it's more baggage than blessing. She seems a great deal like an updated version of the woman she succeeded in the Senate, Hillary Clinton. Gillibrand has lots of love from Wall Street, fungible views on policy and is evidently worried about her relatability. That all sounds pretty familiar.\n\n\n\nAnd Cory Booker? Maybe Beto O'Rourke needs someone to ride shotgun as he LiveJournals his way across the hinterland.\n\n\n\nIt's extremely early, and there will be changes on a near-daily basis. But Harris' candidacy has the most important hallmark of a frontrunner: She's making other candidates think and act differently.\n\n\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: OOF\n\n…for upon some occasions things will not admit of accommodation; and then the measures of government must be injuriously suspended, or fatally defeated. – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 22\n\n\n\nTIME OUT: 'ONLY IN THE DARKNESS CAN YOU SEE THE STARS' AP: A collection of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s papers on display in Atlanta provides insight into the slain civil rights leader's thought processes as he drafted some of his most well-known speeches and notable sermons. 'The Meaning of Hope: The Best of the Morehouse College Martin Luther King, Jr. Collection' is set to open Saturday at the National Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta. It is timed to commemorate what would have been King's 90th birthday on Jan. 15 and to attract people visiting Atlanta for the Super Bowl next month. The Voice to the Voiceless gallery at the center plays host to exhibits of King's papers from the Morehouse collection that rotate every four months. Organizers intended this particular exhibit to showcase the 'best of the best,' papers that people would instantly recognize without much explanation.\n\n\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\n\n\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nTrump job performance\n\nAverage approval: 39.8 percent\n\nAverage disapproval: 55.6 percent\n\nNet Score: -15.8 points\n\nChange from one week ago: down 1.4 points\n\n[Average includes: NPR/PBS/Marist: 40% approve – 54% disapprove; Pew: 39% approve - 58% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 41% approve - 55% disapprove; CNN: 37% approve - 57% disapprove; IBD: 42% approve - 54% disapprove.]\n\n\n\nGILLIBRAND-ED AS A FLIP FLOPPER\n\nWaPo: [Kirsten Gillibrand] … The moderate Democrat from Upstate New York had just been appointed to the Senate and liberals were in an uproar. Then a congresswoman, Gillibrand had an A-rating from the National Rifle Association. She co-sponsored bills to roll back restrictions on firearms in the District of Columbia and to limit disclosure of gun trace information by law enforcement. Gun control advocates were stunned that she was chosen to fill the seat. But Gillibrand's transformation had already begun. … Gillibrand overhauled her political identity during this period, abandoning the conservative positions that made her popular upstate and embracing or even moving further left than the liberal consensus on guns, immigration, Wall Street and same-sex marriage. As the Democratic Party itself moved left, she staked out positions popular with the party's swelling base of liberals, a posture most evident when she called for abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. She has voted against President Trump's agenda more than any other senator.\n\nBiden leans on Obama legacy at Sharpton's King Day breakfast - Washington Examiner: Former Vice President Joe Biden on Monday touted his relationship with former President Barack Obama in a meeting with black voters in New York and assured them that he is close friends with Obama. 'He's my buddy,' Biden said at a breakfast hosted by Rev. Al Sharpton and the National Action Network. 'All those memes are true, except he did the first friendship bracelet, not me.' Biden name-checked Obama multiple times during his speech by referring to him as his friend 'Barack,' as he pitched the Obama administration's record on the topics such as criminal justice reform. Biden made no specific reference to 2020, although he has hinted he'll be a candidate in the coming months. He appeared with former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who hinted that both he and Biden might be running.\n\n\n\nLaments support for Clinton-era sentencing laws - NBC News: Former Vice President Joe Biden acknowledged Monday that his record on criminal justice issues hasn't always been perfect, addressing, albeit briefly, a key aspect of his long career in public office that could be a liability if he runs for president. 'You know I've been in this fight for a long time,' Biden said in remarks to a Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast in Washington. 'I haven't always been right, I know we haven't always done things the right way. But I've always tried.' Biden made no mention of the 1994 crime bill he authored, a law that's sparked criticism from progressive activists for its strict sentencing requirements. Biden had long touted his work on the issue, even recently as vice president since the legislation included gun control measures that have since expired.\n\nBloomberg looks to ditch centrist label - Politico: Bloomberg's top boosters insist he hasn't made up his mind yet about running. He'll make an official announcement within a month. If he decides to run, Bloomberg told reporters in Iowa last month, he would make climate change 'the issue.' Guns won't be far behind. … At first glance, Michael Bloomberg would seem to have zero appeal in a Democratic Party where progressive populism is on the rise and activists and elites say it's time for a woman or a person of color to win the White House. But unlike any of the other presidential hopefuls, Bloomberg plays a dominant leadership role on two of the top issues on the minds of progressives heading into the 2020 cycle: climate change and gun control. He's spent a decade as the nation's preeminent financier on those issues, buying considerable goodwill in progressive circles.\n\n\n\nTexas-sized showdown shaping up between Castro and Beto - Dallas News: It's likely that former San Antonio mayor Julian Castro and former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke of El Paso will joust for the Democratic nomination for president, along with numerous contenders from across the country. Some analysts have dismissed Castro's chances. They point out that since his keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, his star has slipped…. Until he got into the presidential sweepstakes this month, Castro had been somewhat obscure since serving as Housing secretary in President Barack Obama's last term. Despite his low name recognition, Castro has strengths. He's currently the only major Latino in the contest. In the era of Donald Trump, where issues like building a wall along the nation's southern border with Mexico are dominant, Castro is a clear contrast to the sitting president.\n\nBOOKER AND BERNIE WOO BLACK VOTERS IN SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nThe Post and Courier Palmetto: The annual King Day at the Dome in South Carolina served as a jumpstart to the 2020 presidential contest, featuring U.S. Sens. Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders telling voters they deserve better. The two are among a host of potential contenders to challenge President Donald Trump. … The event has become a staple for Democrats — or, in Sanders' case, an independent — seeking the nation's top job, as a way to appeal to voters in the first-in-the-South presidential primary. South Carolina is the first contest with a significant portion of black voters. … Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, broadly challenged the audience to honor King by getting involved and working for change.\n\n\n\nWarren up next - The State: The U.S. senator from Massachusetts announced in an email Sunday she will hold an event in South Carolina's capital this week. It is the latest step in Warren's potential 2020 presidential campaign, following 'the launch of her exploratory committee,' according to the email. Warren will attend a 'Columbia Organizing Event,' on Wednesday, her press office said in the email. The event will be held at Columbia College, and 'is open to the public,' the email stated. Tickets for Warren's event can be reserved online. In addition to making tickets available, Warren's press office said it is also looking for volunteers to 'help' at the event, per the website. … Warren has already visited New Hampshire and Iowa since launching her exploratory committee, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\n\nPOMPEO GETS SERIOUS ABOUT POSSIBLE SENATE RUN\n\nPolitico: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is slated to meet with veteran Republican strategist Ward Baker on Sunday afternoon to discuss a possible 2020 run for the vacant Kansas Senate seat, according to two people familiar with the plans. Pompeo, a former congressman and ex-CIA director who in April 2018 was confirmed as secretary of State, is considering a Senate bid, though he has yet to make a final decision. Yet party leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, are aggressively wooing him. McConnell (R-Ky.) and Pompeo spoke shortly after Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts announced his retirement. Pompeo and Baker are expected to talk about what a Senate campaign would entail.\n\n\n\nDEMS UNDER PRESSURE TO MAKE A DEAL\n\nFox News: Democrats once said the so-called BRIDGE Act was urgently needed to protect young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. But now that President Trump has offered to essentially include it as part of a compromise to re-open shuttered government agencies, those same Democrats are rejecting it -- unwilling to trade border wall funding for the immigrant protections they have long sought. … While the Democratic leadership in Congress has come out against the compromise, they are facing some pressure to deal. The editorial board of the Washington Post over the weekend called on Democrats to come back to the table. In an editorial titled 'Make a deal. Save the dreamers,' the paper argued Trump 'should not be rewarded for having taken the government hostage' but said Trump's offer to compromise 'should be welcomed.'\n\n\n\nMcConnell ready to run the rapids - AP: [T]he issue passed to the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has agreed to bring Trump's proposal to the floor this week. Democrats say there's little chance the measure will reach the 60-vote threshold usually required to advance legislation in the Senate. Republicans have a 53-47 majority, which means they need at least some Democrats to vote in favor.\n\n\n\nGOPers frustrated with White House dysfunction - NYT: Republicans had hoped his plan would put Democrats in a corner, but Democrats called it a nonstarter, prompting attacks from the president on the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. And her relationship with her counterpart in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, who presumably would need to make a deal with her, is fraught. … While Mr. Trump has projected confidence in public, he has expressed private frustration over what he views as negative coverage. Many Republicans concede, also in private, that he has made strategic errors and allowed dysfunction to continue.\n\nConsequences piling up across the country - Albuquerque Journal: The longest shutdown in history has left nine of the 15 major federal agencies without funding since Dec. 22, throwing government workers into furlough status, cutting pay to contractors and canceling previously scheduled projects. ADC, which provides security and conducts background checks for a variety of government agencies, has 350 employees in Albuquerque but it supports more than 2,600 workers nationwide.\n\n\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\n\nEffort to oust King with primary challenge gets funds, key backers - Des Moines Register\n\n\n\nJulie Irwin Zimmerman: 'I Failed the Covington Catholic Test' - The Atlantic\n\n\n\nDemocrats paint target on DeVos - AP\n\n\n\nAUDIBLE: ABOUT THAT… I'm not thinking about politics right now. – Rep.

On Monday a parliamentary committee supported the proposal -- which will also see fines levied for insults to the felt hat -- the first step towards the legislation's introduction for a general parliamentary vote. The bill is a result of a furore that erupted in late 2017 when a dog was photographed wearing an Ak-Kalpak hat at a dog show. The headpiece, which is usually white, has a special place in the Central Asian country, revered so much that it has its own national day. The four-panelled hat symbolises 'the peaks of the magnificent Kyrgyz mountains, forever snow-capped,' a former presidential advisor, Topchubek Turgunaliyev, told AFP last year.\n\n\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… But remember: Enforcement followed by legalization is not just the political thing to do. It is the right thing to do — an act both of national generosity and national interest. It has long been the best answer to the immigration conundrum. It remains so. – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) wrote in the Washington Post January 31, 2013\n\nChris Stirewalt is the politics editor for Fox News. Liz Friden contributed to this report.

Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Falchuk just moved in together after celebrating their one-year wedding anniversary in September.\n\nThe Academy Award winner said that, now that they finally cohabitate, other aspects of their marriage will probably suffer.\n\nSo our sex life is over, Paltrow, 47, joked in an interview with Harper's Bazaar. I thought it was really interesting how resonant that was for people. One of my best friends was like, 'That is my dream. Don't ever move in.'\n\nGWYNETH PALTROW SNAPPED IN RARE PHOTO WITH LOOKALIKE DAUGHTER\n\nI think it certainly helps with preserving mystery and also preserving the idea that this person has their own life. So this is something I'm trying to remain aware of now as we merge together, she added.\n\nFalchuk, 48, previously explained why the couple made the decision. I'm moving in September. We've just done it slowly. Divorce is terrible, even when it's the right thing to do. And it's really hard on kids. Come September, we're all gonna Brady Bunch it up, and it'll be great.\n\nHe has two kids from his previous relationship, while Paltrow shares Apple, 15, and Moses, 13, with Coldplay frontman Chris Martin.\n\nGWYNETH PALTROW, BRAD FALCHUK MOVING IN TOGETHER NEARLY A YEAR AFTER TYING THE KNOT\n\nPaltrow also prides herself on having no animosity toward her exes. In fact, she said she gets along with Martin's girlfriend, actress Dakota Johnson. I love her, Paltrow gushed. I can see how it would seem weird because it's sort of unconventional.\n\nBut I think, in this case, just having passed through it iteratively, I just adore her. I always start to think of the ampersand sign — what else can you bring in, instead of being resistant to or being made insecure by? There's so much juice in leaning in to something like that, she added.\n\nShe's even friendly with ex-boyfriend Brad Pitt -- I don't have any bad blood.\n\nPaltrow previously talked about how much she's enjoying her second marriage. In an interview with InStyle, Paltrow said that married life has been really good.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI adore my husband. He's brilliant and deeply kind. I feel like he's a real equal, too. And he pushes me in the best ways. I really like being married. It's fun, she said.
Robert De Niro was more than a little frustrated while leaving a Manhattan courthouse on Thursday after spending the day hashing out his impending divorce.\n\nAccording to Page Six, the Raging Bull actor emerged from the courthouse and was frantically searching for the driver who was supposed to pick him up. Apparently, De Niro was chewing the driver out over the phone for not being in the right location when he came out and was immediately, and expectedly, surrounded by paparazzi and onlookers.\n\nROBERT DE NIRO SLAMS TRUMP WHITE HOUSE: 'LIKE A NIGHTMARE YOU REMEMBER'\n\nYou're not in front! You're not where you dropped us off, he reportedly barked into his black flip-phone.\n\nA video from New York Daily News captured some of the event showing De Niro yelling at the driver.\n\nOn Worth Street! Then you'd see all the photographers here! You're not where you dropped us off!\n\nEventually, at the behest of his lawyer, De Niro decided to move back into the courthouse to wait for the car situation to be figured out. The star was mobbed by cameras and spent most of the incident holding a newspaper in front of his face to shield it.\n\nROBERT DE NIRO SPEAKS OUT ON SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE AT HIS RESTAURANT\n\nAs previously reported, De Niro and his wife, Grace Hightower, called it quits after 20 years of marriage. It was initially reported that De Niro, 75, and Hightower, 63, were no longer living together.\n\nAfter dating for almost 10 years, the Wizard of Lies star and Hightower tied the knot in 1997. They went on to welcome two children together — son Elliott, 20, and daughter Helen, 6.\n\nThis isn't the first time the pair have separated. Per People, two years after their wedding, De Niro filed for divorce, and a custody dispute reportedly ensued over their son. However, things were smoothed over and the divorce was not finalized.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDe Niro was previously married to Diahnne Abbott, with whom he shares two children — daughter Drena, 47, and son Raphael, 42. He also has 23-year-old twin sons, Julian and Aaron, with ex Toukie Smith.\n\nFox News' Mariah Haas contributed to this report.
President Joe Biden surprised the medical community when he nominated California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to serve on his cabinet as Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nWhile Becerra has a history of fighting for the Affordable Care Act, he lacks any medical background to support his intended role as a top U.S. health official – a factor that some conservatives have taken issue with.\n\nWho is Xavier Becerra?\n\nBiden pledged to make his cabinet reflect the most diverse Cabinet in history, which he has done through several historical nominations -- but Becerra's appointment has been one of the president's more controversial picks.\n\nUnder Becerra, the state of California sued President Trump over 100 times on cases focused on immigration, the environment, and healthcare.\n\nWith the NEPA [National Environmental Policy Act] lawsuit, we have sued @realDonaldTrump 100 times, Becerra wrote in an August tweet. And while we don't go looking for a fight, we're prepared to act when the people, resources, and values of California are at stake.\n\nWhy Biden chose him\n\nBecerra took on the Trump administration on healthcare and abortion when he led a coalition of 23 states, and the District of Colombia, in challenging the Trump-Pence Administration's Title X rule in the Supreme Court.\n\nThe rule restricted doctors' ability to refer patients for abortion procedures.\n\nA patient's medical decisions are between her and her doctor or healthcare provider, not between her and the President or Vice President, Becerra said in an October statement. Once again, this Administration is playing games with reproductive healthcare, putting politics ahead of patients.\n\nHis stance has made him a controversial pick with anti-choice Republicans.\n\nThe California Democrat has also appeared in Supreme Court to defend the Affordable Care Act, leading a coalition of 20 states in California vs. Texas after Republican lawmakers sought to dismantle the federal healthcare program.\n\nWhat do Republicans think about him?\n\nBecerra's background in fighting for the ACA and abortion rights has led some Republicans to condemn the pick and say he undercuts Biden pledge to bridge the partisan divide.\n\nThe most recent condemnation of Becerra came from Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, who claimed the California attorney general was not qualified to fill the role and accused him of being a partisan culture warrior, in an op-ed he penned for Fox News Thursday.\n\nBecerra has targeted social conservatives, religious groups, and others who deny the Democratic Party's dogmas about life, marriage, and the family, Cotton wrote.\n\nAny senator who supports his nomination will bear responsibility for his all-too-predictable radical actions in office, he added, suggesting that Biden's HHS pick could face difficulty getting through his Senate confirmation hearings.\n\nMontana Republican Steve Daines has also voiced his frustration at Biden's HHS pick, taking to Twitter following the then president-elect's nomination of the California attorney general last month.\n\nXavier Becerra is a disaster for religious freedom and pro-life issues, Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., said on Twitter following Biden's announcement. He has made his career aggressively pursuing a radical pro-abortion agenda and attacking the religious freedom of Americans who believe in the sanctity of human life.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWith a split Senate, it is unclear if Biden's pick for HHS Secretary will be able to scrape through the confirmation process, though it is likely.\n\nThe date for Becerra's hearing has not been set yet.\n\nHoward Kurtz contributed to this report.
Kim Kardashian's late father Robert Kardashian would have supported her in her alleged imminent divorce from Kanye West, according to the reality star's childhood nanny.\n\nPam Behan of South Dakota in 2013 penned a book about being a nanny to the stars, namely the Kardashian and her famous siblings back in the '90s.\n\nShe's now weighing in on the reports that Kardashian has hired high-powered divorce attorney Laura Wasser.\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Mail, Behan claims to have struck up a friendship with Robert, who died in 2003 after a battle with esophageal cancer.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN SAYS SHE'S GETTING HER 'MIND AND BODY RIGHT' AMID KANYE WEST DIVORCE RUMORS\n\nAccording to Behan, Kardashian is just as much an overcomer today at the age of 40 as she was as a child.\n\nThere may be some tough days ahead but I know she will come out shining, the family's former caretaker added.\n\nSpecifically, Behan claimed Robert would support Kardashian's decision to go through a third divorce if he were still alive today.\n\nI know that he would not want her to be unhappy and he would want the best for her happiness and wellbeing, for Kim and her kids, she said, adding that she too is behind Kardashian.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN AND KANYE WEST'S ROCKY 2020: ALL OF THE UPS AND DOWNS AHEAD OF COUPLE'S 'IMMINENT' DIVORCE\n\nObviously I think she's had enough.

It's unclear if she still communicates with the Kardashian-Jenners.\n\nBehan recalled the family's support for one another, which she says is apparent on Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nI think her mom Kris and her siblings will all be there for her 100%, she continued to the outlet. On the show they argue and fight but one thing about them is they do stick together, especially during tough times.\n\nReports that Kardashian is planning on divorcing West surfaced this week, with Page Six citing sources that claimed she hired Wasser and is ready to put an end to her marriage for good.\n\n2020 proved to test Kardashian and West's six-year marriage. Sources told Page Six that West's presidential campaign was the final straw for Kardashian.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nThe rapper, 43, first made headlines during his campaign rally in South Carolina, which left Kardashian reportedly furious after he told a crowd the couple once considered aborting their first child.\n\nWest then seemingly leaked their purported marital struggles to the public, declaring on Twitter in July that he has been trying to divorce the Skims founder since 2018 after she attended a prison reform event also attended by rapper Meek Mill. The Yeezy designer also shaded Kardashian's past Playboy spread and called the reality star's mother, Kris Jenner, Kim Jong-Un and claimed she was no longer allowed to see his children. He later issued a public apology to Kardashian.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWest and Kardashian tied the knot in May 2014 in Italy. Kardashian has yet to officially file for divorce, and sources told People magazine on Wednesday that the mother of four is trying to stay positive for the sake of the couple's children: daughters North, 7, and Chicago, 2, and sons Saint, 5, and Psalm, who turns 2 in May.
Thousands of requests by men to bring in child and adolescent brides to live in the United States were approved over the past decade, according to government data obtained by The Associated Press. In one case, a 49-year-old man applied for admission for a 15-year-old girl.\n\nThe approvals are legal: The Immigration and Nationality Act does not set minimum age requirements. And in weighing petitions for spouses or fiancees, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services goes by whether the marriage is legal in the home country and then whether the marriage would be legal in the state where the petitioner lives.\n\nBut the data raises questions about whether the immigration system may be enabling forced marriage and about how U.S. laws may be compounding the problem despite efforts to limit child and forced marriage. Marriage between adults and minors is not uncommon in the United States, and most states allow children to marry with some restrictions.\n\nThere were more than 5,000 cases of adults petitioning on behalf of minors and nearly 3,000 examples of minors seeking to bring in older spouses or fiances, according to the data requested by the Senate Homeland Security Committee in 2017 and compiled into a report.\n\nSome victims of forced marriage say the lure of a U.S. passport combined with lax U.S. marriage laws are partly fueling the petitions.\n\nMy passport ruined my life, said Naila Amin, a dual citizen from Pakistan who grew up in New York City.\n\nShe was forcibly married at 13 in Pakistan and applied for papers for her 26-year-old husband to come to the country.\n\nPeople die to come to America, she said. I was a passport to him. They all wanted him here, and that was the way to do it.\n\nAmin, now 29, said she was betrothed to her first cousin Tariq when she was just 8 and he was 21. The petition was eventually terminated after she ran away. She said the ordeal cost her a childhood. She was in and out of foster care and group homes, and it took a while to get her life on track.\n\nI was a child. I want to know: Why weren't any red flags raised? Whoever was processing this application, they don't look at it? They don't think? Amin asked.\n\nThere is a two-step process for obtaining U.S. immigration visas and green cards. Petitions are first considered by USCIS. If granted, they must be approved by the State Department. Overall, there were 3.5 million petitions received from budget years 2007 through 2017.\n\nOver that period, there were 5,556 approvals for those seeking to bring minor spouses or fiancees, and 2,926 approvals by minors seeking to bring in older spouses, according to the data. Additionally, there were 204 for minors by minors. Petitions can be filed by U.S. citizens or permanent residents.\n\nIt indicates a problem. It indicates a loophole that we need to close, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, told the AP.\n\nIn nearly all the cases, the girls were the younger person in the relationship. In 149 instances, the adult was older than 40, and in 28 cases the adult was over 50, the committee found. Among the examples: In 2011, immigration officials approved a 14-year-old's petition for a 48-year-old spouse in Jamaica. A petition from a 71-year-old man was approved in 2013 for his 17-year-old wife in Guatemala.\n\nThere are no nationwide statistics on child marriage, but data from a few states suggests it is far from rare. State laws generally set 18 as the minimum age for marriage, yet every state allows exceptions. Most states let 16- and 17-year-olds marry if they have parental consent, and several states — including New York, Virginia and Maryland — allow children under 16 to marry with court permission.\n\nFraidy Reiss, who campaigns against coerced marriage as head of a group called Unchained at Last, researched data from her home state of New Jersey. She determined that nearly 4,000 minors, mostly girls, were married in the state from 1995 to 2012, including 178 who were under 15.\n\nThis is a problem both domestically and in terms of immigration, she said.\n\nReiss — who says she was forced into an abusive marriage by her Orthodox Jewish family when she was 19 — said that often cases of child marriage via parental consent involve coercion, with a girl forced to marry against her will.\n\nThey are subjected to a lifetime of domestic servitude and rape, she said. And the government is not only complicit; they're stamping this and saying: Go ahead.\n\nThe data was requested in 2017 by Johnson and then-Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, the committee's top Democrat. Johnson said it took a year to get the information, showing there needs to be a better system to track and vet the petitions.\n\nOur immigration system may unintentionally shield the abuse of women and children, the senators said in the letter.\n\nUSCIS didn't know how many of the approvals were granted by the State Department, but overall only about 2.6 percent of spousal or fiancee claims are rejected.\n\nSeparately, the data show some 4,749 minor spouses or fiancees received green cards to live in the U.S. over that same 10-year period.\n\nThe head of USCIS, L. Francis Cissna, said in a letter to the committee that its request had raised questions and discussion within the agency on what it can do to prevent forced minor marriages. The agency noticed some issues in how the data was collected and has resolved them. Officials also created a flagging system that requires verification of the birthdate whenever a minor is detected.\n\nThe country where most requests came from was Mexico, followed by Pakistan, Jordan, the Dominican Republic and Yemen. Middle Eastern nationals had the highest percentage of overall approved petitions.
Like rain on your wedding day, the ongoing partial government shutdown proved to be an ironic twist of fate for two former Senate staffers who tied the knot over the weekend.\n\nDanielle Geanacopoulos and Dan Pollock headed to the D.C. Superior Court on Dec. 27 – just a few days before their wedding – to obtain a marriage license, according to WNBC-TV. But with the government shuttered, the couple was denied.\n\nWe showed up and asked which way to the marriage bureau, and the guy said, 'You're not going anywhere, Pollock recalled. So we asked some more questions – it turns out no one is getting a marriage license during the shutdown.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe government has remained partially shuttered since before Christmas with President Trump and Democrats seemingly at an impasse over funding for the border wall. Trump has vowed the shutdown will go on for as long as it takes as he's demanded $5 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nWe couldn't stop laughing as two former Democratic staffers whose wedding was put on hold by Trump. — Danielle Geanacopoulos\n\nThank you [Trump] for the #TrumpShutdown, Pollock said with a picture on social media. Thanks to you, the DC marriage bureau is furloughed the week of our wedding. Please stay in Iraq. Sincerely, unwed former public servants.\n\nHe also tagged the photo with the creative hashtag #MyBigFakeGreekWedding.\n\nPARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DRAGS ON: WHAT'S OPEN, WHAT'S CLOSED AND HOW DOES IT IMPACT YOU?\n\nGeanacopoulos and Pollock used to work for Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and have experience with government shutdowns, the pair told BuzzFeed News. Geanacopoulos also formerly worked for Democratic New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.\n\nWe've been furloughed I think twice in our time in the Senate years ago, so we're pretty familiar with what gets funded and what doesn't, Pollock said. It never occurred to either of us.\n\nWe couldn't stop laughing as two former Democratic staffers whose wedding was put on hold by Trump, Geanacopoulos said.\n\nNEW CONGRESS IN 2019: 5 THINGS TO WATCH AS LAWMAKERS GO BACK TO WORK\n\nGeanacopoulos also shared a photo of the couple on their wedding day, referencing their inability to obtain a marriage license.\n\nCan't call it an official wedding until the [government] reopens, so until then, I leave you with this: we closed out 2018 with a really really really good party with those we love most. Thankful beyond measure to enter 2019 with the love of my life and brand new husband, she said.\n\nWashington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser's office said she plans to put forth emergency legislation to establish the authority to issue marriage licenses during a shutdown, WNBC reported.\n\nJust like the Grinch can't steal Christmas, the shutdown can't stop love, the statement read.\n\nBut as BuzzFeed News pointed out, couples wishing to split up are able to still file for divorce during the shutdown as the Family Court is still open, albeit with limited staff.
Any day now, my friend Barronelle Stutzman and her attorneys with Alliance Defending Freedom will hear whether the U.S. Supreme Court will take her case.\n\n\n\nBoth Barronelle and I serve people, and we're happy to serve everyone. I'm a cake artist, and she's a floral designer — the owner of Arlene's Flowers, a small shop she inherited from her mom in Washington state. Both of us find it especially gratifying when customers invite us to design and create iconic aspects of their wedding celebrations. We learn about the couple and craft the custom flower arrangements and wedding cakes that often serve as focal points in their celebrations.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we're not friends just because we love weddings. Barronelle and I both have been forced into long, hard legal battles. We didn't start these fights, but we're at the center of a national conversation about the First Amendment and the rights of creative professionals.\n\nMARC THIESSEN: SUPREME COURT'S HIGH-PROFILE 2020 DOCKET BODES WELL FOR TRUMP\n\n\n\nWe're both quiet, Christian business owners who were asked to use our talents to create custom art celebrating a view of marriage that contradicts our faith. We both believe that marriage is sacred and that God designed it as a union between one man and one woman. But when we politely declined to participate in celebrating something we didn't believe, we both found ourselves targeted by the government.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\n\n\nIn Barronelle's story, the details are important; her voice chokes up a little when she tells it. Rob Ingersoll was a friend and long-time customer for nearly 10 years, Barronelle had created over 30 flower arrangements for him. She knew Rob was gay, but that didn't affect their friendship. When Rob asked her to arrange the flowers for his same-sex wedding, Barronelle gave the decision a lot of thought.\n\n\n\nAfter praying about the situation with her husband, Barronelle knew she couldn't accept Rob's request. So she took him aside, held his hands, and explained her religious conflict. The two continued to talk, and she asked about his engagement story. Before he left, Barronelle referred Rob to three nearby florists she knew would do a good job for him. They hugged, and Barronelle hoped they would stay friends.\n\nBecause of this decision guided by her religious convictions, Barronelle became the target of the Washington attorney general's highly publicized lawsuit — initiated without a complaint from Rob. That lawsuit and another one later brought by the ACLU have taken away her wedding business and now threaten to destroy her financially.\n\nThe state of Washington has turned Barronelle's life upside-down just because it disagrees with her beliefs about marriage. She deserves better. She deserves the freedom to celebrate marriages that are consistent with her faith — without the government harassing her.\n\nWhen news of Barronelle's decision hit the media, Rob was inundated with enough offers for free floral designs that he could have decorated 20 weddings. But because of the attorney general's lawsuit, Barronelle was inundated with hate-filled phone calls, e-mails, and Facebook messages that contained profanity, attacks on her faith, and threats against her safety, including a threat to burn down her shop.\n\n\n\nMore than six years later, Barronelle remains in litigation. Losing these cases could cost her nearly everything she owns. I know some of what she's going through. I've lived it. And she sat in the U.S. Supreme Court near me watching my attorney argue my case in front of the justices.\n\n\n\nAfter hearing my case, the Supreme Court said that my relig­ious beliefs about marriage are protected views, and that the gov­ernment must treat those beliefs with tolerance and respect. Because my state's hostility toward my beliefs was so blatant, the Supreme Court didn't fully address all the questions about my rights as an artist and creator.\n\n\n\nIn 2018, the Supreme Court looked at Barronelle's case in light of mine and decided to send it back to the Washington Supreme Court for reconsideration.\n\nIn June of last year, I was disappointed when the Washington court punished Barronelle again and reissued most of its previous decision word for word. The court concluded that, even though government commissions like the one in my case can't act with hostility toward religion, government officials like the Washington attorney general are free to do just that. That makes no sense.\n\nBut now my friend Barronelle has another chance at justice. The Supreme Court has already said that reasonable and sincere people of faith hold the decent and honorable beliefs we share. If you knew Barronelle like I do, you would know that she's not only reasonable and sincere but also remarkably kind.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe state of Washington has turned Barronelle's life upside-down just because it disagrees with her beliefs about marriage. She deserves better. She deserves the freedom to celebrate marriages that are consistent with her faith — without the government harassing her.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court established important principles in my case, but there's more to be said. That court should hear Barronelle's case, undo the ruling that threatens to bankrupt her, and declare that creative professionals who serve everyone, like Barronelle and I do, need not create custom art celebrating marriages that violate our faith.
Rachel Uchitel is known to the public as one of Tiger Woods' several mistresses in a cheating scandal that led to the demise of his marriage to Elin Nordegren.\n\nIt's been over 10 years since the scandal rocked the pro golfer's world, and now, at the age of 45, Uchitel tells all about their first meeting and the intimate details of their affair in her first-ever TV interview for an upcoming two-part HBO special titled Tiger.\n\nOn camera, Uchitel reveals that the golf star referred to their past secret rendevouz as plugging in, and goes on to say the athlete felt recharged after their trysts, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nUchitel, a former nightclub hostess, recalls speaking to Woods for hours on end about the personal details and relationships in his life, mainly the impact his late father Earl Woods had on him.\n\nTIGER WOODS RELISHES OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY WITH SON, CHARLIE, IN WEEKEND TOURNAMENT\n\nThe documentary reportedly will show Uchitel recalling first locking eyes with Woods, also 45, at a nightclub in New York. That's where Woods allegedly asked for her number and texted her minutes later.\n\nAbout that initial text, Uchitel describes via the outlet: He said something like when can I see you again. It was intimidating. This was Tiger Woods. I knew he was married, I knew he had responsibilities, but he said I want you to fly to Orlando, then I will come see you there.\n\nRACHEL UCHITEL'S REASON FOR BRAIN SURGERY: 'IT FEELS LIKE I WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT'\n\nShe claims it was that night that they began a sexual affair. That was the first night I had sex with him and I remember thinking how am I ever going to be with a mere mortal again because so many people put him on such a pedestal and here he was in my bed, and he was my Tiger.\n\nThe former famed mistress also reportedly discusses ways in which she believes she helped Woods amid his marriage to Nordegren, a Swedish model. According to Uchitel, the two really enjoyed being with each other and Woods found comfort in the mistress' persistent questions about his life.\n\nTIGER WOODS HOPES TO REKINDLE MAGIC AT MOST UNUSUAL MASTERS\n\nHe had trouble sleeping and would have to take Ambien. I'd sit next to him for hours while he'd fall asleep next to me and when he got up he allowed himself to be a little kid, she says in the documentary, according to the outlet.\n\nThe documentary covers Woods' masking of hiring prostitutes in Las Vegas, spending upward of $100,000 on his alleged weekend trysts, the outlet reports.\n\nUchitel says in the film that she has memories of Woods that sound kind of odd, such as him simply watching cartoons and eating cereal in her presence.\n\nHe was like a fountain, he wanted to talk and talk and talk, she claims, noting that Woods implied Nordegren wouldn't pose questions to him about his past as she did.\n\nTheir conversations involved a lot about his childhood and the late Earl.\n\nHe was sick of trying to hide who he was but he was so scared of the real Tiger not living up to the Tiger that everybody else thinks he is, she recalls.\n\nThe former mistress goes on to recall one text message she received from Woods that was particularly complimentary. According to the outlet, Uchitel said it read, You were the only one I ever loved.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nOf her decision to speak out, the Daily Mail said Uchitel believes she has nothing left to lose as the stigma surrounding her name hasn't gone away at all.\n\nShe also claims to have regrets over her fling with Woods.\n\nI regret that he was married and I regret the mistakes that I made but people came at me like they wanted to blame me for the fact a married man cheated on his wife, like I was the only one responsible for his actions, she says in the film.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWoods' divorce from Nordegren became official on Aug. 23, 2010. The former couple share two children: daughter Sam Alexis, 13, and son Charlie Axel, 11. Woods' ex-wife later moved on with Jordan Cameron. Nordegren, 41, and Cameron reportedly welcomed a child together, a baby boy named Arthur, in 2019.\n\nThe first part of Tiger premieres on HBO on Jan. 10, with its second part airing on Jan. 17.
The conservative group One Million Moms is accusing Burger King of crossing the line over an Impossible Whopper commercial that uses the D-word.\n\nBurger King is airing a commercial that uses profanity to advertise its Impossible Whopper -- a burger made from plants instead of beef, the group's website reads. The language in the commercial is offensive, and it's sad that this once family restaurant has made yet another deliberate decision to produce a controversial advertisement instead of a wholesome one.\n\nBURGER KING TO GIVE BRONX RESIDENTS FREE WHOPPERS FOR DEALING WITH 'JOKER STAIRS' TOURISTS\n\nThe group, which is a division of the American Family Association, called out a commercial that documents the reactions of taste tests of the now-popular meatless burger.\n\nOne man, completely stunned by the Impossible Whopper's tastiness says: Damn, that's good.\n\nApparently the use of the D-word went too far for One Million Moms.\n\nOne Million Moms finds this highly inappropriate. When responding to the taste test, he didn't have to curse, the group said. Or if, in fact, it was a real and unscripted interview in which the man was not an actor, then Burger King could have simply chosen to edit the profanity out of the commercial.\n\nCONSPIRATORS ARE CONVINCED BURGER KING'S IMPOSSIBLE WHOPPER GIVES MEN BREASTS\n\nThe group called the ad irresponsible and tasteless.\n\nIt is extremely destructive and damaging to impressionable children viewing the commercial. We all know children repeat what they hear, they continued.\n\nOne Million Moms called for the public to sign a petition urging Burger King to cancel the commercial, or at the very least, edit out the cuss word immediately.\n\nThis isn't the first time the group, which claims its mission is to stop the exploitation of our children, has used its platform to call out a commercial it does not agree with.\n\nHALLMARK PULLS ZOLA COMMERCIAL OF BRIDES KISSING AFTER CONSERVATIVE GROUP CALLS FOR BOYCOTT\n\nLast month, the group caused the Hallmark Channel to initially pull a Zola commercial featuring two brides kissing during a same-sex wedding ceremony.\n\nNow, parents can no longer trust Hallmark because Hallmark is no longer allowing parents to be the primary educators when it comes to sex and sexual morality, One Million Moms said at the time.\n\nHallmark later announced that it decided to pull the commercial just days after the petition was launched. After public backlash, however, the network reversed its decision and reinstated the same-sex marriage commercials.
As a baseball-crazed kid growing up in Miami, Danny Valencia dreamed of playing in the Major Leagues. The thought of heading to the Olympics, for a foreign country no less, never crossed his mind.\n\nBut after nine years and nearly 100 homers in the big leagues, that's the next surreal step for the 35-year-old Valencia, who recently became an Israeli citizen thanks to his Jewishness and is now the star player in Team Israel's improbable run to the Tokyo Games. Baseball is returning to the Olympics after being dropped for 2012 and 2016 and Israel is one of six teams vying for the three medals.\n\nIt's pretty cool to be playing in the Olympics, he told The Associated Press at a team event in Tel Aviv. For it to come about the way it did, especially for my mother who is a practicing Jew and very pro-Israel, it just meant a lot to her. So, to do this, especially at the end of my career, it is like the icing on the cake. \n\nIt's even more of a dream fulfilled for the small baseball community in Israel, comprised mostly of American immigrants, and which has languished for decades in the country's sporting wilderness. Israel has zero tradition of the American pastime, which is largely derided by locals as an arcane and boring sport. In Israel, soccer and basketball reign supreme while baseball, long popular among American Jews, has failed to catch on with the rough-and-tumble native-born Israelis who have taken more of a liking to the strategy and hard hitting of American football.\n\nOnly about 1,000 kids play baseball in Israel and there is just one regulation baseball field in the country. In 2007, a group of American supporters launched the Israel Baseball League, a semi-professional league comprised almost entirely of foreign players that generated little interest and folded after just one season.\n\nBut thanks to a creative outreach campaign to Jewish-American pros, Israel's national team has surged to unthinkable heights.\n\nIt started when Israel fielded a qualifying team for the 2013 World Baseball Classic that was skippered by future Detroit Tigers manager Brad Ausmus and included former all-star Shawn Green. In 2017, Israel made the showcase tournament, upsetting South Korea and Taiwan en route to a surprising 6th-place finish.\n\nBut even that paled in comparison to the sensation of knocking off the top three European teams before routing South Africa 11-1 in September to earn the Europe/Africa Olympic berth and becoming the first team to qualify after host Japan. Mexico and South Korea, which won the Olympic gold in 2008, have since also qualified with the final two openings to be decided in the coming months.\n\nIt's an achievement that Gili Lustig, the executive director of the Israel Olympic Committee, said was nothing short of unbelievable. Extolling praise this week in Hebrew upon the team — nearly none of whose members understood the language — he expressed hope that their Olympic odyssey would finally give the sport its long-awaited boost in Israel.\n\nWhat's important is to leverage your participation to grow baseball in Israel, he said. I have no doubt you will represent us well.\n\nLustig noted that the 24-member group will represent the first time Israel is sending a team sport to the Olympics since 1976, when it sent a soccer team, and will make the Israeli delegation to Tokyo the country's largest ever.\n\nBaseball is one of five sports that were added to the 2020 Summer Olympics. It won't be back in Paris in 2024 but seems likely to return once again for Los Angeles 2028.\n\nUnlike the World Baseball Classic, whose heritage rule allowed countries to field players who were merely eligible for citizenship, the Olympics requires its participants to be full-fledged citizens of the countries they represent. Israel grants citizenship to anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent and in recent months the players have been going through the process, providing marriage certificates, letters from rabbis and other proof of their Judaism. Five of the players have Major League experience and others who find themselves outside opening day rosters may join later before the games kick off in July.\n\nAmong the former major leaguers on the team are Jon Moscot, Ty Kelly and Josh Zeid.\n\nOnce in Israel, they've faced an even greater challenge in drawing interest among a skeptical audience that couldn't tell the difference between a strikeout and a stolen base. Even Israeli President Reuven Rivlin offered his greetings with a caveat while meeting the team during their current week-long promotional visit to the Holy Land.\n\nIt's not a secret that I prefer soccer, but you can't ignore your exciting achievement, he told them at his Jerusalem residence.\n\nTeam Israel head coach Eric Holtz, himself an American Jew who plans to apply for citizenship, said he is aiming to double the number of local players in Israel within two years of the Olympics. He said his primary mission was to instill our love and passion to the five and six-year-old kids throughout this country and show them what a great game this is.\n\nAs for the Olympic Games themselves, he noted that Israel would be an underdog, as usual, but still had a theoretical 50% chance of winning a medal.\n\nNobody gave us a shot ... and we shocked the world, Holtz said of the qualifying process. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity and we as a team couldn't be prouder to represent Israel.
Kate Hudson is hoping to reconnect with her father and siblings in 2021.\n\nThe actress has been estranged from her father, Bill Hudson, for several years. Bill was married to Kate's mother, Goldie Hawn, but they divorced in the early 1980s after several years of marriage. Bill went on to have two children with his new wife, Cindy Williams, as well as a third daughter named Lalania.\n\nSpeaking on an episode of the Sibling Revelry podcast that she shares with her brother, Oliver Hudson, the 41-year-old actress revealed that she's been rethinking letting her dad and his children into her life. According to People, the duo was discussing New Year's resolutions, prompting Kate to note that, although she doesn't have a specific resolution, she's been rethinking her family connections.\n\nYou know what I've been thinking about lately? Dad, Kate shared. I've been thinking about our sisters that we don't spend any time with and our brother — brothers. We've got four siblings we don't spend any time with, she said, in an apparent reference that includes Bill Hudson's three children and Wyatt, the son of Kurt Russell, longtime love of Kate's mom.\n\nKATE HUDSON SHARES GOLDIE HAWN TRIBUTE ON HER MOM'S 75TH BIRTHDAY: 'I LOVE YOU TO INFINITY AND BEYOND'\n\nThe star noted that her siblings are getting older and that she would now welcome having a little contact with them in her life.\n\nI was thinking about how everybody's getting older, she continued. It would be nice to connect a little bit, especially with my sisters.\n\nShe added: We've been talking so much about sibling relationships and distraught relationships or good relations — and we're sitting here like we have the best family, we're so great and yet we don't ever acknowledge the fact that we have four other siblings. Four. So I've been thinking about the Hudsons. Thinking it's important that we reach out with all of our siblings and maybe connect with them a little bit.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nThe actress told Howard Stern in 2016 that she's forgiven her father for walking out on her mother, who later moved on to date Russell.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI really do recognize whatever those issues are, it's just something that he has to live with, and that must be painful for him. So I forgive him, she told the radio show host at the time.
After nearly 70 years of marriage, William Daniels and Bonnie Bartlett have some wisdom to share.\n\nThe Boy Meets World actor and the Emmy-winning actress will celebrate their 70-year anniversary on June 30, 2021.\n\nI think our relationship is based on mutual respect and I think she is smarter than me, a better actor than me, and so I just hang out, you know, and try to get along, Daniels, 93, revealed to Forbes magazine on Monday.\n\nHe doesn't mean that at all! chuckled Bartlett, 91.\n\nJENNIFER LOPEZ ADMITS SHE'S CONTEMPLATING NOT MARRYING ALEX RODRIGUEZ: 'WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR US?'\n\nI'm an actor! joked Daniels. I'm making it up as I go along.\n\nBartlett said that it's her husband's sense of humor that has kept their romance fresh for decades.\n\nHe makes me laugh, she said. His humor, his sense of humor and his ability during every day to find something funny is really good for me because I'm very intense.\n\nBut life wasn't always blissful for the pair. Back in 2017, Bartlett told People magazine that at one point, she was ready to leave after the death of her niece who was killed. Bartlett said her niece was like a daughter to me.\n\nAMAL CLOONEY CALLS HUSBAND GEORGE CLOONEY 'WONDERFULLY ENCOURAGING AND INSPIRING' AT BOOK LAUNCH\n\nYou insisted we come to Hollywood and I didn't want to, she reminded Daniels at the time. It was at a very tough time. I'd lost my niece.\n\nBartlett told the outlet that we had gotten through a lot.\n\nBut he really was starting to drink a lot, she reflected. And he was drinking after the show. Sometimes you didn't know – I mean I didn't know if he was going to come home or not. He did always, but he was drinking. And God knows what else he was doing… And he was into that whole, 'I'm a star' kind of thing. You know, he got into that.\n\nAnd I thought, 'I want no part of this,' she continued. I was confused because there was no way I wanted to take [our sons] away from him. No way. And so I thought, well – I was pondering it.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN AND KANYE WEST 'SPEND A LOT OF TIME APART' BUT REMAIN FOCUSED ON KIDS\n\nDespite her initial hesitations, Bartlett eventually relocated to Los Angeles from New York. She soon scored a role on Little House on the Prairie.\n\nSuddenly, working like that and living in a little house in the valley with the boys and finding a nice school for them and everything, I sort of connected with him again, she said. It took a little while – it took about a year of really hating him.\n\nLooking back, Bartlett said she's very glad – I've always been very glad – that I stayed.\n\nAnd that we have had this long marriage and now I'm totally, I mean, we totally respect and adore each other, she said. We're together all the time.
Testimony by Jeffrey Epstein's ex-girlfriend about her sexual experiences with consenting adults can remain secret when a transcript is released next week, a judge said Tuesday.\n\nThe ruling by U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska in Manhattan pertained to a July 2016 deposition of Ghislaine Maxwell in a civil lawsuit brought by one of Maxwell's accusers that has since been settled.\n\nAlthough the prurient interest of some may be left un-satiated as a result, Ms. Maxwell's interest in keeping private the details of her sexual relationships with consenting adults warrants the sealing of those portions of her testimony, Preska said at a hearing conducted electronically because of the coronavirus.\n\nFEDERAL JUDGE SLAMS GHISLAINE MAXWELL FOR MISLEADING COURT ON WEALTH, MARRIAGE\n\nLawyers for the 59-year-old British socialite had objected to the transcript being made public on the grounds that it could damage her chance at a fair trial on charges that she recruited three underage girls in the 1990s for Epstein.\n\nPreska said Maxwell's lawyers had failed to show how the unsealing of the deposition transcript will jeopardize a trial that isn't slated to begin until July or why publicity about the document cannot be overcome through a fair jury selection process.\n\nThe judge also ordered the release in eight days of dozens of other documents sought by the Miami Herald.\n\nA message seeking comment was left with a lawyer for Maxwell.\n\nEpstein, a wealthy financier and convicted sex offender, killed himself in a Manhattan jail in 2019 as he awaited a sex trafficking trial.\n\nMaxwell, who is held without bail at a Brooklyn federal lockup, has pleaded not guilty to charges that she recruited girls for Epstein and sometimes joined in the abuse of them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe hearing Tuesday was briefly interrupted when the judge was told that audio of the proceeding was being aired online.\n\nWhoever is doing it, you are operating against the law. I suspect there is a way to find out. So I will ask you, most respectfully, to stop doing it. We have had enough of lack of the rule of law around here. Let's try to observe it, Preska said.\n\nThe audio was online on a page that included comments by individuals who seemed to embrace QAnon, a far-right conspiracy theory.
Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke says he'd strip churches of tax-exempt status if they don't support same-sex marriage.\n\nWhen the former Texas congressman was asked if religious institutions -- colleges, churches, charities -- should be stripped of tax-exempt status Thursday night by CNN anchor Don Lemon during the LGBTQ town hall, he immediately responded, Yes.\n\nCNN'S CHRIS CUOMO'S 'MINE TOO' JOKE TO KAMALA HARRIS AT LGBTQ EVENT DRAWS BACKLASH\n\nThe crowd erupted in applause before O'Rourke further explained.\n\nThere can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone or any institution, any organization in America, that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us, he said. So as president, we're going to make that a priority, and we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.\n\nBOOKER QUOTES THIS OLD TESTAMENT BIBLE VERSE TO DEFEND LGBTQ RIGHTS\n\nIn O'Rourke's Plan to Pursue Equality for LGBTQ+ People and Ensure They Can Live Openly Without Fear of Discrimination or Violence, he lists reversing the Trump administration's attempt to expand religious exemptions in order to enable discrimination or harm others.\n\nHe adds, Freedom of religion is a fundamental right, but it should not be used to discriminate.\n\nMatt Lewis, CNN political commentator, tweeted out, This isn't going to help win the electoral college. If you wonder why so many Christians are willing to hold their nose and support someone as horrible as Donald Trump, this helps explain it.\n\nLuke Goodrich, vice president and senior counsel at Becket, a religious liberty law firm, called it blatantly unconstitutional, adding it's also foolish because those groups provide billions of dollars in essential social services to their communities. Churches and ministries should be allowed to hold centuries-old beliefs without fear of government retribution.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nAnd Hiram Sasser, general counsel for First Liberty Institute, told Fox News their faith-based organization has taken on the government before.\n\nWhen the Obama IRS came after pastors gathering together in conferences with Rick Perry support traditional marriage, we had to defend the pastors, Sasser said. We beat the IRS then and we would do it again if O'Rourke attacks churches with the IRS in the future.\n\nPresident Trump has championed religious liberty, largely winning the evangelical vote in 2016, and earlier this year, his administration launched a global effort to decriminalize homosexuality.
Gisele Bundchen opened up about the ways in which she's removing stress from her life in favor of more mindful, healthy habits.\n\nThe 39-year-old model, who is the face of Dior's Capture Totale campaign, recently spoke with Elle magazine about the campaign and the lifestyle changes she's made in the wake of struggling with anxiety and panic attacks in her 20s.\n\nTOM BRADY OPENS UP ABOUT MARRIAGE TO GISELE BUNDCHEN\n\nI felt like my world just kept getting smaller and smaller. I became a prisoner in my own life, she told the outlet in a video from Dior. On the outside I could have everything, I guess, but on the inside I couldn't breathe. I think that was the moment for me that I realized I had to change some of my habits.\n\nPart of that change included shedding away notions that it's important to fit in and be accepted by others.\n\nGISELE BUNDCHEN, DAUGHTER VIVIAN LOOK NEARLY IDENTICAL IN THROWBACK PHOTO\n\nWe believe that we have to look a certain way or do a certain thing to be accepted, but that's not the case and that's unnecessary stress, she explained.

Speaking on the Senate floor, McConnell said he had just spoken to the president about the border security bill set to be voted on in Congress. McConnell said he supported Trump declaring a national emergency, something the president has suggested for weeks he might do. The White House did not immediately comment to Fox News. The Senate is set to vote on the compromise first on Thursday, followed by the House. Congressional negotiators announced Monday they'd reached 'an agreement in principle' on border security funding that includes more than $1.3 billion for physical barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. The White House initially requested $5.7 billion for the border wall. Lawmakers have until 11:59 p.m. Friday to get the agreement through both houses of Congress and signed by Trump [before] what would be the second partial government shutdown this year.\n\n\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: FOR LOVE OF COUNTRY\n\nIn the mild season of peace, with minds unoccupied by other subjects, [the convention] passed many months in cool, uninterrupted, and daily consultation; and finally, without having been awed by power, or influenced by any passions except love for their country, they presented and recommended to the people the plan produced by their joint and very unanimous councils. – John Jay, Federalist No. 2\n\n\n\nTIME OUT: IN DEFENSE OF VALENTINE'S DAY\n\n[Ed. note: We are inaugurating a new Valentine's Day tradition. Because of the great response we got last year from the offering you will find below, we're pressing repeat. Much love to you, dear readers.]\n\nSt. Valentine's Day has become sour rather than sweet for Americans, especially as the rise of social media has encouraged even more ostentatious displays of affection and invariably produced the desired result: envy.\n\n\n\nNow, there's nothing wrong with the holiday when it comes to children. Cutting valentines and enjoying sweet treats is the kind of harmless fun that parents and teachers can enjoy too. But when it comes to the actual object of the holiday, we have gone rather off the boards.\n\n\n\nIt was February 14th in probably the year 278 when a Christian pastor called Valentine was executed by the order of Roman Emperor Claudius II. There was lots that the empire did not like about the growing Christian faith, but much of the concern centered on military preparedness. How could a faith that preached unconditional love, forgiveness and a peace which surpasses all understanding be compatible with the martial, conquering spirit of Rome?\n\n\n\nA material consideration for Claudius was that he was having a harder time getting young men to join the legions because of the emphasis on family and children among Christians. Accordingly, he banned Christian marriage. Valentine, undaunted, continued to perform the ceremonies in secret. When he was caught, the pastor was dragged before the prefect of Rome and condemned to be beaten to death and have his head cut off (not that he would have noticed by then).\n\n\n\nNow, there are a few contenders for the title of the real St. Valentine, so the world will never actually know the details of his story, which have long been intertwined with legend and folklore. But, it seems pretty clear that there was a pastor willing to pay the ultimate earthly price to celebrate and sanctify the romantic love between a man and women. His actions and the veneration of them is a reflection of the centrality of that love to the worldview of Christianity, and, by extension, Western civilization.\n\n\n\nThere is much to deplore in the modern Valentine's Day of edible underwear, overpriced roses and cheesy Instagram posts. But there is much to celebrate when it comes to our society's continuing affection for affection, especially at a time when we are both more connected and more alone ever in history. The story of Valentine and his sacrifice is a reminder that Eros, while not a rightful object of worship itself, is a love worth celebrating.\n\n\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\n\n\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nTrump job performance\n\nAverage approval: 41.8 percent\n\nAverage disapproval: 54.4 percent\n\nNet Score: -12.6 points\n\nChange from one week ago: up 3.6 points\n\n[Average includes: Fox News: 46% approve - 52% disapprove; Gallup: 44% approve - 52% unapproved; CNN: 42% approve - 54% disapproval; IBD: 39% approve - 57% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 38% approve - 57% disapprove.]\n\n\n\nSOURCE: BIDEN ALMOST CERTAIN TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT\n\nFox News: Former Vice President Joe Biden is almost certain to run for president in 2020, a source with direct knowledge told Fox News on Thursday. The source said the timing of an announcement is still up in the air. With such a crowded field of Democratic hopefuls, Biden wants to keep big donors and potential staffers with him, and has been conducting outreach to former colleagues, grassroots activists and contributors, the source said. Fox News also confirmed through two sources that California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein met privately Thursday morning with Biden. The sources said Feinstein expects Biden to run. A 'Friends of Joe' group, which has been inactive since 2016, has been busy with a flurry of emails, conversations and activities, the source said. The group comprises longtime aides, donors, supporters and friends.\n\n\n\nHoward Dean to head Dems' new voter database - AP: Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez is declaring a major victory ahead of the 2020 presidential election, with the help of one of his most well-known predecessors. Howard Dean, the one-time presidential candidate, former Vermont governor and ex-DNC chairman, is set to head a new data exchange operation that Democrats hope puts them back on par with Republicans in the never-ending race to use voter data to drive Americans to the polls. State party leaders on Wednesday approved the arrangement hammered out by DNC officials, state party leaders and Democratic consultants. … The arrangement would allow the national party, state parties and independent political action groups on the left to share voter data in real time during campaigns. … When a presidential campaign spends big money on consumer data to update voter profiles, the new information would go into the central file as well.\n\n\n\nMidwestern Dems push for Milwaukee to host convention - Politico: Top Midwestern Democrats and business leaders are engaged in a frenzied, last-minute effort to bring the Democratic National Convention to Milwaukee next year, insisting that a Wisconsin convention presence would help repair the frayed relationship between the party and heartland voters. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has been involved in the behind-the-scenes overtures, offering up his own political muscle to lure the marquee political event to his neighboring state. Pritzker told POLITICO on Wednesday he spoke to Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers this week about helping to land the convention. … Midwestern Democrats say locating in Milwaukee would help heal the wounds left by a 2016 general election campaign that saw Hillary Clinton skip Wisconsin and then unexpectedly lose the state to President Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nHarris fact-checked over 'nonsensical' claim Trump hiked taxes on middle class - Fox News: Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a 2020 presidential hopeful, is under fire for claiming that lower tax refunds are a sign that the Trump tax cuts are 'a middle-class tax hike' -- something a top fact-checker described as 'nonsensical and misleading.' 'The average tax refund is down about $170 compared to last year. Let's call the President's tax cut what it is: a middle-class tax hike to line the pockets of already wealthy corporations and the 1 percent,' she said in a tweet. Harris was apparently reacting to information from initial returns that the average refund is down approximately 8 percent. But, as fact checkers quickly pointed out, the size of one's refund has more to do with how much was withheld for taxes over the course of the year rather than one's overall tax burden.\n\n\n\nJulian Castro still lacking support from Hispanic Caucus - Politico: Julián Castro is the lone Latino candidate in the crowded 2020 Democratic primary field. He's uniquely positioned to capture the support of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which has more members than ever and more clout. Yet so far, he's come up dry. Just one of the 38-member group has publicly endorsed Castro's bid since his campaign announcement last month — his twin brother, Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), who chairs the CHC and also serves as chairman of Julián's campaign. It isn't personal, according to interviews with CHC members. The reluctance so far to commit to Castro, they say, is largely due to home-state loyalties or political caution in a race that's still taking shape.\n\n\n\nSCHUMER DISCUSSES ANOTHER SENATE RUN FOR BETO\n\nPolitico: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer met with former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke last week to discuss a possible 2020 Senate campaign against GOP Sen. John Cornyn, according to a source familiar with the meeting. O'Rourke, a Democrat who lost narrowly against Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018, is considering running for president and hasn't publicly discussed running again for Senate in 2020. But he also hasn't ruled it out. O'Rourke and former Obama Cabinet secretary Julián Castro — who has announced his own White House bid — are considered by many Democrats to be the party's best prospects for defeating Cornyn. A spokesman for O'Rourke did not return a request for comment on the meeting. Schumer's office declined to comment.\n\n\n\nMark Kelly could face some opposition to Arizona Senate run - HuffPo: Democratic operatives are ecstatic about Mark Kelly's decision to run against appointed Arizona Republican Sen. Martha McSally in 2020. He's a dream candidate… However, the party's left wing is holding off on the celebrations for now. Public records show Kelly voted in the 2012 GOP primary while living in Texas, meaning he likely cast a ballot for either Mitt Romney or one of the host of conservatives running against President Barack Obama and either Ted Cruz or David Dewhurst for Senate. (A Kelly spokesperson said he voted for Obama in the general election.) And progressives both in the state and nationally have long been preparing for Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Latino veteran of the war in Afghanistan and member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, to run for the seat. Gallego is still considering a bid, potentially creating an ideological clash with Kelly.\n\n\n\nWill 2020 bring the first female senator to Colorado? - Roll Call: Colorado Democrats have their sights on Sen. Cory Gardner, one of the most vulnerable senators in 2020 and one of two Republicans running in a state won by Hillary Clinton. And some see the race as an opportunity to do something historic: send a woman to the U.S. Senate. … Colorado is one of just five states that has never elected a female governor or senator. Former Colorado Democratic Party Chairwoman Pat Waak said there have been ongoing discussions among female activists about the importance of having a woman challenge Gardner. … Two women — scientist Trish Zornio, who trained with Emerge Colorado and has been traveling across the state, and activist Lorena Garcia — are already running for the Democratic nomination. But female activists haven't yet coalesced around either so far.\n\n\n\nNew gubernatorial candidate joins Mississippi race - [Mississippi] Clarion Ledger: Retired longtime state Supreme Court Chief Justice Bill Waller Jr., son of a former governor, is planning a gubernatorial run this year as a Republican, sources involved in his planning confirmed Wednesday. One of Waller's main campaign themes is expected to be that he is the only Republican candidate who can beat Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood — who remains very popular in an otherwise deep red state — in the race for governor. Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, already with $7 million in his campaign war chest, has been the presumptive GOP front-runner. But Reeves has trailed Hood in past and recent polling and is unpopular with some segments of the establishment state GOP and hard-line conservatives. Another Republican in the race, freshman state Rep. Robert Foster, a farmer from Hernando, lacks the name recognition and fundraising capacity of Reeves and Waller.\n\n\n\nTHE JUDGE'S RULING: AN INCREDIBLE FREE SPEECH DEBATE\n\nThis week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano discusses the president, his ex-aide Cliff Sims and an incredible free speech debate: A former White House communications aide and former Trump campaign adviser who has written a blistering tell-all book about the Trump White House now finds himself in litigation about whether he can freely publish his book -- which he has already done -- and freely profit from it. The former Trump friend and colleague is Cliff Sims, and his book is called 'Team of Vipers.' … When Sims began his time as an official of the Trump campaign, he signed a nondisclosure agreement, or NDA. … Can the government punish speech of someone who agreed to remain silent? In a word: No. It cannot deter speech, and it cannot chill speech. Chilling takes place when government behavior is so oppressive that the potential speaker is afraid to speak about what he knows.

Seventeen-year-old Cole Salsman had his GoPro camera recording as he slid down the hill with dozens of other kids who were out of class because of widespread school cancellations Tuesday. 'We hitting the ramp boys?' Salsman is heard asking as they speed toward a bump. But it wasn't a ramp he hit seconds later – it was the rat. In the video, the critter is seen deftly dodging another sled before colliding with Salsman. 'I thought somebody's toboggan snapped and a piece of plastic flew my way,' he said. Shrieks from nearby sledders can be heard as the rodent ricochets off the sled, lands in the snow, and scurries away to safety. While getting a rat in your lap might ruin someone's day of fun, Salsman took it in stride. 'I think it made it better,' he said. No word on whether the rat was injured in the collision.\n\n\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…\n\nHaving a child, I discovered, makes you dream again and, at the same time, makes the dreams utterly real. – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on June 28, 1985.\n\n\n\nBrianna McClelland contributed to this report.

Shania Twain spoke candidly about her twisted relationship with husband Frédéric Thiébaud more than a decade after their love story captivated the public's attention.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with AARP Magazine, the Man!

But so beautifully twisted.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Twain's ex-husband of 14 years, Robert John Mutt Lange, ended their marriage. It soon came to light that he was having an affair with Twain's friend and personal assistant, Marie-Ann Thiébaud, Frédéric's wife at the time.\n\nFrédéric quickly became a source of support for the singer, as both were going through the exact same betrayal. Eventually, in 2009, that support system turned romantic and the duo married in 2011.\n\nGRAMMY AWARDS 2020 PRESENTERS REVEALED: KEITH URBAN, SHANIA TWAIN SET TO APPEAR\n\nThere were days I didn't really care if tomorrow came, Twain told the magazine.\n\nSurvival is everything, she added.

I found a way out.\n\nNow that she's been content for several years in her second marriage, the star is looking forward to big developments in her professional career. In June of 2019, she announced that she'll be performing 23 shows in a Las Vegas residency at Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino for a show titled Let's Go!\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNot everybody gets invited to do a residency and certainly not a long-term residency. It's one thing to go and do six shows or something like that, but when you're in a long-term residency, it's a commitment, Twain said at the time. A really big commitment.

I think people always wonder why they're not falling out, but there's a net here [that's] hidden.\n\nAmfAR Gala New York serves as the unofficial kickoff to New York Fashion Week and honors individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\nHeidi Klum Is Engaged to Tom Kaulitz!\n\nI've been supporting amfAR since the year 2000, Klum shared.

There was one British royal who admitted to watching The Crown.\n\nThe Netflix series traces the nearly 70-year reign of Queen Elizabeth II. While the historical drama has been much dissected since its 2016 premiere for its dramatic interpretations of the royal family, the current fourth season has sparked the most debates and headlines.\n\nSet in the '80s, the series now focuses on the widely publicized marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, as well as the 11-year tenure of Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, which transformed and divided Britain.\n\nIt also depicted Prince Andrew's 1986 nuptials to Sarah Ferguson. Tom Bryne portrayed Andrew, 60, and Jessica Aquilina starred as the Duchess of York, 61.\n\nPRINCE HARRY ADDRESSES CAPITOL RIOTS, SAYS SOCIAL MEDIA PLAYED A ROLE: 'NO WAY TO DOWNPLAY THIS'\n\nI thought it was filmed beautifully, Ferguson told Us Weekly on Monday. The cinematography was excellent. I loved the way they put my wedding in as well.\n\nFerguson's marriage to Andrew ended in 1996. The former couple shares two daughters: Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.\n\nWhile Ferguson gave The Crown a positive review, not everyone associated with the royal family has been raving over the show.\n\nFormer royal press secretary Dickie Arbiter previously called The Crown a hatchet job on Charles and Diana. Arbiter has also accused the series of stretching dramatic license to the extreme, The Hollywood Reporter shared.\n\nAHEAD OF INAUGURATION, BIDEN RECEIVED MESSAGE FROM QUEEN ELIZABETH\n\nDiana's brother, Charles Spencer, has also said the show should carry a notice that this isn't true but it is based around some real events.\n\nI worry people do think that this is gospel and that's unfair, the 56-year-old told broadcaster ITV.\n\nNetflix has since rejected calls from British Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden to add a disclaimer to the series that states it is a work of fiction. The streaming giant said the show is presented in enough context.\n\nWe have always presented 'The Crown' as a drama — and we have every confidence our members understand it's a work of fiction that's broadly based on historical events, according to a statement released by Netflix.\n\nPRINCE WILLIAM ENCOURAGES BRITISH CITIZENS TO GET CORONAVIRUS VACCINE AMID PUBLIC UNCERTAINTY\n\nAs a result, we have no plans — and see no need — to add a disclaimer.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Crown creator Peter Morgan, whose work also includes recent-history dramas The Queen and Frost/Nixon, has defended his work, saying it is thoroughly researched and true in spirit.\n\nIn a 2017 discussion of The Crown, Morgan said, you sometimes have to forsake accuracy, but you must never forsake truth.\n\nSteven Fielding, a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham, said the suggestion that The Crown carry a disclaimer was reasonable and yet pointless.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDiana passed away in 1997 at age 36 from injuries she sustained in a Paris car crash.

Cindy McCain, the widow of the late GOP Sen. John McCain, told prospective Arizona Republican candidates in a tweet that they should questions the party's leadership, philosophy and values.\n\nThe social media post was a direct response to her expected censure by the state Republicans for her supposed ties to leftist, globalist causes and failure to support President Trump by endorsing President-elect Joe Biden.\n\nTime for some soul-searching in the Arizona GOP, she wrote in a tweet, which included a link to The Arizona Republic\n\nPHOENIX MAN IN CAPITOL RIOT DRESSED IN HORNS, BEARSKIN HEADDRESS IS ARRESTED, CHARGED\n\nArizona, a traditionally red state, played an important role in the Democrats' victory in the U.S. Senate and Joe Biden's presidential win.\n\nThe state's Republican Party, led by Chairwoman Dr. Kelli Ward, is seeking retribution -- starting with McCain, who endorsed the former vice president during the election and has since joined his transition team advisory board.\n\nThe resolution will be up for consideration at the party's annual meeting on Jan. 23, according to the @AZGOP Twitter account.\n\nA draft of the text lists McCain's support of gay marriage, Biden and condemnation of Trump as reasons to dissolve any connections whatsoever with McCain, even going as far as to say that McCain acted in direct opposition to Republican values, the interests of the American people, and the Constitution of the United States.\n\nMcCain's late husband was not a fan of Trump and vice versa. The two traded blows up until McCain's death in August 2018.\n\nThe state's party issued a similar denouncement of the senator in 2014, but he went on to beat Ward in the 2016 Republican primary.\n\nIn an interview in The Arizona Republic, one of a handful throughout the course of the last few months, McCain said she was not surprised by the resolution and continuous insults and personal attacks from Arizona GOP Chairman Kelli Ward.\n\nMcCain said Ward's assault was politically motivated and her involvement in both Senate elections to replace her husband and former Republican Sen. Jeff Flake resulted in Democrat wins.\n\nAs Chairman of the AZGOP she managed to turn Arizona blue in November for the first time since 1996, she told the Republic. Maybe she should be reminded that my husband never lost an Arizona election since his first win in 1982; he and Governor [Doug] Ducey are the last two Republicans to win statewide races in Arizona.\n\nMcCain accused Ward of backing GOP Congressmen Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs -- two of the three lawmakers who activist Ali Alexander said helped organize the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn response, state Republican Party spokesman Zachery Henry accused McCain of pushing a false narrative about a perceived grudge and said that the censure is actually a tragic indictment by the Republican Party of Arizona at large of her own efforts to campaign for and support left-wing Democratic candidates.\n\nMcCain and the Arizona Republican Party did not immediately return messages from Fox News seeking comment.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Arizona Republican Party will also meet to consider the censure of Republican Gov. Doug Ducey for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFlake, who faced criticisms similar to those against McCain, was successfully censured by Maricopa County Republicans earlier this month.\n\nI'm in good company, he tweeted last week, referring to McCain.

It appears Justin Hartley and Chrishell Stause are officially divorced.\n\nThe actors split in 2019 after marrying in 2017, and have now reached a settlement, according to multiple reports.\n\nBoth parties entered into a confidential settlement as to terms of the divorce, including spousal support, an insider told Us Weekly.\n\nThese days, Chrishell has moved on with her life, a second source told the outlet, and she's now looking forward to new beginnings.

Forty-five minutes later, the world knew.\n\nShe continued: Because of the crazy way in which this went down, people want answers, and I f-----g want answers.\n\n'THIS IS US' STAR JUSTIN HARTLEY FILES FOR DIVORCE FROM CHRISHELL STAUSE AFTER 2 YEARS OF MARRIAGE: REPORT\n\nThe decision to divorce was quick and impulsive, she said.\n\nIn a fight, that's his go-to, you know?

The mainstream media fawned over President Joe Biden's every move on Wednesday, offering a stark contrast from the way the press reacted to his predecessor.\n\nEverything from Biden's rhetoric to his marriage was complimented throughout Inauguration Day.\n\nWhat a great love story between Jill Biden and Joe Biden, MSNBC host Joy Reid said at one point. It's a wonderful story, and we haven't had a love story in the White House in four years.\n\nABC News' Byron Pitts called Biden papa-in-chief, while MSNBC's Brian Williams declared the country was back and under new management. Reid also said the old America had lost the 2020 election and hoped new America wins the war.\n\nCNN ANCHORS CAN'T HIDE EXCITEMENT AS TRUMP EXITS WHITE HOUSE: 'HE JUST LOOKS LIKE A SMALL MAN'\n\nGod bless Joe Biden. This is a truly deeply religious man with incredible compassion, and he's got a great partner in Kamala Harris, Reid added.\n\nNBC News presidential historian Michael Beschloss said the country had a happy ending with Biden's victory. This is Joe Biden's day, but actually it's not Joe Biden's day. It's the country's day, gushed CBS' John Dickerson.\n\nBiden was called a breath of fresh air and a man who gave Americans permission to feel good about who we are, while MSNBC's Chuck Todd labeled him the better angel president.\n\nI can finally feel myself beginning to unclench my jaw, drop my shoulders, and exhale, author Jill Filipovic wrote for an opinion piece published by CNN.\n\nBIDEN TO SIGN 17 EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ACTIONS DURING FIRST DAY IN OFFICE\n\nThe Biden lovefest was so over the top that the Media Research Center put together a two-minute montage featuring some of the most egregious examples:\n\nThese adoring takes are really just the tip of the iceberg as far as the praise TV journalists had for Biden's inauguration, MRC media editor Bill D'Agostino wrote. It's not as though anyone actually expected TV newsrooms across America to cover today's inauguration objectively. But boy, did they lay it on thick.\n\nThe partisan nature of the coverage was perhaps most blatant on CNN where everyone from alleged news anchors to network executives openly mocked the outgoing president while publicly cheering the beginning of the Biden administration.\n\nBIDEN, HARRIS POST-INAUGURATION MEDIA COVERAGE EXPECTED TO BE MUCH FRIENDLIER THAN TRUMP-ERA VITRIOL\n\nCNN's David Chalian set the tone for the liberal network Tuesday when he proclaimed the lights on the National Mall's reflecting pool were like extensions of Joe Biden's arms embracing America.\n\nJake Tapper, who is billed as a straight news anchor despite regularly offering his liberal opinions, declared that President Trump was disgraceful as the 45th president prepared to board Marine One and head to Joint Base Andrews. Tapper's colleague Wolf Blitzer even mocked the size of the crowd waiting for Trump as pathetic, while Dana Bash claimed he looked small.\n\nAfter Trump spoke, Tapper called the address an embarrassment, while Blitzer described the remarks as repulsive.\n\nWhen Biden was sworn in hours alter, CNN personalities had a much different reaction, with Blitzer calling the 46th president's remarks an address like no other and Tapper saltuing the new president's determination and passion.\n\nCNN celebrated Biden for much of the day, taking jabs at Trump in the process.\n\nCNN PULLS COMBATIVE QUESTIONER JIM ACOSTA FROM WHITE HOUSE BEAT WITH BIDEN SET TO TAKE OFFICE\n\nBiden's inauguration speech was applauded by critics on both sides of the aisle, as it seemed like everyone with access to social media tweeted, Democracy has prevailed, after it was uttered by the 46th president.\n\nBut Biden's speech wasn't the only thing that media members fawned over and many descended upon Twitter to express excitement over the new commander-in-chief and disdain for his predecessor.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNot all of the praise was reserved for the new president. Atlantic staff writer Edward-Isaac Dovere fondly recalled Kamala Harris's hair blowing in the wind as she took the oath of office as vice president as [o]ne of the simple, enduring images of the day.\n\nNo one with longer hair (in other words: a woman) has ever taken the oath of office outside at the Capitol before, because she's the first woman to ever do it, he helpfully explained.
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg took incoming fire on electability issues from former Vice President Joe Biden and other rivals in the eighth presidential primary debate as Democrats search for a candidate capable of beating President Trump in November.\n\nThe debate Friday night in Manchester, N.H., was the last meeting of the candidates before the Granite State's primary on Tuesday, and candidates did not shy away from drawing attention to their rivals' perceived political vulnerabilities.\n\nThe president wants very much to stick a label on every candidate, Biden said of how Trump would treat the eventual Democratic nominee. Bernie's labeled himself -- not me -- a democratic socialist. I think that's the label the president's going to lay on everyone running with Bernie if he's the nominee.\n\nThe president wants very much to stick a label on every candidate. — Joe Biden\n\nCLICK HERE FOR 2020 DELEGATE TRACKER, STATE RESULTS, PRIMARY CALENDAR AND MORE\n\nCandidates also repeatedly hit Buttigieg on his experience, arguing the 38-year-old may not be equipped to beat Trump.\n\nHe's the mayor of a small city, Biden said before going on to list several of his own major policy accomplishments as a U.S. senator and as former President Barack Obama's vice president, defending his politics of the past as effective. Biden touted his work on the Violence Against Women Act, Obama's economic stimulus package and same-sex marriage.\n\nBillionaire Democratic booster Tom Steyer also piled on: That's why I'm worried about Mayor Pete. You need to be able to go toe-to-toe with this guy [Trump] and take him down on the debate stage or you're going to lose.\n\nYou need to be able to go toe-to-toe with this guy [Trump] and take him down on the debate stage or you're going to lose. — Tom Steyer\n\nRace and reparations\n\nThe candidates also sparred over issues related to race, with Steyer calling for reparations for African-Americans and Buttigieg clashing with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on criminal justice.\n\nThe ABC News moderators threw Buttigieg against a wall on his time as the South Bend mayor, noting, over his objections, that the rate of black arrests for drug possession increased after he took office.\n\nWARREN APPEARS TO TARGET BUTTIGIEG AS SHE SLAMS PEOPLE WHO 'SUCK UP TO BILLIONAIRES'\n\nWe adopted a strategy that said that drug enforcement would be targeted in cases where there was a connection to the most violent group or gang connected to a murder, Buttigieg said. These things are all connected, but that's the point.\n\nWe adopted a strategy that said that drug enforcement would be targeted. — Pete Buttigieg\n\nWhen asked whether Buttigieg's answer was sufficient, Warren was terse.\n\nNo, she said. You have to own up to the facts, and it's important to own up to the facts of how race has totally permeated our criminal justice system.\n\nBiden also questioned Buttigieg's ability to attract support from minorities.\n\nBIDEN: 'THE POLITICS OF THE PAST WERE NOT ALL THAT BAD'\n\nMayor Buttigieg is a great guy and a real patriot, Biden said. [He] has not demonstrated he has the ability to, and we'll soon find out, to get a broad scope of support across the spectrum, including African-Americans and Latinos.\n\nEmbrace of socialism\n\nAs for the arguments over his embrace of socialism, Sanders defended himself, saying it doesn't matter what Donald Trump says, pointing out that Trump will attack any Democratic candidate.\n\nButtigieg and Sanders also butted heads, with Buttigieg characterizing the self-labeled democratic socialist's politics as my way or the highway.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., sought to differentiate herself from Sanders, presenting herself as someone could win more moderate voters.\n\nI am the only one on this stage that has consistently won in red congressional districts – not once, not twice, but three times, she said.\n\nI am the only one on this stage that has consistently won in red congressional districts – not once, not twice, but three times. — Amy Klobuchar\n\nKlobuchar closed with an emotional plea to New Hampshire voters, embracing a populist message and referencing former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in a debate moment that struck some pundits as her best yet.\n\nI will tell you this, there is a complete lack of empathy in this guy in the White House right now and I will bring back to you, she said. If you have trouble stretching your paycheck to pay for that rent, I know you and I will fight for you. If you have trouble deciding if you're going to pay for your child care or your long-term care, I know you and I will fight for you. … I do not have the biggest name up on this stage, I don't have the biggest bank account, I'm not a political newcomer with no record, but I have a record of fighting for people.\n\nBloomberg looms large\n\nOne candidate didn't even need to be on the debate stage to loom large. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is skipping the early states and using his fortune to blanket the airwaves in Super Tuesday states, drew a rebuke from Warren.\n\nI don't think anyone ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination, she said. I don't think any billionaire ought to be able to do it and I don't think people who suck up to billionaires in order to fund their campaigns ought to do it.\n\nI don't think anyone ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination. — Elizabeth Warren\n\nSteyer emphasized the importance of the economy in response to Sanders telling his fellow candidate that they cannot nibble around the edges in order to get radical change like Medicare-for-All.\n\nHe's crowing about it every day, and he's going to beat us unless we beat him on the economy, stupid, Steyer said, calling back to ABC moderator George Stephanopoulos' time working for former President Bill Clinton, who adopted the slogan.\n\nROMNEY APPLAUDED BY DEMS DURING NEW HAMPSHIRE DEBATE\n\nLargest targets\n\nSanders and Buttigieg are the two largest targets entering New Hampshire as they each have momentum and have claimed victory in the Iowa caucuses despite vote-counting problems in the state.\n\nIn the hours before the debate, the Trump administration ousted two people from their jobs who testified during the impeachment trial: U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and National Security Council aide Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman.\n\nBiden during the debate dinged Trump's recent move to give radio talker Rush Limbaugh the Medal of Freedom, saying, We should be pinning a medal on Vindman and not on Rush Limbaugh.\n\nWe should be pinning a medal on Vindman and not on Rush Limbaugh. — Joe Biden\n\nAt the beginning Friday evening's event, Biden -- long seen as the frontrunner in the race -- sought to downplay expectations ahead of the New Hampshire primary, saying I took a hit in Iowa and I'm probably going to take a hit here.\n\nAnd in another memorable moment, Democrats in the debate hall applauded the mention of Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah -- the only Republican who voted to convict Trump in the impeachment trial this week.\n\nOn foreign policy, Steyer, Buttigieg and Biden got into a three-way dust-up that ended with both Steyer and Biden raising their voices.\n\nButtigieg argued that judgment was more important than tenure, saying Biden had shown bad judgment when he voted for the use of force authorization that allowed former President George W. Bush to start the Iraq War. The former mayor added that the problems of the new decade will require a new perspective from the commander-in-chief.\n\nLooking forward we've got to recognize how much is going to be on the plate of the next president. That is different in kind from what we have faced before, he said.\n\nBiden admitted that he made a mistake in trusting Bush, but noted that he was one of the architects of the troop drawdown in Iraq at the beginning of the Obama administration.\n\nWhen we got elected the president turned to me with the entire security apparatus and said, 'Joe, I want you to organize getting 156,000 troops out of Iraq,' Biden said. I did that. I did that.\n\nThe exchange between Biden and Buttigieg prompted Steyer to complain that both were too focused on using the military to carry out American foreign policy.\n\nWhat we're hearing here is a very long dissertation about exactly why America should be the world's policemen, Steyer said. So, when we're talking about our role in the world and commander in chief, we have abandoned diplomacy, we don't have a strategy and we don't have allies.\n\nThat prompted an impassioned response from Biden, who raised his voice as he listed some of his foreign policy accomplishments.\n\nBIDEN SAYS HE'S 'PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE A HIT' IN NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\nI was part of the reason putting that deal together with Iran. I was there, Biden said. I was involved in that. I was also part of putting together the Paris climate accord. I was part of that. I've been part of every major initiative we've had relative to diplomacy.\n\nButtigieg and Biden also clashed on Supreme Court expansion. Buttigieg advocated an expansion of the court but also called for structural reform so that some of the justices are not appointed through a partisan process. We cannot allow the Supreme Court to continue to become one more political battlefield.\n\nBiden hit back, siding with popular liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who has come out against Supreme Court expansion.\n\nI agree with Ruth Bader Ginsburg, that's who I agree with, Biden said before changing the subject to electability.\n\nWe must win back the United States Senate this time out, and that's why … you have to ask yourself, who is most likely to help get a senator elected in North Carolina, Georgia? Who can win Florida, Pennsylvania, Minnesota? Who can do that?\n\n'Not about Hunter Biden'\n\nWhile Republicans on Capitol Hill are ramping up probes of the overseas activities of Biden's son, Hunter, while Biden was vice president, the Democrats on the stage didn't go there.\n\nWe're not going to let them change the subject, Buttigieg said of Republicans when asked a question about Hunter Biden. This is not about Hunter Biden or Vice President Biden, or any Biden. This is about an abuse of power by the president.\n\nAt another point, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, cautioned Democrats against making their arguments all about the president.\n\nDonald Trump is the not the cause of all of our problems -- and we're making a mistake when we act like he is, Yang said. He added, He is a symptom of a disease...It is our job of getting to the harder work of actually curing the disease.\n\nDonald Trump is the not the cause of all of our problems -- and we're making a mistake when we act like he is. — Andrew Yang\n\nCo-hosted by ABC News, WMUR-TV and Apple News, the debate brought seven of the Democratic contenders to Saint Anslem College in Manchester ahead of that state's first-in-the-nation primary on Tuesday. The debate comes as neither news organizations nor the Iowa Democratic Party have been able to call a winner in Monday's Iowa caucuses while Buttigieg and Sanders are both claiming victory in the state.\n\nAt the moment, Buttigieg has a narrow lead in state delegate equivalents, or SDEs, which are what helps decide how many delegates candidates get to bring to the Democratic National Convention later this year. Sanders, on the other hand, leads in the popular vote from both the first alignment and the second alignment phases of the caucuses.\n\nThose numbers could change, however, as the IDP has noted many irregularities in its vote count and it is highly likely candidates will call for reexaminations of the numbers. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez already has.\n\nBIDEN SAYS HE WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED DRONE STRIKE THAT KILLED SOLEIMANI\n\nBiden is coming off what appears to be a fourth-place performance in Iowa that he characterized as a gut punch while the Klobuchar campaign is looking for a momentum boost that didn't come in the Hawkeye State as it currently sits significantly behind Biden in fifth-place.\n\nWarren is comfortably in third place in Iowa and will try to make a case to her neighboring New Hampshire that she, and not Sanders -- who currently leads in most Granite State polls -- is the best New Englander to take on President Trump in November.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Steyer and Yang campaigns are essentially throwing Hail Marys in New Hampshire after dismal finishes in Iowa. They'll battle for votes with other flagging campaigns that did not qualify for the New Hampshire debate.\n\nFormer Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick was a late entrant into the race and didn't register in the Iowa caucuses. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, has staked her entire campaign on New Hampshire, spending more time there than any other candidate. Sen. Mike Bennet, D-Colo., was on MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews from New Hampshire in the lead-up to the Friday debate, looking to get national television exposure for his campaign which has struggled to gain any traction.
Leaders from the United Methodist Church reportedly announced a tentative plan Friday to split the church over differences on same-sex marriage and the inclusion of gay clergy.\n\nThe new conservative Traditionalist Methodist denomination wouldn't allow gay marriage or gay clergy members, The New York Times reported.\n\nThe proposal was first signed in December after the fundamental differences within the church became irreconcilable.\n\nI'm actually really sad that we couldn't build a bridge that could have provided a witness to the world of what unity amid diversity and disagreement could look like, Methodist Bishop Karen Oliveto, the denomination's first openly gay bishop, said.\n\nUNITED METHODISTS EDGE TOWARD BREAKUP OVER LGBT POLICIES\n\nIn 2017, the Judicial Council, the church's highest court, declared Oliveto's consecration was incompatible with church law. She was, however, allowed to remain as the resident bishop of the Mountain Sky Conference, which covers churches in Colorado, Montana, Utah, Wyoming and part of Idaho.\n\nThere are roughly 13 million church members around the world and about half of them are in the United States, according to The Times.\n\nUNITED METHODIST DELEGATES REJECT RECOGNIZING GAY MARRIAGE, THREATENING SPLIT IN CHURCH\n\nThe division, which has been brewing for years, came to an impasse last May when delegates in St. Louis voted 438-384 to ban gay marriage and the inclusion of gay clergy.\n\nA majority of U.S.-based churches opposed the Traditional Plan but were outvoted by conservatives in the U.S., Africa and the Philippines.\n\nSoon after, 16 church representatives determined breaking up the church was the best means to resolve our differences, allowing each part of the church to remain true to its theological understanding, Bishop Cynthia Fierro Harvey of Louisiana said, according to the Times.\n\nThere is a degree of heartbreak within me because I never thought we would reach this point, New York Bishop Thomas Bickerton said. However, we are at this point. The differences are irreconcilable. This is inevitable.\n\nTexas Bishop Scott J. Jones said the proposal has not yet been adopted.\n\nThe Protocol itself says it was developed in service to the General Conference delegates who will decide on its adoption or amendment, he said. Other plans may well be considered as alternatives. Significant questions remain to be answered about the Protocol's implementation. The Judicial Council will need to rule on its constitutionality.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe added that financial feasibility will also need to be considered before any split.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
Matt James made history on Monday during his premiere episode as the first Black lead on ABC's The Bachelor.\n\nAhead of his debut, James sat down for an interview with People in which he discussed his ultimate goal as a role model for the Black community on the show.\n\nI'm hoping that being in this position paves the way for people like me to be in this and it be normalized, he said. 'Oh Matt was a great Bachelor.' It doesn't have to be, 'Oh he was a great Black Bachelor.'\n\nSeason 25 kicked off with the 28-year-old real estate broker talking with host Chris Harrison about what to expect from the show and the pressure he felt being a historic part of the long-running reality series.\n\nEX-'BACHELOR' PETER WEBER, FIFTH-PLACE KELLEY FLANAGAN SPLIT\n\nMy mom is White and my dad is Black, and I experience what it was like to be a product of interracial marriage, Matt told Chris (via People). And it's tough because you've got people who have certain views, old-school views on what a relationship and what love looks like. And you've got people who are cheering for you to find love. And then you've got people who are cheering for you to end up with a specific person, a specific person of a specific race.\n\nHe added: That's something that kept me up at night. It's like, I don't want to piss off Black people, I don't want to piss off White people, but I'm both of those. You know what I mean? It's like, how do I please everybody?\n\n'BACHELOR' FRANCHISE STAR CARLY WADDELL OPENS UP ABOUT SPLITTING WITH HUSBAND EVAN BASS\n\nAfter a pep talk from the host, who instructed him to lead with his heart and not let the weight of responsibility get in the way of finding love, it was time for James to meet the 32 women vying for his affection this season.\n\nMany of the women noted that he was making history on the show, including 28-year-old model Chelsea, who said she hoped they could be the show's first-ever Black couple.\n\nDuring his time with Kristin, she asked him about the weight of responsibility he faces this season to which he echoed similar sentiments he shared with Harrison.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nI feel a load of responsibility, James admitted.

A California advisory board comprised of law enforcement and public officials has called for police agencies in the state to regularly check officers' department-issued cellphones, computers and social media activity for any racist or otherwise offensive content that would lend to disproportionate policing based on biases.\n\nThe controversial recommendation, announced Monday, was based on the board's analysis of nearly 4 million vehicle and pedestrian stops by California's 15 largest law enforcement agencies in 2019.\n\nThe Racial and Identity Profiling Advisory Board report was unveiled amid calls to defund police departments and promises from state lawmakers to renew efforts to strip badges from bad officers, make more police misconduct records public, and allow community groups to handle mental health and drug calls where police powers may not be needed.\n\nFORT HOOD'S TOXIC CULTURE? RED FLAGS RAISED OVER MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES, SEXUAL ASSAULTS\n\nReform efforts have often focused on increasing training to make officers aware of how their implicit, or unconscious, bias may affect their interactions. Starting this year, a new California law requires agencies to screen job applicants for implicit and explicit biases.\n\nExplicitly racist or bigoted social media posts by some law enforcement officers appear to be a widespread problem nationwide, it said, citing a study by the Plain View Project that examined the Facebook accounts of 2,900 active and 600 retired officers in eight departments across the country.\n\nIn California, current and former San Jose Police Department officers were found to have shared racist Facebook posts in the past. Other agencies, including the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and San Francisco Police Department, have been involved in similar issues.\n\nThe board found that Black individuals, or people who appear to be Black, were most frequently stopped for reasonable suspicious as opposed to a traffic violation. The report describes reasonable suspicion as a legal standard in criminal law that requires an officer to point to specific articulable facts that would lead a reasonable person to believe that a crime is, was, or is about to occur.\n\nAccording to the report, 21% of police stops involving Black individuals were for reasonable suspicion, whereas 74.4% were for traffic violations. People who were described as multiracial were stopped 13.2% of the time for reasonable suspicion.\n\nPeople who were perceived as Black were more than twice as likely to be stopped as their percentage of the population would suggest, the board said in its fourth annual report.\n\nAdditionally, Black individuals were searched at 2.5 times the rate of people perceived as White.\n\nAnd the odds were 1.45 times greater that someone perceived as Black had force used against them during a traffic stop compared to someone perceived as White. The odds were 1.18 times greater for people perceived as Latino.\n\nCALIFORNIA WOMAN PLEADS GUILTY TO BOMB THREATS AGAINST CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL OVER SAME-SEX MARRIAGE VIEWS\n\nUnchecked explicit bias may lead to some of the stop data disparities we have observed, the board said. The social media and technology checks should be conducted to ensure the officers are not exhibiting racist behavior, the report says.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Protective League's board of directors said the disproportionate numbers could be driven by demographics, rather than racism.\n\nWhat these numbers don't tell is that in Los Angeles, 70% of violent crime victims are either Black or Hispanic and that 81% of the reported violent crime suspects are either Black or Hispanic, the league said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nChief Eric Nuñez, president of the California Police Chiefs Association said police departments demand fair and impartial police services for the communities they serve, but said the state board's recommendations would require a significant additional funding source, time and legal issues that have not been properly identified or researched at this point.\n\nBoth the league and the state sheriffs' association said the broader issue of racial bias must be addressed across society, not just law enforcement.\n\nMeanwhile, Betty Williams, president the NAACP's Sacramento Branch, said the recommendation doesn't go far enough and should also include officers' personal cellphones.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
Ashley Graham may be mere days away from giving birth to her first child, but she has marriage on her mind.\n\nThe pregnant model, 32, announced a partnership with bridal brand Pronovias on Tuesday, revealing a slate of plus-size wedding dresses of her own design.\n\nASHLEY GRAHAM BARES BABY BUMP IN SKIMPY BIKINI FOR NEW SWIMWEAR COLLECTION\n\n[Your wedding day is] beyond a size or a type of woman — it's really just about her, Graham told WWD about the collaboration. That's why I'm so excited there are now sizes from 0 to 34.\n\nGraham helped design a collection of 16 styles, including a gown with lace sleeves, an off-the-shoulder silhouette, and a tuxedo — which was reportedly a must for the model — with prices ranging from $1,000 to $3,500.

She said she had to add a panel sewn into the back of the bustier to make it fit.\n\nI really didn't get the option of what I truly wanted because I didn't have the time or the luxury because of my size.

It may be a cringe-worthy question, but people of faith tend to explore these queries when disaster strikes and the world is in upheaval. So with the global reach of the coronavirus, the question of whether the pandemic is God's judgment on a sinful and corrupt world begs for some attention, and attention from one of the cooler heads in the Christian world.\n\nNoted theologian and best-selling author Dr. Timothy Keller says the answer is nuanced. In other words, it's both Yes and No.\n\nWHAT IS THE 'CHRISTIAN RESPONSE' TO THE CORONAVIRUS? PASTORS URGE FAITH OVER FEAR\n\nAccording to the biblical narrative, there's a brokenness in this world that's existed since ancient times. Since the fall from Grace -- the turning away from God in the Garden of Eden -- all the bad stuff we encounter entered the world: disease, death, destruction, murder and a whole list of sins is the reality of the world we live in. But, says Keller, God is sovereign, which means he's in control. And His greatest priority is our welfare. But disasters will happen.\n\nIt's just a way, I do think, for God to try to wake us up and to say, please make sure you're right with me, Keller explained. Please think, think about, you know, where you are. So there's a sense in which all these kinds of disasters are a judgment, but a judgment that's not on the people who are suffering.\n\nKeller and his wife, Kathy, have written three small handbook guides: On Birth, On Marriage and On Death. These are events that give us the greatest joys in life and our deepest sorrows, he says. He explores more of the books' contents on the Lighthouse Faith Podcast.\n\nKeller says Jesus addressed the issue in the Bible, in the Gospel of Luke, about whether disasters are God's judgment.\n\nJesus uses the example of a tower that had fallen and killed several people. He asks, Do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.\n\nKeller calls Jesus' polemic here a brilliant move.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE STORIES ON FAITH\n\nJesus is telling us, When people die in a disaster that does not mean because God is judging them. What He's actually trying to do is show that they're no worse than anybody else. ... But what God is trying to do is trying to get our attention. And [that] these things do happen, Keller says.\n\nCOVID-19 is the latest scourge to hit humanity, but there's a pretty good chance it will not be the last. Medical scientists have in the past, and will now, use their God-given brains to help figure out a solution.\n\nBut the real question, Keller says, is not, Is this God's judgment? But rather, Is God to whom I look to and trust in when bad things happen?
Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen remained a united front this past Easter Sunday.\n\nThe couple posted a moving message to fans on their social media accounts about the meaning of the holiday as the world faces uncertainty during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe NFL star and the supermodel posted a stunning photo of their family standing on a beach at sunset. By their side were their three kids: son Benjamin, 10, and daughter Vivian, 7, plus Brady's son John, 12, from his previous relationship with actress Bridget Moynahan.\n\nTOM BRADY JOINS CAUSE TO BRING 10 MILLION MEALS TO FAMILIES IN NEED DURING CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\nHappy Easter from our family to yours! Bundchen, 39, wrote as the caption. I hope the meaning of this day of renewal and rebirth, can bring us to be more compassionate, to love more, to help more, to be more united.\n\nMay each new day allow us to be the best version of ourselves! Wishing you a day filled with love, she added.\n\nWhile the six-time Super Bowl champion, 42, wrote -- This Easter has been a truly unique one.\n\nTOM BRADY OPENS UP ABOUT MARRIAGE TO GISELE BUNDCHEN\n\nI was thinking this morning of how the busyness of my life often keeps me from recognizing the most simple and joyful moments over the course of a year. Like this one; being surrounded by my family, sharing a beautiful sunset and realizing these moments are the ones that matter the most to me, Brady said.\n\n'Blessings from our family to yours! he concluded.\n\nLast week, Brady opened up about his marriage to the supermodel. He told Howard Stern on his SiriusXM show that she wasn't satisfied with their relationship a few years ago.\n\nGISELE BUNDCHEN TALKS TOM BRADY'S DEPARTURE FROM THE PATRIOTS\n\nA couple of years ago, she didn't feel like I was doing my part for the family, he said. She felt like I would play football all season and she would take care of the house, and then all of a sudden when the season ended, I'd be like, 'Great, let me get into all of my other business activities. Let me get into my football training.'\n\nBrady admitted that he had to re-prioritize and do more of the domestic work.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe's sitting there going, 'Well, when are you going to do things for the house? When are you going to take the kids to school and do that?' And that was a big part of our marriage. I had to, like, check myself. Because she's like, 'I have goals and dreams too.'
Linda Dyas' quest for love turned into a nightmare.\n\nThe 49-year-old nuclear scientist is one of nine women who came forward for Oxygen's new documentary Seduced By Evil, which details how con man Derek Alldred romanced more than two dozen women out of a reported $2 million.\n\nTED BUNDY SURVIVOR TELLS ALL\n\nThe 49-year-old con artist targeted intelligent but vulnerable single women looking for long-term relationships. Alldred took on false identities and wore costumes to charm women, including dressing up as an Afghanistan veteran in full uniform. Once Alldred lured his victims, he would then entangled the women in a web of lies to deplete their savings, leaving them behind in financial ruin.\n\nIn the documentary, Dyas shared that in February 2016, she was getting ready to delete her account on an online dating website called MyTime.com when she spotted Alldred. Going by Rich Peterson, he was a Christian, a military vet and a conservative studying at the University of Minnesota working on a Ph.D. — all the qualities Dyas was yearning for in a man.\n\nI like smart guys, I always have, Dyas told Fox News. That really appealed to me. And the fact that he was conservative appealed to me. He was super smart, funny, charming. He's very charismatic, and he has an incredible smile. He makes you feel like you're the only person in the room. I mean, this coffee shop was totally crowded where we later met, and he just had that innate ability to make you feel like you're the only person there.\n\nDyas admitted she fell head over heels for the God-worshipping Peterson who was passionate about his country and willing to offer his heart to her. Within the first month, Peterson met her 7-year-old son.\n\nRARE TED BUNDY TAPES REVEALED\n\nThey got along, she recalled. My son was very quiet. [But] Rich played a few video games with him. And for a 7-year-old, he was immediately impressed. If somebody will play video games with you, then they're pretty cool.\n\nThe Atlantic reported that after a few months, Dyas lost her job, but Peterson found them a house to rent in the upscale suburb of St. Paul, Minn. — one that she wouldn't have been able to afford on her own. Dyas and her son moved in. The publication noted Dyas' admiration for Peterson grew when she stumbled onto paperwork for a $100,000 college fund he had secretly started for her son.\n\nStill, Dyas was starting to have doubts.\n\nHis military career didn't really match up, she said. But I didn't question it that much. He had told me he was a reservist. I didn't really know anything about that. I didn't ask the questions I probably should have. But I just never pushed the issue.\n\nAnd then everything unraveled.\n\nROBERT DURST WAS 'PRIME SUSPECT' FOR CAT BEHEADING\n\nThe Atlantic shared Peterson was drinking heavily and was going to the hospital frequently for his war wounds. Minneapolis' KARE11 shared Dyas was also receiving notices for bounced checks that she didn't write. Peterson was also using her computer where she kept most of her personal financial data.\n\nIt was about seven months into the relationship, recalled Dyas. He got angry about something. I don't even remember what it was. But the way he handled it was out of what I would think was the norm. He really went over the top. It scared me. To be honest, it put the fear of God in me. … Very soon after, I was getting feelings that something wasn't right.\n\nIn spring 2016, former flight attendant Missi Brandt met a Richie Peterson also on OurTime.com. As Peterson, Alldred told Brandt he had completed eight tours in Afghanistan. He often spent time with Brandt and her daughters in full uniform.\n\nAccording to KARE11, Brandt grew suspicious when Peterson was frequently on the phone and always had someplace else he needed to be. One day when he was in the shower, she spotted his wallet on her dresser and opened it. In it was a social security card that read Alldred's name and two of Dyas' credit cards.\n\nRETIRED LAPD DETECTIVE THINKS HIS FATHER KILLED THE BLACK DAHLIA\n\nBrandt, who investigated Alldred's real identity, immediately contacted Dyas and dropped a bombshell.\n\nI was contacted on Facebook Messenger by another victim who sent me his real name and his prior arrest and an article on him with his mugshot, said Dyas. It was just a huge shock. I mean, yes, I was questioning, but when you think somebody might have lied to you about some things, you don't think they lied about everything. It was literally about everything.\n\nDyas had other reasons to be frightened.\n\nHe was still in my house at the time, she said. I was upstairs in my bedroom when I opened this message. The first thing I did was go to my closet — I have a handgun — to see if my handgun was in my safe. It was not. He had used it a time or two at the shooting range. I found out later that he had carried it with him at times. I had told him not to use it. I planned to change the safe lock, and I didn't. There I was upstairs in my bedroom scared out of my wits because I just saw this guy's mugshot.\n\nHe's a felon, she continued. He has felonies on his record, and my gun is missing. One of the reasons I was suspicious in the first place is because his [previous] angry outburst really scared me. I was terrified. I didn't know what to do.\n\nThankfully, Alldred didn't have Dyas' gun handy — it was later found in the garage.\n\nThat same day, The Atlantic reported, Alldred complained of pain and said he needed to go to the emergency room. Dyas dropped him off and called the police on her way home. Dyas reached out to Brandt when Alldred was in custody.\n\nThe publication revealed Dyas figured out Alldred stole her emergency credit cards, ordered new cards in her name, maxed them out on fancy dinners and trips to Hawaii with her and other women. He also emptied out her retirement savings to purchase a boat and two motorcycles, and he put her name on the house's lease — a rent she couldn't afford.\n\nDyas, who was devastated, said it was Brandt who helped her cope with the numerous losses. The two women later learned in their own investigation that they were not alone. Other women were being conned by Alldred, who depicted himself as a devout Christian ready for marriage.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn 2018, Alldred was sentenced in Texas to 24 years in prison for stealing from various women he met online after pleading guilty to mail fraud and aggravated identity fraud. He was also ordered to pay about $255,000 in restitution.\n\nProsecutors said a Dallas-area woman who was dating Alldred, who then used the name Richard Tailor, filed a police report after becoming suspicious of him. Investigators discovered he had charged more than $12,000 to her credit card. They determined he had victimized at least 25 others in California, Hawaii, Minnesota and Nevada. The Star Tribune shared Alldred had posed over the years as a U.S. Navy pilot, defense analyst, attorney, firefighter, medical doctor and professor.\n\nThis defendant left a trail of tears, emotional devastation, and financial ruin behind him, U.S. Attorney Joseph Brown said in announcing the sentence. It is clear that he will never change, and we expect his sentence to reflect that. We are glad we were able to get some level of justice for these women.\n\nDyas admitted she has tried online dating since Alldred was put behind bars. However, she hopes her story — and her involvement in the documentary — will encourage those looking for love not to dismiss any red flags in a relationship of any kind.\n\nOh God, I hate to admit yes, she said about trying online dating again. … I'm not from Minnesota. I live here. You don't really know people. You don't really have a whole lot of options unless you're going to a bar and or go date someone that you work with. None of which are great options. I still believe in my heart that most people are good. I'm a Christian. I believe that everything happened for a reason, and that somehow this is a learning moment for me and that I am going to be able to hopefully help other women.\n\nSeduced by Evil premieres Feb. 9 at 8 p.m. on Oxygen.

The ongoing animosity between 90 Day Fiancé stars Jonathan Rivera and Fernanda Flores has soared to new heights, with Flores suggesting her husband blocked her on Instagram.\n\nWho likes to hear the true?

I remember being in the relationship, I know exactly what happen, I recognized my mistakes, I say sorry, she wrote.

Several hundred members of Congress filed amicus, or supporting, briefs in a closely watched upcoming Supreme Court case that could decide the future of abortion access.\n\nThe brief from 207 mostly GOPers included signatures from Sens. Mitt Romney, John Cornyn, Marco Rubio and Reps Steve Scalise and Liz Cheney. The opposing brief was signed by 197 members of Congress -- a mostly Democratic group that included Sens. Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein, as well as Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Jerry Nadler.\n\nThe mostly Republican signatories -- 39 senators and 168 representatives -- argued that Louisiana clinics are rife with safety violations -- and that the time is ripe to reconsider the legal underpinnings of Roe v. Wade, the seminal 1973 Supreme Court case that established a constitutional right to an abortion. All were Republicans except Democratic Reps. Dan Lipinski and Collin Peterson.\n\nRoe's jurisprudence has been characterized by Delphic confusion and protean change, the members wrote.\n\nWHY ARE PRO-LIFE DOCTORS CASTING DOUBT ON ABORTION STUDY?\n\nThey argued that Roe claimed to establish a fundamental right to abortion -- only for the 1992 Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood v. Casey to establish a new standard, which required that the government not impose an undue burden on abortion rights. Multiple incoherent exceptions and balancing tests have since been employed by the courts, according to the amicus brief.\n\nFor example, one Supreme Court case post-Casey defined a law as an undue burden on abortion rights if in a large fraction of the cases in which [the law] is relevant, it will operate as a substantial obstacle -- a test later abandoned. then revived by the high court.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democrats primarily argued that stare decisis, the principle through which existing Supreme Court cases are given deference, dictated that Roe should remain good law.\n\nThe high court will hear arguments in March on the case, which involves a Louisiana law that requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The Louisiana statute is virtually identical to a Texas law that the Supreme Court struck down in 2016.\n\nThat decision came when Justice Anthony Kennedy was on the bench and before President Donald Trump's two high court picks, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, joined the court.\n\nILLINOIS REPEALS BAN ON PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTIONS, AS PRO-LIFE GROUPS LAMENT 'DEATH PENALTY' FOR THE UNBORN\n\nAt least one justice is likely to find the amicus brief agreeable. Last summer, in a concurring opinion in a Supreme Court case, Justice Clarence Thomas issued a lengthy call for his colleagues to overturn demonstrably erroneous decisions even if they have been upheld for decades -- prompting legal observers to say Thomas was laying the groundwork to overturn Roe.\n\nThe 5th Circuit Court of appeals recently lifted an injunction issued by a lower court against the Louisiana law, but the Supreme Court quickly restored the injunction.\n\nThe Supreme Court's upcoming decision comes as abortion has taken center stage in legal battles across the United States, with numerous states passing stricter limits on abortion.\n\nLast August, Planned Parenthood announced that it was pulling out of the Title X federal family planning program rather than abide by a new Trump administration rule prohibiting participants from referring patients for abortions.\n\nFox News' Bill Mears, Shannon Bream and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
TV icon Susan Lucci opened up about the death of Hollywood legend Kirk Douglas on Wednesday.\n\nThe All My Children actress joined the rest of the country in mourning the late actor, who died at 103, according to a statement shared by his son, Michael Douglas.

Pamela Anderson is speaking out after her former husband Jon Peters claimed he paid off her debt during their 12-day marriage.\n\nPeters, 74, claimed in an email to Page Six on Monday that he dropped everything for Anderson, 52, including hundreds of thousands of dollars. But Anderson's team is claiming it never happened.\n\nThese claims are not only entirely fabricated, they are ludicrous, a rep for Anderson said to Fox News on Tuesday. Despite Mr. Peters' scurrilous and ongoing efforts to elicit a response from Ms. Anderson, she has no comment to provide and hopes he is well.\n\nPAMELA ANDERSON SPLITS WITH MOVIE MOGUL JON PETERS AFTER 12-DAY MARRIAGE\n\nThe Baywatch icon shocked fans last month when she revealed on Instagram she had tied the knot to Peters, her fifth husband, in a secret ceremony in Malibu, Calif. However, the duo split just 12 days later amid reports they never obtained a legal marriage license.\n\nShe had almost $200,000 in bills and no way to pay it so I paid it and this is the thanks I get, Peters claimed in his email to Page Six.\n\nAfter their split, a source told the outlet that Anderson had made a terrible mistake and found Peters to be too controlling to stay with. In his email, Peters referred to the actress' claims as lies.\n\nThere's no fool like an old fool, he continued.\n\nPAMELA ANDERSON SHARES FIRST PHOTO WITH HUSBAND JON PETERS\n\nIn a statement to Fox News last month, Anderson explained the two put a delay on their marriage license.\n\nI have been moved by the warm reception to Jon and my union. We would be very grateful for your support as we take some time apart to reevaluate what we want from life and from one another, Anderson said via her rep.\n\nLife is a journey and love is a process, she said. With that universal truth in mind, we have mutually decided to put off the formalization of our marriage certificate and put our faith in the process.\n\nPAMELA ANDERSON'S SON BRANDON THOMAS LEE SAYS HE'S 'INCREDIBLY HAPPY' ABOUT WEDDING NEWS\n\nThank you for respecting our privacy, she added.\n\nAt the time of their split, a source close to the couple told Fox News that their living situation is what caused a rift in their short-lived union.\n\nShe's known Jon forever, but she never lived with him, contrary to some reports. And until you live with someone... Well, let's just say Pamela asked for a break. She is heading back to her compound in Ladysmith, Canada, to be with her family, said the source.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnderson and Peters were both married four times previously, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Anderson was formerly married to Tommy Lee, Kid Rock and twice to Rick Saloman.\n\nPeters had a 12-year affair with Barbra Streisand.

A new law that its backers called a pivotal step in protecting vulnerable young women and girls across the United States from the barbaric and medically unnecessary procedure of female genital mutilation was signed into law by President Trump on Thursday.\n\nThe bipartisan legislation, known as the Strengthening the Opposition to Female Genital Mutilation Act of 2020, or STOP FGM Act of 2020, was introduced in Congress by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, just before the coronavirus pandemic paralyzed much of the country in March.\n\nWe are thrilled that the president has signed this. President Trump knows the Stop FGM Act will finally offer young women and girls stronger protection from the atrocity of female genital mutilation, Andrea G. Bottner, senior adviser to advocacy group Independent Women's Voice and former State Department official, told Fox News. We are grateful this administration is making sure no girl should ever have to face this horror in her lifetime.\n\nICE WAR CRIMES UNIT RAMPS UP EFFORTS AT US AIRPORTS TO STOP FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION\n\nThe law ultimately empowers federal law enforcement to prosecute perpetrators of female genital mutilation (FGM), increases the punishment from five to 10 years' imprisonment, and requires government agencies to estimate the number of women and girls impacted by or at risk of FGM in the U.S. and report their actions taken to end the practice.\n\nThe STOP FGM Act will finally offer young women and girls stronger protection from the horror of female genital mutilation. No girl should ever have to face this in her lifetime. The bipartisan nature of this legislation shows that when it comes to the safety of young girls, politics shouldn't matter, Bottner added in a statement.\n\nAn estimated 8,000 girls endure FGM – a practice entailing the full or partial slicing out of female genitals – worldwide every day. More than 3 million are forced to endure it annually.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) classifies the procedure as a severe human rights violation with no medical benefits. Rather, it brings with it extreme physical and emotional health consequences from sexual dysfunction, incontinence and increased risk of HIV transmission to the risk of infection and uncontrolled bleeding.\n\nLAW BANNING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL; MICHIGAN DOCTORS CLEARED OF CHARGES\n\nFGM is considered not to be a religious practice but rather a cultural one designed to ensure girls retain their purity before marriage despite its grave ramifications.\n\nIn an incredibly difficult year, the little girls in our country who are vulnerable to this painful practice were not forgotten, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, founder of AHA Foundation and FGM survivor, said in a statement. The STOP FGM Act is a strong bill that makes it clear that in this country, we do not tolerate this practice, and we will not stand idly by as girls are cut.\n\nAccording to Congress, it is a form of child abuse, gender discrimination and violence against women and girls, and a global problem whose eradication requires international cooperation and enforcement at the national level.\n\nThe United States should demonstrate its commitment to the rights of women and girls by leading the way in the international community in banning this abhorrent practice, the newly-inked bill states.\n\nFORT HOOD'S TOXIC CULTURE? RED FLAGS RAISED OVER MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES, SEXUAL ASSAULTS\n\nAnd it's far from a problem only plaguing countries far and wide. Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that approximately 513,000 women and girls have experienced FGM or are at risk of being subjected to FGM and its consequences on U.S. soil.\n\nThe issue garnered significant stateside attention and outrage after a Michigan judge ruled in November 2018 that a 1996 U.S. federal law banning FGM was unconstitutional – thus dropping critical charges against practitioners accused of performing FGM on nine young girls.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to Bottner, the STOP FGM Act of 2020 will strengthen current law, especially in ensuring that the commercial clause is explicit that it will not be tolerated.\n\nWe are raising awareness and making it very well known that this practice will not occur in the United States, she added.

I hope this campaign reminds all women that they are sexy and should be celebrated at all stages in their lives.\n\nASHLEY GRAHAM'S SECRET TO A LASTING MARRIAGE IS 'JUST HAVE SEX ALL THE TIME'\n\nASHLEY GRAHAM STRIPS FOR NUDE PREGNANCY PHOTOSHOOT WITH HUSBAND\n\nAccording to the retailer, the 11-piece tropical paradise collection will come in sizes 4-24 and feature lace-up panels, plunging necklines, mixed prints, including tropical exotic and animal prints with mesh underlays.\n\nGraham has been showing off her growing baby bump on social media in recent months. In an interview with Vogue for its January issue, Graham shared details about her struggle to remain positive as her body began changing.\n\nI've always had control over my body – when everyone else wanted to dictate what it should be, I took full control over it – but I had this life inside of me saying, 'It's not yours anymore, it's mine,' she said.\n\nThe brunette beauty admitted the first hurdle to overcome was the weight gain.\n\nASHLEY GRAHAM OPENS UP ABOUT BODY IMAGE AND SEX FEARS DURING PREGNANCY: 'I FELT ALONE'\n\nASHLEY GRAHAM SAYS SHE'S TIRED OF BEING TOLD YOU'RE JUST 'THE SEXY GIRL'\n\nI felt like I didn't have anyone to talk to.

You're like, 'Hey, do we need to plan this?' And now, with pregnancy, things have been real-ly diff-er-ent, she recalled.\n\nBecause there's this huge bulge that can be sensitive if you lay on it or go into a new position. I've been literally asking every single one of my friends who have had babies or who're pregnant, like, 'What positions do you guys do?' This has to be a normal conversation among mothers.\n\nLast month, the mother-to-be revealed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that she is expecting a baby boy.\n\nASHLEY GRAHAM GETS CANDID ON MISS UNIVERSE, BEING A SEX SYMBOL AS A PLUS-SIZE MODEL\n\nASHLEY GRAHAM SHARES STUNNING NUDE BABY BUMP PHOTO: 'FEELING GRATEFUL'\n\nThe model admitted to Vogue that she is clueless when it comes to the opposite sex.\n\nI don't know anything about boys, so I'm excited.\n\nGraham has been married to videographer Justin Ervin since 2010.\n\nBack in 2017, Graham told Fox News she felt honored to be recognized as a sex symbol.\n\nPREGNANT MODEL ASHLEY GRAHAM PRAISED FOR SHARING INTENSE WORKOUT SESSION ON INSTAGRAM\n\nASHLEY GRAHAM'S LOVE STORY WITH HUSBAND JUSTIN ERVIN LEAVES GWYNETH PALTROW IN TEARS\n\nI think it's fantastic! she said at the time.

Michael Douglas says life has gotten easier with age — because his finite time on Earth forces him to prioritize and plan better, even if wife Catherine Zeta-Jones pokes fun at him for it.\n\nCATHERINE ZETA-JONES, MICHAEL DOUGLAS SHARE SECRET TO THEIR LONG MARRIAGE\n\nThe kids and Catherine always tease me because I am planning holidays three and six months ahead, Douglas, 74, told The Mirror on Tuesday.\n\nThere's much more planning your time because all of a sudden, you don't have this infinite amount of time. Your time is finite now.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDouglas' bout with tongue cancer also made him more aware of his mortality, he admits, but after recovering, made him realize it was for the best.\n\nIt feels like a rebirth after you go through cancer and come out of it, he said. You see priorities differently. You have a much deeper appreciation of marriage, of your children – you see everything a little bit clearer, and a little brighter.\n\nThankfully, if he takes after his father, legendary 102-year-old actor Kirk Douglas, Michael's got plenty of time left.\n\nCATHERINE ZETA-JONES ON MAKING IT WORK WITH MICHAEL DOUGLAS: 'YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST AND OPEN'\n\nKirk was on hand with Zeta-Jones, 49, and their family for his Michael's Hollywood Walk of Fame induction in November.\n\nI didn't expect to feel such emotion at the ceremony, Michael admitted. Catherine was excited and happy. I was happy to have Kirk sitting there ... Dad and I cover about 120 years and about 130 films between us.\n\nHe also revealed that his children want to go into the family business.\n\nMICHAEL DOUGLAS SAYS FATHER KIRK TOLD HIM HIS ACTING DEBUT WAS 'ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE'\n\nMy three kids, Cameron, Dylan and Carys, all want to be actors, as well as my niece Kelsey, he said. So there are four Douglases in this next generation. So I think this sense of immortality and the continuity of ­generations going on is kind of special.\n\nStill, not everything about aging is all it's cracked up to be. Michael confessed that he has trouble memorizing scripts occasionally as he gets older.\n\nMICHAEL DOUGLAS ON AGING AND HOLLYWOOD AND BECOMING A GRANDFATHER\n\nMemory is tough. Memorizing lines takes longer, and I don't like that anxious feeling that you don't have it locked in, he lamented.\n\nStill, he added, Hey, I am 74 and in most jobs they kick you out at 65. So I love what I am doing and it keeps me going. I can only play so much golf.
Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard on Thursday released a lengthy apology for her past activism and comments against gay marriage, saying her views have changed significantly since her outspoken protests of the early 2000s.\n\nGabbard, 37, announced plans last week to seek the Democratic Party's nomination for president. Since then, her past statements have come under fire from Democrats and gay rights groups.\n\nTULSI GABBARD UNDER FIRE FOR PAST ANTI-GAY REMARKS AMID 2020 BID\n\nIn my past, I said and believed things that were wrong, and worse, hurtful to people in the LGBTQ+ community and their loved ones, Gabbard tweeted, along with a video. I'm deeply sorry for having said and believed them.\n\nIn years past, Gabbard referred to gay activists as homosexual extremists. Her father, Mike Gabbard, was known at the time as Hawaii's leading opponent of the gay-rights movement. Gabbard herself was a visible force against same-sex marriage, and in 2004 spearheaded a fight in the state against a same-sex union measure.\n\nTo try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, she said at the time. As Democrats, we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists.\n\nGabbard also blasted Massachusetts' passage of same-sex marriage legislation, making it the first in the nation to recognize gay marriage. Speaking on behalf of the Alliance for Traditional Marriage and Values, a group headed by her father, she said the Massachusetts marriage law would cause a ripple effect across the country.\n\nIt is highly likely that federal judges will soon be tearing apart our U.S. Constitution in order to force same-sex marriage down the throats of the people of Hawaii and America, Gabbard said. The only way to protect traditional marriage in Hawaii and throughout our country, the only way to stop activist federal judges from rewriting our constitution, is by the passage of the Federal Marriage Amendment.\n\nTULSI GABBARD, HAWAII DEMOCRAT, SAYS SHE WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020\n\nGabbard also once gave a lengthy speech at the Hawaii State House against a proposed resolution that addressed the bullying of gay students in public schools. Gabbard argued the resolution would cast homosexuality as normal, and that it would attract homosexual-advocacy organizations into our schools to promote their agenda to our vulnerable youth.\n\nOn Thursday, Gabbard said her views have changed significantly since then, and my record in Congress over the last 6 years reflects what is in my heart: A strong and ongoing commitment to fighting for LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nGabbard said she grew up in a socially conservative household, where I was raised to believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman. For a period of my life I didn't see the contradiction in those beliefs.\n\nWhile many Americans may relate to growing up in a conservative home, my story is a little different because my father was very outspoken, Gabbard said. He was an activist who was fighting against gay rights and marriage equality in Hawaii – and at that time, I forcefully defended him.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGay rights groups have criticized Gabbard for her past activism, with Zeke Stokes, the vice president of programs at GLAAD, telling Fox News she was was someone who worked so actively against our community when the stakes were so high.\n\nOne thing is to say that marriage should be between a man and a woman, but another is to actively work to stymie the progress of a community that is marginalized, and to oppose an effort to keep kids safe, Stokes said.\n\nFox News' Elizabeth Llorente contributed to this report.
Maria Shriver may not be spilling the beans on Katherine Schwarzenegger's pending nuptials to Chris Pratt, but she's peeling back one tiny layer – giving us a glimpse into how her author daughter is feeling after saying yes.\n\nShe's super happy and gave me super strict instructions not to talk about it, Shriver said of Schwarzenegger's exciting announcement Tuesday on the Today show. It's not my moment.\n\nCHRIS PRATT ANNOUNCES ENGAGEMENT TO KATHERINE SCHWARZENEGGER\n\nShriver acknowledged that Schwarzenegger, 29, wants to have her moment, before jokingly adding, Good luck.\n\nPratt, 39, announced his engagement to Schwarzenegger on Jan. 14 via Instagram with a post of him kissing her on her head while she tightly holds him around his neck flashing her massive diamond ring.\n\nSweet Katherine, so happy you said yes! I'm thrilled to be marrying you, the Avengers actor captioned the photo. Proud to live boldly in faith with you. Here we go!\n\nCHRIS PRATT, KATHERINE SCHWARZENEGGER'S WEDDING WILL FOCUS ON GOD, REPORT SAYS\n\nSchwarzenegger echoed the same sentiment while she shared the same image to her followers, writing, My sweet love. Wouldn't want to live this life with anyone but you.\n\nPratt's marriage to Schwarzenegger would mark his first since he and ex-wife Anna Faris, 42, finalized their divorce in November 2018, after announcing their separation more than a year prior. The exes tied the knot in July 2009 and waived their right to spousal support as the two signed a prenup prior to getting married. They also share a 6-year-old son, Jack.\n\nFollowing the engagement announcement, Faris dished on her podcast Anna Faris Is Unqualified that Pratt had actually texted her to give her the heads up – which she admits she was stoked by.\n\nCHRIS PRATT AND KATHERINE SCHWARZENEGGER SHARE A LOVE OF FAITH\n\nChris texted me this morning and he was like, 'I proposed to Katherine last night,' Faris explained. And I was like, 'Ahh, that's amazing.' I texted him back like, 'I just wanted to remind you I'm an ordained minister.'\n\nI'm so happy for them, she added. I knew that it was gonna happen and I love her and I love him and I'm just so happy that they found each other.

Jeff Bezos and his wife MacKenzie are divorcing after 25 years of marriage, the Amazon CEO and Washington Post owner has announced, potentially leading to the costliest divorce settlement in history with $137 billion at stake.\n\nThe richest man in the world, currently worth about $137 billion, according to Bloomberg, made the divorce announcement on Wednesday on his Twitter.\n\nWe want to make people aware of a development in our lives. As our family and close friends know, after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends, read the statement signed by both of them.\n\nJOHN STOSSEL: WHY AMAZON AND JEFF BEZOS HAVE ME FEELING REALLY DISAPPOINTED RIGHT NOW\n\nThe split could lead the costliest divorce is history, even if the couple doesn't divide the money equally. There are no reports indicating the couple has a prenuptial agreement, meaning the wealth accumulated during their marriage would have to be split evenly.\n\nBezos also became a millionaire only in 1997 – four years after they got married. MacKenzie reportedly was one of the first Amazon's employees.\n\nExperts say that it's unlikely MacKenzie will gain control of Amazon after the divorce, with the divorce agreement mostly focusing dividing the family's personal wealth.\n\nThis seems to be the most amicable and cordial relationship that split up, which leads me to believe whatever the agreement is going to be, it will purely be financial and beneficial, Juda Engelmayer, a crisis management expert and president of HeraldPR, told Fox News.\n\nIt's not going to be the control of the company, he continued. Will it affect his personal wealth and split it in half? Quite possibly, he added, though noted that a lot of the Bezos' wealth is tied to Amazon's performance.\n\nWill it affect [Jeff Bezos'] personal wealth and split it in half? Quite possibly. — Juda Engelmayer\n\nThe current most expensive divorce belongs to billionaire art dealer Alec Wildenstein and New York socialite Jocelyn Wildenstein, dubbed Catwoman. She won roughly $2.5 billion in the divorce settlement, shattering all the records.\n\nAMAZON IS GOING TO START DELIVERING PACKAGES INSIDE YOUR GARAGE SO THEY DON'T GET STOLEN\n\nBezos first met his wife in New York after interviewing her for a research job at a hedge fund, where he worked as vice president, MacKenzie told Vogue magazine in 2013.\n\nMy office was next door to his, and all day long I listened to that fabulous laugh. How could you not fall in love with that laugh? she told the magazine.\n\nThey got engaged after three months of dating and eventually got married in 1993. Together with his new wife, he shortly left his job on Wall Street and resettled in Seattle where he founded Amazon, initially an online bookstore.\n\nTheir marriage lasted 25 years and they are parents to four children, including three sons and one daughter who was adopted from China.\n\nWe feel incredibly lucky to have found each other and deeply grateful for every one of the years we have been married to each other. If we had known we would separate after 25 years, we would do it all again, the statement added.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWe've had such a great life together as a married couple, and we also see wonderful futures ahead, as parents, friends, partners in ventures and projects, and as individuals pursuing ventures and adventures. Though the labels might be different, we remain a family, and we remain cherished friends.\n\nAmazon has been deemed the most valuable company in the world, worth nearly $810 billion. In September, it briefly surpassed the trillion-dollar valuation. It valued $20 billion more than Microsoft.

We knew he could sing, but we had no idea how just so many people would come to hear him sing. You saw him on stage and you just knew he was going to be somebody one day.\n\nI remember it was at Sam Houston State [University]. He got a Greyhound bus for us. They picked us up from our house — I think I was in junior high at the time. But I just thought the whole experience was pretty cool. I remember when the show was over he started bowing and thanking everybody. And then my dad walked out there and he started taking bows. He said, Dad, this is my show. *laughs* But it was so funny.\n\nFox News: What's your favorite memory of Kenny Rogers?\n\nRogers: Oh, we have so many. I remember my twin Randy and I would go with him to the recording studio. He let us do background on one of his songs. I remember we were even suggesting how to make the song better — could you believe that? But we did just that… When it was all over, we started asking for royalties *laughs*. Kenneth would say, I can't believe you've only been in here for 30 minutes and you're already asking for royalties. That became an ongoing joke for us, one that I will remember forever.\n\nDORIS DAY WAS NOT A RECLUSE, SPENT HER FINAL YEARS RESPONDING TO FANS, PAL SAYS: 'SHE CALLED THEM HER FRIENDS'\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN DETAILS HER NEW DOC, SAYS SHE'S NOT WORRIED ABOUT JUSTICE REFORM CRITICS\n\nFox News: How did fame impact your relationship with Kenny Rogers in any way?\n\nRogers: He opened up a whole new world for us.

It was all because of him.\n\nI remember Dottie West used to come to my mom's house in the country when she and Kenneth were touring. My mother loved her and would take her fishing. Well, Dottie would come up to the pier with heels on! Mama used to say, You can't do that, you need to put on other shoes! I mean, who wears heels on a pier to go fishing? Only Dottie. I think out of all the people we've met, she is probably the one that paid a lot of attention to my mom. We just loved her to death.\n\nFox News: What did you think of his Gambler persona?\n\nRogers: I thought it was pretty cool. There's a disc jockey we all grew up with and he said, I have never known a singer who could take one song and make five movies out of it. But we loved that song. That and Lucille. My mom's name is Lucille but the song wasn't written for her. I remember Kenneth called one day and said, Sandy, what do you think of this song? I said, Oh, that doesn't sound right to me. I don't think you'll do good with that. Well, he made 20 million off of it. So here I am eating crow.\n\n'HAPPY DAYS' STARS DON MOST, ANSON WILLIAMS REUNITE FOR 'HARVEST TIME': 'IT WILL SURELY SURPRISE PEOPLE'\n\n'NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET' STAR ROBERT ENGLUND ON WHY IT'S UNLIKELY HE'LL PLAY FREDDY KRUEGER AGAIN\n\nFox News: What are some fun facts about Kenny Rogers that would surprise fans today?\n\nRogers: His humor. He was such a jokester. That never left him. I have two other sisters and he called every one of us his baby sisters… I remember he would call me and if I wasn't there, he'd leave a message and said, All right, if you're shacking up with somebody, I need to meet him. Typical brother. I remember I sent him a church picture of me. He called me and said, Thank you for that picture. But Sandy, I thought I saw that picture in Playboy. But seriously, I put it out in the yard, out in the garden. And nothing's there anymore! And to top it off, everything's dead.\n\nWhen we were helping him with this special, we went to visit him. He said, Look here, I've got that picture still. I could look at it every day. I'm thinking to myself, 'He ain't gonna do that.

So I told him, Can you sing 'Crazy' for me? And he did. He didn't say why he was singing it but was looking at me and this guy. Two weeks later he said, What happened? Well, nothing, he's gone.

He would have us stand up. And then he would say, OK guys, any of y'all single? I have a sister that's looking. And then all these guys were whistling, hollering and waving. The spotlight was right on me. I just went to myself, Oh my God, Lord have mercy. He was protective of me, but such a typical brother. He also used to say, If my sister ever gets married, she's going to have a bigger wedding than Princess Diana. I would tell him, There's no use for everybody to be miserable. I'm not getting married. He ended up putting that in his book. He [joked], I think my sister had the right idea on that.\n\nFox News: People continue to speculate about his relationship with Dolly Parton. What do you make of those rumors?\n\nRogers: Nothing. I mean, he loved her to death. But we never thought anything of it, to be honest with you. It was just him finding somebody he could sing with and make everyone feel a special way. And they had that. Dolly is just like a little child, a china doll. She met all of us in the family. By the time she got to me, she said, Kenny, how many Rogers are in this family? I've met people for two days! She was really cute and very sweet.\n\nFox News: What were Kenny's final years like?\n\nRogers: I remember he said one year, I'm going to retire next year. And then that year came and he didn't. I don't think in a sense that he really wanted to retire. He just figured he needed to and spend some time his [wife] Wanda and the boys. I know when we were filming this A&E special, he was doing pretty well. I remembered I had my hair colored and I asked him if he liked it. He said, Why didn't you do it before? Well, it wasn't in style *laughs*. But he always remained very sweet.\n\nJOHN TESH RECALLS HOW HE WAS 'READY TO TAKE' HIMSELF 'OUT' WHILE BATTLING CANCER: 'I WAS ANGRY AT GOD'\n\nKENNY ROGERS' EX-WIFE MARIANNE GORDON REMEMBERS THE LATE SINGER: 'HE REALLY DIDN'T CHANGE WITH FAME'\n\nFox News: What do you hope audiences will get from this special?\n\nRogers: I don't want anybody to forget him. I know fans just can't get enough of him, and that is good. He was good to everybody. He was a jokester, but he helped everybody. That's how we were raised to be and he never forgot that. He did an amazing job. He never saw himself as this icon. He would always say, I'm not a great singer, but I like to entertain people. And he was a very good entertainer. I just can't say enough about him. He's my brother. I love him. We all loved him. Sometimes I don't deal with this very well. I still can't believe he's gone, but I know I'll see him again. We'll see him one day in heaven.\n\nBiography: Kenny Rogers airs on April 13 at 9 p.m. EST on A&E. The Associated Press contributed to this report.
A California woman pleaded guilty to making bomb threats against a historic Catholic high school in Washington D.C. two years ago after school officials decided same-sex marriage announcements would be included in its alumni letter, the Justice Department said Monday.\n\nSonia Tabizada, 36, of San Jacinto, Calif., pleaded guilty in federal court to intentionally obstructing persons in the enjoyment of their free exercise of religious beliefs by threatening to bomb the Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School in Washington, D.C., the DOJ annonced in a press release. Her actions qualified as a hate crime.\n\nIn May 2019, school officials announced that Visitation Prep, the oldest Catholic school for girls in the country, would begin publishing same-sex wedding announcements in its alumni magazine to advance its teaching that we are all children of God ... worthy of respect and love, according to the Justice Department.\n\nPROUD BOYS LEADER TO APPEAR IN COURT AS DC PREPS FOR PRO-TRUMP RALLIES, ELECTORAL COLLEGE CERTIFICATION\n\nTabizada learned of this announcement and made multiple calls threatening violence in response to the school's decision, according to her plea agreement.\n\nOn May 15, 2019, Tabizada left a voice message stating that she was going to burn and bomb the church, prosecutors said. She also stated that she was going to kill school officials and students. Several minutes later, Tabizada left a second voice mail stating that she was going to blow up the school and warned that she would commit terrorism.\n\nThe defendant made violent threats against high school students, religious leaders, and school officials based solely on her disagreement with a private school's application of religious doctrine, Eric Drieband, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. Tolerance and religious freedom are cornerstone values in our society and the Department of Justice will continue to vigorously prosecute violent threats motivated by bias.\n\nPOPE FRANCIS SUPPORTS LAW FOR SAME-SEX CIVIL UNIONS IN NEW DOCUMENTARY: 'THEY ARE CHILDREN OF GOD'\n\nMichael R. Sherwin, Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, said the defendant's violent threats were directed at the free exercise of a private school community's religious beliefs.\n\nAn attack upon the free exercise of any person or group's religious beliefs is an attack upon the civil rights of every citizen, he added.\n\nSteven M. D'Antuono, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI Washington Field Office, said Tabizada used threats of violence to intimidate others because of differing religious views.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEvery citizen and community has the Constitutional right to exercise their own religious beliefs free from fear and discrimination, he continued. Defending civil rights is a top priority for the FBI and we will continue to work to protect the civil rights and freedoms granted to all Americans.\n\nTabizada will be sentenced at a hearing scheduled for March 23, 2021. She faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000.
Friends of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' rumored girlfriend Lauren Sanchez were shocked when news of the alleged pair dating broke after Bezos announced he and wife MacKenzie were divorcing after 25 years of marriage.\n\nWithin hours, Page Six reported that the richest man in the world was secretly dating Sanchez, a former TV anchor and wife of Patrick Whitesell, powerhouse Hollywood agent for the likes of Christian Bale, Matt Damon, Hugh Jackman and more A-listers.\n\nAMAZON'S JEFF BEZOS HAS NO PRENUP, $67B ON THE LINE: REPORT\n\nHowever, the news of Bezos', 54, and Sanchez's, 49, discreet romance came as a surprise to many who knew the brunette bombshell, a licensed helicopter pilot who served as an aerial filming consultant on films including Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk.\n\nThis whole thing came as a huge shock for many of us who knew Lauren, a source close to the former Good Day LA co-host told Fox News exclusively. She was always the smartest person in the room and relished in her opportunities to showcase her many talents to everyone.\n\nJEFF BEZOS DIVORCE BEGS THE QUESTION: IS THERE A RIGHT WAY TO DIVORCE?\n\nSanchez was the first host of So You Think You Can Dance in 2005, and worked as an entertainment reporter and correspondent for Extra from 2011 to 2017, however despite the shocking reports surrounding her relationship with the brown box boss, those close to her have a hard time believing she is the blame for Bezos' split from his wife as suggested on the cover of the National Enquirer – and say that she regularly exuded a beaming personality that was infectious to anyone she encountered.\n\nI don't think she would ever put herself, her family or anyone else's family in jeopardy for a fling -- she always put her kids before anything else, the source maintained. Regardless of what did or didn't happen, Lauren is a catch for anyone and her attitude and personality permeated the room.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSanchez and Whitesell married in 2005, but have yet to formally file for divorce.

Larry King is speaking out about the downfall of his marriage to Shawn Southwick, saying religion and their 26-year-year age gap eventually took its toll on their relationship.\n\nThe television personality has married eight times — twice to the same woman — and is on his way to his eighth divorce.\n\nIn August, King, 86, filed for divorce from Southwick, 60, after 22 years of marriage. They are parents to Chance, 20, and Cannon, 19.\n\nCOACH SAYS HE HAD AN AFFAIR WITH LARRY KING'S WIFE\n\nI'm sorry about the marriage, King said to People Magazine. I'll always care for my wife. But it just hit a point where we didn't get along.\n\nKing and Southwick married in 1997, but since then, things changed for the Larry King Now host.\n\nI got married a lot, he said. But in my head, I'm not a marrying guy. When I grew up, nobody lived together. If you fell in love, you got married. And so I married the ones that I loved. But what I loved at 20 is not what I loved at 30 and what I loved at 30 is not what I loved at 40.\n\nThis marriage was King's longest, however, with his other unions clocking in at seven years or less. They even withstood rumors of cheating that cropped up after a brief separation.\n\nI never cheated on my wives, King said. My career always came first.\n\nLARRY KING'S ESTRANGED WIFE, SHAWN, SAYS SHE WAS 'BLINDSIDED' BY DIVORCE\n\nIt wasn't just King's changing emotions that led to the split.\n\nWe had a big age difference and that eventually takes its toll, said King, who is 26 years older than his 60-year-old wife. It became an issue. Also, [Southwick] is a very religious Mormon and I'm an agnostic atheist so that eventually causes little problems.\n\nHe added: We overcame a lot, but eventually it became a ships passing in the night situation.\n\nAnother factor leading to the separation: King suffered a stroke early last year, which made him take stock of his life and think about the future.\n\nI thought a lot about what I wanted the rest of my life to be, said King of the time after his stroke. When there are moments of unhappiness in a marriage, you can overcome it at 40, but at my age, it became a lot. I wanted to be happy. Separating was of course difficult. But there is nothing worse than arguing.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOf course, King still wishes Southwick all the best.\n\nI wish her nothing but the best, King noted. We love each other.

I mean, that's why my husband cheated on me.\n\nJANA KRAMER VENTS ABOUT BODY CRITICS AFTER GIVING BIRTH TO SECOND CHILD\n\nShe then added, Sorry, babe.\n\nCaussin, 31, and Kramer married in 2015 but split a year later after the NFL star was accused of cheating on his One Tree Hill star wife.

Kristin Cavallari is ringing in her birthday by reflecting on the last 12 months.\n\nThe Uncommon James mogul took to Instagram on Tuesday to celebrate turning 34.\n\n33 was a crazy year to say the least, Cavallari wrote.

We tried really, really hard for years and years. It was the hardest decision I've ever made.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs for why their marriage didn't last? Cavallari has chalked it up to changing and maturing over time. She met Cutler when she was just 23 years old.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nEvery relationship has their stuff. I met Jay when I was 23. I was a baby. Jay and I had so much love for each other, but we grew up, she explained. When you work at something for so many years and nothing's changing, I think you have to just make a decision. We all want to be happy.
Armie Hammer's ex is speaking out amid his recent social media scandal with bizarre claims of her own.\n\nCourtney Vucekovich said in a recent interview that she previously dated the 34-year-old actor and during that time he allegedly discussed his desire to eat her body parts.\n\nHe said to me he wants to break my rib and barbecue and eat it, Vucekovich alleged to Page Six.\n\nIn hindsight, she said: 'F--k that was weird,' but you never think about it again.\n\nARMIE HAMMER EXITS UPCOMING MOVIE ROLE AMID ALLEGED SOCIAL MEDIA SCANDAL\n\nA rep for Hammer did not return Fox News' requests for comment.\n\nDespite previously not paying much thought to Hammer's odd fantasies, Vucekovich went on to share other dark examples of their time spent together. The founder of a beauty and photo app called Flashd claimed Hammer once told her, I want to take a bite out of you.'\n\nIf I had a little cut on my hand, he'd like suck it or lick it. That's about as weird as we got, she continued.\n\nVucekovich's claims come just days after messages allegedly written by Hammer -- they have not been verified -- were leaked featuring graphic sexual fantasies. The messages first surfaced on an anonymous Instagram account named House of Effie. In the screenshots, Hammer allegedly shares with an unidentified woman his desire to cut off one of your toes and keep it with me in my pocket so I always had a piece of you in my possession.\n\nARMIE HAMMER IS LIVING WITH FRIEND, WORKING CONSTRUCTION AMID SPLIT FROM ESTRANGED WIFE ELIZABETH CHAMBERS\n\nIn another, Hammer allegedly refers to himself as 100% a cannibal. Vucekovich said she too is unsure of the legitimacy of the messages. However, based on her experiences, she isn't shocked by the allegations.\n\nThe app founder, 30, went on to detail traumatic memories from her past with Hammer, who she called one of the most broken people she's ever met. She claimed the relationship was emotionally abusive and resulted in her undergoing a hospitalization program for PTSD and trauma.\n\nHe enters your life in such a big way. He's such a captivating person. He has such a presence and he's aware of that and he uses it in such a way that most women would think, 'Oh my gosh, this is amazing,' but especially young women, that's kind of the scary part — how good he is at active manipulation and making you feel like he's never felt this way about anybody, Vucekovich said.\n\nARMIE HAMMER, RUMER WILLIS RELATIONSHIP IS 'VERY CASUAL': SOURCE\n\nVucekovich claimed the Rebecca star grooms his partners while putting on this front of being charming.\n\nHe's grooming you for these things that are darker and heavier and consuming, she said. When I say consuming, I mean mentally, physically, emotionally, financially, just everything.\n\nShe also described the actor's obsessive ways during their relationship. After spending three whole weeks by his side, she claimed the actor would text her 100 times per day when they were apart. She also claims that she did not feel safe.\n\nI had this gut feeling the whole time that this was not right. He's not well, she said. She also claimed the actor is privy to drinking and doing drugs all the time.\n\nThe tech guru also claimed she used to spot Hammer for money because he was broke.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe actually needs you, she said.\n\nOn Thursday, Hammer offered a statement to Variety after it was revealed he would be departing from the upcoming movie Shotgun Wedding in which he was set to star alongside Jennifer Lopez, amid the scandal.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nI'm not responding to these bulls--t claims but in light of the vicious and spurious online attacks against me, I cannot in good conscience now leave my children for 4 months to shoot a film in the Dominican Republic, he said. Lionsgate is supporting me in this and I'm grateful to them for that.\n\nIn July, Hammer and his wife of over 10 years, Elizabeth Chambers, announced their split on social media. They share two children together: daughter Harper Grace, 5, and son Ford Douglas Armand, 3.
The Cuban government has been accused of censoring text communications that oppose the country's new proposed constitution.\n\nThe Cuban public will decide in a referendum Feb. 24 whether to approve the proposal, which would update the Cold War-era constitution.\n\nBut not everyone is on board with the new version, as it would pave the way for the legalization of same-sex marriage and wouldn't overhaul the country's socialist economic system or embrace private property.\n\nSome have accused the government, which is backing the proposed constitution, of rigging the debate and the upcoming vote.\n\nJOHN STOSSEL: TRUMP DOESN'T NEED TO MEDDLE IN CUBA BECAUSE THINGS ARE ALREADY TURNING AROUND\n\nEduardo Sánchez, 23, told Miami's WPLG-TV that the alleged suppression of text messages first spread by the word of mouth.\n\nBut then he tried to test the allegations by himself to find out whether the Cuban government was engaging in censorship.\n\nHe claims that only positive messages about the constitution, with hashtags like #YoVotoSi (I Vote Yes) and #SomosContinuidad (We Are Continuity), were actually delivered to recipients.\n\nMeanwhile, negative messages or texts that say #Abstencion (Abstention) were reportedly blocked.\n\nIt's a fully legal referendum, a fully legal state-organized referendum and people should be allowed to vote for, against or even abstain, Sanchez told the outlet, saying the state-run telecommunications company should work for the people.\n\nGOOGLE PRESSURED BY HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS TO ABANDON CENSORED SEARCH IN CHINA\n\nSocial media and text messages are becoming the new challenge of communist governments around the world to contain the spread of ideas that could cause upheaval against the government.\n\nIn China, young adults are facing intimidation and detention for the crime of posting on Twitter, with one man spending 15 days in a detention center for using the platform blocked in the country, the New York Times reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn an apparent crackdown on unapproved social media use, Chinese authorities detaining and interrogating an increasing number of Twitter users.\n\nIf we give up Twitter, we are losing one of our last places to speak, Wang Aizhong, a human-rights activist, told the newspaper.\n\nHe said the police asked him to delete posts that criticized the government.

[Editor's note: This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).]\n\nFor decades, MDMA has been considered a party drug. But, after years of research and clinical trials, one organization is convincing government officials and patients that the drug can also be beneficial in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nThe Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) recently announced they had received expanded access approval for the continued research into MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD, a major step toward making the drug legal for medical purposes. The Food and Drug Administration recognition of the drug's effectiveness for trauma survivors furthers the organization's efforts to destigmatize and make universal MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.\n\nVETERAN SUICIDE RATES REMAIN ALARMINGLY HIGH DESPITE YEARS OF REFORM\n\nWe're looking at possible FDA approval for treatment at the end of 2021, and the accessibility of treatment in clinics by 2022, said Brad Burge, a spokesperson for MAPS.\n\nThe therapy has been so effective that it prompted a Special Protocol Assessment from the FDA, which Burge said is an agreement with the administration that if the Phase 3 trials are effective enough, the therapy will be approved.\n\nOver the past several years, the nonprofit's research has markedly advanced the prospects of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a medically accepted, and legal, form of treatment for PTSD. The clinical trials are part of a larger $26.9 million mission to make MDMA an FDA-approved prescription by 2021.\n\nIn the decades since MDMA was criminalized in 1985, it has garnered a reputation as a party drug. However, there has been growing movement to harness the drug's effects to enhance traditional therapy.\n\n[The FDA's] response has been really great. They've allowed these studies to move forward since the mid-90s. — Brad Burge, spokesman for MAPS\n\nEven after its criminalization, MAPS was able to get FDA approval to test MDMA's effectiveness in a number of therapeutic capacities. Now, it seems this decades-long effort to make the drug available to assist in therapy is coming to fruition.\n\nResults of their research have been encouraging. A study of 26 veterans, firefighters and police officers with service-related PTSD found that two of the three testing groups responded positively to MDMA-assisted psychotherapy and had significantly greater decreases in PTSD symptom severity, according to results published in The Lancet Psychiatry in 2018.\n\n[The FDA's] response has been really great, Burge said. They've allowed these studies to move forward since the mid-90s.\n\nDEATHS RELATED TO BINGE-DRINKING ON THE RISE, NEW STUDIES SHOW\n\nOne year after the end of the three MDMA-assisted sessions, 67 percent of participants reportedly did not meet the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis. The significant improvement of the trauma survivors' symptoms gave the FDA enough confidence in the program to grant MAPS Expanded Access for people who haven't found relief in traditional treatments.\n\nThough the work with veterans has garnered the most headlines, Burge said the majority of the participants in the recent trials weren't veterans or first responders. Many had developed their PTSD by way of sexual assault or domestic violence.\n\nWhat we're seeing in the studies is that the effectiveness applies to people with PTSD from any cause, said Burge.\n\nLost in the statistics and medical jargon of FDA approvals and whitepapers is the human impact of the treatment. Jonathan Lubecky, who works as a part-time contracted lobbyist for the organization, is an Iraq War veteran who credits the therapy with saving his life.\n\nLubecky was a career military man until the combination of a traumatic brain injury and PTSD, sustained simultaneously, forced him to medically retire from the armed forces as an E-5 Sergeant.\n\nFrom 1995 to 1999, he served in the Marine Corps. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Lubecky reenlisted, joining the National Guard a few days after the invasion of Iraq in 2003. He was stationed at Balad Air Base, which was notorious for a near-constant bombardment of mortar attacks.\n\nLubecky, now 43 years old, worked base security at Balad, and was using the outhouse when he said a mortar shell hit him. The blast wave concussed him, leading to a traumatic brain injury. The trauma from the incident would manifest years later as PTSD and force his medical retirement.\n\nMAPS saved my life. I wouldn't be here, wouldn't be talking to you right now, if it wasn't for them and this treatment. — Jonathan Lubecky, Iraq War veteran and MAPS lobbyist\n\nDespite the injuries and trauma, he finished his tour of duty. When he returned from Iraq in 2006, he came home to a personal life upended and marriage on the verge of disintegration. The combination of PTSD and marriage problems proved too much, pushing Lubecky to attempt suicide five times over the years.\n\nTwice, his pistol misfired when he put it to his head and pulled the trigger. Lubecky said the peace he felt in those milliseconds, when the hammer was going to fall, is the daily peace he credits to MAPS' therapy.\n\nMAPS saved my life, Lubecky said. I wouldn't be here, wouldn't be talking to you right now, if it wasn't for them and this treatment.\n\nHe said he feels it's part of his mission to spread the word of the effectiveness of MDMA-assisted therapy to trauma survivors.\n\nFive suicide attempts that should've ended my life, but didn't, he said. I don't want anybody on this planet to ever feel that way.\n\nLubecky has lobbied members of House and Senate as well as local governments, crisscrossing the country to help MAPS garner the political support to enact their therapeutic agenda.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAmong his proudest achievements of the past year is getting Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., two philosophically opposed politicians, to co-sponsor a bill on psychedelic research.\n\nAs a [non-commissioned officer], I have to do this until everybody has access to it, said Lubecky, adding, the biggest thing I want people with PTSD to take out of this is that there is hope coming, there is help coming.\n\nAndrew Keiper is an associate producer with the Investigative Unit.

90 Day Fiance fans were surprised when Jonathan Rivera and Fernanda Flores announced they were ending their marriage.\n\nRumors of their split had been bubbling for weeks before the pair confirmed they had separated after Sunday night's episode of the TLC show.\n\nRivera took to Instagram Live to explain what had happened between the couple, adding that he is very hopeful about a possible reconciliation.\n\nEvery marriage has its problems. Every relationship has its issues, Rivera said on Instagram, per E! News. It's all about your attitude. As long as you're positive… [I] gotta take it day by day.\n\nThe 32-year-old real estate agent added that all of this has happened really fast but that he was committed to making their marriage work.\n\nI promise you, I didn't give up. I gave 110 percent to my marriage, he shared. I reached a point where I said, 'I have to love myself just as much.'\n\nRivera and Flores met while he was traveling in Mexico on vacation when Flores was just 18 and they married a year later. Their romance and wedding was detailed in Season 6 of 90 Day Fiance.\n\nFlores, now 20, alluded to the split on Instagram.\n\nSome of the kindest souls I know have lived in a world that was not so kind to them. Some of the best human beings I know, have been through so much at the hands of others, and the will still love deeply, they still care. Sometimes, it's people who have been hurt the most, who refuse to be hardened in this world, because they would never want to make another person feel the same way they themselves have felt, she wrote.
NEW YORK — Mary Higgins Clark, the tireless and long-reigning Queen of Suspense whose tales of women beating the odds made her one of the world's most popular writers, died Friday at age 92.\n\nHer publisher, Simon & Schuster, announced that she died in Naples, Florida, of natural causes.\n\nNobody ever bonded more completely with her readers than Mary did, her longtime editor Michael Korda said in statement. She understood them as if they were members of her own family. She was always absolutely sure of what they wanted to read — and, perhaps more important, what they didn't want to read — and yet she managed to surprise them with every book.\n\nCHRISTOPHER TOLKIEN, SON OF 'LORD OF THE RINGS' CREATOR, DIES AT 95\n\nA widow with five children in her late 30s, she became a perennial best-seller over the second half of her life, writing or co-writing A Stranger Is Watching, Daddy's Little Girl and more than 50 other favorites. Sales topped 100 million copies and honors came from all over, whether a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters in France or a Grand Master statuette back home from the Mystery Writers of America. Many of her books, including A Stranger is Watching and Lucky Day, were adapted for movies and television. She also collaborated on several novels with her daughter, Carol Higgins Clark.\n\nMary Higgins Clark specialized in women triumphing over danger, such as the besieged young prosecutor in Just Take My Heart or the mother of two and art gallery worker whose second husband is a madman in A Cry in the Night. Mary Clark's goal as an author was simple, if rarely easy: keep the readers reading.\n\nYou want to turn the page, she told The Associated Press in 2013. There are wonderful sagas you can thoroughly enjoy a section and put it down. But if you're reading my book, I want you stuck with reading the next paragraph. The greatest compliment I can receive is, 'I read your darned book 'til 4 in the morning, and now I'm tired.' I say, 'Then you get your money's worth.'\n\nThe greatest compliment I can receive is, 'I read your darned book 'til 4 in the morning, and now I'm tired.' — Mary Higgins Clark\n\nHer own life taught her lessons of resilience, strengthened by her Catholic faith, that she shared with her fictional heroines. She was born Mary Higgins in New York City in 1927, the second of three children. She would later take on the last name Clark after marriage. Mary Clark's father ran a popular pub that did well enough for the family to afford a maid and for her mother to prepare meals for strangers in need. But business slowed during the Great Depression and her father, forced to work ever longer hours as he laid off employees, died in his sleep in 1939. One of her brothers died of meningitis a few years later. Surviving family members took on odd jobs and had to rent out rooms in the house.\n\nMary had always loved to write. At age 6, she completed her first poem, which her mother proudly requested she recite in front of the family. A story she wrote in grade school impressed her teacher enough that Mary Clark read it to the rest of the class. By high school, she was trying to sell stories to True Confessions magazine.\n\nAfter working as a hotel switchboard operator (Tennessee Williams was among the guests she eavesdropped on) and a flight attendant for Pan American, she married Warren Clark, the regional manager of Capital Airways, in 1949. Throughout the 1950s and into the '60s, she raised the children, studied writing at New York University and began getting stories published. Some drew upon her experiences at Pan American. One story which appeared in The Saturday Evening Post, Beauty Contest at Buckingham Palace, imagined a pageant featuring Queen Elizabeth II, Jackie Kennedy and Princess Grace of Monaco. But by the mid-60s, the magazine market for fiction was rapidly shrinking and her husband's health was failing; Warren Clark died of a heart attack in 1964.\n\nMary Clark quickly found work as a script writer for Portrait of a President, a radio series on American presidents. Her research inspired her first book, a historical novel about George and Martha Washington. She was so determined that she began getting up at 5 a.m., working until nearly 7, then feeding her children and leaving for work.\n\nAspire to the Heavens was published in 1969. It was a triumph, she recalled in her memoir Kitchen Privileges, but also a folly. The publisher was sold near the book's release and received little attention. She regretted the title and learned that some stores placed the book in religious sections. Her compensation was $1,500, minus commission. (The novel was reissued decades later, far more successfully, as Mount Vernon: A Love Story).\n\nFor her next book, she wanted to make some money. Following a guideline she would often suggest to other writers, she looked at her bookshelves, which featured novels by Agatha Christie, Rex Stout and other mystery writers, and decided she should write the kind of book she liked to read. A recent tabloid trial, about a young woman accused of murdering her children, gave her an idea.\n\nIt seemed inconceivable to most of us that any woman could do that to her children, Mary Clark wrote in her memoir. And then I thought: Suppose an innocent young mother is convicted of the deliberate murder of her two children; suppose she gets out of prison on a technicality; and then suppose seven years to the day, on her 32nd birthday, the children of her second marriage disappear.\n\nIn September 1974, she sent her agent a manuscript for Die a Little Death, acquired months later by Simon & Schuster for $3,000. Renamed Where are the Children? and released in 1975, it became her first-best seller and began her long, but not entirely surprising run of success. She would allege that a psychic had told her she would become rich and famous.\n\nMary Clark, who wrote well into her 90s, more than compensated for her early struggles. She acquired several homes and for a time owned part of the New Jersey Nets. She was among a circle of authors, including Lee Child and Nelson DeMille, who met regularly for dinner in Manhattan. She also had friends in Washington and was a White House guest during the administrations of the Clintons and of both President George H.W. Bush, whose wife Barbara became a close friend, and President George W. Bush.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMarried since 1996 to former Merrill Lynch Futures CEO John J. Conheeney, she remembered well the day she said goodbye to hard times. It was in April of 1977, and her agent had told her that Simon & Schuster was offering $500,000 for the hardcover to her third novel, A Stranger is Watching, and that the publisher Dell was paying $1 million for the paperback. She had been running her own script production company during the day and studying for a philosophy degree at Fordham University at night, returning home to New Jersey in an old car with more than 100,000 miles on it.\n\nAs I drove onto the Henry Hudson Parkway, the tailpipe and muffler came loose and began dragging on the ground. For the next 21 miles, I kur-plunked, kur-plunked, all the way home, she wrote in her memoir. People in other cars kept honking and beeping, obviously sure that I was either too stupid or too deaf to hear the racket.\n\nThe next day I bought a Cadillac!

The biggest stars in TV and film gathered in Beverly Hills in the hopes of kicking off the 2020 awards season with a highly coveted Golden Globe award, and notoriously controversial host Ricky Gervais wasted no time laying into the Hollywood elite vying for a big win.\n\nStars from films like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Rocketman and The Irishman as well as shows like Big Little Lies, The Crown and Barry were in attendance but the comedian and host was undeterred by the many famous faces staring back at him.\n\nHe called out the many stars in the room for their relationship to large corporations like Apple, Amazon and Disney.\n\nTIM ALLEN ARRIVES AT THE GOLDEN GLOBE AWARDS AFTER RICKY GERVAIS ADMITS HE REGRETS MAKING FUN OF HIM\n\nApple roared into the TV game with 'The Morning Show,' a superb drama about the importance of dignity and doing the right thing made by a company that runs sweatshops in China, he said. So you say you're 'woke', but the companies you work for, Apple, Amazon, Disney... If ISIS had a streaming service you would be calling your agents.\n\nGervais then mocked the stars in attendance for their relation to the late sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein. Gervais declared that Epstein didn't kill himself, prompting groans from the crowd.\n\nShut up, I know he's your friend but I don't care.\n\nNICOLE KIDMAN CRIES ON RED CARPET AHEAD OF GOLDEN GLOBES OVER AUSTRALIA WILDFIRES: REPORT\n\nNext up on Gervais' jokes list was Felicity Huffman who recently completed a stint in prison for her role in the college admission scandal.\n\nYou all look lovely all dolled up, you came here in your limos. I came here in a limo and the license plate was made by Felicity Huffman, he said to the crowd who cringed. It's her daughter I feel sorry for. That must be the most embarrassing thing that ever happened to her. And her dad was in 'Wild Hogs,' so...\n\nHe also took a shot at Leonardo DiCaprio for his film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood being three hours long.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio attended the premiere and, by the end, his date was too old for him.\n\nHe added: Even Prince Andrew is like, 'Come on Leo, mate. You're nearly 50.\n\nRUSSELL CROWE TO MISS GOLDEN GLOBE AWARDS DUE TO DEVASTATING WILDFIRES IN AUSTRALIA: REPORT\n\nHe also set his sights on director Martin Scorsese's comments about Marvel movies being like theme parks, joking that he doesn't understand why the director would be at a theme park.\n\nHe's not big enough for any of the rides.\n\nGervais concluded his scathing monologue by warning the celebrities not to make any political or woke statements when accepting their awards.\n\nYou're in no position to lecture the public about anything, he declared. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg.\n\nWith that, the host quickly welcomed Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon to introduce the first win of the evening. Ramy Youssef won best actor in a TV comedy for his series Ramy, beating out fellow celebrities such as Michael Douglas, Bill Hader, Paul Rudd and Ben Platt. Next, Russell Crowe brought home the award for best performance by an actor in a limited series or motion picture made for television for The Loudest Voice, but was unable to attend due to wildfires threatening his home in Australia.\n\nHBO's Succession, meanwhile, was the first series to win one of the more anticipated awards, best television drama, while the South Korean horror film Parasite kicked things off for the movies by winning best foreign language motion picture.\n\nBRAD PITT CALLS JENNIFER ANISTON 'A GOOD FRIEND' AT GOLDEN GLOBE AWARDS\n\nKate McKinnon introduced the first of two special awards of the evening, honoring Ellen DeGeneres with the Carol Burnett Award for excellence in television. She spoke about the 61-year-old comedian's struggle when she came out as a lesbian and how it risked her career in 1997 and helped contribute to attitudes about the LGBT community changing.\n\nBecause brave people like Ellen jump into the fire to make them change, McKinnon said through tears.\n\nEllen then took the stage to deliver a lengthy monologue filled with laughs and ended with a bit of heart as she explained that the power of television, to her, is having the ability to inspire people to do good in this world.\n\nI'm so grateful to be a part of it, she concluded.\n\nThe next big accolade of the evening, best television series for a musical or comedy, went to Amazon Prime Video's breakout hit, Fleabag, following a win for its creator and star, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, for best actress in a musical or comedy.\n\nIn her acceptance speech, she made sure to thank former President Barack Obama for putting the show on his list of top TV shows of the year.\n\nDespite the host's warning, Patricia Arquette couldn't help but pontificate on the state of the United States in her acceptance speech after taking home the award for best performance by an actress in a supporting role.\n\nWe're not going to look back on this night in the history books. We will see a country on the brink of war, the United States of America. A president tweeted out a threat, she said.\n\nThe star added: While I love my kids so much, I beg of us all to give them a better world. For our kids and their kids, we have to vote in 2020 and we have to beg and plead for everyone we know to vote in 2020.\n\nCharlize Theron took the stage next to follow McKinnon in awarding the second special accolade of the night, the Cecil B. DeMille award, to Tom Hanks.\n\nThe actor stood up and, after first mentioning he had a cold, got incredibly emotional thanking his wife and five kids. After taking a moment to collect himself, he launched into a lengthy monologue about what he's learned throughout his career as an actor.\n\nSoon after, things took a turn toward the political again when Michelle Williams accepted the award for best performance by an actress in a limited series. In a powerful memorized speech, she called on women to vote pro-choice in the upcoming election.\n\nWomen 18 to 118, when it is time to vote, please do so in your own self-interest. It's what men have been doing for years, she concluded. Which is why the world looks so much like them. But don't forget we are the largest voting body in this country, let's make it look more like us.\n\nAs the night went on, the most highly anticipated awards started to roll in, starting with Taron Egerton beating Daniel Craig, Roman Griffin Davis, Leonardo DiCaprio and Eddie Murphy for best performance by an actor in a motion picture musical or comedy for his part in the Elton John biopic, Rocketman.\n\nAwkwafina then beat out Cate Blanchett, Beanie Feldstein, Emma Thompson and Ana de Armas to win best actress in a motion picture musical or comedy for her role in The Farewell, about a young woman in a Chinese family that is keeping their matriarch's cancer a secret from her.\n\nWill Ferrell and Pierce Brosnan took the stage next to reveal Once Upon a Time in Hollywood as the best motion picture musical or comedy of the year after its director and writer, Quentin Tarantino, brought home the award for best screenplay earlier in the night.\n\nNext, Joaquin Phoenix took home the award for best actor in a drama for his role as Arthur Fleck in Joker. In his acceptance speech, he made a note about Hollywood stars leading by example and not taking private jets if they can avoid it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRenee Zellweger won the penultimate award, best actress in a motion picture drama, for her part as Judy Garland in Judy before the final award of the evening was announced.\n\nSandra Bullock closed out the evening by presenting the last award of the night, best motion picture drama, which went to 1917. The WWI drama beat out The Irishman, Joker, Marriage Story and The Two Popes.
Bachelorette star Clare Crawley has addressed her high-profile split from Dale Moss.\n\nThe two met while filming the last season of ABC's popular dating show, but in a surprise twist, the 39-year-old star decided to depart the show just a few weeks in, as she felt she'd already found her winner in Moss, who proposed to her.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 32-year-old Moss announced on social media that he and Crawley decided to go our separate ways, calling the split their healthiest course of action.\n\nNow, Crawley has released her own statement on Instagram.\n\n'BACHELORETTE'S CLARE CRAWLEY, DALE MOSS SPLIT\n\nI was made aware of a 'mutual' statement at the same time you all were, so I've needed some time to really digest this, she began, implying that Moss' announcement wasn't on her radar ahead of time.\n\nSpeaking for myself, my intentions with this relationship have always been clear, so the truth is I am crushed, the star continued. This was not what I expected or hoped for and am still trying to process this.\n\nThe reality star then reflected on the year 2020, calling it one hell of a year.\n\nShe said that in 2020, she faced severe anxiety, the coronavirus pandemic, balancing a public new relationship and slowly losing my mother -- circumstances that left her looking forward to the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nCLARE CRAWLEY WRITES HEARTFELT MESSAGES AFTER 'BACHELORETTE' EXIT: 'I AM SIMPLY TRYING MY BEST'\n\nOur relationship was not perfect, but I can say that I was genuinely invested with all of my heart, Crawley concluded. I may not have all the answers, but I do know this- I will continue to show up, stand by my word, and be committed to love.\n\nFurthermore, it seems that it wasn't just the announcement of the split that caught the star off guard.\n\nClare feels blindsided by the split, a source told People magazine. She genuinely thought they could make things work and after everything she's been through, she can't believe she's in this place again.\n\nThe breakup has been extremely painful and emotional for Crawley, the source said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAn insider spoke to the outlet after news of the breakup surfaced, and claimed that Moss wasn't ready for marriage and kids.\n\nHe did have feelings for Clare but he wasn't on the same page as her, the source explained.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nFor her part, Crawley was really hoping he would grow in the relationship and come around, said the insider, but, things only got tougher after the show when they had to start making big life decisions.\n\nA rep for Moss did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.
In 1973, the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade struck down state laws banning abortions. And liberals then, I think, thought that would settle the issue.\n\nBut 46 years later, the country is still torn apart about abortion. On Friday, hundreds of thousands of mostly young people will converge on Washington for the March for Life. They brave the snow and usually frigid temperatures, year after year after year, to speak for those who have no voice -- the unborn. According to a new Marist poll, 75 percent of Americans say they would limit abortion to, at most, the first three months of pregnancy, that include 6 and 10 of those who self-identify as pro-choice as well 6 and 10 Democrats.\n\nWell, that means the Supreme Court is actually out of sync with most Americans on that issue. Not that any of that matters. Because we've given so much power to the Supreme Court to run roughshod over the will of the people in the states, that's it become a super governmental force.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LAURA INGRAHAM.\n\nOur framers never intended that unelected judges would have power over politics and our culture like this. Because it's a question, addressed time and again, by really smart minds, like the late great Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nRegardless of whether you think prohibiting abortion is good or whether you think prohibiting portion is bad, regardless of how you come out on that, my only point is the constitution does not say anything about it, it leaves it up to democratic choice, he once said on the issue.\n\nBut the decisions have not been left up to the people. In fact, the left has long relied on courts to advance a radical transformation of American society on issues like marriage and public justice, and criminal justice reform. And now that the balance of the high court is shifting, or could be shifting, the stakes could not be higher. This is part of the reason Supreme Court battles have gotten so ugly and contentious in recent years.\n\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.\n\nCompared to the chaos and ugliness of Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing, the hearing room during Scalia's confirmation had several empty seats behind him, even after a few hours in. Even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg admitted that judicial confirmations were never this ugly during her process, saying a few months ago, The way it was, [it] was right. The way it is [now], is wrong.\n\nWell, Bader Ginsburg was confirmed overwhelmingly in 1993 by a vote of 93 to 6. Scalia was confirmed by a vote of 98 to 0. By the way, the two had completely different, in most issues, judicial philosophies. But they were really close, really good friends. And as a family friend of the Scalias, I even actually spent a New Year's eve with them, back in 1986 if you can believe it. It was nice to see those friendships.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.\n\nAll these years later, the court is still a pretty collegial place. The justices get along, they're actually friends; they like each other. But because so many on the outside have become so reliant on the court instead of Congress to advance mostly liberal causes, another potential vacancy comes up, and it has all the activists on edge.\n\nPolitico just published a piece titled, What happens if Ruth better Ginsburg remains too sick to work? In just the past two months, Politico reports, the justice, 85, has suffered three fractured ribs and had a pair of cancerous nodules removed from her lung. And this was, as we all know, not Bader Ginsburg's first bout of cancer. She's been there before and her doctors say that they expect her to return to the bench next month.\n\nThe left has long relied on courts to advance a radical transformation of American society on issues like marriage and public justice, and criminal justice reform. And now that the balance of the high court is shifting, or could be shifting, the stakes could not be higher. This is part of the reason Supreme Court battles have gotten so ugly and contentious in recent years.\n\nWell, the justice has been buoyed by America's prayers and well-wishes, and she seems to actually have enjoyed the near-mythic status bestowed on her by the left. You've got movies, documentaries, books, children's books about her. Let's face it, cynics say that this was smartly-designed to set the cultural narrative early, and should the time come, make it more difficult perhaps, for President Trump to appoint someone to replace her with a judicial conservative - someone with temperament that is obviously judicially conservative -- even if that pick is another woman.\n\nLook, anytime a sitting Supreme Court justice, especially at an advanced age, is in declining health, it does raise serious questions. That's why people are writing articles like Politico's. Remember how Democrats made a big deal about President Trump's health leading up to his first physical as commander-in-chief? They endlessly questioned his stamina and mental acuity. A White House physician, Ronny Jackson, reported that the president was in excellent health last January. People still didn't believe it.\n\nWell, now there are some asking that, if it was appropriate to ask questions about the physical condition of the president and his fitness for office, is it also appropriate to ask similar questions about Supreme Court justices, beyond Ginsburg -- all of them. With all the weighty issues facing the High Court, everything from immigration to ObamaCare's contraceptive rules, the stakes are really high now.\n\nAnd as we all wish the justices long and happy lives, do Americans have the right to be reassured that 28-year old law clerks aren't exercising undue influence, especially when the court has outsized powers over matters of life and death. These are big questions we all face.\n\nAdapted from Laura Ingraham's monologue from The Ingraham Angle on January 17, 2019.
Pamela Anderson is being accused of splitting up her now-husband Dan Hayhurst's previous relationship.\n\nThe Playboy model announced this week she married Hayhurst in an intimate ceremony on Christmas Eve in Canada after the two found love during the coronavirus lockdown.\n\nA woman named Carey has now come forward, claiming that Hayhurst's affair with Anderson during their relationship led to their split. Carey, a mother of one, and Hayhurst, who she said has two children of his own, did everything together, including family vacations and fishing trips, she told The Sun.\n\nCarey claims that Hayhurst's marriage to Anderson blindsided her, as she learned about it in the news. Although she did not reveal her last name, Carey provided photos of herself and Hayhurst to the outlet and implied that Anderson and Hayhurst's union wasn't as fairytale as it sounds.\n\nPAMELA ANDERSON'S MARRIAGES: A LOOK BACK\n\nIt's sad that people celebrate this and cheer them on, when it started with deceit, denials and life-shattering choices for all the people involved, the woman said.\n\nA rep for Anderson did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.\n\nCarey, a Canadian native, denied that Hayhurst was Anderson's bodyguard. She described him as Anderson's handyman who began performing work on her house in 2019. Their professional relationship turned more personal in early 2020, and that July Hayhurst moved out of the home they lived in and into Anderson's, she claims.\n\nWe were all totally blindsided by this, it's been so hard for us. And it's not just me and the kids, lots of people have been hurt by them. Dan has lost friendships and business relationships because of this, Carey claimed.\n\nPAMELA ANDERSON MARRIES HER BODYGUARD IN INTIMATE CHRISTMAS WEDDING\n\nWhat's more, Carey claims Hayhurst wasn't fond of Anderson in the beginning. She allegedly shared text messages from her ex who once referred to Anderson as a dragon.\n\nCarey went on to claim Hayhurst would discuss how crazy Anderson is. In January 2020, Anderson confirmed she married movie mogul Jon Peters in a secret wedding, but the union reportedly lasted 12 days.\n\nAt the time, Carey said Hayhurst mocked Peters as being older than [Anderson's] dad, but seemed satisfied that his and Carey's money troubles were over due to Peters' financial worth.\n\nPAMELA ANDERSON SAYS 'YOU NEVER REGRET SAYING YES' FOLLOWING SECRET WEDDING TO JON PETERS\n\nCarey noticed a change between her and Hayhurst in March, she recalled to the outlet. There were times the handyman would stay at her house and not come home, and here I am taking care of the kids, she claimed.\n\nHe asked me to give him time to figure things out so I just let him do what he was doing...And there was no turning back by then. I had met Pam and had gone to dinner with her. My daughter used to work for her. I couldn't believe it, Hayhurst's ex further alleged.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nCarey said she has since moved out of the home she once shared with Hayhurst and it's now up for sale. Carey's daughter Denise, 21, said she too shocked by Hayhurst and Anderson's romance. She worked for Anderson alongside Hayhurst.\n\nI'm here working with them full-time and I had no idea. And the fact that he had a family, we were a blended family, he has two young kids and obviously she's quite a lot older, Denise said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn addition to Peters, Anderson was also formerly married to Tommy Lee, Kid Rock and twice to Rick Salomon.
Jennifer Lopez is looking back on her life.\n\nThe Hustlers actress recently sat down for an interview with Coach and discussed her past relationships and how she felt about herself while in them.\n\nI remember when I was going through therapy at the beginning, you know, kind of in my late 30s and there was a lot of talk about loving yourself and I was like, 'I love myself,' Lopez said.\n\nBut, she later came to realize there was a deeper meaning to loving yourself.\n\nJENNIFER LOPEZ RIPPED FOR 'LET'S GET LOUD' REFERENCE DURING BIDEN INAUGURATION\n\nBut obviously I was doing all these things in like my personal relationships that didn't seem like I was loving myself, but I didn't even understand the concept of it, she admitted. It took time and it's a journey and it's still a journey for me.\n\nIt's unclear which past relationships she was referring to, but Lopez was 34 when she married singer Marc Anthony in 2004. The pair -- they share 12-year-old twins Max and Emme -- split in 2011 and finalized their divorce three years later.\n\nJENNIFER LOPEZ'S INAUGURATION PERFORMANCE RECEIVES HIGH PRAISE FOR HER RENDITION OF 'THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND'\n\nThe star is now engaged to former baseball pro Alex Rodriguez. They were set to marry in 2020 but delayed their nuptials in response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nLopez previously spoke to W Magazine about her split from Anthony and said it was one of the times in her life that she stopped and thought this is too hard.\n\nWhen my marriage ended, it was not easy to find forgiveness. It wasn't the dream that I had hoped for, and it would have been easier to fan the flames of resentment, disappointment and anger, she said, per E! News back in 2016. But Marc is the father of my children, and that's never going away. So, I have to work to make things right. And that is, by far, the hardest work I do.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFurthermore, Lopez admitted that though she was married for many years, she knew her marriage to Anthony, now 52, wouldn't last.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nI hung in there for seven years, she said. I knew very quickly that it wasn't the right thing.
CBS fawned over Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on Sunday with a glowing feature that could indicate how the incoming administration will be treated by the mainstream media.\n\n'CBS Sunday Morning' host Jane Pauley seems to have found her new Democrat to gush over for the next four years, Media Research Center news analyst Nicholas Fondacaro wrote in a piece headlined, Cozy with Kamala.\n\nPENCE CALLS VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT HARRIS TO OFFER CONGRATULATIONS AHEAD OF INAUGURATION\n\nPauley sat down with Harris and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, for a two-part interview that was a far cry from the way Mike and Karen Pence have been covered over the past four years. The veteran journalist began by praising Harris for soon becoming the first woman vice president, along with being the first Black vice president and the first of South Asian ancestry.\n\nAre you excited about Jan. 20? Pauley asked before noting a series of issues the incoming administration will face, such as the coronavirus pandemic and aftermath of the tragic Capitol riot.\n\nPauley then asked a series of conversational questions, including how Harris found out the riot was happening and how she can look at her upcoming agenda without looking at it through the veil of the Capitol riot. Pauley declared that it might seem that Kamala Harris was born for his moment in history and began a look into her background. Pauley then discussed the vice president-elect's parents, her education and rattled off a series of Harris' accomplishments.\n\nPauley asked if we'll still be talking about Trump next month, allowing Harris to bash the current president in perhaps the only tough question of the first segment.\n\nNext, Pauley said, Can I meet Doug?\n\nEmhoff joined his wife for the second half of the interview as Pauley began by asking how she should address the first husband of a vice president. Harris joked that he should be called the First Dude as Pauley took a look at how their relationship began. Harris laughed as she told the story of their first encounter and the CBS morning show took a trip down memory lane to detail the origins of their marriage.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPauley asked if they plan to cook after Inauguration Day, inquired about Harris' sneakers and pointed out the diversity of their mixed family. The two-part interview ended without a tough question regarding anything about upcoming policies or plan, as Pauley instead focused on praising the incoming veep.\n\nThere was no such flattery for Mike and Karen Pence four years ago, Fondacaro wrote.
Pamela Anderson has no regrets about her secret wedding to movie producer Jon Peters.\n\nThe former Playboy playmate, 52, took to her Instagram to reflect on how she feels about tying the knot to Peters, 74, earlier this month.\n\nPAMELA ANDERSON SHARES FIRST PHOTO WITH HUSBAND JON PETERS\n\n#Honeymoon You never regret saying yes, she wrote with a red rose emoji.\n\nThe black and white photo shows Anderson lying down and giving a smoldering look to the camera. The Baywatch icon did not disclose where the couple is vacationing on their honeymoon, although it appears she is somewhere warm as she shows off some skin in a revealing top.\n\nAnderson and Peters confirmed their secret wedding ceremony took place in Malibu, Calif. on Jan 20.\n\nAnderson and Peters dated over 30 years ago, and according to The Hollywood Reporter, they rekindled their relationship in recent months and kept it under wraps.\n\nPeters gushed about the former Playboy Playmate to THR, saying Anderson is the only woman he's had an interest in for nearly four decades.\n\nPAMELA ANDERSON'S SON BRANDON THOMAS LEE SAYS HE'S 'INCREDIBLY HAPPY' ABOUT WEDDING NEWS\n\nPamela has never seen her full potential as an artist. She has yet to shine in a real way. There is much more to her than meets the eye, or I wouldn't love her so much, Peters told the outlet.\n\nThe new husband continued: There are beautiful girls everywhere.

Christina Anstead is going back to her roots.\n\nThe Christina on the Coast star, who is 37, made a subtle switch on Instagram, reverting back to her maiden name Christina Haack amid her divorce from Ant Anstead.\n\nHowever, the handle for the HGTV star's account still bears the last name of her estranged second husband.\n\nChristina's personal life has undergone many changes since September, when she first announced on the social media platform that she and Anstead had made the difficult decision to end their marriage.\n\nCHRISTINA ANSTEAD REVEALS NEW MAYA ANGELOU-INSPIRED BACK TATTOO AMID SPLIT FROM HUSBAND ANT: 'STILL I RISE'\n\nEarlier this month, the Flip or Flop co-host showcased a new Maya Angelou-inspired tattoo that reads Still I Rise in black cursive down the middle of her back. She also has showed off an adorable addition to her family: a new Rottweiler puppy. Ant, meanwhile, has been outspoken about the split, recently revealing that a separation was not what he wanted.\n\nI think everybody knows this was not my decision, Ant previously told People magazine. It really hit me hard.\n\nChristina, meanwhile, has been doing great while navigating the split, so said her first ex-husband, Tarek El Moussa, this month. The exes still serve as co-hosts of their hit HGTV show Flip or Flop.\n\nIt appears Christina and Tarek have mastered co-parenting their two children -- daughter Taylor, 10, and son Brayden, 5. She and Ant also are also sharing time with their 16-month-old son Hudson. Over the weekend, Christina shared a selfie with little Hudson in what appears to be a hot tub.\n\nCHRISTINA ANSTEAD REFLECTS ON LESSONS LEARNED IN 2020, HOW SHE WAS 'UNGRATEFUL' AT TIMES: 'CAN'T DENY TRUTH'\n\nCold weather spa days are the best days, the TV personality captioned the pic.\n\nJust ahead of the new year, Christina announced she'd be taking a step back from Instagram in order to be present with her loved ones over the holidays.\n\nShe was also hit with criticism shortly before when social media trolls claimed she was an absent mother.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nWhen I get told 'you must be an absent mother because you are not with your kids' - smh (shake my head), Christina reacted at the time. Wake up people. I hardly post anymore...and I def do not want to post my kids every freaking day to make it a contest of who's a better parent. f that.\n\nChristina argued that the lack of photographic proof of her time spent with her children doesn't warrant the accusations she's receiving.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt means the opposite - I am with them - I'm present, she said. So stop parent shaming people, stop choosing sides when there is no side to choose. My point being - when you see stuff on here take it all with a grain of salt. There is a whole lot of Filters and fake smiles. I've been guilty of faking it too. We are all struggling - some of us are just better at 'masking' it.\n\nChristina and Ant began dating in 2017 and married one year later in a ceremony in Newport Beach, Calif.
Pamela Anderson has tied the knot again.\n\nThe former Baywatch star, 53, married her bodyguard Dan Hayhurst in an intimate ceremony on Christmas Eve in Canada.\n\nI'm exactly where I need to be - in the arms of a man who truly loves me, Anderson told DailyMailTV.\n\nShe revealed they fell in love during the pandemic.

It's a big property but a few people passing by could see the fairytale gown with the long Princess Diana veil dragging in the mud. Heaven, she professed.\n\nShe said of the Vancouver Island property where she's been living since 2019, The property has a special energy. It's full of deer, bears, raccoons, eagles.\n\nThe trees have known me my whole life, and to be surrounded by the nature I knew since birth on my wedding day was very powerful, Anderson described.\n\nPAMELA ANDERSON SAYS 'YOU NEVER REGRET SAYING YES' FOLLOWING SECRET WEDDING TO JON PETERS\n\nThe former Playboy star was previously married to Jon Peters for just 12 days. They wed and split in February 2020.\n\nI have been moved by the warm reception to Jon and my union. We would be very grateful for your support as we take some time apart to reevaluate what we want from life and from one another, Anderson said in a statement provided to Fox News by her rep at the time.\n\nLife is a journey and love is a process, she continued. With that universal truth in mind, we have mutually decided to put off the formalization of our marriage certificate and put our faith in the process.\n\nThank you for respecting our privacy, Anderson added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnderson was also formerly married to Tommy Lee, Kid Rock and twice to Rick Salomon.

Jana Kramer and Rachel Uchitel had a raw and emotional conversation about infidelity and what it does to relationships.\n\nThe singer spoke with Uchitel, who is widely known as one of Tiger Woods' mistresses and part of his 2009 sex scandal, on her Whine Down podcast.\n\nKramer, 37, blatantly stated before talking to Uchitel, I hate her, honestly. That's a really mean thing to say. I don't know her. She's the face of someone else I hate. That's where I feel bad, I don't know her story.\n\nShe's the face of someone I don't like. It's going to be hard for me to take the picture of who I'm picturing and just see her, she continued.\n\nTIGER WOODS' EX-MISTRESS RACHEL UCHITEL SAYS LIFE HAS BEEN 'LIVING HELL' FOR YEARS\n\nKramer's marriage to Mike Caussin was rocked by a cheating scandal in 2016 and the former NFL player went to rehab for sex addiction. The couple has since reconciled and is open about working through issues in their relationship.\n\nAfter hearing Uchitel's side of the story, Kramer apologized for passing judgment on her.\n\nI feel really bad, my direct quote was, 'I hate her,' but I don't hate you. I hate [Tiger's] affair girls. But I label everyone that cheated on someone that girl, the One Tree Hill said. I think I just have so much hate for his affair girls.\n\nIt's rude to say that I hate someone that I don't even know, Kramer continued. And that's really rude. I want to apologize because I should never have said... I don't know you. And I don't know your story. Now I'm learning your story, but I want to apologize because that's not fair of me to label you for the face of someone else... I'm sure you've gotten that judgment from a lot of people.\n\nTIGER WOODS' FORMER MISTRESS RACHEL UCHITEL BREAKS SILENCE ON INTIMATE DETAILS OF THEIR SORDID LOVE AFFAIR\n\nUchitel, 45, confessed that she's received intense backlash for the affair.\n\nI go through life with people hating me like I did something personally to them and personally hurt them, personally offended them, personally did something to them with such a vengeance, she explained. They hate me with a passion when I did nothing to them personally.\n\nUchitel reasoned, You're the first person that has cause because your husband did something similar. I get it because your husband did something and it makes sense though. I get it but I know why you have that hatred and I feel horrible. I feel horrible.\n\nThe former nightclub hostess recently participated in a new HBO documentary about Woods called Tiger, in which she speaks about her relationship with the golfer.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe explained to Extra why she's finally breaking her silence over a decade later.\n\nI have been silent for over a decade now, and I felt that it was really important to me to speak only once in my life, because I have spent all these years letting people think what they want to think and say what they want to say, Uchitel explained. I needed to take the shackles off and be able tell my story for me. I have spent years under the shame of what's been going on.
Kanye West's dream of being president of the United States soured his marriage to Kim Kardashian, according to a new report.\n\nWest, 43, stunned Americans on July 4, 2020, when he announced his bid for the presidency. Shortly after, West's public commentary and unleashing of revelations about his family on Twitter spawned numerous reports claiming the pair were on the brink of divorce.\n\nPage Six -- who rang the alarm about Kardashian readying for divorce earlier this week-- now reports it was indeed West's last-minute campaign that caused her to reflect on their future with more scrutiny.\n\nAn insider tells the outlet that Kardashian, 40, needed to end the marriage for the sake of her kids and her own sanity.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN SAYS SHE'S GETTING HER 'MIND AND BODY RIGHT' AMID KANYE WEST DIVORCE RUMORS\n\nThe Power rapper's presidential bid was simply the final straw for Kardashian, the source explained.\n\nMeanwhile, a second source said Kardashian opposed it from the start: She never came out publicly and endorsed him. Her silence on it spoke volumes.\n\nWest made headlines early on in his campaign, beginning with his first campaign rally in South Carolina in July, leaving Kardashian reportedly furious after he told a crowd the couple once considered aborting their first child, daughter North, 7.\n\nWest went on to claim he has been trying to divorce the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star since 2018 after she attended a prison reform event also attended by rapper Meek Mill. The Yeezy designer also shaded Kardashian's past Playboy spread and called the reality star's mother, Kris Jenner, Kim Jong-Un and claimed she was no longer allowed to see his children. He later issued a public apology to Kardashian.\n\nConcerns for West's mental health state grew, with the hashtag #PrayforYe trending on Twitter over the summer. It was then that Kardashian broke her silence on her husband's bipolar disorder for the first time, asking the public for compassion.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN AND KANYE WEST'S ROCKY 2020: ALL OF THE UPS AND DOWNS AHEAD OF COUPLE'S 'IMMINENT' DIVORCE\n\nThe first source said Kardashian was really supportive of West's mental health journey. But she also knows she has to do the right thing for her kids.\n\nThe outlet reported that Kardashian has since hired well-known divorce attorney Laura Wasser. On Tuesday, Kardashian declared she's taking care of herself in a social media post that vowed she was getting her mind and body right for 2021.\n\nNews that Kardashian is seriously contemplating a divorce filing came on the heels of an announcement that she had sold a 20% stake in her company to Coty for $200 million.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nKardashian has not yet filed for divorce from West, and a source relayed to People magazine on Wednesday that the mother of four is trying to stay positive for the sake of the couple's children: daughters North, 7, and Chicago, 2, and sons Saint, 5, and Psalm, who turns 2 in May.\n\nDecember was a rough month for Kim. She has been living separately from Kanye. Over the holidays, it was hard for her to stay positive, a separate insider revealed to People magazine Wednesday. She has been trying her best, though, for the kids. She stayed in Los Angeles for New Year's [Eve]. Kourtney and Khloé [Kardashian] were around to support her. She is very grateful to have her sisters to lean on.\n\nRumors have swirled that Kardashian has already begun dating other men, but a source told Page Six she's not dating anyone.\n\nShe can't go to restaurants now on dates and have paparazzi. She can't date quietly; she doesn't even understand what that would be like, the insider added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile a lot of eyes are now on Kardashian as a split is nearing, the source added there's not a war between the couple. They are also reportedly already in marriage counseling and Kardashian has not officially filed divorce papers.\n\nWest and Kardashian tied the knot in May 2014 in Italy.
Debra Messing is looking for love in 2019.\n\nThe Will & Grace star is finally ready to mingle after she failed to go on a single date last year. In fact, Messing, 50, told Ellen DeGeneres she's been finding it rather difficult to secure a date, and now the Emmy award-winning actress is pulling out all the stops in her quest for companionship.\n\nNot one. Zero, Messing told DeGeneres Thursday on Ellen when asked if she's been active in the dating scene. I have been open, no one has asked me on a date.\n\nDEBRA MESSING, JOHN CUSACK AND MORE CELEBRITIES BASH COVINGTON CATHOLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS AFTER VIRAL VIDEO\n\nMessing split with ex-husband Daniel Zelman in 2016 and she's said she's ready to get back on her horse after 16 years of marriage and three years single.\n\nWhen asked what places she frequents to look for love, Messing said she doesn't go anywhere because she hasn't been approached.\n\nNo one, 'cause no one's asking me anywhere, Messing lamented before later asking Ellen if she's a good matchmaker.\n\nDEBRA MESSING SUPPORTS ALYSSA MILANO'S DECISION TO DISTANCE HERSELF FROM WOMEN'S MARCH LEADERS\n\nI have set so many people up, Ellen replied and asked Messing what boxes she's looking for a potential partner to check.\n\nMessing explained to Ellen that she's could see herself dating someone who works in Hollywood and who is within a 10-year age range of hers, but also explained very clearly that she would prefer her next partner be sensitive towards the world.\n\nDEBRA MESSING WOULD RATHER BE STUCK IN AN ELEVATOR WITH DONALD TRUMP THAN SUSAN SARANDON\n\nReally smart, really funny, cares about the world - that third one is really tricky, explained Messing, who has been one of many entertainers on the forefront of voicing their displeasure with President Donald Trump and his administration.\n\nLast year, Messing slammed Thelma & Louise actress Susan Sarandon in a series of tweets, telling her to shut the f--- up after Sarandon told Variety in an interview that Trump has if anything, inspired more women and people of color to run for office.\n\nSTFU SUSAN, Messing tweeted on Sept. 13. Oh yes, PLEASE let's give Trump CREDIT. I mean how else are you able to walk out on the street.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Sarandon and Messing had a heated exchange about politics.\n\nAccording to People, Messing, who supported Hillary Clinton, and Sarandon, who backed Bernie Sanders, got into it in 2016 after Sarandon seemed to suggest she would vote for Trump over Clinton during an appearance on MSNBC's All In With Chris Hayes.
The Iranian regime that has repeatedly been criticized for detaining Americans and then ignoring calls for their release is now crying foul following the FBI's arrest of an anchorwoman from Iran's state-run English-language TV channel.\n\nNews of the detention of Press TV's Marzieh Hashemi, an American-born newscaster who also holds Iranian citizenship, emerged just a week after Iran revealed it has been holding Michael White, a U.S. Navy veteran and the first American to be taken into custody by the Islamic Republic during President Trump's administration.\n\nIran's hard-line Vatan-e Emrooz paper blasted the detention of Hashemi as Saudi-style behavior with a critical journalist, comparing the case to the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also told Press TV that she is a famous journalist who has done nothing but journalism, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe arrest of Ms. Hashemi is a very clear affront to freedom of expression, a political abuse of an innocent individual and I believe the United States should release her immediately without further delay, he was quoted as saying.\n\nBut Iran's calls for Hashemi's release echo the pleas they themselves have faced regarding Americans who are currently detained there, some who have been languishing in prisons for years.\n\nMICHAEL WHITE\n\nMichael White, a 46-year-old former Navy cook, is the latest American to be detained by Iran. White's family says he was taken into custody in July last year when he traveled to Iran to visit his girlfriend, whom he had met online. In a statement released for a family spokesperson, Joanne White, his mother, said she is very worried that's he's not going to make it.\n\nWhite had been undergoing cancer treatment and his mother is urging the Iranian government to release him so he can get the specialized medical care he needs. Why White was even detained by Iran in the first place, as of Thursday, remains a mystery.\n\nXIYUE WANG\n\nIn 2017, Chinese-American Princeton graduate student Xiyue Wang was sentenced to 10 years in prison for allegedly infiltrating the country while doing doctoral research on Iran's Qajar dynasty. The university says he was taken into custody a year earlier, but was not involved in any political activities or social activism; he was simply a scholar trying to gain access to materials he needed for his dissertation. Over the past several years, Princeton has been working with Wang's family in hopes of securing his release.\n\nSIAMAK AND BAQUER NAMAZI\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Iranian-American businessman Siamak Namazi and his 82-year-old father Baquer, a former UNICEF representative who served as governor of Iran's oil-rich Khuzestan province under the U.S.-backed shah, were detained by Iran. They were both, in the words of their family, convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison on charges of 'collaborating with a hostile state,' referring to the United States.\n\nSON OF AMERICAN MISSING IN IRAN SINCE 2007 MAKES PLEA FOR HIS RETURN\n\nBoth men have been held by Iran for more than 1,000 days and in an open letter written by the family last year, they said Siamak has been physically and psychologically tortured in prison and his father's health continues to decline.\n\nNIZAR ZAKKA\n\nNizar Zakka, a Lebanese-born Internet freedom activist who is a permanent resident of the U.S., also is among those held by Iran. He was detained in 2015 while attending a woman' empowerment conference he was invited to and has been sentenced to 10 years in prison on spying charges.\n\nROBERT LEVINSON\n\nOne of the most notable cases is the detention of Robert Levinson, a retired FBI agent who, if alive, remains the longest-held American hostage in history – having disappeared in Iranian territory almost 12 years ago.\n\nHe is being held against his will, with no human rights or access to his family, David Levinson, his son, told Fox News in an interview around the start of 2019. It's inconceivable that, almost 12 years later, we have no answers. The Iranian government knows what happened to my father and needs to send him now. We continue to push for more action by our government, and awareness of his case worldwide.\n\nHashemi, who was born Melanie Franklin in 1959 to a Christian family in New Orleans, was detained Sunday in St. Louis, where she had filmed a Black Lives Matter documentary after visiting relatives in the New Orleans area. She was then taken to Washington by the FBI on a material witness warrant, her elder son, Hossein Hashemi, told the Associated Press.\n\nWe still have no idea what's going on, said Hashemi, a research fellow at the University of Colorado who was interviewed by phone from Washington. He also said he and his siblings had been subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury.\n\nThe FBI has declined to comment on her case. Federal law though, according to the AP, allows judges to order witnesses to be arrested and detained if the government can prove their testimony has extraordinary value for a criminal case and that they would be a flight risk and unlikely to respond to a subpoena. The statute generally requires those witnesses to be promptly released once they are deposed.\n\nIran's Press TV said Hashemi, who converted to Islam and has worked at the state broadcaster service for 25 years, was arrested along with her son, Reza Hashemi.\n\nThe broadcaster reported that Hashemi told her daughter she was handcuffed and shackled in addition to having her hijab forcibly removed, and was photographed without her headscarf upon arrival at the prison.\n\nFAMILIES OF IRAN HOSTAGES CALL ON WORLD GOVERNMENTS TO STEP UP AND 'SEND OUR LOVED ONES HOME'\n\nThe National Iranian American Council, which describes itself as a nonprofit advocacy group, says it is concerned by reports of [Hashemi's] mistreatment and reiterates that all nations must observe international law with regard to such detentions.\n\nMs. Hashemi's status as a journalist for an Iranian outlet cannot prevent her from access to the same legal rights afforded to every U.S. person, its president, Jamal Abdi, said in a statement obtained by Fox News.\n\nNIAC has consistently condemned the Iranian government's shameful track record of politically motivated detentions - including arbitrarily arresting dual citizens, holding them on spurious charges, subjecting them to cruel conditions, and using them as bargaining chips in negotiations, he added. Such practices are inhumane, illegal, and often in the service of agendas that seek to preserve U.S.-Iran hostility. It is absolutely critical that the U.S. government not follow suit and instead observe the core values of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.\n\nHashemi studied journalism at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. During her time there, encounters with Iranian students in the wake of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution sparked Hashemi's conversion to Islam, the Associated Press says. A marriage brought her to Iran, where she learned fluent Farsi and began working for Press TV.\n\nThe English-language station focuses predominantly on international affairs through the lens of how leaders in the Islamic Republic see the world. The hashtag FreePalestine accompanies stories on the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Fierce criticism of British and American foreign policy is common.\n\nIts broadcasts have also drawn Western criticism.\n\nIn 2012, the Anti-Defamation League described the channel as one of the world's leading dispensers of conspiratorial anti-Semitism in English.\n\nThe channel was pulled from the air in Britain in 2011 after a complaint by Maziar Bahari, a Canadian-Iranian journalist for Newsweek who was imprisoned by Iran after the 2009 disputed re-election of hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became the Green Movement protests. Bahari said the channel aired an interview that had been scripted by his captors, who threatened to execute him unless he cooperated.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFor her part, Hashemi both helmed newscasts critical of the West and offered her own criticisms as well.\n\nIn 2009, she said she believed Western media exaggerated popular support in Iran for Mir Hossein Mousavi, a reformist who was later put under house arrest, where he has languished for years after challenging Ahmadinejad in 2009 and leading the Green Movement protests.\n\nFox News' Hollie McKay and the Associated Press contributed to this report.
New Year, new outlook on anniversaries!\n\nJada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith have always been candid about their unique approach to their 21-year marriage.\n\nJada Pinkett Smith Reveals the First Man She Took Home for the Holidays\n\nIn a New Year's Eve episode of Jada's popular Facebook series, Red Table Talk, she opened up to her mom, Adrienne, and 18-year-old daughter, Willow, about the Dec. 31 anniversary of her union.\n\nIt's more of a life partnership, so it's not steeped in that day, Jada said of the anniversary. We don't really celebrate that day anymore in the sense because the context of our union is totally different.\n\nShe added that the Collateral Beauty actor has a different outlook on the day itself than she does, meaning they are often apart on New Year's Eve.\n\nJada Pinkett Smith Recalls Severe Emotional Breakdown: 'I Was Completely Suicidal'\n\nUsually Will on New Year's likes to be in an adventure in the world somewhere. There's no telling where he's going to be, she explained. And I like to be inside. I don't want to be out in the world. He now has the freedom to go and have an awesome adventure of some kind.\n\nJada Pinkett Smith Recalls 'Horrendous Fight' With Her Father Prior to His Overdose\n\nThis past July, Will opened up about the nature of his marriage to his wife, saying on TIDAL's Rap Radar podcast, We refer to ourselves as life partners, where you get into that space where you realize you are literally with someone for the rest of your life. There's no deal breakers. There's nothing she could do — ever. Nothing that would break our relationship. She has my support till death and it feels so good to get to that space.
Kamala Harris' rise to political power started in California, where she served as a district attorney and attorney general for the state. And it has culminated in a 2020 presidential run.\n\nHarris, 54, has broken many barriers in her career, becoming the first African-American and woman to serve as California's attorney general. And when she joined the Senate, she became the first South Asian-American and second black woman to join. In January 2019, Harris officially announced she would run for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020.\n\nHarris graduated from Howard University, a historically black university, and received her law degree from the University of California, Hastings.\n\nGROWING NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS SUPPORTING 'GREEN NEW DEAL'\n\nShe worked as a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, California in the 1990s at a time when violent crime in Oakland was rising, according to The New York Times. She worked for the San Francisco city attorney before she was elected – twice – as the city's district attorney.\n\nShe served as the district attorney from 2004 until 2011, when she became California's attorney general. She was first elected to the Senate – where she serves on the Judiciary, Intelligence, Homeland Security and Budget Committees – in 2016.\n\nHarris said she chose her career because she wanted to be at the table where the decisions are made.\n\nRead on for a look at some of the decisions she made throughout her career.\n\nShe advocated for legalizing same-sex marriage\n\nBefore Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage, Harris was a champion for marriage equality.\n\nAs California's attorney general, Harris refused to defend Proposition 8, a constitutional amendment passed by the state's voters in 2008 which would have barred same-sex marriage.\n\nI declined to defend Proposition 8 because it violates the Constitution. The Supreme Court has described marriage as a fundamental right 14 times since 1888, she said in a statement. The time has come for this right to be afforded to every citizen.\n\nThe Supreme Court eventually ruled against Proposition 8. Harris would officiate the wedding of Kris Perry and Sandy Stier, the first same-sex marriage in California.\n\nShe went after website Backpage.com\n\nAs attorney general, Harris was a fierce opponent of the advertising website Backpage, which has been widely accused of knowingly aiding human traffickers. It was seized by the FBI in April 2018.\n\nShe filed multiple charges against the site's CEO and shareholders, including money laundering, pimping and conspiracy to commit pimping.\n\nBy creating an online brothel – a hotbed of illicit and exploitative activity – Carl Ferrer, Michael Lacey and James Larkin preyed on vulnerable victims, including children, and profited from their exploitation, Harris said in 2016. My office will not turn a blind eye to this criminal behavior simply because the defendants are exploiting and pimping victims on the Internet rather than on a street corner.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS DEFENDS RASHIDA TLAIB'S CALL FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT\n\nBackpage let users create posts to sell items, seek a roommate, participate in forums, list upcoming events or post job openings. But the site also had listings for adult escorts and other sexual services, and authorities said advertising related to those services has been extremely lucrative.\n\nFerrer, the CEO, pleaded guilty last year to money laundering and conspiracy charges. The company pleaded guilty to human trafficking.\n\nShe's against the death penalty – sort of\n\nMy career as a prosecutor was marked by fierce opposition to the death penalty while still upholding the law and a commitment to fixing a broken criminal justice system, Harris said in a 2018 Facebook post.\n\nIn 2004, as San Francisco's district attorney, Harris declined to pursue the death penalty against David Hill, a gang member, who fatally shot a police officer. He was sentenced to life without parole in 2007.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS' DOJ RECEIVED MISCONDUCT CLAIM INVOLVING AIDE MONTHS BEFORE SHE LEFT\n\nShe again declined to seek the death penalty for Edwin Ramos, who murdered three people in 2009. He, too, was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nShe reportedly campaigned for district attorney by pledging not to advocate for capital punishment which helped solidify her win, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nBut critics have noted that despite her refusal to seek the death penalty in multiple cases, Harris has defended capital punishment in court. In 2014, as California's attorney general, Harris asked an appeals court to reverse an earlier decision declaring California's death penalty unconstitutional, calling the ruling fundamentally misguided.\n\nCalifornia provides capital defendants with substantial opportunities to challenge their convictions – and resources for doing so – for the precise purpose of ensuring that the death penalty will not be 'arbitrarily' imposed, she wrote.\n\nShe went after for-profit Corinthian Colleges\n\nHarris won a $1.1 billion judgment against the controversial for-profit Corinthian Colleges in 2016. Harris accused the company, which shuttered in 2015, of predatory advertising practices and having profited off the backs of poor people.\n\nShe launched San Francisco's program to reduce recidivism\n\nOn her Senate website, Harris lists the program she launched to reduce recidivism rates for non-violent drug offenders as one of her achievements as San Francisco's district attorney.\n\nCalled Back on Track, the 2005 program aided the low-level drug offenders with education and job training to help them once they left jail, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS' CHIEF OF STAFF LEAVING TO JOIN HER PAC, RAISING SPECULATION OF 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RUN\n\nThe program was criticized, however, after it was revealed that it included undocumented immigrants, training them for jobs they couldn't legally get. Harris later called the acceptance of undocumented immigrants into the program a flaw in the design and asked for it to be fixed, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nCritics accused her of protecting Catholic clergy who abused children\n\nMatt Smith, a writer for SF Weekly, derided Harris for refusing to turn over files related to clergy abuse within the San Francisco Archdiocese in 2010. At the time, Harris was campaigning to become attorney general.\n\nThe records at issue may contain answers to a question of great public concern that has consumed international headlines during recent weeks: What did senior Catholic officials know, and what did they do behind the scenes, while priests accused of molesting children were shielded from punishment? Smith wrote.\n\nHe noted while it's important for district attorneys to not release information that could undermine a case or draw unwanted attention to victims, Harris' office seems to be going beyond these important principles to a blanket policy of secrecy.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS KEEPS SEAT ON SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, BOOSTING POTENTIAL 2020 BID\n\nIn a statement at the time, Harris' office said: District Attorney Harris focuses her efforts on putting child molesters in prison. We're not interested in selling out our victims to look good in the paper.\n\nShe was once accused of violating defendants' rights\n\nA judge accused Harris, then a district attorney, of having violated defendants' rights by refusing to disclose problems regarding a police drug lab technician. In all, more than 600 cases were ultimately dismissed because of Deborah Madden, who was accused of stealing some of the cocaine she was supposed to analyze.\n\nHarris' office had a duty to implement some type of procedure to secure and produce information relevant to Madden's criminal history, the judge ruled. By not disclosing information about Madden, Harris' office was complicit in the violation of the defendants' constitutional rights, the judge said.\n\nShe negotiated a massive mortgage settlement during the housing crisis\n\nAs California's attorney general, Harris secured a massive settlement with big banks for her state in 2012. Out of the $25 billion deal she helped negotiate with other state attorney generals, California homeowners received nearly $20 billion in mortgage relief and assistance for people who had their homes foreclosed from Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase, according to her office.\n\nThe attorney generals accused the banks of using illegal practices to foreclose on homes nationwide.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS' NEW BOOK PUBLISHED WITH PRAISE FOR 'LEADERSHIP' OF NOW-DISGRACED FORMER AIDE\n\nNotably, Harris declined to charge Steven Mnuchin, now President Trump's treasury secretary, for allegedly violating state foreclosure laws when he ran OneWest bank. Under his leadership, the bank foreclosed on more than 36,000 homes, according to The Hill.\n\nHarris said her office followed the facts and the evidence and pursued it just like any other case.\n\nShe advocated for a law barring advertisements with photos of handguns\n\nAs attorney general, Harris defended an archaic law which banned firearms dealers from displaying advertisements visible from outside the stores that included a photo of a handgun. Notably, the law allowed for pictures of rifles to be visible.\n\nThose people, who otherwise might not enter the store, might respond on impulse to an advertisement in the store by entering and purchasing a handgun – indeed, that is the self-evident purpose of that kind of advertising, to draw people in and induce them to purchase a handgun, Harris argued.\n\nThe Supreme Court has long held that the government may restrict advertising in order to dampen demand, and thereby advance a substantial government interest, she said.\n\nAttorney Bradley Benbrook, who filed the lawsuit challenging the law, said Harris was suggesting the right to free speech is OK except when it's about guns because guns are bad.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA federal judge struck down the law last year, saying it violated gun store owners' First Amendment rights.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
President Bush, reacting to a new Massachusetts state court ruling, says a constitutional amendment will be necessary to ban gay marriages (search) if judges persist in approving them.\n\nIn a written statement late Wednesday, Bush termed deeply troubling the decision that same-sex couples in Massachusetts have a right to marry — not just form civil unions — and reiterated a position staked out in his State of the Union (search) speech last month.\n\nMarriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman, he said in the statement. If activist judges insist on redefining marriage by court order, the only alternative will be the constitutional process. We must do what is legally necessary to defend the sanctity of marriage.\n\nThe Massachusetts Supreme Court's (search) advisory opinion that gays are entitled to nothing less than marriage set the stage for the nation's fi1rst legally sanctioned same-sex weddings by the spring.\n\nThe issue has the potential to become a hot factor in the presidential campaign.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. John Kerry, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, said in his own statement: I believe and have fought for the principle that we should protect the fundamental rights of gay and lesbian couples — from inheritance to health benefits. I believe the right answer is civil unions. I oppose gay marriage and disagree with the Massachusetts Court's decision.\n\nRetired Gen. Wesley Clark, another Democratic presidential candidate, said: I leave that to the states and the courts — whether you call it a marriage or not, I leave up to the states and churches and synagogues and mosques.\n\nBush's statement was similar to his remarks in his Jan. 20 State of the Union address in which he said that if judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process.\n\nConservative activists and religious groups, banding together under the name the Arlington Group, gathered in Washington this week to plot strategy. Some participants said they left with a White House commitment to fight for a constitutional amendment.\n\nWe were given direct assurances from the very top, said Kelly Shackelford, president of the Texas-based Free Market Foundation. There's no doubt. It's our understanding that the president is waiting for a day when there is not a massive news story to do it himself.\n\nAnother group, the Alliance Defense Fund based in Scottsdale, Ariz., sent out an e-mail asserting, This morning, President Bush agreed to join the effort to push for the passage of this amendment.\n\nTony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a leading group of social conservatives, said, I would not be surprised at all to see the president come out very soon calling on Congress to act. He said he could not speak for Bush but that it appears that things are falling in line for that to happen.\n\nGrover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform and a conservative who is close to the White House, said a constitutional amendment is what you'd expect the president to do. ... They are forcing the president's hand — if you say only an amendment can fix this, guess what, you're going to get an amendment.\n\nWhite House press secretary Scott McClellan said the administration would review the Massachusetts' opinion.\n\nRecalling Bush's remarks in his State of the Union speech, McClellan said, What he said at that time, that if judges continue to force their arbitrary will upon the people, that the only alternative to the people would be a constitutional process. And that remains his view.
Russell Brand refuses to change his daughters' diapers, but swears he looks after their wellbeing in other ways.\n\nThe controversial British comedian says that his wife, Laura Gallacher, won't leave him with their girls, Mabel, 2, and Peggy, six months, for a 24-hour period because of his admitted ineptitude at caring for infants.\n\nLaura does all of it, he confessed to The Sunday Times (via The Daily Mail). It turns out that she is extremely well-versed in the nuances and complexities of child-rearing. Me, I am dedicated to it, devoted to it, but I am still surprised when it's like, 'Oh my God this is f—king really hard and it's so exhausting.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe wouldn't go away for 24 hours, Laura. She respects and cares for their safety too much, Brand, 43, added. Yes, I'm very, very focused on the mystical connotations of Mabel's beauty and grace. Not so good on the nappies and making sure that they eat food.\n\nHe explained, When I looked after Mabel on her own, she dropped two social classes in an hour. In no time at all we're in a coffee shop, she's just got a nappy on and she's covered in stuff because I'm not willing to fight any of the battles. Laura's able to sustain and maintain domesticity in a way that's astonishing. I didn't have much experience of how to organize domesticity. I do whatever I'm told.\n\nRUSSELL BRAND CANCELS STANDUP TOUR AFTER HIS MOTHER SUFFERS LIFE-THREATENING INJURIES IN CAR CRASH\n\nBut I'm sensitive and awake and aware, he insists, so I have to dial a lot s—t down to go through normal life.\n\nThe Get Him to the Greek star also reflected on his past sex addiction — reportedly bedding five women in one day at its height — in light of the #MeToo movement and says he wouldn't change a thing.\n\nNo [I don't regret my past], he said. I just feel [the #MeToo movement] is a really positive change. It's a sign of real awakening.\n\nAs for his own sexual proclivities, he swears he's a changed man and has no interest in extracurricular affairs outside of his marriage to Gallacher, 31.\n\nWhen I think, 'Oh, that person is attractive,' the next thought is, 'Yes, but if you ever did anything, you realize it would destroy your whole life.' There's that voice in my head now.
Miranda Lambert stunned fans last year when she announced her marriage to New York Police Department officer Brendan McLoughlin just months after another woman gave birth to his child. Now, a pal close to the country crooner's husband has revealed to Fox News that McLoughlin's sudden marriage has not affected the close bond he has with his family and friends.\n\n[Brendan] is still very much a part of his family, the close friend told Fox News. Everyone is super supportive of his marriage to Miranda.\n\nOn Jan. 26, Lambert and McLoughlin celebrated their one-year marriage anniversary. On Valentine's Day 2019, Lambert announced the couple's union and thanked McLoughlin, a Staten Island, N.Y. native, for loving me for me.\n\nMIRANDA LAMBERT, BRENDAN MCLOUGHLIN ENJOY ROMANTIC MAUI VACATION\n\nMcLoughlin has since taken an authorized leave of absence from the NYPD and has been spotted with his country star wife on the road. McLoughlin's pal told Fox News that his family back home in New York have also embraced the birth of his first child, a baby boy with a woman named Kaihla Rettinger.\n\nMIRANDA LAMBERT REVEALS 'DEAL-BREAKER' THAT WOULD HAVE LED TO SPLIT FROM BRENDAN MCLOUGHLIN\n\nI've seen him with the baby a lot, the friend said, adding that McLoughlin was present for his son's first birthday party in November. He's an amazing father.\n\nMcLoughlin's friend said that currently, the NYPD officer is just loving life with his famous wife.\n\nHe, of course, loves living with Miranda, the source added.\n\nLambert and McLoughlin reportedly purchased a multimillion-dollar apartment in New York City after they tied the knot. They also live part-time in Lambert's Tennessee home.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLess than two weeks ago, the Little Red Wagon singer admitted in an interview she had a really hard time after her divorce from Blake Shelton.\n\nMcLoughlin was previously engaged to soccer star Jackie Bruno.
Running from one year into the next may not be most people's idea of holiday revelry, but since 1979 doing so has become an annual tradition for tens of thousands in New York City. Until now.\n\nLike so many other longstanding events, the Midnight Run in Central Park from 2020 to 2021 was scuttled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But I nevertheless have terrific New Year's Eve memories of racing with a cast of colorful (some costumed) characters in the shadow of the city's skyscrapers and under the glow of festive fireworks.\n\nAs my friend and fellow runner Lynne recently told me: I never ran in the Olympics, but at midnight in Central Park I got a sense of what it must feel like.\n\nFLORIDA ATHLETE BECOMES FIRST PERSON WITH DOWN SYNDROME TO FINISH IRONMAN TRIATHLON\n\nOrganized by the New York Road Runners Club, the four-mile race winds its way through the famed metropolitan oasis. Sparkling cider is offered at the water stops, though in the early years champagne was available.\n\nBut of all those cold, late-night runs, one stands out more than the rest because of a man I met at two miles into the run.\n\nLarry was older than me, his bearded face weathered and a bit worn, but his pace was steady and comfortable.\n\nAny resolutions for the new year? I asked him as we matched stride for stride on Central Park's inner loop.\n\nJust hoping this year is better than the last, he said matter-of-factly.\n\nTaking the bait, I responded. What happened last year?\n\nWife said I was running too much, ignoring the family, Larry said. I was lacing up my shoes one day for a workout, and she said, 'If you walk out that door, when you come back, we won't be here.'\n\nSo, what did you do? I asked.\n\nI went for my run — and when I came back, sure enough, she was gone, Larry said.\n\nLarry went on to tell me how he sensed the marriage was a mistake from Day One.\n\nI remember standing at the front of the church and watching her walk up the aisle, he said. I had a bad feeling about it.\n\nI never got to ask why he felt such dread, but one can imagine. Too many people are more in love with being in love than truly loving their significant other. Romance may make the world go around, but it's also a daily decision and not just a euphoric elixir rush of dopamine, adrenaline, vasopressin and oxytocin.\n\nLarry said the biggest lies are the ones we tell ourselves. We ignore obvious signs and problems, hoping for better days instead of taking action to make changes.\n\nMy old pastor and friend Dr. Jim Singleton once told a story about an old dog moaning and groaning on the wooden floor of a hardware store. When a customer expressed concern, the proprietor told him the dog was sitting on a nail.\n\nWhy doesn't he move? the shopper inquired.\n\nI guess it doesn't hurt him enough to get up, the owner replied.\n\nWe're too often like that dog — lamenting a lot but lazily going along with the status quo. Taking action is what separates success from failure. Because even if you don't entirely solve the problem you set out to tackle, the mere pursuit and effort will change you for the better.\n\nIn reality, Larry's running didn't cause his divorce. It only magnified underlying and unresolved problems. Any number of things could have helped him, from premarital counseling to a heart-to-heart conversation with a trusted friend. He simply ignored all the warning signs.\n\nLarry isn't the only one ignoring or running from his problems. America is full of people doing the same thing. Whether wallowing in unfulfilled relationships, going to jobs we don't like, or spending money we don't have to impress people who don't care about us, the human condition bends towards apathy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAfter one of the most difficult years in memory, of being locked down both literally and figuratively, I think action needs to be the operative word of 2021.\n\nIt's time to stop talking and start doing. Don't run from your problems. Face them head-on.\n\nStruggling in your marriage? Ask for help. Pastors and counselors are a great place to start.\n\nUnhappy in your job? Do something small every day to work towards something better.\n\nA dream written down with a date becomes a goal, says film producer Greg Reid. A goal broken down into steps becomes a plan. A plan backed by action makes your dreams come true.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI lost sight of Larry just before the finish line, but often think of him each New Year's Eve, including this one. I'd like to think he made changes in his life. His struggles have helped me with mine, and I hope they might also help you tackle yours as we head into 2021.\n\nAnd now that we've entered 2021 after COVID-19 tragically claimed the lives of over 346,000 Americans in 2020, I think we can all agree with Larry's wish: Just hoping this year is better than the last.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM PAUL BATURA
Steve Hilton offered strong praise for President Trump Sunday and took aim at his Republican critics after Iran's apparent stand-down in the latest confrontation between Washington and Tehran.\n\nI don't think there has been proper recognition of the substance of what this president is doing. It's completely different than what we've seen before. It doesn't fit into the establishment traditional ideological boxes, Hilton said Sunday on The Next Revolution.\n\nThat's why they waste our time with pointless political games with impeachment, Hilton continued. We saw the new approach clearly with Iran. The Democrats, never-Trumpers and their lackeys branded him a warmonger. But his strategy has been consistent with day one. He's anti-war, but he's also anti-weak. He doesn't want to invade deserts of sand…but he doesn't want to put his head in the sand like the isolation nuts either.\n\nANTI TRUMP REPUBLICANS LAUNCH PAC TO DEFEAT HIM\n\nRattling off a series of accomplishments by the Trump administration, Hilton devoted much of his monologue to what he called the Trump revolution and fired back at establishment Republicans who criticize the president.\n\nThis is the Trump revolution, Hilton said. Pragmatic. Non-ideological. He approaches issues as a businessman. It's a revolution in ideas and it goes way beyond foreign policy. \n\nHilton credited Trump for combining the best of traditional conservative ideas with positive populism, highlighting his tax cuts, criminal justice reform, job creation, low unemployment rates, and the confirmation of several conservative judges.\n\nHow are the establishment Republicans reacting? he asked, pointing to a recent New York Times op-ed penned by a group of prominent anti-Trump Republicans that announced the launch of a new super PAC aimed at preventing the GOP incumbent's 2020 re-election. The article, published in December, is titled We are Republicans and we want Trump defeated.\n\nAs Americans, we need to stem the damage he and his followers are doing to the rule of law, the Constitution and American character, the article reads.\n\nWhat? Trump's damage? Hilton fired back. Who backed the human and economic catastrophe of the Iraq war? Who brought in the disastrous 1986 immigration reform creating the broken system Trump is trying to fix? Who let China into the World Trade Organization devastating American manufacturing to the point where we literally can't even print bibles in America? Who pushed ruling class trade globalism that spawned the disastrous NAFTA putting so many Americans out of work in the heartland? And who assaulted the American family with policies that collapsed marriage rates and family stability?\n\nNo, Not the 'evil Trump,' Hilton continued. It was you, the Republican establishment who did this to America. These never Trumpers are apologists for an elitist ideology that is anti-worker, anti-family and anti-community.\n\nThey can write whatever pompous self-righteous nonsense they want in the New York Times. The establishment Republican party is not coming back. It is dead, Hilton concluded, ...killed by their policy failure and Donald Trump's policy success.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAfter Trump, it will be a different Republican party...and for American workers, families, and communities, that is fantastic news.
Elizabeth Smart has slowly begun to open up to her children about her abduction as a teenager and being held in captivity for several months, she said in a recent interview.\n\nSmart, 33, an author, podcast host and advocate for kidnapped children and sexual assault victims, told E! News that she has started to open up to her oldest child, Chloe, 5, who has asked questions about her mother's ordeal.\n\nEven now, she has begun to sort of ask questions, Smart said. Occasionally, I'm doing a presentation or I'm on a Zoom call, and she doesn't understand. So she asked me, 'Why?' And as her questions come up, that is how I gauge how much to tell my daughter.\n\nSmart garnered worldwide headlines when she was kidnapped at knifepoint from her Utah home in 2002. She was 14 years old at the time and was held captive for nine months by handyman and street pastor Brian David Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee.\n\nMitchell forced Smart into a polygamous marriage and raped her almost daily. She was found while walking with Barzee and Mitchell on a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy.\n\nHe is serving a life sentence and Barzee was released from prison in 2018 despite objections from Smart.\n\nSmart is now married and has two other children, 3-year-old James and 2-year-old Olivia. Her experience has made her a different kind of parent than she otherwise may have been, she said.\n\nI'm probably more into helicopter parents than I would have imagined, she told the entertainment news outlet. And it also makes me think that I'll never regret checking on my children or spending that extra time to look after them or watch them. I'll never regret it. I might regret not spending time with them or not looking after them for that moment. So, I think it's probably made me a more conscious parent.\n\nLast year, Smart revealed that she never had a 'tell all' with her parents about the abuse she suffered.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe truth is I never sat them all down and had a 'tell all' experience with them, Smart wrote of her father Ed Smart and mother Lois in a November 2020 Instagram post. I was brought to an advocacy center, where I had to disclose much of what happened to two professionals and they, in turn, relayed much of what happened to my parents. But I don't think my parents ever heard in detail what happened from my own lips until my court appearance almost a decade later.
In the wake of powerful tornadoes devastating central Tennessee, country stars who either live in the state or simply wanted to express support to its shaken residents took to social media to share their prayers, condolences, and, in some cases, to reveal that they and their families were OK.\n\nA powerful storm system produced at least two tornadoes that struck central Tennessee early on Tuesday morning, including one that caused significant damage near downtown Nashville and left several people dead.\n\nMIRANDA LAMBERT IS 'MUCH HAPPIER, LIGHTER' IN MARRIAGE TO BRENDAN MCLOUGHLIN, SOURCE SAYS\n\nThe tornado near downtown Nashville lit up the night sky with flashes of light as transformers blew and the storm reportedly stayed on the ground into Hermitage, about 10 miles east of the city.\n\nCarrie Underwood, who calls Nashville home, was out of town when the tornadoes touched down but appeared on the TODAY show Tuesday to reveal that her husband and kids were unharmed thanks to a safe room they have in their home.\n\nDolly Parton, who also lives in Nashville, posted a video message revealing that she's OK and telling those not as fortunate that she's with them.\n\nRUSSELL DICKERSON ON HIS NEW SONG 'LOVE YOU LIKE I USED TO,' THE PRESSURE OF CREATING HITS: I'M 'HERE TO STAY'\n\nWe had a lot of damage out in our area.

Kristen Bell wants her fans to know that her marriage to Dax Shepard isn't all rainbows and butterflies.\n\nThe Frozen actress appeared on Tuesday's episode of the Life Is Short with Justin Long podcast, where she revealed a blowout fight between she and Shepard that resulted in them not speaking to each other for three days.\n\nBell explained to Long that the couple have an agreement to be open and honest with their fans about their relationship. She then admitted that the two do fight, we do go to therapy, we dislike each other a lot sometimes, according to People.\n\nDAX SHEPARD, KRISTEN BELL TEAR UP IN ROMANTIC EXCHANGE ON 'ELLEN' FOR HIS BIRTHDAY\n\nA particular moment of distaste for her husband occurred recently over a dispute about chores, she explained.\n\nWe had this pretty incredible fight recently. Incredible. I mean like top of the lungs screaming, Bell said (via People).\n\nBell explained she left a note for Shepard asking him to fold a couple of towels from their dyer and one other thing. Later on, Shepard complained that the note left him feeling really controlled.\n\nKRISTEN BELL, DAX SHEPARD BOTH FORGOT THEIR 5TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY: 'THE DATES BECOME IRRELEVANT'\n\nBell said she responded in a calm manner, but their argument quickly escalated into a full-blown screaming match.\n\nSomehow, then we both blacked out and got into a fight and I don't actually remember what happened but what transpired was a lot of volume, a lot of harsh words being thrown around, and it was an angry, angry fight about how nobody does anything for anybody else, Bell said, according the magazine.\n\nShe continued: I grabbed my pillow and stomped down the hall and I sleep in the front room and I'm crying. We don't talk for three days.\n\n'BLESS THIS MESS' STAR DAX SHEPARD RATES HIMSELF A 'CALIFORNIA 10' ON THE ALL-AMERICAN HANDYMAN SCALE\n\nLuckily for Bell, the two made up after she video-chatted her husband and showed him a dog while inside of a dog cafe. The rescue dog named Frank ended up becoming their own.\n\nThis is so much better than an apology. So I bring the dog home, it's great, Bell explained, noting however that Shepard is allergic to dogs.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe said the couple's chores around the house have become even less stressful thanks to their explosive argument.\n\nEvery single thing that I have needed done or thought, 'I'd want help with this,' since that fight, he has been ahead of. I couldn't complain about him if I tried right now.
Brittany Aldean is gearing up for swimsuit season.\n\nThe wife of country star Jason Aldean is unveiling a 17-pound weight loss since the birth of her second child, Fox News learned.\n\nThe South Beach Diet ambassador welcomed a daughter named Navy Rome Williams on Feb. 4, 2019. Navy makes six at the Aldean household, which also includes their son Memphis, as well as Jason's daughters Kendyl and Keeley from a previous marriage.\n\nI gained 40 pounds with both of my children and it took me a lot longer to start feeling myself after my second [child], Brittany Aldean, 30, told Fox News.

R. Kelly broke his silence when he shared one of his hit songs while incarcerated on his birthday.\n\nThe R&B recording artist is in jail in Chicago awaiting trial on sex crime charges involving women and underage girls.

A Japanese legislator is drawing criticism for his comment that a nation would collapse if everyone became LGBT.\n\nRemarks by Katsuei Hirasawa, a veteran lawmaker of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, were carried on Nippon News Network's national broadcast Friday. Outrage has been popping up on social media.\n\nHirasawa told a crowd in Yamanashi Prefecture in central Japan on Thursday: Criticizing LGBT would create problems, but if everyone became like them then a nation would collapse.\n\nHe also said he didn't understand moves in Tokyo's Shibuya Ward and other local areas to recognize same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriages are not recognized in Japan nationally.\n\nPoliticians have been struggling to deal with Japan's low birth rate without success, mostly blamed on a lack of child care and help for working women.

A progressive school in the nation's capital said its students will not be playing sports at the school where Second Lady Karen Pence teaches part-time because of safety concerns.\n\nJessica Donovan, headmaster of Sheridan School, a K-8 institution located in northwest D.C. that has a tuition of more than $36,000 a year, sent a letter to parents saying Immanuel Christian School's policies were an obvious challenge given the school's fundamental belief in diversity and inclusion.\n\nPENCE TELLS MEDIA 'ATTACKS ON CHRISTIAN EDUCATION MUST END'\n\nThe initial plan was to make the kids go to the school during away games wearing rainbow socks or warm-up jerseys as a show of LGBTQ support. But instead, Donovan banned the students from playing sports at the Virginia elementary school because some expressed they feel unsafe in such an environment.\n\nAs we talked more, we understood that some students did not feel safe entering a school that bans LGBTQ parents, students or even families that support LGBTQ rights, she wrote.\n\nSheridan is the latest group to target the school after Pence took a part-time job teaching art to students. The NOH8 Campaign, the Human Rights Campaign, The Trevor Project, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, and several others attacked her and the school, which says it holds to traditional Christian values when it comes to marriage and other beliefs.\n\nNeither Donovan nor the Sheridan school immediately returns calls from Fox News seeking comment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe school requires employees to pledge they believe marriage is monogamous and heterosexual and they won't engage in homosexual or lesbian sexual activity or adopt or promote transgender identity. The school can deny admission or remove a student whose behavior is in opposition to the biblical lifestyle the school teaches.\n\nThe hashtag #exposeChristianschools blew up on Twitter amid the outrage.\n\nVice President Mike Pence defended his wife, saying the attacks on Christian education must end.\n\nCUOMO BRUSH OFF CRITICISM OF NEW YORK ABORTION LAW: 'I'M NOT HERE TO LEGISLATE RELIGION'\n\nDonovan explained the administrators at Sheridan work to separate the ideals of Christianity with the policies of this particular school, as we play many Christian schools that support LGBTQ rights.\n\nThe school will still play against the Virginia Christian school for home games but will wear rainbow socks to express their support for LGBTQ rights.
The black dress that a distraught Marilyn Monroe wore to a 1954 press conference announcing her separation from baseball legend Joe DiMaggio less than a year after she married him is going up for auction.\n\nThe simple wool dress with a zippered turtleneck front will be up for bidding starting on March 30, KruseGWS Auctions announced Wednesday.\n\nThe auction house expects the dress will fetch between $100,000 and $150,000. The seller's name is not being made public.\n\nMonroe was wearing it on Oct. 6, 1954, when she stepped out into the Beverly Hills sunlight to meet a mob of cameras and shouting reporters and announced the split in her marriage with the New York Yankees star that united sports and Hollywood and brought frenzied press coverage.\n\nMARILYN MONROE FILMED LOST NUDE SCENE TO PLEASE AUDIENCES, WAS 'FURIOUS' ON HER LAST DAY ALIVE, BOOK CLAIMS\n\nYou can certainly see the anguish and despair on Marilyn's face when she spoke, said Brigitte Kruse, founder of GWS Auctions. That moment changed Hollywood history forever.\n\nMonroe barely spoke at the auction, appearing to be on the verge of tears and nodding to answer one question while her attorney Jerry Giesler explained the two were splitting because of conflicting careers.\n\nMARILYN MONROE GAVE TEEN 'GROUPIES' COMPLETE ACCESS TO HER LIFE, DOC REVEALS: 'SHE ALWAYS MADE HERSELF AVAILABLE'\n\nMonroe and DiMaggio married in January 1954. She cited mental cruelty as the reason for the divorce, which became final the following year.\n\nIn 2014, a love letter DiMaggio wrote to Monroe after the news conference sold for $78,125 at auction.\n\nMonroe had previously been married to James Dougherty and would also marry and divorce playwright Arthur Miller before her death in 1962 at age 36.
A bitter feud has erupted between an Arizona woman's family and the neighborhood group refusing to allow the woman to be buried in a historic cemetery, Tucson News Now reports.\n\nThe family of Rosa Figueroa, who passed away on Dec. 15 at the age of 98, has petitioned twice to allow her to be laid to rest at the Fort Lowell Cemetery in Tucson, Ariz. Each time, the Old Fort Lowell Neighborhood Association, which owns the land, has reportedly denied the request, claiming that Figueroa does not meet the requirements to be buried in the cemetery. The space is restricted only to direct descendants of the town's original settlers, Los Fuertenos, or The People of the Fort.\n\nFigueroa's family, however, disagrees — and claims that she should be buried there because it is where her grandmother, mother, sisters and other relatives were laid to rest.\n\nShe was born and raised here, she did her first baptismal here. She went through the elementary school here, we have photos to prove that in front of the Old Fort Lowell structures, Bennett Rios, Figueroa's great nephew, told Tucson News Now. So, we feel she is as much a descendant as anyone else plotted in the graveside here.\n\nThe Fort Lowell cemetery dates back further than the 1800s, according to their website, and serves as the final resting place for those who cultivated the historic land. It was first built as an Army post in 1873, but was abandoned less than 20 years later. Mexican farmers and ranchers — later dubbed as Los Fuertenos — then settled in the area and continued their agriculture practices using irrigation systems built by Mormons. The neighborhood group claims the cemetery is the resting place to only those who descended from the original families — going by the name Díaz, Lujan, Ochoa, Jacobo, Pérez, Martínez, Casteldeoro, Domingo, Villa, Romero, Navarro, Montano, Bennett, Mulé and García.\n\nWhen the committee denied the Figueroa family's first burial request, they contacted local news outlets in an attempt to get answers as to why their loved one was being barred from the historic land. They even escorted reporters to the gravesite, which led to a tense confrontation between the family and the Old Lowell Neighborhood Association, whose president ordered the group to leave because they were trespassing on private property.\n\nThis woman is going on three weeks since she passed. She's sitting in a morgue off of Grant, for godsakes, and she needs to be laid to rest, Bennett Rios said at the time.\n\nFollowing that altercation, the committee agreed to review again the family's photos and Census records, along with birth, baptism and marriage certificates. The answer came yesterday, Jan. 5, and they refused yet again on the basis that Figueroa did not meet criteria for interment.\n\nHer family now says they will continue to fight for what they believe is a proper burial for their loved one, and are reportedly strongly considering legal action against the neighborhood group.
Whenever liberals see former President Donald J. Trump strolling through Palm Beach, they should disturb his peace just long enough to yell two words at him:\n\nThank you!\n\nWhile they never will admit it, the now-former president secured numerous policy objectives that leftists advocate. However, Trump answered liberal prayers through conservative means. This, of course, makes him worse than Hitler, as Refuse Fascism organizer Sunsara Taylor told Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson.\n\nSo, which leftist bullseyes did Trump hit with rightist bullets?\n\nBIDEN CREDITS TRUMP ON VACCINE EFFORT BEFORE ADDING PROGRAM WAS IN 'WORSE SHAPE' THAN EXPECTED\n\n•Cut CO2! Reducing perfectly natural carbon dioxide (or carbon pollution as Obama smeared it) approximates Holy Communion in the left's Church of Climate Change. The left should be thrilled that CO2 emissions fell 2.9 percent between 2018 and 2019.\n\nWhy?\n\nFracking!\n\nYes, center-left boys and girls, that dirty, nasty, evil fracking that you hate more than steamed spinach yields abundant natural gas.\n\nAs skyscrapers, power plants, and buses switch to gas, they respectively yield 32 percent less CO2 than with heating oil, 50 percent less versus coal, and 88 percent less beside diesel. This helped push energy-related U.S. CO2 output into a post-1985 pit.\n\n•Stop income inequality! For years, the left screamed for an end to American paychecks in different amounts. If only we all earned the same, they dreamed.\n\nUnder the income-inequality-hating Obama-Biden administration, the relevant Gini Coefficient actually increased from 0.466 in 2008 to 0.481 in 2016 — 3.218 percent more unfairness.\n\nUnder the left's despised Donald Trump, Gini advanced from 0.481 in 2016 to 0.489 in 2017. But then Gini fell two consecutive years, to 0.486 in 2018 and 0.484 in 2019 — 1.033 percent less unfairness.\n\nCredit Trumponomics. Tax reductions, regulatory relief, and a pro-business tone ignited robust economic growth, buoyed the modest, and never bashed the moneyed. A rising floor, not a falling ceiling, squeezed Gini the right way.\n\n•Fight for 15! The left loves the $15 minimum wage so much that it wants to impose it nationwide — even on employers who cling by their cuticles amid lockdowns and layoffs.\n\nRegardless, Trump helped American workers enjoy $15-per-hour wages voluntarily.\n\nUnder the Trump/GOP Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), numerous employers shared their tax savings with employees. Americans for Tax Reform reports that at least 45 employers hiked their minimum wages to $15 per hour, including major job creators such as Charter Communications, JP Morgan Chase, and Met Life. Cigna and at least two other enterprises hiked hourly wages to $16 — all without government mandates.\n\n•War on Poverty! President Lyndon Baines Johnson launched the War on Poverty in 1964. SNAP, TANF, VISTA, and other tax-fueled acronyms became costly beads on the left's collective social-spending rosary.\n\nFive decades and some $16 trillion in federal outlays later, Manhattan Institute scholar Brian Riedl calculates, Trumponomics chopped the poverty rate from 11.8 percent in 2018 to 10.5 percent in 2019 — its nadir since federal estimates began in 1959, five years before the War on Poverty.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nTrump's policies graduated 4.2 million from poverty and cut Obama-Biden's 22 percent black poverty rate in 2016 to 18.8 percent in 2019 — a record low and its first-ever reading below 20 percent.\n\n•Urban renewal! Since the 1960s, liberals have pushed to revitalize low-income, minority, inner-city communities. TCJA's incentives (e.g. capital gains tax: 0 percent) have lured $75 billion in private investment and created some 500,000 new jobs in 8,764 Opportunity Zones in such neighborhoods.\n\n•End mass incarceration! Black Lives Matter, among other Leftist groups, insisted on the release of thousands of largely Black non-violent offenders vacuumed into federal prisons during the War on Drugs. Obama-Biden snored.\n\nPresident Trump signed the First Step Act criminal-reform bill, which freed some 3,100 such federal prisoners in fiscal year 2019. In FY 2021, expect another 8,700 similar returns to normal.\n\n•More school spending! Leftists cheer for higher educational outlays as predictably as roosters crow at dawn.\n\nPresident Trump reauthorized the Washington, D.C. School Voucher Program (which Obama-Biden repeatedly tried to kill), boosted it with $85 million, and established steady funds for Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n\n•Slash drug prices! Cheaper pharmaceuticals are a leftist perennial. President Trump too often slammed the cure-producing drug industry. His Most Favored Nation Rule effectively let price-controlling foreign governments fix U.S. medication costs.\n\nTrump's approval of Canadian pharmaceutical imports might work if 37.7 million Canadians had enough for 331 million Americans.\n\nConversely, a January 15 roster of 605 Administration accomplishments says that Trump let pharmacists recommend lowest-cost options, ended the costly kickbacks to middlemen (cutting brand-name treatments up to 30 percent), and excised healthcare regulations, which lowered drug prices for the first time in 51 years.\n\n•Legalize homosexuality! Since 1969's Stonewall Riots, the left has demanded the decriminalization of gay relationships. With marriage equality, this agenda has been fulfilled at home.\n\nPresident Trump took this battle overseas, largely by challenging rather than appeasing Islamic fundamentalism. While Obama literally bowed before Islamo-potentates, including Saudi King Abdullah, the Trump administration pressed 69 foreign governments (many in the Islamic world) to decriminalize homosexuality.\n\nFormer Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Ric Grenell, America's first-ever gay Cabinet member, spearheaded this initiative. To prevent backlashes abroad, results were not ballyhooed. Still, Gabon legalized homosexuality, and Sudan has stopped executions for gay sex.\n\n•No more wars! Since at least the 1960s peace movement, liberals typically have been dovish and conservatives hawkish. Regardless, President Trump rebuilt the armed forces that Obama-Biden neglected, and then he pursued a Reaganite policy of Peace through Strength.\n\nTrump brokered four Middle East peace agreements with Israel and its Islamic neighbors. He also was the first American president since Jimmy Carter to launch no new wars. Hence, Trump earned four Nobel Peace Prize nominations.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs former President Trump encounters lefties in greater Mar-a-Lago, he should offer them these two words:\n\nYou're welcome!\n\nBucknell University student Michael Malarkey contributed research to this opinion piece.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DEROY MURDOCK
A Louisiana judge wants his ex-girlfriend to return an engagement ring he purchased along with a matching wedding band for $62,000. He also wants her to give back $30,000 to $45,000 for expenses he claims he incurred on her behalf.\n\nWayne Ray Chutz is an elected judge on Louisiana's First Circuit Court of Appeal. The Advocate reports that Chutz made the demand in a lawsuit he filed against attorney Ellyn Julia Clevenger last month in district court.\n\nChutz's lawsuit says he proposed to Clevenger in 2016, but that they never wed. The suit says she moved out last year, but kept the ring.\n\nClevenger said Thursday that she's not required to return the ring. She says Chutz never intended to get married; that he only gave her the ring to shut her up about marriage.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Advocate, http://theadvocate.com
Three officials with a Philippines-based church in Los Angeles have been charged as part of an alleged scheme to trick followers into becoming fundraisers and arrange sham marriages to keep them in the U.S.\n\nFederal agents arrested the local leaders of Kingdom of Jesus Christ church during a raid last month. They were each charged Wednesday. Conspiring to commit forced labor trafficking and immigration and marriage fraud were some of the charges, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nCALIFORNIA PASTOR WHO PROPHESIED KANYE WEST'S TRANSFORMATION 4 YEARS AGO PREDICTS THIS ABOUT TRUMP\n\nGuia Cabactulan, 59, was the church's top official in the United States, according to the indictment. Marissa Duenas, 41, allegedly handled immigration matters as the human resources leader and investigators believe Amanda Estopare, 48, tracked fundraising and funneled money to the church's leadership in the Philippines, the newspaper reported Thursday.\n\nA magistrate judge had ordered all three women detained after their arrests last month. Attorneys for Cabactulan and Duenas didn't immediately respond to requests from the Times for comment. It was unclear from court records if Estopare had retained a lawyer.\n\nIsraelito Torreon, an attorney for the church in the Philippines, previously denied all accusations. Torreon said the U.S. charges stemmed from a campaign, waged by disgruntled ex-members, to exact revenge and drag the church and its leader, Apollo Quiboloy, into a quagmire of shame, blatant humiliation and defeat.\n\nGOOGLE AND GOD: HOW CHURCHES ARE USING TECH TO REACH PEOPLE SEEKING RELIGIOUS ADVICE\n\nQuiboloy was neither charged nor identified by name in court documents; prosecutors and agents have referred only to the church's leader, the Times said.\n\nWorkers who say they managed to escape from the church told the FBI that they had been sent across the U.S. to work long hours soliciting donations for the church's charity and were beaten and psychologically abused if they didn't make daily quotas, according to an affidavit filed last month in support of the charges. Some described having to live in cars at truck stops.\n\nThe immigrants essentially became full-time workers, sometimes referred to as miracle workers, in a crusade to raise money for the nonprofit Children's Joy Foundation USA, which was supposed to benefit poor children in their homeland. But the complaint said most of the money raised was used to finance church operations and fund the leaders' lavish lifestyles.\n\nThe church claims a membership of 6 million people and backed the 2016 candidacy of President Rodrigo Duterte, a close friend of Quiboloy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBetween 2014 and the middle of last year, $20 million was sent to the church in the Philippines, the FBI said.\n\nInvestigators documented 82 sham marriages over a 20-year period between top fundraisers and church members who were U.S. citizens.
Margaret Court, a tennis legend who won each of the sport's four major tournaments multiple times and has created controversy over her anti-LGBT views, is set to be honored on Australia Day.\n\nHowever, the decision to give her the Companion in the General Division of the Order of Australia, which is awarded for eminent achievement and merit of the highest degree in service to Australia or humanity at large, sparked a massive backlash. The award is set to be given Tuesday, on Australia Day.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nViews on Court have changed since her playing days on the tennis courts. Court, now a Pentecostal minister, has been outspoken about her disagreement with LGBT rights and same-sex marriage in Australia. Her criticisms sparked calls for Australia to rename the Margaret Court Arena, which is one of the venues for the annual Australian Open.\n\nThe decision to award Court the honor on Australia Day received criticisms from Australian politicians. Former tennis star Martina Navratilova didn't outright criticize the decision but retweeted Court scrutiny.\n\nI don't give out those gongs. That's not a matter for me; that's for others. You might want to speak to them about why they think those views, which are disgraceful, hurtful and cost lives, should be honored, Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said Friday, via The Guardian.\n\nSPANISH TENNIS PLAYER SAYS SHE TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID-19\n\nAndrews added more in a tweet.\n\nAnthony Albanese, of the Australian Labour Party, also tweeted about the decision.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison didn't comment on Court's honor.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI can't comment on an award that is done through an independent process that hasn't been announced or I have no official knowledge of those things, he said.
Carrie Underwood and Mike Fisher welcomed their second son this week, and like their firstborn, they gave him a biblical name, reflecting the importance of faith for the Nashville stars.\n\nThe couple referred to newborn baby Jacob Bryan as a miracle in separate posts on Instagram in light of the loss and heartbreak that preceded the birth —the Cry Pretty singer revealed in September that she suffered three miscarriages over the last two years.\n\nYou are a gift from our Lord! Fisher wrote Thursday with a closeup picture holding Jacob Bryan on his chest. The last few years has had its challenges and it makes this moment even more sweet! We didn't know if Izzy would ever have another sibling but we learned through it all that God is in control and his timing is perfect! He is good all the time even in the difficult times that are hard to understand.\n\nJacob's brother, who is 3, is called Isaiah Izzy Michael. Both Jacob and Isaiah are popular names from the Hebrew Bible.\n\nJacob, whose name was later changed to Israel, was the father of the 12 tribes of Israel, and Isaiah was a prophet who is credited in Christianity with many messianic prophecies.\n\nTheir middle names compliment their family. Michael after Mike and Bryan reportedly for Carrie's family.\n\nPREGNANT CARRIE UNDERWOOD AND HUSBAND MIKE FISHER ADOPT NEW PUPPY\n\nThe American Idol winner and the former Nashville Predators hockey player have never been shy about their faith. Fisher told Oprah Winfrey it made for an instant connection when they first met.\n\nWe both grew up in Christian families, and kinda experienced life, and all of a sudden it's fame, he reflected. Spiritually we're kinda able to be on the same page and understood each other. And now, it's a big part of our marriage, for sure.\n\nUnderwood has said the couple prays regularly and tries to read the same Bible study material so they can discuss it together.\n\nThe Jesus, Take the Wheel singer has also been instilling her same faith in Isaiah.\n\nMike and I talk about teaching him how to approach everybody in a loving way, even if they're not the same, and to try to say, 'You know what? God loves them, so it should be my job to do my best to love them as well.' Carrie told People Magazine.\n\nIn 2017, she posted an adorable duet with Izzy singing Jesus Loves Me in the car.\n\nUnderwood's faith is something she's put front and center - singing hits like Something in the Water, How Great Thou Art, and Love Wins. It's something she strongly defends as well.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCountry music is different. You have that Bible Belt-ness about it, she told Glamour in 2012.

Prince Harry and Prince William are on their way to repairing their relationship as brothers.\n\nA source told Us Weekly on Wednesday that the British royals have made strides to heal their alleged rift, but still have a long way to go.\n\nWilliam and Harry's fallout was very real, very ugly and incredibly intense, the insider claimed to the outlet. They'd reached an impasse, there was so much mud under the bridge and a lot of people felt their feud was beyond repair.\n\nHarry, 36, confirmed that he and his older brother, 38, were on different paths in 2019. Things allegedly escalated when Harry and his wife Meghan Markle announced in early 2020 that they were taking a step back as senior members of the British royal family.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY 'DON'T REGRET THEIR MOVE TO THE US' AFTER ROYAL EXIT, PAL CLAIMS\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex, yearning to work independently, currently reside in Santa Barbara, Calif., with their firstborn Archie, 1.\n\nIt's certainly been a roller coaster for everyone involved, especially the brothers, who are vowing not to let things get this out of hand in the future and have learned a lot from this difficult experience, the source explained.\n\nThe insider also insisted there has been a lot of rejoicing from the family, especially from their grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, as they work toward reconciliation.\n\n[William and Harry] are looking forward to spending time together in person the moment it's safe to travel, said the source, adding they will likely reunite in England.\n\nPRINCE HARRY IS 'THRIVING' IN CALIFORNIA SINCE ROYAL EXIT, 'ISN'T LOOKING BACK,' PAL CLAIMS\n\nRumors of an alleged royal feud came to light in 2019, when British bestselling author Katie Nicholl claimed that since Markle, 39, and Harry announced their engagement in 2017, William grew increasingly worried for his brother and his whirlwind romance with the American actress.\n\nWilliam was quite concerned that the relationship had moved so quickly, Nicholl claimed in the TLC documentary Kate V. Meghan: Princesses at War? And being close to Harry, you know, probably the only person close enough to say to Harry, 'This seems to be moving quickly. Are you sure?' And I think what was meant as well intended brotherly advice just riled Harry.\n\nHarry is hugely protective of Meghan, Nicholl continued. He saw that as criticism, he interpreted that as his brother not really being behind this marriage, this union. And I don't think things have been quite right ever since.\n\nHarry hinted at an alleged rift with his older brother in ITV's 2019 documentary Harry & Meghan: An African Journey.\n\nPRINCE HARRY, MEGHAN MARKLE SHARE PHOTOS OF THEIR MOTHERS AND YOUNGER SELVES IN WEBSITE RELAUNCH\n\nPart of this role and part of this job, this family, being under the pressure that it's under, inevitably stuff happens, he said at the time. But look, we're brothers, we'll always be brothers. We're certainly on different paths at the moment but I'll always be there for him and I know he'll always be there for me.\n\nIn November 2020, royal historian and biographer Robert Lacey told Fox News that William had reason to be concerned about his sibling's whirlwind romance with the former American actress.\n\nLet's make clear that William's reservation wasn't whether Meghan was right for Harry, but whether she was right for the royal family and royal life, Lacey explained at the time. When it came to Kate [Middleton], William was slow and cautious. He followed duty. Harry immediately fell in love and discovered a new destiny for himself, a new meaning in his life. William saw Meghan as a self-made woman who created her own celebrity and wealth in the process. The royal family, on the other hand, is in the business of representing values.\n\nRoyals are expected to know their place, Lacey continued. And Harry, of course, was expected to marry a nice girl named Henrietta or Gabriella who lived in the provinces of Britain in the countryside and settle down. But Meghan and Harry both made it clear they wanted to do so much more than that. And let's just say there are things that you can and cannot do when it comes to running the royal family and what it stands for.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE AND PRINCE HARRY: 15 WAYS THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF SUSSEX STIRRED HEADLINES IN 2020\n\nLacey said that while William and Harry speak on the phone from time to time, it will take a while for their relationship to heal.\n\nI think it would always have happened that Meghan and Harry would live on the other side of the world, he explained. I think Meghan and Harry will remain based in North America. Unless the brothers can find a way to reconcile, they will have to go their separate ways and keep mutual respect for each other.\n\nWe do know that in July 2021, both brothers have committed to being in Kensington Gardens for the unveiling of the statue dedicated to their late mother, Princess Diana, he pointed out. The world will judge then. But there is a lot of work to be done.
Elizabeth Chambers has broken her silence about the scandal surrounding her soon-to-be ex-husband, Armie Hammer.\n\nHammer, 34, has been under intense scrutiny after multiple women, some unidentified, have come forward claiming he's shared his desire of twisted sex fantasies, including one alleged admission from him on social media that he is 100% a cannibal. He has denied the claims.\n\nIn a bizarre twist, a new report noted that Hammer's former Call Me By Your Name director Luca Guadagnino and co-star Timothee Chalamet are working on a project titled Bones & All which is reportedly about a woman who has the urge to kill and eat the people that love her.\n\nChambers caught wind of the movie's plot on Instagram, where she subtly reacted for the first time.\n\nARMIE HAMMER'S EX-GIRLFRIEND SAYS ACTOR 'HAS A DESIRE TO HURT WOMEN'\n\nNo. Words., she commented from her verified Instagram account.\n\nChambers had previously remained mum on the drama for the past few weeks. Shortly after the House of Effie Instagram account leaked messages allegedly sent to a woman by Hammer that shared his desire of graphic BDSM acts, the father of two exited his upcoming movie role in Shotgun Wedding, also starring Jennifer Lopez.\n\nLast week, one of Hammer's ex-girlfriends, 23-year-old model Paige Lorenze, gave an interview to Fox News about her decision to end her months-long romance with the actor. She said she believes he has a desire to hurt women.\n\nARMIE HAMMER INVESTIGATED BY POLICE OVER MISS CAYMAN VIDEO SCANDAL\n\nLorenze and Hammer struck up a romance last September in Los Angeles. The current college student said Hammer described it as a polyamorous open relationship. She said she consented to his BDSM desires during the four months they were together, but looks at it in hindsight as the opposite of fun and safe.\n\nRight away he definitely did get into things and had me do things that weren't my norm. He wanted me to only call him 'Sir' or 'Daddy' in the bedroom. He's obviously a very kinky person and he made that very clear to me, but I thought it was going to be fun and safe, she claimed to us.\n\nLorenze said she became disturbed after Hammer voiced his desire of eating her ribs.\n\nHe was talking about finding a doctor to remove my ribs that I don't need -- the ribs that are on the bottom -- and that he had a smoker at his house. He wanted to smoke them and eat them. He wondered how they would taste and he basically was like, 'I bet you they would taste good.'\n\nShe's also shared photographs of a scar she has above her groin area in the shape of an A. She claimed the actor branded the letter on her skin with a knife.\n\nARMIE HAMMER'S EX COURTNEY VUCEKOVICH CLAIMS HE WANTED TO 'BARBECUE AND EAT' HER RIBS AMID MESSAGING SCANDAL\n\nThese assertions about Mr. Hammer are patently untrue. Any interactions with this person, or any partner of his, were completely consensual in that they were fully discussed, agreed upon, and mutually participatory. The stories being perpetuated in the media are a misguided attempt to present a one-sided narrative with the goal of tarnishing Mr. Hammer's reputation, and communications from the individuals involved prove that, Hammer's attorney, Andrew Brettler, told Fox News in a statement.\n\nLorenze went on to allege that Hammer was really obsessed with biting and leaving marks on me and bruising me. She claimed the Rebececa star would always brag about her bruises and asked her to show them off.\n\nLorenze told Fox News she met Hammer's family in Texas over Thanksgiving. This gave her a sense that the relationship could be long-term as Hammer sugggested, but she put an end to the relationship in December after she began to feel really sick to my stomach, anxious, and very strange, she said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nAnother woman named Courtney Vucekovich also claimed Hammer wanted to barbecue and eat her ribs. Meanwhile, writer Jessica Ciencin Henriquez who also reportedly dated Hammer last fall said on Instagram she believes the messages are real.\n\nLast July, Hammer and Chambers, announced their split on social media. They share two children together: daughter Harper Grace, 5, and son Ford Douglas Armand, 3.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHammer is best known for his roles in The Social Network and Call Me by Your Name, which earned him a Golden Globe nomination in 2018. His recent appearances include an episode of HBO's We Are Who We Are and Netflix's Rebecca remake.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has been a loud and constant voice for socialist policies throughout his 30 years in Washington, D.C., a self-proclaimed champion of the collective good. But in researching my new book, Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Political Elite, I discovered that while Sanders may talk about the common good, his public service has made him and his family quite wealthy.\n\nPerhaps no one has benefited more from Sanders's career in politics than his wife Jane.\n\nWhen Bernie was first elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont, he appointed his then-girlfriend, Jane Driscoll, to head his administration's Youth Office. Though the position was originally unpaid, Bernie eventually put Jane on the payroll over objections of the city council. The job was never advertised so that others could apply. A local paper noted that Sanders never bothered to provide evidence as to Jane's qualifications for the position.\n\nPICK YOUR POLL: EITHER SANDERS OR BIDEN IS LEADING IN IOWA\n\nThe appointment would remain a source of controversy for Sanders. After Bernie and Jane got married in 1988, his new wife received a big pay increase. As one local newspaper reported, Political sparks flew at Burlington's annual city meeting Monday night as Democratic aldermen raised a series of questions concerning a hefty pay raise for Mayor Bernie Sanders' new wife and whether she should continue to hold her job as director of the Mayor's Youth Office.\n\nAfter Bernie won election to Congress in 1990, Jane's business ties to her husband rose to a new level.\n\nIn Washington, Jane became one of her husband's top aides, serving at various times as his chief of staff, press secretary and political analyst. After a decade in Congress, Jane and family went about setting up a company that operated under three different names to provide income tied to Bernie's political career.\n\nOn Sept. 27, 2000, the family formed Sanders & Driscoll LLC, a for-profit consulting company run by Jane, her daughter Carina, and son David. The business also operated under two trade names: Leadership Strategies and Progressive Media Strategies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe fact that this entity and its aliases were formed just weeks before the 2000 election is significant. The Sanderses ran these out of their home on Killarney Drive in Burlington. These entities served as financial conduits to run cash to the Sanders family.\n\nIt is impossible to know precisely how much because Sanders' financial disclosure forms, which he is required to release as a member of Congress, only listed more than $1,000 as the amount of income they earned from these consulting firms. We do know that some of Bernie's campaign dollars flowed through the LLCs. While running for House reelection in the early 2000s, critics claimed, Sanders doled out more than $150,000 to his wife and stepdaughter for campaign-related work between 2000 and 2004.\n\nSome of the campaign money flowing to the family from Bernie's campaign came as Jane served as a media buyer for his reelection. Media buying is a murky but potentially highly lucrative stream of income for those involved in political campaigns. Modern American political campaigns spend large sums of money on television and other forms of media. A media buyer handles the purchase of airtime and secures the contracts with media outlets.\n\nTypically, a media buyer receives a commission of about 15 percent of the cost for a media campaign. So if a campaign were to spend, say, $1,000,000 on television ads, the media buyer would pocket a $150,000 commission. But here's the kicker: the media buyer commission is not actually disclosed anywhere. Filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) only require disclosure of the bulk amount of the media buy. In this example, the FEC report will only disclose the $1,000,000 media buy. And as for the fact that Jane Sanders is the spouse of a politician, she is only required to disclose that she earns more than $1,000 from her businesses.\n\nWhat is interesting about the Sanders family foray into media buying, in particular, is that Jane Sanders had no apparent background in media buying. But in her husband's 2006 campaign, she worked with two media buyers named Barbara Abar Bougie and Shelli Hutton-Hartig – two names that would become significant when Bernie's political ambitions went national.\n\nBernie Sanders's insurgent 2016 presidential campaign brought in a huge sum of money. A large chunk of it — nearly $83 million — flowed to a mysterious limited liability company with no website, no phone number, and no office space. Indeed, the LLC was registered to a private home on a cul-de-sac in suburban Virginia.\n\nThe mysterious company is called Old Towne Media LLC. Two names connected to the company are Barbara Abar Bougie and Shelli Hutton-Hartig, Jane's associates from the 2006 campaign.\n\nThe Sanders campaign purchased a whopping $82.77 million in political ads through Old Towne Media, which could have earned the company a media fee of more than $12 million, based on the industry standard for ad-buy commissions. Was Jane Sanders somehow involved in this financial arrangement? FEC disclosures make it easy to hide where media buying fees actually go. Jane listed her income from her professional work at the time as simply more than $1,000.\n\nWhen a highly respected Vermont reporter named Jasper Craven, working for the nonprofit VTDigger.com, asked Jane about Old Towne Media during a phone interview, she replied, I have no idea what Old Towne Media is. Then she hung up the phone.\n\nEven when Jane got a job not working for Bernie, it still seemed to be connected to his political position.\n\nIn 2004, Jane was appointed head of Burlington College, a private school with fewer than two hundred students. One of the board members of the college admitted that Jane's marriage to Bernie played a big role in her hiring because they thought that it would help with fundraising.\n\nAttending Burlington College was not cheap; tuition was over $23,000 a year in 2014-15. In addition, the college received millions in federal money over the years and students could apply for federal government–supported student loans. That flow of money provided funds that could be directed into family enterprises. And Jane steered Burlington College resources in the same direction as Bernie did his campaign money: it went to the family.\n\nBeginning in 2009, the nonprofit Burlington College agreed to a deal with the for-profit Vermont Woodworking School to set up a carpentry program. The school, launched two years earlier, was not accredited and happened to be owned by Jane's daughter, Carina. Burlington College had never had a woodworking program before, and as when Bernie hired Jane to a city job while he was mayor, those outside the family were never invited to apply.\n\nThat first year of the alliance, the college gave Carina's school $56,474 for materials charges and lease of bench space. By 2010, the cash flowing from the college to the family business was more than $133,000. Payments ballooned to $182,741 in rental costs alone by 2012. In total, Burlington College would funnel more than $500,000 to Carina's woodworking school.\n\nThe transactions are notable because Burlington College at the time was struggling to pay its own faculty and bills.\n\nCarina's school also received at least one federal grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to install biomass heating. At the time, Sen. Bernie Sanders sat on the powerful Senate Budget Committee, with financial oversight of the USDA budget.\n\nDespite the academic failings of the college, its continuing financial difficulties, and the growing river of funds that were flowing to her daughter's business, Jane's salary as president continued to rise. By 2009, she was making $160,000, including benefits.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt soon became apparent that the college did not have enough money coming in to pay its debts, and it started falling behind in its loan payments. The board of directors asked Jane to leave in 2011. She received a $200,000 severance on the way out.\n\nFive years later, the college collapsed.\n\nThis essay is adapted from the author's book Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY PETER SCHWEIZER
The House Ethics Committee on Thursday released a trove of striking internal campaign communications sent in 2018 by Michigan Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, in which Tlaib urgently requested money from her congressional campaign to defray personal expenses -- and, a government watchdog said, possibly violated federal law in the process.\n\nThe document dump was related to the committee's ongoing ethics probe into Tlaib, which the panel said on Thursday would be expanded based on a referral from the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE). Additionally, the Ethics Committee acknowledged for the first time on Thursday an investigation into Florida Democratic Rep. Alcee Hastings concerning a personal relationship with an individual employed in his congressional office.\n\nTexts and emails released by the Ethics Committee show Tlaib frantically contacting members of her staff for financial help.\n\nIn one April 2018 email offered as an exhibit by OCE, Tlaib wrote that she was struggling financially right now and was sinking. She continued: So I was thinking the campaign could loan me money, but Ryan said that the committee could actually pay me. I was thinking a one time payment of $5k.\n\nIn another email, on April 4, 2018, Tlaib wrote: I am just not going to make it through the campaign without a stipend.\n\nWith the loss of a second income to lean back on, she wrote. I am requesting $2,000 per two weeks but not exceeding $12,000. The cost of living stipend is going towards much needed expenses due to campaigning that includes car maintenance, child care and other necessities. Please let me know if I can proceed.\n\nREAD THE OCE'S REFERRAL STATEMENT ON TLAIB\n\nIn August of that year, Tlaib texted her future chief of staff Ryan Anderson at 6:38 a.m.: Sorry for the early text but do you think the campaign can still pay me a stipend until the general. Trying to get out of debt.\n\nI think we definitely afford to do so. But we need to really clearly define your time and space, Anderson responded, noting that the arrangement could arouse concern among the media.\n\nThe OCE also attached scans of checks made out to Tlaib from her campaign, totaling thousands of dollars.\n\nTalib's lawyers said in August there was no evidence that she violated the law on purpose or otherwise, and insisted there were no bad intentions. They noted that Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulations permit campaigns to pay limited salary to candidates who curtail outside employment to focus on their campaigns in certain limited conditions that, the lawyers said, were met in this instance.\n\nThe attorneys went on to say it was most irregular for OCE to call for a probe into a member of Congress based on pre-election activities, and argued that there was no conscious disregard of any law or regulation. Tlaib was paid by her campaign after Election Day, the attorneys conceded, but they asserted that the money was for services performed before Election Day.\n\nBut Tlaib's campaign committee, Rashida Tlaib for Congress, allegedly reported campaign disbursements that may not be legitimate and verifiable campaign expenditures attributable to bona fide campaign or political purposes, according to a release from OCE that unanimously recommended the Ethics Committee investigate Tlaib.\n\nREAD THE OCE'S EXHIBITS OUTLINING TLAIB'S POSSIBLE MISCONDUCT\n\nIf Tlaib converted campaign funds from Rashida Tlaib for Congress to personal use, or if Tlaib's campaign committee expended funds that were not attributable to bona fide campaign or political purposes, then Tlaib may have violated House rules, standards of conduct, and federal law, the OCE continued.\n\nThe Board recommends that the Committee further review the above allegation concerning Rep. Tlaib because there is substantial reason to believe that Rep. Tlaib converted campaign funds from Rashida Tlaib for Congress to personal use or Rep. Tlaib's campaign committee expended funds that were not attributable to bona fide campaign or political purposes, it said.\n\nThe Ethics Committee first announced on August 16, 2019 that it had received a referral from the OCE concerning Tlaib.\n\nSo I was thinking the campaign could loan me money ... — Michigan Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, in 2018 email released by OCE\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethics Committee also said it was looking into an alleged relationship between Hastings and a staffer, and whether Hastings has received any improper gifts, including any forbearance, from that employee.\n\nThe Committee is specifically considering whether Representative Hastings' relationship with the individual employed in his congressional office is in violation of House Rule XXIII, clause 18(a), the ethics panel said. That provision refers to improper sexual relationships with any employee of the House who works under the supervision of the Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner, or who is an employee of a committee on which the Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner serves.\n\nREAD THE RESPONSE FROM TLAIB'S LAWYERS\n\nThe Committee continues to gather additional information regarding the allegations, the panel noted.\n\nThe announcement from the ethics panel came less than a month after California Democratic Rep. Katie Hill resigned amid allegations that she had improper personal relationships with her own staffers.\n\nI have cooperated with the Committee since May 14, 2019, Hastings said in a statement. As they continue to conduct their work, I stand ready to fully cooperate with their inquiry.\n\nTlaib and Hastings have both vocally supported impeaching and removing President Trump from office, saying he is unfit to serve. Earlier this year, Tlaib boasted that Democrats would impeach the motherf---er, referring to the president.\n\nALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ HIT WITH MAJOR FEC COMPLAINT OVER CAMPAIGN SPENDING -- $800G ALLEGEDLY MOVED OFF THE BOOKS\n\nILHAN OMAR VIOLATED CAMPAIGN FINANCE RULES, INVESTIGATION FINDS -- WHILE ALSO RAISING TAX QUESTION ABOUT HER MARRIAGE\n\nAnd, in a striking scene at the outset of a Rules Committee meeting last month, Hastings -- who himself was impeached and removed from the federal bench in 1989 for taking bribes -- outlined the alleged high crimes and misdemeanors that he said Trump had committed.\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.
Daryl Dragon, the cap-wearing Captain of pop band The Captain and Tennille, has died. He was 76.\n\nDragon passed away on Wednesday of renal failure at a hospice in Prescott, Ariz., according to spokesman Harlan Boll, as The Associated Press reports. Toni Tennille, Dragon's ex-wife and longtime musical partner, was by his side.\n\nHe was a brilliant musician with many friends who loved him greatly. I was at my most creative in my life when I was with him, Tennille said in a statement to Fox News.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDragon was born on August 27, 1942, in Los Angeles. He came from a musical family with his father, Carmen, winning an Academy Award as a composer and conductor, and his mother, Eloise, a singer who worked on Bing Crosby recordings among others, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nIn 1967, Dragon — a classically trained musician — started playing keyboard for The Beach Boys, which led to him being given the nickname Captain by lead singer Mike Love because of his affinity for wearing a captain's hat while on stage.\n\nFour years later, Dragon met Tennille, and the pair soon began performing together, with Tennille singing and Dragon on keyboards — he also later served as a producer for The Captain and Tennille.\n\nThe duo went on to top the 1970s music charts with hits including Muskrat Love, Shop Around and Love Will Keep Us Together.\n\nLove Will Keep Us Together catapulted the couple to fame with their breakthrough coming in 1975 when they covered the Neil Sedaka-Howard Greenfield song, which Sedaka himself recorded in 1973 and been released as a single in Europe.\n\n'CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM' STAR DEAD AT 76\n\nThe Captain and Tennille version topped the charts -- and acknowledged Sedaka's authorship by singing Sedaka's back at the end of the song -- and won a Grammy for record of the year.\n\nThey followed with a mix of covers such as Muskrat Love and Shop Around and original songs, including Tennille's Do That to Me One More Time, which hit No. 1 in 1980. They also briefly starred in their own television variety show.\n\nDragon and Tennille divorced in 2014 after nearly 40 years of marriage, but they remained close and Tennille moved back to Arizona to help care for him.\n\nHe is survived by his older brother, Doug Dragon, and two nieces, Kelly Arbout and Renee Henn.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
Larry King, legendary talk show host and a broadcast pioneer, died Saturday at the age of 87.\n\nWith profound sadness, Ora media announces the death of our co-founder, host, and friend Larry King, who passed away this morning at age 87 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, his company said in a statement posted to Twitter.\n\nFor 63 years and across the platforms of radio, television and digital media, Larry's many thousands of interviews, awards and global acclaim stand as a testament to his unique and lasting talent as a broadcaster, the statement said.\n\nKing, with his trademark suspenders and iconic voice, spent more than 60 years in the spotlight. He hosted CNN's Larry King Live for 25 years, interviewing everyone from world leaders and icons to criminals and conspiracy theorists during 6,000-plus episodes of the show from 1985 to 2010.\n\nLARRY KING, BROADCAST PIONEER AND LEGENDARY TALK SHOW HOST, DIES AT 87\n\nIn addition to his wide-ranging interviews with celebrities, politicians, athletes and more throughout his decades-long career, King's personal life generated headlines, too.\n\nOne critical part about his life off-camera was his relationships with his seven ex-wives, as well as his role as a father. He was married eight times, to seven different women, and at the time of his death, he was single after divorcing actress Shawn King in 2019.\n\nHere's a look at all seven of the women who walked down the aisle with the entertainment icon.\n\nFreda Miller (1952-53)\n\nKing walked down the aisle for the first time with his high school girlfriend, Freda Miller. Their union came in 1952 when King was reportedly 18 years old. The marriage was short-lived, however. The union was annulled in 1953 because their parents reportedly did not approve.\n\nLARRY KING LOSES 2 CHILDREN WITHIN WEEKS OF EACH OTHER\n\nAnnette Kaye (1961)\n\nKing would go on to marry his second spouse, Annette Kaye in 1961. Their marriage lasted less than one year. Kaye gave birth to King's first son, Larry King Jr.\n\nAlene Akins (1961-63, 1968-71)\n\nKing said I do a third time to Playboy bunny Alene Akins in 1961. During their union, King adopted Akins' son Andy. The marriage lasted two years and ended in divorce in 1963, but this wouldn't be the end of his romance with Akins.\n\nLARRY KING FILES FOR DIVORCE FROM WIFE SHAWN KING AFTER 22 YEARS OF MARRIAGE\n\nThe pair rekindled their romance in 1968, which came after he married and divorced his fourth wife Mickey Sutphin. During their second marriage, Akins gave birth to their daughter, Chaia.\n\nKing and Akins split for good, however, in 1971.\n\nSadly, both Andy and Chaia died within weeks of each other last summer. Andy, 65, died in late July and his daughter Chaia, 51, lost her battle with lung cancer weeks later.\n\nKing spoke out about his childrens' deaths in a statement last August.\n\nLARRY KING SAYS 26-YEAR AGE GAP, RELIGION TOOK 'ITS TOLL' ON MARRIAGE, ULTIMATELY LED TO DIVORCE\n\nIt is with sadness and a father's broken heart that I confirm the recent loss of two of my children, Andy King, and Chaia King. Both of them were good and kind souls and they will be greatly missed, he wrote on Facebook. Andy passed away unexpectedly of a heart attack on July 28th, and Chaia passed on August 20th, only a short time after having been diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\nMickey Sutphin (1964-66)\n\nKing's fourth wife is Mickey Sutphin. The duo wed in 1964 and divorced in 1966 after welcoming a daughter, Kelly. Kelly was later adopted by her Sutphin's subsequent husband.\n\nSharon Lepore (1976-83)\n\nAfter divorcing Sutphin, King lived the single life. But the bachelor life wouldn't last for long as he struck up a romance with Sharon Lepore, a production assistant. Their marriage lasted six years until it ended up also ending in divorce.\n\nJulie Alexander (1989-92)\n\nIn 1989, King walked down the aisle yet again, this time with businesswoman Julie Alexander. The pair called it quits in 1990 but wouldn't become officially divorced until 1992.\n\nShawn Southwick (1997-2019)\n\nActress Shawn Southwick, who also lent her voice to movies such as Shrek, was King's final wife. The couple were married for 22 years before King filed for divorce in August 2019 after 22 years of marriage. They are parents to two sons: Chance and Cannon.\n\nI'm sorry about the marriage, King said to People Magazine last year. I'll always care for my wife. But it just hit a point where we didn't get along.\n\nLARRY KING'S ESTRANGED WIFE, SHAWN, SAYS SHE WAS 'BLINDSIDED' BY DIVORCE\n\nI got married a lot, he added. But in my head, I'm not a marrying guy. When I grew up, nobody lived together. If you fell in love, you got married. And so I married the ones that I loved. But what I loved at 20 is not what I loved at 30 and what I loved at 30 is not what I loved at 40.\n\nThis marriage was King's longest. King and Southwick withstood rumors of cheating that cropped up after a brief separation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI never cheated on my wives, King said. My career always came first.\n\nKing said it wasn't just his changing emotions that led to the split.We had a big age difference and that eventually takes its toll, said King, who is 26 years older than his 60-year-old wife. It became an issue. Also, [Southwick] is a very religious Mormon and I'm an agnostic atheist so that eventually causes little problems.
Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard barely finished announcing she is running for president in 2020 when the spotlight quickly shifted to anti-gay comments and actions from her past.\n\nGabbard, a 37-year-old Democratic lawmaker from Hawaii, is known for being politically unpredictable, something she has publicly said she takes pride in. But some of her most fiery remarks against same-sex marriage in years past, as well as her active campaign to promote traditional marriage legislation, have drawn closer scrutiny since her announcement Friday.\n\nIn years past, she several times referred to LGBTQ activists as homosexual extremists, a view that echoes that of her father, Mike Gabbard, whom a New Yorker profile of the congresswoman described as having long been Hawaii's leading opponent of the gay-rights movement, an energetic and often brusque activist who stood ever ready to denounce what he called 'the radical homosexual agenda.'\n\nGABBARD SAYS SHE WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT\n\nGabbard was a visible force against same-sex marriage, and in 2004 spearheaded a fight in the state against a same-sex union measure. To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, she said at the time. As Democrats, we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists.\n\nGabbard then also blasted Massachusetts' passage of same-sex marriage legislation, making it the first in the nation to recognize gay marriage. Speaking on behalf of the Alliance for Traditional Marriage and Values, a group headed by her father, she said the Massachusetts marriage law would cause a ripple effect across the country.\n\nIt is highly likely that federal judges will soon be tearing apart our U.S. Constitution in order to force same-sex marriage down the throats of the people of Hawaii and America, Gabbard said. The only way to protect traditional marriage in Hawaii and throughout our country, the only way to stop activist federal judges from rewriting our constitution, is by the passage of the Federal Marriage Amendment.\n\nJULIAN CASTRO LAUNCHES 2020 BID\n\nThe Alliance for Traditional Marriage and Values also drew controversy for supporting so-called conversion gay therapy, which views homosexuality as a mental illness. More than a dozen states in the country have since outlawed or restricted the controversial practice.\n\nAt the time, Gabbard also gave a lengthy speech at the Hawaii State House against a proposed resolution that addressed the bullying of gay students in public schools. Gabbard argued the resolution would cast homosexuality as normal, and that it would attract homosexual-advocacy organizations into our schools to promote their agenda to our vulnerable youth.\n\nGabbard has in recent years said she has evolved in her views about gay rights, and has actively helped further LGBTQ interests in Congress. She was quoted in several media outlets as saying in a statement on Sunday, after her old remarks and actions came under fire, that she was sorry about her past views and comments.\n\nOver the past six years in Congress, I have been fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to help work toward passing legislation that ensures equal rights and protections on LGBTQ+ issues, Gabbard said. Much work remains to ensure equality and civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ Americans and if elected president, I will continue to fight for equal rights for all.\n\nRarely have we seen someone who was so actively and vehemently and viscerally against LGBTQ equality and acceptance. [Gabbard] was someone who worked so actively against our community when the stakes were so high. — Zeke Stokes, the vice president of programs at GLAAD\n\nOn social media, critics for the most part were not forgiving.\n\nSome said they had been aware of talk about Gabbard's controversial remarks about gays, but were surprised to hear about the depth of her anti-LGBTQ views.\n\nOthers said they wanted to hear more from the congresswoman about why she held the views and, in particularly, why she went out of her way to fight against issues of importance to the LGBTQ community.\n\nWe've seen [people] who may held a particular view and evolved to a place of acceptance,, but rarely have we seen someone who was so actively and vehemently and viscerally against LGBTQ equality and acceptance, said Zeke Stokes, the vice president of programs at GLAAD, one of the most prominent LGBTQ advocacy groups, in an interview with Fox News. [Gabbard] was someone who worked so actively against our community when the stakes were so high.\n\nOne thing is to say that marriage should be between a man and a woman, but another is to actively work to stymie the progress of a community that is marginalized, and to oppose an effort to keep kids safe.\n\nStokes said her anti-LGBTQ remarks likely will haunt her throughout her campaign, and that it behooves the congresswoman to confront it head-on and address skeptics by explaining how her evolution unfolded.\n\nWhat changed for her, to go from such an aggressive anti-LGBTQ stance to one of being an ally, Stokes said. That can set a good example for others who may be struggling to get to that acceptance. It can be educational for other Americans.
Newly-elected Utah senator Mitt Romney kicked off 2019 with an op-ed in the Washington Post that savaged Donald Trump's character and leadership. Romney's attack and Trump's response Wednesday morning on Twitter are the latest salvos in a longstanding personal feud between the two men. It's even possible that Romney is planning to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. We'll see.\n\nBut for now, Romney's piece is fascinating on its own terms. It's well-worth reading. It's a window into how the people in charge, in both parties, see our country.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TUCKER CARLSON.\n\nRomney's main complaint in the piece is that Donald Trump is a mercurial and divisive leader. That's true, of course. But beneath the personal slights, Romney has a policy critique of Trump. He seems genuinely angry that Trump might pull American troops out of the Syrian civil war. Romney doesn't explain how staying in Syria would benefit America. He doesn't appear to consider that a relevant question. More policing in the Middle East is always better. We know that. Virtually everyone in Washington agrees.\n\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL EPISODE OF TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.\n\n\n\nCorporate tax cuts are also popular in Washington, and Romney is strongly on board with those, too. His piece throws a rare compliment to Trump for cutting the corporate rate a year ago.\n\nThat's not surprising. Romney spent the bulk of his business career at a firm called Bain Capital. Bain Capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: Take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. Romney became fantastically rich doing this.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.\n\nMeanwhile, a remarkable number of the companies are now bankrupt or extinct. This is the private equity model. Our ruling class sees nothing wrong with it. It's how they run the country.\n\nMitt Romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream Republican view. And he's right about that. For generations, Republicans have considered it their duty to make the world safe for banking, while simultaneously prosecuting ever more foreign wars. Modern Democrats generally support those goals enthusiastically.\n\nThere are signs, however, that most people do not support this, and not just in America. In countries around the world — France, Brazil, Sweden, the Philippines, Germany, and many others — voters are suddenly backing candidates and ideas that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. These are not isolated events. What you're watching is entire populations revolting against leaders who refuse to improve their lives.\n\nSomething like this has been in happening in our country for three years. Donald Trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the White House. Does he understand the political revolution that he harnessed? Can he reverse the economic and cultural trends that are destroying America? Those are open questions.\n\nBut they're less relevant than we think. At some point, Donald Trump will be gone. The rest of us will be gone, too. The country will remain. What kind of country will be it be then? How do we want our grandchildren to live? These are the only questions that matter.\n\nThe answer used to be obvious. The overriding goal for America is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. But is that still true? Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones, or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy? They haven't so far. A lot of Americans are drowning in stuff. And yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. Anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in GDP is an idiot.\n\nThe goal for America is both simpler and more elusive than mere prosperity. It's happiness. There are a lot of ingredients in being happy: Dignity. Purpose. Self-control. Independence. Above all, deep relationships with other people. Those are the things that you want for your children. They're what our leaders should want for us, and would want if they cared.\n\nBut our leaders don't care. We are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule. They're day traders. Substitute teachers. They're just passing through. They have no skin in this game, and it shows. They can't solve our problems. They don't even bother to understand our problems.\n\nOne of the biggest lies our leaders tell us that you can separate economics from everything else that matters. Economics is a topic for public debate. Family and faith and culture, meanwhile, those are personal matters. Both parties believe this.\n\nMembers of our educated upper-middle-classes are now the backbone of the Democratic Party who usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. In other words, functionally libertarian. They don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. Somehow, they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. As far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.\n\n\n\nSocial conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, and yet reach a strikingly similar conclusion. The real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the American family is collapsing. Nothing can be fixed before we fix that. Yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. The idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. They refuse to consider it. Questioning markets feels like apostasy.\n\nBoth sides miss the obvious point: Culture and economics are inseparably intertwined. Certain economic systems allow families to thrive. Thriving families make market economies possible. You can't separate the two. It used to be possible to deny this. Not anymore. The evidence is now overwhelming. How do we know? Consider the inner cities.\n\nThirty years ago, conservatives looked at Detroit or Newark and many other places and were horrified by what they saw. Conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. The majority of children were born out of wedlock. Single mothers were the rule. Crime and drugs and disorder became universal.\n\nWhat caused this nightmare? Liberals didn't even want to acknowledge the question. They were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. Conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner-city dysfunction and it made sense: big government. Decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what conservatives called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.\n\nThere was truth in this. But it wasn't the whole story. How do we know? Because virtually the same thing has happened decades later to an entirely different population. In many ways, rural America now looks a lot like Detroit.\n\nThis is striking because rural Americans wouldn't seem to have much in common with anyone from the inner city. These groups have different cultures, different traditions and political beliefs. Usually they have different skin colors. Rural people are white conservatives, mostly.\n\nYet, the pathologies of modern rural America are familiar to anyone who visited downtown Baltimore in the 1980s: Stunning out of wedlock birthrates. High male unemployment. A terrifying drug epidemic. Two different worlds. Similar outcomes. How did this happen? You'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. But mostly they're not. They don't have to be interested. It's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born Americans who are slipping behind.\n\nBut Republicans now represent rural voters. They ought to be interested. Here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. Manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. All that remained in many places were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. In many places, women suddenly made more than men.\n\nNow, before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Maybe they should want to marry them, but they don't. Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out-of-wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that inevitably follow -- more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation.\n\nThis isn't speculation. This is not propaganda from the evangelicals. It's social science. We know it's true. Rich people know it best of all. That's why they get married before they have kids. That model works. But increasingly, marriage is a luxury only the affluent in America can afford.\n\nAnd yet, and here's the bewildering and infuriating part, those very same affluent married people, the ones making virtually all the decisions in our society, are doing pretty much nothing to help the people below them get and stay married. Rich people are happy to fight malaria in Congo. But working to raise men's wages in Dayton or Detroit? That's crazy.\n\nThis is negligence on a massive scale. Both parties ignore the crisis in marriage. Our mindless cultural leaders act like it's still 1961, and the biggest problem American families face is that sexism is preventing millions of housewives from becoming investment bankers or Facebook executives.\n\nFor our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer. They teach us it's more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids.\n\nSheryl Sandberg of Facebook wrote an entire book about this. Sandberg explained that our first duty is to shareholders, above our own children. No surprise there. Sandberg herself is one of America's biggest shareholders. Propaganda like this has made her rich.\n\nWe are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule. They're day traders. Substitute teachers. They're just passing through. They have no skin in this game, and it shows.\n\nWhat's remarkable is how the rest of us responded to it. We didn't question why Sandberg was saying this. We didn't laugh in her face at the pure absurdity of it. Our corporate media celebrated Sandberg as the leader of a liberation movement. Her book became a bestseller: Lean In. As if putting a corporation first is empowerment. It is not. It is bondage. Republicans should say so.\n\n\n\nThey should also speak out against the ugliest parts of our financial system. Not all commerce is good. Why is it defensible to loan people money they can't possibly repay? Or charge them interest that impoverishes them? Payday loan outlets in poor neighborhoods collect 400 percent annual interest.\n\nWe're OK with that? We shouldn't be. Libertarians tell us that's how markets work -- consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives. OK. But it's also disgusting. If you care about America, you ought to oppose the exploitation of Americans, whether it's happening in the inner city or on Wall Street.\n\n\n\nAnd by the way, if you really loved your fellow Americans, as our leaders should, if it would break your heart to see them high all the time. Which they are. A huge number of our kids, especially our boys, are smoking weed constantly. You may not realize that, because new technology has made it odorless. But it's everywhere.\n\nAnd that's not an accident. Once our leaders understood they could get rich from marijuana, marijuana became ubiquitous. In many places, tax-hungry politicians have legalized or decriminalized it. Former Speaker of the House John Boehner now lobbies for the marijuana industry. His fellow Republicans seem fine with that. Oh, but it's better for you than alcohol, they tell us.\n\nMaybe. Who cares? Talk about missing the point. Try having dinner with a 19-year-old who's been smoking weed. The life is gone. Passive, flat, trapped in their own heads. Do you want that for your kids? Of course not. Then why are our leaders pushing it on us? You know the reason. Because they don't care about us.\n\nWhen you care about people, you do your best to treat them fairly. Our leaders don't even try. They hand out jobs and contracts and scholarships and slots at prestigious universities based purely on how we look. There's nothing less fair than that, though our tax code comes close.\n\nUnder our current system, an American who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate as someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. We tax capital at half of what we tax labor. It's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of our rich people do.\n\nIn 2010, for example, Mitt Romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. He paid an effective federal tax rate of 14 percent. For normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. No wonder Mitt Romney supports the status quo. But for everyone else, it's infuriating.\n\nOur leaders rarely mention any of this. They tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. Please. It's based on laws that the Congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. It worked well for those people. They did increase their economic advantage. But for everyone else, it came at a big cost. Unfairness is profoundly divisive. When you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. They hate each other.\n\nThat happens in countries, too. It's happening in ours, probably by design. Divided countries are easier to rule. And nothing divides us like the perception that some people are getting special treatment. In our country, some people definitely are getting special treatment. Republicans should oppose that with everything they have.\n\n\n\nWhat kind of country do you want to live in? A fair country. A decent country. A cohesive country. A country whose leaders don't accelerate the forces of change purely for their own profit and amusement. A country you might recognize when you're old.\n\nA country that listens to young people who don't live in Brooklyn. A country where you can make a solid living outside of the big cities. A country where Lewiston, Maine seems almost as important as the west side of Los Angeles. A country where environmentalism means getting outside and picking up the trash. A clean, orderly, stable country that respects itself. And above all, a country where normal people with an average education who grew up in no place special can get married, and have happy kids, and repeat unto the generations. A country that actually cares about families, the building block of everything.\n\n\n\nWhat will it take a get a country like that? Leaders who want it. For now, those leaders will have to be Republicans. There's no option at this point.\n\nBut first, Republican leaders will have to acknowledge that market capitalism is not a religion. Market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster. You'd have to be a fool to worship it. Our system was created by human beings for the benefit of human beings. We do not exist to serve markets. Just the opposite. Any economic system that weakens and destroys families is not worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.\n\n\n\nInternalizing all this will not be easy for Republican leaders. They'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. They'll likely lose donors in the process. They'll be criticized. Libertarians are sure to call any deviation from market fundamentalism a form of socialism.\n\nThat's a lie. Socialism is a disaster. It doesn't work. It's what we should be working desperately to avoid. But socialism is exactly what we're going to get, and very soon unless a group of responsible people in our political system reforms the American economy in a way that protects normal people.\n\n\n\nIf you want to put America first, you've got to put its families first.\n\nAdapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue from Tucker Carlson Tonight on January 2, 2019.
Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem are in talks to secure roles in the upcoming Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz flick, Being the Ricardos, according to reports.\n\nKidman, 53, will portray Ball while Bardem, 51, will tackle Arnaz.\n\nThe film will follow the relationship between the famed I Love Lucy co-stars, and will be directed by Aaron Sorkin (Molly's Game, The Trial of the Chicago 7), Deadline and Variety report.\n\nThe prolific filmmaker has also written the script, which will reportedly be produced for Amazon Studios and Escape Artists.\n\nHOW NICOLE KIDMAN HELPED 'THE UNDOING' STAR WITH HER NUDE SCENES\n\nAccording to both outlets, the film will take place within one week of production on the iconic I Love Lucy sitcom, beginning with a table read and carrying the audience through to a live taping.\n\nAdditionally, the two will face crises that could put an end to their careers and their marriage, per the outlets.\n\nSorkin, who is known mostly for his writing, was originally set only to pen the script, but his time directing Chicago 7 led him to direct as well.

But when it boiled down to it, we both just said, 'Look, we desperately want to get married, and no matter what the future holds, at least we'll be husband and wife. We can take on the world together.'\n\nBINDI IRWIN PENS SWEET MESSAGE TO LATE FATHER, STEVE IRWIN, AMID WEDDING PLANNING\n\nPowell told the outlet that he struggled to contain his emotions when he set eyes on his bride-to-be in her long-sleeved wedding gown.\n\nThe first time I saw Bindi in that dress was the most beautiful sight in the world, he said. I immediately teared up. Nothing has ever felt more right than that moment in time.\n\nAnd Irwin believes her father, the late Crocodile Hunter who died in 2006, would approve of his daughter's journey and prospective for the future.\n\nThese last few days have been amazing reflecting on our whirlwind of a day and also looking forward to the future, she said. My dad would be so happy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIrwin and Powell, 22, started dating in 2013 when he was in Australia for a professional wakeboarding competition, People noted at the time of their engagement. He visited the Australia Zoo, where the Irwin family lives and works.\n\nSince then, Powell has grown to share her affinity for animals. She previously told the outlet that she's thrilled to find someone who shares her late father's love of wildlife and conservation, noting, He has this strength [that] is necessary when you're jumping on crocs.\n\nFox News' Tyler McCarthy contributed to this report.
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, along with his wife, MacKenzie, announced in a joint statement on social media Wednesday plans to divorce after 25 years of marriage.\n\nThe world's richest couple suggested the split was amicable, expressing gratitude for their quarter-century union. The Bezos's have four children – three sons and a daughter who was adopted from China.\n\nThe Bezos' outward facing amicability notwithstanding, divorce is a gut-wrenching development in anyone's life. The late author Pat Conroy once compared it to the death of a small civilization, and I think he is exactly right. In my decades of counseling and ministry, I have seen the pain and anguish that couples face with the demise of once happy marriages.\n\nWHY MARRIAGE IS A LOT LIKE HALIBUT FISHING\n\nDivorce is not just a transaction, it's the loss of a dream, the implosion of plans to grow old together and live happily ever after. I have often compared a marriage to a ball of bunched-up fishing line. Husbands and wives, especially those who are also mothers and fathers, are entangled with one another, and separating one from the other is extremely difficult. It's not like an apple, which is easily sliced and separated in two.\n\nAs a Christian counselor, I view divorce as the severing of a sacred union and pledge. There are biblical reasons to divorce, specifically infidelity and abandonment – but my heart breaks for every couple mired in the misery of a relationship gone bad. And yet divorce is rarely the best solution to marital discord. Most couples who stick together through tough times later report being happy they did so.\n\nBut when two individuals like Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos have decided to split, is there a right way to do it?\n\nIn my counseling, if every available means to potential reconciliation has been exhausted, I advise divorcing couples to concentrate on four main things:\n\n1. Honor the Other Person\n\nRegardless of the animosity that might exist between divorcing spouses, it's critical to remember that the other person is valuable and worthy of dignity and respect. It's not uncommon for angry and hurt spouses to gather up support against the soon-to-be ex-spouse. Piling on may feel good at first, but it diminishes the other person. Resist the urge to do so.\n\n2. Grieve Well\n\nIt's critical to find emotional and professional support in the form of a qualified and credentialed counselor. Friends also play a vital role, but find ones who will be candid with you and hold you accountable. You want someone who will see a Facebook post that you wrote in frustration and say, Hey, that's not you. You're better than that.\n\n3. Model Handling Difficulty for Your Children\n\nChildren are the innocent victims of divorce, but it's important for them to see how you navigate tragedy and trial. They're watching and learning. Whenever possible, be gracious.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n4. Deal with your own issues\n\nIt's easy to place all the blame for the dissolution of a marriage on the other person. But marriage is the union of two imperfect people, so there are always areas you need to own. What did you do to bring about the problems? Don't sweep it under the rug and pin all fault on your spouse. Confront your own shortcomings and learn from your mistakes, lest you repeat the same ones down the road. Grow through your grief.\n\nCouples who are going through divorce need our prayers, understanding and support. They need to know there is hope and redemption available to them in even the darkest hour.
I've never been happier to ring in a new year. Finally, 2020 is behind us, the U.S. presidential election is over and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines has begun. After a year of trauma, upheaval and challenge, a brand new year is the next best thing to a reset button.\n\nMaybe you've jotted down a few resolutions for this fresh, unmarred year or mapped out specific goals for the months to come. Good for you. Or you may be thinking: Why bother? It may be that 2021 isn't any better and is out of my control anyway.\n\nBefore you go down either of these trails, may I make a suggestion? Take time to ask yourself a simple question: What story do I want to tell?\n\nPAUL BATURA: A RACE FROM ONE YEAR INTO THE NEXT TAUGHT ME A LIFELONG LESSON\n\nThough we've probably never met, here's something I know about you: You would like to be able to tell your entire story without skipping any chapters or having to lie about the details. We all want that. And going forward, you can have that. But it will require you to stop mid-decision and ask: What story do I want to tell?\n\nThe decisions you're in the middle of making right now are going to be reduced to a story you tell. Once it's behind you, like 2020, it's a story. But the rest of your life is a story waiting to be written, and you will create that story one decision at a time.\n\nHere's an example. If you lost your job during 2020, surviving this season without a job is going to be a story you tell someday. What story do you want to tell?\n\nYou could decide to make this the story: I lost my job. I was embarrassed. I told friends I was doing consulting work. But I wasn't consulting. I was consoling myself every afternoon with a bottle. I racked up a ton of debt. I lost the respect of my wife and kids. Maybe worse, I lost my self-respect.\n\nOr you could decide a better story, because we each write our story one decision at a time: I lost my job. I was embarrassed. I let my friends and family know, and they not only offered encouragement, they offered job leads. And brought over a few meals. Our family worked together to cut expenses, and I worked two part-time jobs for a while. My faith grew as I trusted God for daily bread. Our family grew closer, and our compassion for others deepened.\n\nThe decisions you make in the valleys are eventually just stories you tell on the other side. Which of the available options do you want as part of your story?\n\nThe primary reason we don't think in terms of story when making decisions is that the story comes later. Decisions are now. We think about the future later. As in later, when it's too late to do anything about it. We don't think in terms of story because we're distracted by the pressure and emotions we feel in the moment.\n\nIsn't it true that your worst decisions were fueled by something with strong emotional appeal? Not rational, just emotional. That weekend. That first marriage. That purchase. That lease. It was so appealing you bought it.\n\nIt was so appealing you ate it. It was so appealing you dated that person and moved in with him or her. It was so appealing you jumped at the opportunity. If was so appealing you took it, smoked it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIt goes on and on. The reason we have regrets, the reason we look back and wonder what we were thinking is that we were presented with something that had strong emotional appeal.\n\nWhen confronted with a situation or decision that has strong emotional appeal, it's a good idea to press pause, not play. Not because he's not the one. He may be. Not because it's not a good investment. It may be. Not because it's not the perfect job. It may be.\n\nWe should step back because anything with strong emotional appeal — even the right thing —clouds our judgment. So pause. Get your bearings. Go home and think about it. Call a friend. Consider your story.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nConsidering your story draws you out of the immediate and focuses on the eventual. It empowers you to put the decision-making process within the broader context of the story of your life. Our story is future tense.

Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Erika Jayne's divorce from estranged husband Thomas Girardi just got a little more complicated.\n\nNews of their split broke in November after 21 years of marriage, and now, Girardi's brother has reportedly filed for conservatorship over him.\n\nA conservatorship is a form of legal guardianship, in which a conservator would oversee the finances -- and possibly the everyday life -- of a conservatee.\n\nAccording to People magazine, Girardi's brother Robert has requested he act as conservator over his 81-year-old brother, as he's allegedly having trouble taking care of himself -- both personally and financially.\n\nWHO IS ERIKA JAYNE'S ESTRANGED HUSBAND TOM GIRARDI?\n\nA court date is set for June 9.\n\nShould the conservatorship be approved, Robert will assume control of his brother's estate, as well as make decisions about his care and living arrangements, the outlet reports.\n\nThe high-power attorney's current condition has sadly deteriorated to the point where he cannot care for himself without assistance, the filing reportedly claimed.\n\nFurthermore, he can no longer afford to pay his housekeeper of 25 years, and his short-term memory is severely compromised and, on information and belief, he is often not oriented as to date, time or place.\n\nERIKA JAYNE'S HUSBAND TOM GIRARDI SUFFERING FROM MEMORY LOSS AMID DIVORCE AND LAWSUITS, BROTHER SAYS\n\nWhile Tom does have family members, such as Petitioner [Robert], and certain friends looking out for him to make sure he has sufficient food and that he makes it to a given appointment on time, reads the petition, left to his own devices, it is highly doubtful that Tom could manage most of the activities of daily living for any significant period of time without assistance.\n\nReps for Jayne, Thomas Girardi and Robert Girardi did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\n\nJust days ago, news broke that Robert had filed a petition requesting to be installed as his brother's guardian as he claimed that Girardi is no longer capable of making rational decisions on his own.\n\nGirardi also recently revealed that he's broke, reportedly saying that while he once had about 80 million or 50 million in cash, his money is now all gone.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGirardi shares no children with his 49-year-old pop star wife, but she has made references to multiple stepchildren on Housewives in the past.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nTo make the matter of their divorce even more complicated, both Girardi and the Rollercoaster singer are being sued for allegedly embezzling millions from plane crash victims' families to fund their rich and famous lifestyle.
Britain's Kensington Palace refused to comment on whether Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle and Prince Harry weren't among the friends who gathered to ring in Kate Middleton's 37th birthday.\n\nI'm afraid this isn't something we'd comment on, a rep for the palace told Fox News Monday.\n\nPeople Magazine previously reported Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton and husband Prince William celebrated her January 9 birthday every year with a gathering at their Norfolk home.\n\nAccording to the publication, the guest list for this year's celebration included William's old pals and his daughter Princess Charlotte's godparents Thomas van Straubenzee and James Meade, along with Meade's wife Laura. Tom Barber and his wife Davina – née Duckworth-Chad, William's distant cousin on his mother Princess Diana's side – as well as Tom and Harriet Sutton were also in attendance.\n\nHowever, reports are claiming Markle and husband Harry were absent from the festivities.\n\nSince Markle, 37, became an official member of the royal family when she tied the knot with Harry, 34, sources have claimed there has been a rift between the two women.\n\nWives do change the dynamic, and both [brothers] have very strong wives, a palace insider to People. If you bring two independent-minded women from the real world into the royal world, they are going to want to have an impact.\n\nThe first signs of distress came in November 2018, when The Telegraph reported that Markle made Middleton cry over an argument involving bridesmaid dresses for the former Suits star's wedding.\n\nThe alleged tension between the two duchesses has been widely rumored as the reason behind the announcement of Markle and Harry moving out of London's Kensington Palace, where Middleton and William, 36, reside.\n\nRoyal expert Leslie Carroll, who recently published a book titled American Princess: The Love Story of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, told Fox News that at the time of the purported bridesmaid dress incident, Middleton was still recovering from giving birth to her third child, Prince Louis, on April 23. Therefore, she would have naturally been in a more emotional state while the American actress was attempting to navigate her new life leading up to the royal wedding.\n\nKate was postpartum at that time, said Carroll. She's hormonal and sensitive. And the first thing anyone has ever said about Meghan was how kind she was. Her sorority sisters, her former teachers — the first word that came to anyone's mind was 'kind.' So the fact that Meghan was not kind implies other things were going on… She had so much on her plate, it wouldn't have been surprising if she did snap.\n\nIngrid Seward, the editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, has been covering the royal family since the 1980s and has written over 20 books on the subject. Her latest one, My Husband and I, analyzes the marriage of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. She said she agrees with Carroll's analysis.\n\nPeople forget Meghan is an LA girl, explained Seward. It's very difficult for her to suddenly come here and marry into the royal family. It's very, very difficult. I think Meghan thought she had an ally in Kate. But everything happened so quickly. Kate was pregnant and unwell. And then she had a new baby. So she couldn't give Meghan the attention she expected. And I think that's when things started to sour.\n\nI'm afraid there is [some] truth in these stories, added Seward. I don't think it's so much of a rivalry as much as these are two very different women that just don't have to be the best of friends. Why should they?
The 2020 Grammys came and went Sunday night, bringing with it a slew of weird and awkward moments throughout the lengthy broadcast.\n\nAs stars like Billie Eilish made a name for themselves by taking home several Grammy Awards, other celebrities such as Gwen Stefani, Nick Jonas and Demi Lovato had memorable, and in some cases embarrassing, moments at the 62nd annual show.\n\nFor those who missed the broadcast or simply need a recap of the strangest, most eye-catching bits of the night, below is a rundown of the 2020 Grammys' most memorable moments:\n\nA skeleton in the crowd\n\nIt didn't take long before shots of the crowd at the 2020 Grammys revealed a man wearing intense face paint in the second row. The person who chose to wear skeleton makeup at the show was none other than Prince Nasir Dean, the 19-year-old son of Swizz Beatz. The teenager's mother is Nicole Levy, but his dad is married to Grammys host, Alicia Keys, who even highlighted the face paint for a brief moment during the show.\n\nAccording to People, Dean even posted about the makeup while showing off his Grammys prep ahead of the show.\n\nSomething in Nick Jonas' teeth\n\nAs Nick Jonas performed What a Man Gotta Do along with his brothers, viewers were quick to notice that the 27-year-old musician seemed to have something stuck in his teeth.\n\nThe star, who attended the show with his wife, Priyanka Chopra, 37, took notice of the online chatter and winked to the embarrassment on Twitter shortly after he performed writing, And at least you all know I eat my greens.\n\nJonas and his brothers, Kevin and Joe – the Jonas Brothers – performed the songs Five More Minutes and Gotta Do.\n\nGwen Stefani dodges engagement questions\n\nThe No Doubt singer has been dating country music star Blake Shelton for several years and the duo is constantly asked about whether or not they plan to take the next step toward marriage. The 2020 Grammys red carpet was no exception.\n\nAfter Stefani gave a sweet answer about how the relationship with Shelton saved her life, he was asked how he can resist putting a ring on her finger. In an effort to let her boyfriend off the hook, Stefani joked that her already ring-adorned finger had no room for an engagement ring.\n\nI know, it's like Mr. T, look at that, Shelton joked.\n\nWith that, the two went on to perform their duet Nobody But You at the top of the broadcast and avoided further questions about a proposal.\n\nDemi Lovato had to restart her song\n\nDemi Lovato performed at the Grammys for the first time since her near-fatal overdose in July 2018.\n\nThe singer, 27, debuted her new song Anyone at the 2020 Grammy Awards on Sunday night and looked stunning in a white gown.\n\nAfter an introduction by Little Women director Greta Gerwing, Lovato was so overcome with emotion when she began to sing she paused to collect herself before starting the song again.\n\nThe lyrics touched her state of mind last July before her overdose. She actually wrote the song just before the incident.\n\nI tried to talk to my piano / I tried to talk to my guitar / Talked to my imagination / Confided into alcohol / I tried and tried and tried some more / Told secrets 'til my voice was sore / Tired of empty conversation / Cause no one hears me anymore, Lovato began.\n\nA hundred million stories / And a hundred million songs / I feel stupid when I sing / Nobody's listening to me / Nobody's listening / I talked to shooting stars / But they always get it wrong / I feel stupid when I pray / So, why am I praying anyway? / If nobody's listening, she continued.\n\nAnyone, please send me anyone / Lord, is there anyone? / I need someone / Anyone, please send me anyone / Lord, is there anyone? / I need someone.\n\nSharon Osbourne struggles to read rapper's names\n\nSharon and Ozzy Osbourne took the stage to announce the nominees for best rap/sung performance and immediately noted that they were an odd choice to announce a category that's so far away from the 71-year-old rocker and his 67-year-old wife's genre.\n\nHowever, The Talk co-host was undeterred as she brazenly forged ahead trying her best to announce names like DJ Khaled, Lil Baby & Gunna and Young Thug.\n\nPerhaps the most awkward moment was when the star broke to say, oh yeah, yeah yeah while shaking her arms as she started to get the hang of things.\n\nThe couple took the stage just days after Ozzy revealed to the world that he's been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.\n\nAriana Grande swearing\n\nThe person tasked with working the bleep button had their work cut out for them on the red carpet when Ariana Grande took the microphone.\n\nWhile giving an interview on the red carpet a large section of the 7 Rings singer's answer was bleeped out thanks to some off-color language. In fact, the star herself immediately realized her flub and covered her mouth before apologizing.\n\nAs Cosmopolitan notes, the 26-year-old was actually bleeped not once, but twice during her interview. Unfortunately, it's unclear specifically what the singer said that got her words cut out of the broadcast.\n\nFox News' Nate Day and Jessica Napoli contributed to this report.
This is a rush transcript from The Ingraham Angle, January 10, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nSEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Watch the whole thing. Laura Ingraham interviewing the President starts right now. See you, Monday.\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham, and this is the Ingraham Angle tonight from Washington. And do we have a show for you tonight? My exclusive interview with President Trump at the White House. It's been a wild week all around in Washington. Of course, the rest of the world. The President passed a monumental leadership test this week with flying colors. First, we had an Iranian missile attack in retaliation for the killing of terrorist mastermind Soleimani. Democrats of course predicted World War III would ensue. And as usual, the President proved them wrong. So, now hostilities aren't a deescalated state and Iran may and I underline may even come to the negotiating table. No one thought that was going to happen. Second, the President and the GOP held firm on impeachment. And boy, did that strategy pay off. After weeks of delay, Nancy Pelosi is finally caving, and she will transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate next week. Her plot to control the Senate trial has been completely foiled. Oops. Well, I had the great privilege of sitting down with the President for a wide-ranging interview today. He made news on all of these important topics and a lot more and he shared his plans for the New Year. Here's part one of my exclusive interview with President Trump.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Mr. President, thanks so much for being with us tonight.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you, Laura.\n\nINGRAHAM: Today, Mike Pompeo gave a very forceful press conference on the fallout from the Iranian jetliner going down. His concern is that people aren't understanding the imminent nature of the threat of Soleimani, and he was pressed on that today. He said, there were large scale attacks planned on U.S. facilities, but he didn't go more specific. Don't the American people have a right to know what specifically was targeted without revealing methods and sources?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I don't think so, but we will tell you that probably it was going to be the embassy in Baghdad. You saw that happening. You saw with all of the men, very few women circling it and circling it very strongly and very viciously, knocking out windows and trying to get in and they were close to getting in and I called out the military. They said, we'll have it there tomorrow. I said, no, you'll have it there today. We're not going to have another Benghazi on our hands. And we did a really amazing job, get no credit for it, but we never get credit for anything and that's OK. In the meantime, we have the greatest economy we've ever had, a lot of other things. But I think you would have had another Benghazi had we not acted quickly. That could have been stopped. And this was stopped. And we had our Apaches going there, the great helicopters and they were dropping flares all over the place and a lot of things were happening. They had action real fast and everybody disappeared.\n\nINGRAHAM: City of large-scale attacks planned for other embassies and if those were planned, why can't we reveal that to the American people? Wouldn't that help your case?\n\nTRUMP: I can reveal that I believe it would have been for embassies. And I think that probably Baghdad already started. They were really amazed that we came in with that kind of a force. We came in with very powerful force and drove them out. You know that ended almost immediately. But Baghdad certainly would have been the lead. But I think it would have been for embassy, could have been military bases, could have been a lot of other things too. But it was imminent and then all of a sudden, he was gone.\n\nINGRAHAM: Why is Nancy Pelosi describing her briefing as dismissive and disdainful? Mike Lee said it was insulting the Intel briefing. What wasn't said to mollify the concerns of some of your strongest supporters like Mike Lee?\n\nTRUMP: Yes, he is a great supporter. He is a friend of mine. He called me just a little while ago and he said, you know, I just wanted to get some more information and he was - look, I have also had calls from some of the senators, some of the congressmen said it was the single best briefing. One person said they've been there for 10 years. It's the single best briefing they've ever had. One said 20 years, the single best military briefing they've ever had. I understand what Mike had, Mike wanted certain things said and we just couldn't say, and we could probably say maybe individually to him and he's certainly a trustworthy person.\n\nINGRAHAM: Are you worried that the Democrats can't be trusted with classified information because that's kind of what it sounded like when Pence gave that interview and talked about sources and methods the other day.\n\nTRUMP: I am worried about it. Certainly, I am worried about it. Can you imagine, here we are split second timing executed like nobody has seen in many, many years on Soleimani. Can you imagine, they want us to call up and speak to crooked corrupt politician, Adam Schiff. Oh! Adam, we have somebody that we've been trying to get for a long time. We have a shot at him right now. Could we meet so that we can get your approval Adam Schiff. And he'd say well, let's do it in a couple of days. Oh! OK. Let's meet in a couple - it doesn't work that way. Number one. Number two, they leak. Anything we give will be leaked immediately. You'll see breaking news. We're about to attack in 25 minutes or do something. And by the way, I'm not somebody that wants to attack. I probably could have attacked five times, 10 times having to do with Iran. I've been very guarded because I don't want to do that. But we may have to do something. We have to be in a position where we can do it even from the negotiating standpoint. But hopefully it won't be necessary. We have tremendous sanctions. They're doing very poorly. They have riots all over their country and they could straighten out easy. But it's up to them. Whatever they want to be.\n\nINGRAHAM: Speaking of sanctions, Ilhan Omar, I think said today that this is akin to economic warfare against Iran, even though she supports sanctions against Israel.\n\nTRUMP: Yes. She hates Israel. She hates Jewish people. You just have to take a look at her rhetoric. It's incredible what's happened to the Democrats in Congress. They used to be supportive of Israel. Today, they're supportive of her and Tlaib. That's another real winner. Tlaib and AOC who knows nothing. AOC knows nothing. Poor student, poor everything and then she comes, and she talks about the Green New Deal and all these poor fools say, isn't it wonderful, isn't it wonderful. But you know as I said last night in Ohio, I don't like talking about the Green New Deal, it's too early. I want to save it for about two weeks before because they may change their mind.\n\nINGRAHAM: Bernie Sanders was out. You're not surprised to hear this, discussing Iran. What happened. And he basically said this.\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Just as we were led into Vietnam and Iraq by lies, the Trump administration is misleading us on Iran. They just did the assassination of Qasem Soleimani by claiming that he was planning imminent attacks and yet they produce no evidence that would justify this claim, not even in a classified setting.\n\nTRUMP: I don't see it happening. We are there for a very, very strong reason. They cannot have nuclear weapons. The Iran nuclear deal signed by President Obama gave 150 billion and that's when the real terrorist started. They took that money and they used it all over the place. You look at Yemen, you look at all of the things that were happening including Syria. They were using, Pallister (ph) gave 1.8 billion in cash, 1.7, 1.8 billion in cash. Green cash, beautiful green cash. You almost - how do they have the power to do this plane load of cash and instead of Iran saying, thank you very much. It's really nice. Let's go and get along. Let's do well. Let's do deals together. Let's build buildings in Iran. They said, Death to America and they said it when they were signing. When Kerry signed, and by the way, Kerry violated the Logan Act.\n\nINGRAHAM: He's out there. He's out there just slamming you.\n\nTRUMP: He totally violated. This man totally violated the Logan Act with his conversations. OK. But when Kerry was out there and making the deal and they had people screaming, Death to America, Death to America, who signs a deal while they're screaming Death to America.\n\nINGRAHAM: They're saying you destabilized the Middle East after campaigning as a man of restraint, not interventionism. Elizabeth Warren is saying this, Kerry saying this, all the old Obama folks are out there, Susan Rice, they're all kind of waiting in the wings, like see he's the guy that we told you he was.\n\nTRUMP: If you look at the Middle East right now, it's much tamer than it was when I got in. When I got in, it was just all over the place. Number one, we got rid of the caliphate, the ISIS caliphate. We have tens of thousands of ISIS prisoners. We've killed most of their fighters. We've gotten rid of ISIS. Now they come back and we take care of it. Other people should take care of it. Other countries should take care of it. Europe should take them back.\n\nINGRAHAM: Is NATO going to actually step up? I know they're committed to doing more in the Middle East. But what specifically is NATO going to contribute that's going to take some of the burden off the American taxpayers.\n\nTRUMP: So, when I came in as you know NATO was virtually a dead organization. It had no money. Nobody was paying except us. Practically nobody was paying. If you look at a chart of money and funds received, it looked like a rollercoaster down. Now, and Secretary Stoltenberg, I think he's terrific. In my first year, I raised $130 billion from them, not from us. And now he just announced $530 billion, all because of me. He's my biggest salesman. My greatest salesman Secretary Stoltenberg. But I said to him, look, you're there for Russia and Europe. OK. By the way, NATO is much more for Europe than it is for us and yet we--\n\nINGRAHAM: What are we protecting them from now, all the money we're spending in NATO. Who are we protecting them from?\n\nTRUMP: Well, they build an office building for $3 billion. They do lots of things that they shouldn't be doing before I got here. But I raised a lot of money. We can use NATO in other locations. We can use NATO as an example in the Middle East. And that's what we should do. I think frankly it's more palatable to countries in the Middle East, if an international force comes in rather than just the United States. And from our standpoint, let somebody else pay for it. Why are we always paying? We pay for everything. One thing, I moved our troops out of Syria - on the border between Turkey and Syria. That turned out to be such a successful move, Laura. Look what happened. Now they protect it. They've been fighting over that border for a thousand years. Why should we do it? And then they say, he left troops in Syria. You know what I did, I left troops to take the oil. I took the oil. The only troops I have are taking the oil. They're protecting the oil. I took over the oil.\n\nINGRAHAM: We're taking, we're not taking--\n\nTRUMP: Maybe we will, maybe we won't.\n\nINGRAHAM: They're protecting their facility.\n\nTRUMP: I don't know maybe we should take it. But we have the oil. Right now, the United States has the oil. So, they say, he left troops in Syria. No, I got rid of all of them other than we're protecting the oil. We have the oil.\n\nINGRAHAM: The Wall Street Journal is reporting today that after this strike, Mr. Trump told associates he was under pressure to deal with General Soleimani, take him out. From GOP senators, he views as important supporters in the coming impeachment trial in the Senate. Associates said sounds like you've got a leaker here in the White House or someone. What is it, it's just fake?\n\nTRUMP: They just made it up. It's fake news.\n\nINGRAHAM: OK. Wall Street Journal.\n\nTRUMP: They use the term, leakers. They just make it up. They're all very dishonest. Most of them are really - I mean 80 percent are dishonest and I mean really dishonest. They made that story up.\n\nINGRAHAM: So, no concern about Lindsey Graham or--\n\nTRUMP: No, not at all. By the way, absolutely not at all. We have tremendous support. Look in the House we own 196 to nothing and we got three Democrats. So therefore, it was bipartisan, I guess you could say. We got nothing. They had nothing. We didn't lose one Republican vote. As you know, that's very unusual. In the Senate I think I have the same if not more support, I don't have to do that. I would never compromise what we're doing with Iran and potential war and all of the things that we're doing so well--\n\nINGRAHAM: So, we're not doing Bush 2.0 here? This is not Bush 2.0. This is not WMD.\n\nTRUMP: You know what I want in the Middle East, I don't want people having nuclear weapons because they'll use them. I don't want people having nuclear weapons. That's my biggest thing.\n\nINGRAHAM: Well, John Kerry was out there yesterday saying, well, you guys got out of the Iran deal and that's what's caused all this tension.\n\nTRUMP: By the way, you know how bad the Iran deal was? The Iran deal, I did a great thing getting out of the Iran deal. They gave 150 billion, they gave 1.8 and forget that. You couldn't do inspections of the most important locations. And you know another big thing, they have the right to do ballistic missiles. We couldn't go into areas and look; we'd have to give massive notice. So, if they were doing something that they could clean them up, it was ridiculous. But most importantly, it expires. This is a short-term agreement. And now once it expired, they have an absolute clear, unstopped path of nuclear weapons. Unstopped. In a very short period of time, the deal that President Obama made with John Kerry, who may be the worst negotiator I've ever seen that deal expires and you know what? Once it expires, you can't do what I did. I mean because they have a deal that says once it expires, they can do what they want to do. You cannot let Iran have a nuclear weapon. That's what I'm doing.\n\nINGRAHAM: Pete Buttigieg and other Democrats, I predicted this when I talked to Mike Pompeo yesterday are actually blaming your moves against Iran for the downing of that commercial jetliner in Iran, in Tehran, the night of the strikes by Iran to our Iraqi facilities. Your reaction to that charge?\n\nTRUMP: Well, a couple of people started that, and they got hit real fast by a lot of different people, not me. I think it's just low life. Look, he's not going anywhere. He was a lousy mayor of a place that is not doing well, and Indiana is doing unbelievably. Indiana, the state had the best year they've ever had. Thank you very much. But that city was badly run. You look at what's going on.\n\nINGRAHAM: Jackie Speier saying on this too.\n\nTRUMP: He's going nowhere. And she's another beauty. I mean take a look at her past. Check out her past please.\n\nINGRAHAM: The Iraqi Prime Minister has notified Mike Pompeo about potential plans, drawing up plans for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq. You ran on pulling out of the Middle East, why not use this opportunity to say, we're done.\n\nTRUMP: I'm OK with it. By the way--\n\nINGRAHAM: You're OK with removing our troops from Iraq?\n\nTRUMP: That's what they say publicly. They don't say that privately because if we leave that means they're not going to be--\n\nINGRAHAM: Why not leave?\n\nTRUMP: I'm not so bad with it. When I heard that I said I have it down to 5000 troops. We had many, many troops there in Iraq and we're there only in a training. We trained them. But if they'd want us to leave, but they speak different publicly than they do privately.\n\nINGRAHAM: But are we sending more troops to the region as we speak?\n\nTRUMP: We're sending more to Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia is paying us for it. We're doing something that nobody has ever done. I said to Saudi Arabia, we have a very good relationship with Saudi Arabia, I said listen, you're a very rich country. You want more troops. I'm going to send them to you. But you've got to pay us. They're paying us. They've already deposited $1 billion in the bank. We are going to help them, but these rich countries have to pay for it. South Korea gave us $500 million. They never gave us - they gave us $500 million. I said you're going to help us along. We have 32,000 soldiers in South Korea protecting you from North Korea. You've got to pay. And they gave us $500 million. I mean you should have breaking news because nobody wants to report that stuff. I'm not sure anybody knows it. I might be sort of saying it, you have some - I mean its good stuff. But they are a wealthy country. They build all your television sets. They took that away from us. They build the ships. They build a lot of things. I said look, we're protecting you. You've got to pay. They paid us $500 million. They're going to pay us a lot more.\n\nINGRAHAM: Do you think that Iraq should repay the American taxpayer for these bases?\n\nTRUMP: Sure.\n\nINGRAHAM: For what we've done there.\n\nTRUMP: You heard that from me. OK.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes. Why don't we (ph).\n\nTRUMP: I said we built one of the world's most expensive airport facilities anywhere in the world. I mean I wish we had it in New York. I wish we had it in Washington. We build runways that are 15,000 feet long at LaGuardia, they're 7000 feet long. In fact, I think they're 20,000 feet long over there and deep thick concrete and steel. Nobody ever built runways like this. OK, it's way overbuilt, but that's OK. But we have billions of dollars into that. I said if we leave, you've got to pay us. If we leave, you have to pay us for embassies, you have to pay us for the money we put in.\n\nINGRAHAM: How you're going to collect.\n\nTRUMP: Well, we have a lot of their money right now. We have a lot of their money. We have $35 billion of their money right now sitting in an account. And I think they'll agree to pay. I think they'll agree to pay. Otherwise, we'll stay there.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Up ahead, my exclusive interview with President Trump continues. His thoughts on Nancy Pelosi's failed political gambit. The big news that the speaker is sending the articles to the Senate. And later, Raymond Arroyo reacts to the President's thoughts on the rogue royals and a lot more. Breaking news all ahead. Stay there.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Mr. President, we just learned that Nancy Pelosi is now, she's sending articles of impeachment next week to the Senate. What's your reaction?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I think it's ridiculous. She should have sent them a long time ago. It just - it belittles the process. What they've done to impeachment. It's like I was interviewed by a very, very good writer, reporter somebody that you know very well. I can say Bob Woodward. He said, he's doing something and this time, I said maybe I'll sit down, because nobody has done more than me. I mean nobody - if you look at three years with the economy, with regulations, with the tax cuts, with everything, and all the things, we've rebuilt our military. Our military was totally depleted. Our military was old and depleted. And he said you know you don't look like somebody who's under impeachment, as you know he's slightly covered Nixon and he covered Clinton. But Bob Woodward, he said, you actually look like you've won everything, you look happy. I said, I am happy. So maybe I'm wired a little bit different.\n\nINGRAHAM: Impeachment managers anyone that you would prefer to see, she has a name--\n\nTRUMP: Well, we have a team.\n\nINGRAHAM: Her impeachment managers. They have a name--\n\nTRUMP: Well, I would love to ask a couple of their people some questions like Schiff, why did he lie? Why did he make up my statement? Totally made it up. But again, the whole thing unraveled when I put in the transcript because it's all about the transcript and it's all about the President of Ukraine saying, he did nothing.\n\nINGRAHAM: How long do you think this will last?\n\nTRUMP: Well, it depends. If they have a trial, probably takes a few days or a week and unless we want to have a bigger trial, where we bring in the whistleblower which I'd love to do, and I'd love to bring in the informer who disappeared. I'd love to bring in the second whistleblower who disappeared. I'd love to bring in the Inspector General. Why did he bring it up there? He should have never done it. He didn't want to see the call. He didn't want to see the call. He took this whistleblower, who's a fraud. He took the whistleblowers' report and he put it in. They said to him, no, if that's the case, if you have to do that, what we'll do is we'll show you the actual call. No, no, I don't want to see it. What's that all about? Why did he do that? Inspector General, so I'd like to interview the Inspector General. Why did he do that and put everybody through--\n\nINGRAHAM: You're worried about future presidents, what this is going to do to the presidency in the future?\n\nTRUMP: I think it cheapened the word impeachment. I think impeachment is a very ugly word, but I think this cheapen the word impeachment. I think Nancy Pelosi and Schiff, because he's corrupt. I mean he's the guy stands up at the United States Congress and repeats a conversation except it was a fraud. He made up a conversation. He was saying my conversation and it was totally wrong and he knew it. He said, don't call me, I'll call you. That's from the Godfather. That's a mafia statement. I never said that. He said eight times quid pro quo. It was no times. He made up a conversation and repeated it in front of Congress and because he has immunity, we can't do anything about it. I'd like to say, why did you do that? Now, these people are frauds and it's very bad. No, they've cheapened the word impeachment. It's a bad word to start off with. I really say, it's an ugly word. To me, it's a very ugly word, but maybe it played to our benefit.\n\nINGRAHAM: When we talk about impeachment now, it looks like McConnell is agreeing with Josh Holly's (ph)--\n\nTRUMP: Good.\n\nINGRAHAM: Proposition to dismiss these articles of impeachment, if Pelosi doesn't send them over. My question to you is, why not have it dismissed today? Why would McConnell just say, we're done with these games or do you want a trial, you want one?\n\nTRUMP: In many ways, I'd like a trial. And I'd love to have Sleepy Joe Biden. I'd love to have his son. I call him Where's Hunter, I've changed his first name to Where, Where's Hunter. I'd love to have the whistleblower who wrote a fake report. The whistleblower is a person that is you know who the whistleblower is. By the way, everybody knows who the whistleblower is.\n\nINGRAHAM: Whistleblower is still working in the White House?\n\nTRUMP: Everybody - I don't want to say. But everybody knows about the whistleblower and they know about the whistleblower's lawyer. But then, do you remember, there was a second whistleblower. I want to know what happened to the second whistleblower. What happened to the informer? Remember that an informer. They all disappeared when I gave the transcript because I gave a transcript and that blew everything apart, because we have an accurate. And if the only thing covered by the hearings was that now people agree. Everybody. Even our great Lieutenant Colonel, please call him Lieutenant Colonel or great Lieutenant Colonel agrees that the transcript was accurate. I think he had one word different. We'll change the one word, it meant absolutely nothing. The transcript was professionally done by the best people there. Just one second. So, we have a transcript. They never thought I'd release it. They probably never thought I had it. I can only say thank goodness they had it because otherwise I would have been falsely accused and it would have been sadly my word against them. But we had other people on that call. Think of this. I was going to do something wrong on a call where I know there are many people listening.\n\nINGRAHAM: Always.\n\nTRUMP: The President of Ukraine said, I did absolutely nothing wrong. He said, I had no pressure whatsoever. He didn't even know what we were talking about. And we called them before I released the transcript, because it's a terrible thing to have to release a conversation with a leader from another country, it's a terrible thing. I mean what are other countries other than Ukraine, what are they saying. So, anyway, they have no case.\n\nINGRAHAM: Why not call Bolton, why not allow him to testify. This thing is bogus.\n\nTRUMP: I would have no problem other than one thing. You can't be in the White House as President's future. I'm talking about future, many future presidents and have a security adviser. Anybody having to do with security and legal and other things.\n\nINGRAHAM: You're going to invoke Executive Privilege?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I think you have to for the sake of the office. I would love everybody to testify. I like Mick to testify. I like Mike Pompeo to testify. I like Rick Perry to testify. I want everybody, but there are things you can't do from the standpoint of Executive Privilege. You have to maintain that. So, we'll see where it all goes. But especially, a National Security Adviser, you can't have him explaining all of your statements about national security concerning Russia, China, North Korea, everything. We just can't do that. I think for the good of the office. Look, Nancy Pelosi will go down as probably the least successful Speaker of the House in the history of our nation. She has done nothing. The only thing she's done is she finally get done one of the best trade deals our country has ever made, the USMCA. That's with Mexico and Canada. But I did that. She doesn't even know what it says. She has no idea what it says. She was forced to do that. You know why? She wouldn't have done it, but she did nothing. So, now she can say, I signed something. She is obsessed with impeachment. She has done nothing. She's going to go down as one of the worst Speakers in the history of our country. Now, in all fairness, she's hurting our country. She's very bad for our country and she's become a crazed lunatic. But she will go down as I think maybe the worst Speaker in the history of our country.\n\nINGRAHAM: How do you get--\n\nTRUMP: And she'll be overthrown pretty soon, because she's doing very little. And the people are tired of it. And she's controlled by the radical Left. She's controlled by AOC. She's controlled by this Tlaib, it's another great one and she's controlled by Omar.\n\nINGRAHAM: We just heard that, they are thinking about adding another article on impeachment. They're floating this to include the events of the last few weeks. Here's what Chuck Schumer just said.\n\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Over the past few weeks, there have been several crucial disclosures of evidence that appear to further incriminate the President. Each disclosure bolstering the argument we Democrats have made for a trial that features the relevant witnesses and documents.\n\nINGRAHAM: Your reaction to their potentially adding to articles of impeachment. They still haven't delivered to the Senate floor.\n\nTRUMP: So, they can't win an election that's going to take place in 10 months. They know that and the only thing they can do, it's like quit there (ph). Congressman Green, when he said we can't beat him, we have to impeach him. And they all know that. They're making things up. This is the craziest thing anyone has ever seen. And the two articles that they put in, as you know, they're not crimes. They're not even allowed to be put in. It's a disgrace.\n\nINGRAHAM: Does it not show the weakness of their case, but they're still trying to rebrand this as something else?\n\nTRUMP: I think it's incredible.\n\nINGRAHAM: I've never seen anything like this. This is--\n\nTRUMP: I think it's incredible. I think it's really hurting them. Look, my numbers are the highest, my poll numbers. You have this guy that goes on television all the time. He gives phony numbers. My poll, as you know, my poll numbers right now today are the highest they've ever been. And, by the way, people love that we took this horrible terrorist. They love it, Soleimani. The love that we took him out. They think it's so fantastic. He should have been taken out over the last 20 years by somebody. He should have been taken out a long time ago. But my numbers are the highest they've ever been, and a lot of it is because of the impeachment hoax. It's a hoax. How would you like to be two, two-and-a-half years, I'm under investigation, federal investigation before I even ran, in my opinion, before I came down the escalator. But from the time I came down the escalator, I have been under investigation. They found nothing. They found nothing. Who else do you think in Washington --\n\nINGRAHAM: Few could have withstood it.\n\nTRUMP: No, no. Think of it, not only withstood it mentally. And I think --\n\nINGRAHAM: But accomplished.\n\nTRUMP: -- it actually energizes you, yes, because it makes me angry. But think, who else could have withstood that? You take some of these Democrat senators, they couldn't withstand it. You know what would happen? Number, one, they would fold up like an umbrella. And number two, they'd be guilty of a lot of stuff.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nINGRAHAM: More of my exclusive interview with President Trump in just moments. His thoughts on immigration, bringing in all those foreign workers, the economy, and whether he really trusts Google in the election year. Plus, a little later on, his thoughts on the latest royal scandal. Stay there.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Aishah Hasnie. Bernie Sanders leading in Iowa with the first nominating contest just weeks away. Twenty percent of likely Democratic caucus goers support the Vermont senators, that's according to the latest Des Moines Register/CNN poll. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is in second place with 17 percent, and former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is third with 16 percent, and former V.P. Joe Biden has 15 percent. The Iowa caucuses are on February 3rd. Meantime, Texas is cracking down on new refugees. Governor Greg Abbott says his state is already overwhelmed and is now rejecting resettlements. It is the first state in the nation to do so under a Trump administration order granting local governments that authority. Abbott's decision is being denounced by refugee advocates and others. I'm Aishah Hasnie. Now back to The Ingraham Angle.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nINGRAHAM: You slapped the sanctions back on China, the tariffs, the extra tariffs, if they don't fulfill what they said they would do --\n\nTRUMP: Yes, well, I have the right to do that. But people don't realize, I still have the tariffs, 25 percent tariffs on China on $250 billion worth of goods. I still have those. And by the way, remember, they used to say we pay for it. No, no. China devalued their currency and they pay for it. And we have a great relationship with China right now. So I don't want to speak badly of anyone, but they are having the worst year that they've had. The last year was the worst year they've had in 67, it was 57, now it's 67 years. And they wanted to make a deal, and we made a deal. And it's a great deal. Now we have a phase two deal which will start at some point, but phase one was very important for banking. You know what we did, we opened it up to banking, but for banking, for our farmers, for manufacturers, it's a great, it's a great --\n\nINGRAHAM: If China, though, is --\n\nTRUMP: We have a lot of these deals that I've made, South Korea, Japan. Japan --\n\nINGRAHAM: Undocumented all of this. No one else has touched it.\n\nTRUMP: Remember this, they are all kicking in now. We didn't have anything. We had horrible deals or no deal. The Japan deal, we had no deal. We are getting $40 billion. What this is going to do for our economy is going to be amazing. And it was just signed a month ago, it's just now kicking in.\n\nINGRAHAM: On the human rights issue in China, you don't talk a lot about it, but it concerns a lot of your strongest supporters, evangelical Christians, Catholics, other people who are really concerned about human rights. You've got 1 million people in reeducation camps, internment camps, Catholics getting missiles in their pews at Christmas that had tributes to Xi instead of Silent Night, crazy stuff happening. Reagan saw the power of the moral argument for freedom and married it to the economic and military argument for peace through strength. Can you do more on that front without damaging your ability to make future trade agreements, more on the human rights front?\n\nTRUMP: Well, we're riding a fine line, because we are making not good trade deals. We're making great trade deals.\n\nINGRAHAM: But human rights count.\n\nTRUMP: They do count. And when you say Reagan, look, I was a big fan of Reagan, but he wasn't heavy into it. He wanted to do certain things, he wasn't really heavy into it. But he wasn't also making trade deals. He let Japan come in and take our automobile market. As much as I like Reagan, he was not good on trade.\n\nINGRAHAM: He didn't trade with the Soviet Union at all. We didn't have a big bunch of students from the Soviet Union coming into the United States.\n\nTRUMP: I think we should be able to trade with Russia. I think we should be able -- I think getting along -- by the way, getting along with Russia, now that the witch hunt has ended having to do with Russia, now that they spend $45 million, found nothing.\n\nINGRAHAM: Mr. President when you look at the trajectory of your administration, huge progress on trade, incredible progress on dealing with our political foes, ISIS, incredible deregulation, judges, you've done a lot. On the economy today, we found out that still added 146,000 jobs, unemployment historically low at 3.5 percent. But we do have a little bit of a stall out on wage growth, which you ran on, and we've seen some, 2.9 percent last year, 0.1 percent over the last month.\n\nTRUMP: I know.\n\nINGRAHAM: But we don't have a tight labor market. If we had a tight labor market, we'd be seeing real increases in wages. I hear that your team is planning on advocating more foreign workers coming in for some of these high-tech companies. I'm very concerned about that, as are a lot of your supporters.\n\nTRUMP: And so is Mark Levin a little bit.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes, we are concerned, because Americans --\n\nTRUMP: So is the great Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs is concerned, too. But I'll say, Lou, here is the problem. I am demanding that Japan and all these countries that have these massive, we have trade deficits like nobody has ever seen before. I said you have to open up. I call Prime Minister Abe, he's a friend of mine. I say Shinzo, you have got to open up more plants in the United States. And they tell me, we want to do it, we want to do it. They start opening. They can't get labor. We need help. Otherwise, we could just say don't open up --\n\nINGRAHAM: If they couldn't get labor, wages would be going up. But wages aren't going up.\n\nTRUMP: Wage are going up.\n\nINGRAHAM: Not in the high-tech industry. We are seeing a plateauing of wages.\n\nTRUMP: It went up three percent and it went up 2.9 percent. In the last two year, wages have gone up more than they have 25 years.\n\nINGRAHAM: But for Google, why reward Google? Google is working against you in the campaign.\n\nTRUMP: I don't want to reward Google. I'm not a fan. I'm not a fan of Google.\n\nINGRAHAM: All they want is low skilled workers, low paid workers.\n\nTRUMP: I'm not a fan of Google. I'm a fan of great companies, OK.\n\nINGRAHAM: You did not run on bringing more foreign workers into the United States.\n\nTRUMP: It's not foreign workers. We have to allow smart people to stay in our country. Your graduate number one in your class at Harvard. You graduate from the Wharton Schools of --\n\nINGRAHAM: That's a small percentage of what they want.\n\nTRUMP: No, it's not. It's a lot.\n\nINGRAHAM: But you ran on people training their foreign replacements -- you ran against that. The Americans, it's humiliating for an American worked for a company for 30 years, now is told you have to train your foreign replacement, he's going to live in Korea, and you're going to pay him 20 percent.\n\nTRUMP: No, no, that's different. I would never do that. But we do need workers in our country. And I do want immigration policy. Nobody's been better on immigration then me. By the way we won the funding for the wall, and the wall has been built anyway because I was taking it out of the military and everything else. And now it's easier. We need people come. I got Foxconn to go into Wisconsin. They have to get people. They spent a fortune, they built the most incredible plant I've ever seen in Wisconsin, Foxconn --\n\nINGRAHAM: They why should we have American graduates of colleges and universities taking those jobs?\n\nTRUMP: We do. No, we do, we do, but we don't have enough of them. We don't have enough of them. And we have to be competitive with the rest of the world, too. The companies want to hire these people.\n\nINGRAHAM: They want to hear people they can hire for the cheapest amount because that's what they want.\n\nTRUMP: I'm not talking about cheap. I'm talking about brainpower. They want to hire smart people. And those people are thrown out of the country. We can't do that.\n\nINGRAHAM: You ran on America first.\n\nTRUMP: No, this is America first.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right, I'm going to keep going.\n\nTRUMP: Excuse, I just have to finish this. If we tell smart people to get the hell out --\n\nINGRAHAM: That's not what we are saying.\n\nTRUMP: That's a bad thing.\n\nINGRAHAM: There is a never-ending appetite on the part of corporate America to bring in as much cheap labor as possible to drive down wages. That's going to happen.\n\nTRUMP: Laura, I have so many people coming into this country, you're not going to have to worry about it. It's always going to be a shortage. If somebody smart sitting in this position, we have so many companies coming in from Japan. Japan is doing many car companies. China now is going to start building a lot of things. They haven't been doing it too much. We have so many companies wanting to come in, and they don't have the labor. But they're coming in.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right.\n\nTRUMP: We're doing great. Our country is doing great, our economy is doing great.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nINGRAHAM: Coming up, the president on the Queen's Harry situation, and the news that the Olympics proposing to ban athletes' protests, politics particularly. Does he think that should happen here? Then our own Raymond Arroyo, will join me with reaction. Stay there.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nINGRAHAM: Mr. President, I know you were close to the Queen, and she has a lot of affection for you. You have great visits over there.\n\nTRUMP: We have a great relationship.\n\nINGRAHAM: Would you be able to give her any advice for some of the rogue royals? What's happening there? It seems like there's a lot of tumult. And you've been so good at keeping your kids together in a close-knit family.\n\nTRUMP: I think it's sad. I do. I think it's sad. She is a great woman. I sat with her. I was supposed to be with her 15 minutes, I stayed an hour- and-a-half. By the way, I got killed by the press. She wanted me to stay. The press had no, no, he was supposed to be there, it's very rude. We had a great time. Then we had dinner. We were honored. Our country was honored. I sat with her for a long time, and she was smiling and laughing the whole time.\n\nINGRAHAM: Protocol is important for her. She has the tradition of the monarchy and the responsibilities.\n\nTRUMP: But we have a very great relationship. I think this was a blindside, she was blindsided by this whole situation, and I think it is too bad. But she has been, the Queen, it has to be an all-time record appeared. From the time she was 25, and now she's 94, she has never made a mistake, if you look. She's had like a flawless time.\n\nINGRAHAM: Do you think Harry should go back, come back and fix this?\n\nTRUMP: I think -- I don't want to get into the whole thing. But I find it, I just have such respect for the Queen, I don't think this should be happening to her.\n\nINGRAHAM: IOC announced today, and this is our final question, Mr. President, just announced that no politics at the upcoming Olympics, new policy, by any of the athletes. Would you like to see that extended to the United States where politics stay out of sports? I know you are going to the big LSU-Clemson game.\n\nTRUMP: I am, and I was responsible for getting the Olympics. The Olympics is coming to Los Angeles. And I was called by the mayor, and he said, could you do us a favor when I was president-elect. And he said, could you do us, and I worked very hard, and we got the Olympics. And we have the World Cup coming into the United States. And I don't know, I guess you can say no politics, but people are going to talk politics. I think politics -- I do believe I have made politics somewhat more exciting. The New York Times would be dead right now. It would be out of business.\n\nINGRAHAM: What are they going to do without you?\n\nTRUMP: The Washington Post would be out of business. I hate to say it, but cable television would be obsolete. Cable television would be out of business. So we'll go hopefully another five years, and we'll keep everybody happy. Thank you very much.\n\nINGRAHAM: Thank you so much. Fantastic.\n\nTRUMP: Thank you very much.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nINGRAHAM: President Trump offering his thoughts on the latest royal scandal across the pond, and banning political speech at the Olympics. FOX News contributor Raymond Arroyo is at the White House with me for this exclusive interview today. He joins us now. Raymond, I think Trump looked like he was in fighting form today. Look, no one sleeps, he doesn't sleep, I don't sleep, nobody sleeps, but he is unbelievably resilient.\n\nRAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: He was on it, he was on it today. He was feisty, he had great humor. Laura, look, I always say his ability to greet opposition with a laugh and kind of diffuse people with that humor, that is a great quality to have in an office like this, particularly as you go into a campaign. He also went out of his way to take pictures with the entire team that was with us today. Unbelievable, really went out of his way. You made a lot of news in that interview lady. We learned that four embassies were targeted by Soleimani. For the first time he said the Iraqi government privately wants the U.S. to stay in their country. And he sounded off on Pelosi and the whole impeachment imbroglio. And for the first time, the president said he would invoke executive privilege to keep Bolton from testifying. Oh, and you and the president apparently our great sparring partner when it comes to Chinese and foreign workers coming into the country.\n\nINGRAHAM: Foreign workers. The thing that he also said which didn't get a lot of play, but people should take note of, when I pressed him about whether, why not our troops out of Iraq? That is what he ran on. I said, would you be OK with that? He said that I'd be OK with that, but that's not --\n\nARROYO: Privately that's not what he saying.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes, he basically said I would be OK with that, but he's pulled in between.\n\nARROYO: Speaking of buts, I want to turn back to what the president said about Harry and Meghan Markle's royal temper tantrum.\n\nINGRAHAM: Megxit.\n\nARROYO: Or Megxit as they are calling it in the U.K. press. Madame Tussauds has separated Harry and Meghan, their wax works at least, from the rest of the royals at their --\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nARROYO: They cordoned them off. They went away, bye-bye. That is what you call a big step back. The royal family is holed up in emergency meetings with Harry while Meghan is already in Canada. Meanwhile, the president is sticking up for the Queen, and CNN, Laura, had the most incredible coverage of the day. In their telling him it was racism that forced Megharry away.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let's talk about whether race has played a role in this royal feud.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Prince Harry, he has complained about how his wife has been treated, and he has specifically said part of it is because of racism.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think she should come to North America. We are much more welcoming. We will embrace you.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nARROYO: You know, it was not raised that through these two away. It was rude that ticked the royal family off. This is the duke and duchess sucking up to the celebrities. That's all they've ever done. Oprah has come out to support them. But look, if you want to trade on your title, you have to live up to the office. And the royals are not just liberties. There are public functions and responsibilities. But my take on this is the Queen, as the president rightly said, 65 years on the throne, she has taken them to World War II, the Falklands, Diana, Brexit. Meghan Markle is hardly a challenge for this lady. She will survive and so will the royals.\n\nINGRAHAM: I think she is looking at this thing going oh, the petty squabbles of the youth.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nARROYO: But Laura, if they were racist, why would she let Harry marry her in the first place? They would have called the marriage off.\n\nINGRAHAM: Why would Khizr (ph) Khan be the mayor of London? I mean, this is just ridiculous. It has nothing to do with that, but this is all the left has. They were talking about the Situation Room photo from the night that the Iranians were lobbing those roman candles toward out military installations, and they said, look at the Situation Room photo. Not diverse enough. Only one woman, Stephanie Grisham, all white men in the room. So this is their focus, not whether America is better off or not.\n\nARROYO: Or that the best people are around the table who are experts in the field. We have got to go to the Olympic message of the president. You asked about the International Olympics Committee saying we don't want any political displays during these medal ceremonies. The president kind of dodged your answer dodged your question a little bit. But I like this idea. It allows us to come together, lets sports be a means of bringing people together. Don't divide people with your political messages. I would like to see in the United States, not only in the Olympics.\n\nINGRAHAM: I'd say shut up and compete. That is not as good as showed up and sing, shut up and compete.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nARROYO: Great job, congratulations on that.\n\nINGRAHAM: It was a lot of fun. It could have been a more -- every night there is something. Next week the trial is going to start the couple of days after Martin Luther King holiday. So that is going to start in earnest then.\n\nARROYO: And then the State of the Union. It's going to be a big year.\n\nINGRAHAM: And the Super Bowl, anything else. Raymond, thanks so much. Have a great weekend.\n\nARROYO: Thank you.\n\nINGRAHAM: My final thoughts on this amazing week when we return.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nINGRAHAM: What a week of shows. We had the breaking news on the missile strike on Tuesday. Then we had the secretary of state with us last night. And the president joining us for another exclusive tonight. And I'm telling you, the news shows no signs of slowing down next week because we expect the articles of impeachment to hit the Senate Tuesday or maybe Wednesday. And as always, we hope you join us right here for all of the breaking news, and the best analysis, and a little humor, you need that, too. So that's it from us tonight in Washington.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2020 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Roman Catholic bishops criticized on Friday President Biden's recent executive order on applying anti-discrimination protections to certain groups, arguing it didn't properly account for religious liberty and furthered false theories on human sexuality.\n\nWednesday's order, they said, threatens to infringe the rights of people who recognize the truth of sexual difference or who uphold the institution of lifelong marriage between one man and one woman. This may manifest in mandates that, for example, erode health care conscience rights or needed and time-honored sex-specific spaces and activities.\n\nSigned by bishops from across the country, the statement represented another sharp disagreement Church leadership had with the second U.S. president to identify as Roman Catholic.\n\nThe executive order referenced the Supreme Court's decision last year in Bostock v. Clayton County, in which Justice Neil Gorsuch issued a controversial opinion on what's protected under sex-based anti-discrimination law.\n\nWHITE HOUSE SAYS BIDEN IS A 'DEVOUT CATHOLIC' WHEN ASKED ABOUT ABORTION POLICIES\n\nIn Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. ___ (2020), the Supreme Court held that Title VII's prohibition on discrimination 'because of [...] sex' covers discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation, the order read.\n\nThe bishops argued, however, that the executive order didn't leave as much flexibility for religious entities as the Court did.\n\nEvery person has a right to gainful employment, education, and basic human services free of unjust discrimination, read the bishops' statement.\n\nThat right should be protected. The Supreme Court's Bostock decision, however, needlessly ignored the integrity of God's creation of the two complementary sexes, male and female, with reasoning that treated them as devoid of meaning. Wednesday's executive order on 'sex' discrimination exceeds the Court's decision.\n\nThey added that Biden was conflating the goal of racial equality ... with the imposition of new attitudes and false theories on human sexuality which can produce social harms.\n\nHEAD OF US BISHOPS' CONFERENCE WARNS BIDEN WOULD 'ADVANCE MORAL EVILS AND THREATEN HUMAN LIFE'\n\nThe head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) previously criticized Biden's stance on abortion and other issues, saying that he would advance moral evils and threaten human life. When asked on Wednesday about Biden's abortion policies, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the president was a devout Catholic.\n\nBiden's identification as a Catholic has come under intense scrutiny from some given his public advocacy and activity. For example, he previously presided over a same-sex wedding ceremony even though the Church has long condemned homosexuality. The Catechism reads: Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that 'homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered,' it said referencing a document from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. They are contrary to the natural law, it added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt adds that individuals with deep-seated homosexual tendencies must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided.\n\nHowever, Catholic teaching also emphasizes the importance of religious freedom, stating: The right to the exercise of freedom, especially in religious and moral matters, is an inalienable requirement of the dignity of man. But the exercise of freedom does not entail the putative right to say or do anything.

Prince Albert of Monaco has spoken out against President Trump following the chaos that occurred in the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.\n\nThe 62-year-old royal has released a statement regarding the incident, in which pro-Trump rioters breached security while Congress was voting to certify the Electoral College votes that secured the White House for President-elect Joe Biden.\n\nAlbert told People magazine that he was shocked by the events.\n\nThis is not the America I know — the one I partially grew up in, went to school in, said Albert. President Trump has to be held accountable. Albert's mom is Grace Kelly, the Philadelphia-born Hollywood actress who became Princess Grace of Monaco after her marriage to Prince Rainier III.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT SAYS HE ENDURED LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF CORONAVIRUS: 'THE VIRUS STAYS WITH YOUR QUITE A WHILE'\n\nThe president has been accused of inciting protestors and has been widely criticized for his response to the riots, which resulted in the deaths of multiple people.\n\nFor his part, Prince Albert spent a great deal of time in America during his lifetime, including his studies at Amherst College in Mass., and said that he's feeling anger after these tragic events of yesterday.\n\nThe royal said he turned on the news just before settling in for bed and saw the coverage of the chaos.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT OF MONACO SAYS DONALD TRUMP'S DAMAGE TO THE CLIMATE IS 'REPARABLE'\n\nIt's just unbelievable, he said. I'm still in shock, but at the same time, I'm not totally surprised because, unfortunately, this is where we were heading.\n\nAlbert said he felt shock and disbelief but his feelings quickly turned to disgust.\n\nGRACE KELLY'S SON PRINCE ALBERT SAYS HE'S ALWAYS 'FELT A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY' TO PROTECT THE LATE STAR\n\nAdditionally, he felt anger about how this could have happened and how this was fueled by President Trump.\n\nWhile the news was hard to believe, the royal said he wasn't exactly surprised.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI felt months ago that there would be big problems whichever way the election went. It is a very somber moment, not only in the U.S. but in contemporary world history: A president still in office who has, directly and indirectly, spurred a revolt like this, explained Albert. I agree with those who have said that President Trump has to be held accountable for this.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nOther world leaders, including the UK and Swedish Prime Ministers Boris Johnson and Stefan Löfven as well as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, expressed concern over the unrest that occurred on Wednesday while condemning the violence that took place.\n\nFox News' Sam Dorman contributed to this report
Making a splash comes naturally to Bo Derek, who famously made hearts race while running on the beach in a nude one-piece with beaded braids in the 1979 film 10.\n\n'10' for me was a small part, the 62-year-old told Fox News. I'm in the movie for about 10 minutes. The movie is Dudley Moore and the legendary, gorgeous Julie Andrews. I had a little tiny part, and I was happy to go to Mexico. That's all I expected out of that movie. When it opened, my life changed overnight. And all of a sudden, to be on the cover of all the magazines and have the great Walter Cronkite talking about you on the evening news, was a big deal.\n\nDerek's brief appearance in 10 made her an instant sex symbol and the sultry image made a lasting impact in Hollywood history.\n\nMARILYN MONROE FOUGHT TO SHED SEX SYMBOL STATUS\n\nIt wasn't that big of a problem for me, because I never took it seriously, the actress recalled about her pinup status. … It was always just a job, like you put on your uniform. Back then, it was a time where we had to cross boundaries in sexuality and sensuality in movies. Whose gonna do a nude scene first? Who's going to do this first? Now, you look back and what was all the fuss about?\n\nBut the star's proudest role is that of an advocate. Her shampoo line for canines named Bo Derek Pet Care supports retired military working dogs.\n\nMilitary working dogs give us everything, she said. There are still things that no matter what science accomplishes, there are still things that a dog senses, which can save lives. Whether it's detecting explosives, catching bad guys — we use them. … They're just incredible creatures.\n\nIn 2003, Derek was granted the highest award offered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for her efforts supporting American veterans. According to VA, Derek was an honorary chair of its National Rehabilitation Special Events for several years, which aims to improve public awareness of veteran issues, all while encouraging participants and visiting VA medical centers around the country.\n\nBOB HOPE WAS DETERMINED TO ENTERTAIN THE TROOPS\n\nAt the time, VA shared Derek goes on USO tours to support troops and works with the Special Forces Association, which named her an honorary Green Beret.\n\nHer father, Paul Collins, was a radio operator during the Korean War. Both her stepfather and late husband, actor John Derek, were veterans.\n\nAll the men in my family served in the military, said Derek. I spent eight incredible years as the Chairperson for the Disabled Veterans, all their rehabilitation events. … They're so inspiring, these young men and women, and what they've sacrificed. These events are important because there's nothing like competitive sport to lift a spirit. And… sports are good for physical rehabilitation. But for the spirit, it's fantastic.\n\nDerek and John met in 1974 when she was just 17 — he cast her in a film he was directing, titled And Once Upon a Time. Later that year, he married her after divorcing actress Linda Evans. After Derek catapulted to fame with 10, John continued to promote his wife's blossoming career. They remained together until his death in 1998 at age 71 from heart failure.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDerek found love again three years later with actor John Corbett, 57. The two have been dating for nearly 18 years.\n\nI think we just keep our relationship day to day, she said. I understand when he goes off on location, he understands when I travel. We have all our independence and freedom. We just enjoy spending our time together.\n\nDespite their lasting courtship, Derek said they're not in a hurry to walk down the aisle anytime soon.\n\nI don't know if we'll ever get married, she said. We don't have children. There isn't that tradition to follow. Marriage, I don't know. It feels funny. It's not necessary for us. We're not proving our love, we're not starting a new generation together of families coming together. We almost got married… We were on a funky, horrible boat in the Amazon, and I thought it might be fun to be able to later tell you… that we got married on a funky little boat in the Amazon, that the captain married us. Then we decided, no that was just too weird.\n\nJOHN CORBETT: I HAVE A STRONG BELIEF IN GOD\n\nDerek is about to embark on her latest project — producing a history film about the Women's Air Force Service Pilots during WWII. She's also diving into her latest role — that of runway model for a day.\n\nShe was one of several celebrities who made their mark on the catwalk Thursday night for the American Heart Association's Go Red for Women Red Dress Collection during New York Fashion Week. Macy's is one of the sponsors of the annual event, which helps shine a spotlight on the issue of heart disease in women.\n\nThe American Heart Association is close to my heart and it should be close to all of our hearts, said Derek. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women. One in three women will die of heart disease. That's very close to my heart.\n\nThe California native, along with other stars, wore gowns created by world-renowned and up-and-coming designers to raise awareness about heart and stroke as the number one killer of women.\n\nDerek was also accompanied by Flynn, the bichon frise who won best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club in 2018.\n\nThe actress said the goal is to raise awareness on how pets can impact one's health.\n\nPeople with pets have lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol, she said. All are these good health benefits. [And] I love pets. I love dogs, in particular. I'm really happy to be doing this and help spread this message that having a dog can really help your health.\n\nThe cause hits close to home for Derek. About 10 years ago, she had endocarditis, an inflammation of the heart's inner lining, which is usually caused by bacteria. The condition can cause complications if not treated early, including stroke and seizure, among others.\n\nI have mitral valve prolapse, and I came back from China on a wildlife trafficking trip and came back with a blood infection that didn't sound that very important, but it was, Derek explained. It caused something called endocarditis of my heart. I'm completely fine, but if I hadn't been aware of a little quirky pre-existing condition, it could have been very serious. Because I was aware of it, my doctor was aware of it, I'm perfectly fine.\n\nThe star admitted she wasn't a fan of hitting the gym to stay in shape but has found other ways to stay moving while promoting good heart health.\n\nFor me, I swim, said Derek. I've always been involved in sports. I hate exercise, working out. The formal working out part, I don't like it. I make every excuse not to do it. I don't get the endorphin rush and the high that everybody talks about. … I had back surgery about five years ago because I've been riding horses for so long. The surgeon said if I get in a pool in 10 days then I don't even need physical therapy.\n\nIf I have to do something I like, it's the anti-movement being weightless in water that counteracts all the high impact that I've done all my life, she continued. It's great exercise. It's fantastic. Now I've taken up open water swimming. I go with a girlfriend once a year to a pretty place, and we do a swim race.\n\nDerek hopes her appearance will inspire women everywhere.\n\nWomen… we can do anything, she said. We can accomplish anything. If we're aware [of heart disease], we can make sure it doesn't get us. We can prevent so much of it. I hope it brings awareness. I think that the women coming together will help show unity and a commitment for our sisters.
Accused madam Ghislaine Maxwell once directed a room of underage girls to kiss, dance and touch one another in a sexual way for late pedophile boss Jeffrey Epstein, according to newly released court documents.\n\nA witness told of the alleged creepy forced performance in testimony that was revealed in 112 court documents running to thousands of pages that were released late Wednesday.\n\nThey also include a handwritten telephone note from July 2004 in which Maxwell, now 59, warned Epstein that a girl age 14 at the time was available and that he had no one for tomorrow.\n\nJUDGE: GHISLAINE MAXWELL'S SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH ADULTS CAN REMAIN SECRET\n\nAnother witness was recorded as being in tears as he recalled a 15-year-old girl in utmost distress — claiming that Maxwell stole the young girl's passport and tried to make her have sex with Epstein and then threatened her.\n\nThe disturbing allegations were part of a trove of documents released by US District Judge Loretta Preska from a since-settled lawsuit brought against Maxwell by one of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre.\n\nAlthough Maxwell was allowed to keep documents detailing her sex life private, the released sections included testimony that Maxwell and Epstein had sex sessions with strap-ons and dildos.\n\nMost damningly, a witness — whose name was redacted — testified that he watched Maxwell direct a room full of underage girls to kiss, dance, and touch one another in a sexual way for [Maxwell] and Epstein to watch, the documents stated.\n\nAnother witness also testified that Maxwell recruited her from her school campus to have sex with Epstein with lies about being her personal assistant, the report said.\n\nEPSTEIN'S FINAL CELLMATE QUESTIONED BY AG BARR AFTER APPARENT SUICIDE: REPORT\n\nSome of the most explicit testimony comes from Giuffre's ex-boyfriend, Anthony Figueroa, according to DailyMail.com.\n\nAsked if Giuffre ever talked to him about her often-repeated claim that she was made to have sex with Prince Andrew, he admitted he could not recall her doing so, but said it could be possible.\n\nBut Figueroa said Epstein did want the accuser to have sex with Ms. Maxwell and all the other girls — and that she was forced into a threesome after Jeffrey wanted Virginia to have sex with Ms. Maxwell, who used strap-ons and dildos on her, the Mail said.\n\nMs. Maxwell and Jeffrey would obviously be doing stuff, all three of them together, he said, according to the report.\n\nThey would all go out to clubs to pick up girls and try and find them to bring back for Jeffrey.\n\nFEDERAL JUDGE SLAMS GHISLAINE MAXWELL FOR MISLEADING COURT ON WEALTH, MARRIAGE\n\nAnd then she told me about how, like I said, her and Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey were all intimate together on multiple occasions, Figueroa reportedly stated.\n\nThe documents also show how Maxwell tried to dismiss the complaints made by Giuffre — including that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew — by claiming she had an opioid addiction and had previously cried rape as a teenager, the Sun said.\n\nShe branded Giuffre a professional victim and sexually permissive by digging up earlier police reports, according to the report.\n\nHowever, Maxwell's plan of attack came undone when two of her own witnesses called to defend her in the lawsuit said they witnessed her escort young girls he brought over to Epstein's home to Epstein for sex acts. They also said Maxwell called him on the phone, asking him to bring over girls to Epstein's home, according to the documents.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNow, there is actual, live testimonial evidence that [Maxwell] was a procurer of young girls for sex with Jeffrey Epstein, with whom she shared a home and a life, thus validating Ms. Giuffre's claims, lawyers for Giuffre said of the witnesses' testimony.\n\nMaxwell has been held without bail since pleading not guilty in July to recruiting girls for Epstein to abuse in the mid-1990s.\n\nEpstein, 66, hanged himself in his Manhattan lockup in August 2019 as he awaited a sex-trafficking trial.\n\nThis report was originally published by the New York Post.
R. Kelly has come under scrutiny again for his relationship with late R&B singer Aaliyah.\n\nA former background singer for Kelly, Jovante Cunningham, made a shocking revelation during an interview in the Lifetime documentary Surviving R. Kelly, alleging that the Trapped in the Closet crooner, then 27, engaged in a sexual relationship with Aaliyah when she was just 15.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAaliyah [was] very tomboyish, glasses, braces, no swag, Cunningham recalls of meeting 12-year-old Aaliyah, who was the niece of Kelly's then-manager, Barry Hankerson.\n\nShe truly was a beautiful young lady. We used to sneak Aaliyah out of the hotel room and take her all over the place, Cunningham said. Those were the good old days, but those are the things that also make you cry.\n\nR. KELLY ACCUSED OF SEXUALLY ABUSING MINOR, BRAINWASHING ANOTHER WOMAN IN HIS 'CULT'\n\nDuring the interview, which will air as part of a six-part docuseries beginning on Jan. 3, according to People magazine, Cunningham opened up about the feeling she had after learning Kelly and Aaliyah were sexually involved.\n\nWe were out on the road with Aaliyah. On a tour bus, there really aren't many confined spaces. When you get on the bus there are bunks and so these bunks have little curtains you can pull at night if you don't want anybody to see you sleeping, she explained.\n\nSo, it just so happened we were all laying in our bunks and the curtains are open, everybody's communicating, laughing, Cunningham continued. When the [room] door flew open on the bus, Robert was having sex with Aaliyah.\n\nWhen pressed to describe exactly what she had witnessed, Cunningham doubled down on her claims adding that it was evident Kelly was having sex with Aaliyah.\n\nR. KELLY DROPS SONG 'I ADMIT' IN RESPONSE TO SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS\n\nThings that an adult should not be doing with a child, Cunningham lamented. I can't stress to you how people are still suffering behind things that went on 20 years ago.\n\nIn 1994 reports surfaced that Kelly and Aaliyah had secretly married, and a marriage certificate was made public listing Aaliyah's age as 18, although she would have been 15 at the time.\n\nNeither Kelly nor Aaliyah ever addressed the nature of their relationship, but his former personal assistant, Demetrius Smith, alleges he was a present witness at the wedding and even obtained false marriage documents for the underage Aaliyah.\n\nRobert came to me, we were in Miami, Smith recalled. Robert said, 'Man we got Aaliyah in trouble'. After probing for more information, Smith said he was floored by Kelly's response; Robert mentioned to me that 'I think she's pregnant'. That broke my heart right there because I really believed him when he said that he wasn't messing with Aaliyah…Once he told me that, I was at a loss for words.\n\nR. KELLY'S WIFE THINKS 'SURVIVING R. KELLY' GUN THREAT WAS LINKED TO SINGER\n\nSmith went on to claim, I was in the room when they got married. I'm not proud of that. I had papers forged for them when Aaliyah was underaged. It was just a quick little ceremony; she didn't have on a white dress, he didn't have on a tux. Just everyday wear. She looked worried and scared.\n\nKelly's marriage to Aaliyah was reportedly annulled within the year.\n\nAaliyah's career as an actress and singer continued to soar until the Detroit-raised R&B star died tragically in a plane crash in 2001. She was 22.\n\nHe was later accused of child pornography after a widely circulated videotape appeared to show him having sex with, and urinating on, a teenage girl. He was acquitted of all charges in 2008 and continued to rack up hits and sell out stadiums around the country.\n\nIn recent years, a series of women have come forward to accuse him of everything from sexual coercion to physical abuse.\n\nR. KELLY'S EX-WIFE SLAMS VICTIM SHAMERS FOR BEING 'BY FAR THE BIGGEST SUPPORTER' OF HER ABUSER\n\nThat includes parents who said their daughter was being held by Kelly as part of a sex cult, and a woman who said she was in a long-term abusive relationship with him. Kelly and the girl whose parents came forward denied the allegations against him.\n\nNeither reps for Kelly or his music label RCA responded to Fox News' request for comment on the allegations.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
(Ed. note: This article has been adapted from the six-part Fox Nation series The Unauthorized History of Socialism, hosted by Bret Baier.)\n\nThe history of socialism in America did not begin with Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Rather, it began in 1825 on the banks of the Wabash River in Indiana.\n\nOn April 27 of that year, Robert Owen, a Welsh textile manufacturer-turned-philanthropist, welcomed 800 eager arrivals to the settlement he had christened New Harmony.\n\nNew Harmony was to be a community of equality heralding a new way of life. Owen's followers would soon coin a new name for his vision: utopian socialism.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS' DEFENSE OF CASTRO'S CUBA EVOKES SOCIALISM'S BRUTAL HISTORY\n\nOn July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, Owen issued his own variation, what he called the Declaration of Mental Independence. From that day forward, Owen proclaimed, men would be free from what he called a trinity of the most monstrous evils that could be combined to inflict mental and physical evil upon the whole race ... I refer to private property, absurd and irrational systems of religion and marriage founded upon individual property.\n\nThe quest to do away with private property would animate the philosophy of socialism for the next 150 years.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SUBSCRIBE NOW TO FOX NATION\n\nIntellectuals were drawn to Owen and the promise of New Harmony, but managing the community's resources without individual ownership proved highly inefficient. One New Harmony member wrote that even salads were deposited in the store to be handed out, making 10,000 unnecessary steps [and] causing them to come to the tables in a wilted, deadened state.\n\nIn the end, I think one of the problems in New Harmony was that it was a big group of idealists in one place -- in a very isolated place, says Connie Weinzapfel, longtime director of the Historic New Harmony site. They spent a lot of time thinking about the idea of a perfect community. Ultimately you had a lot of thinkers and not enough doers.\n\nAfter two years, several re-organizations, and seven different constitutions, Owen's great experiment collapsed.\n\nOwen had a very hard time acknowledging that there was a failure at New Harmony, Joshua Muravchik, author of the 2003 book Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism, told Fox Nation. And through a period of many months when everyone around him, including his sons, was saying, 'Things are falling apart,' Owen was saying, 'Things are going great here.'\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut eventually, he couldn't keep up that pretense any longer because everyone was leaving, Muravchik adds. And so Owen found a kind of alibi, I think, in blaming the people who came to New Harmony as being poor human material for his experiment.\n\nOwen's son, Robert Dale Owen, stayed at New Harmony after its collapse and went on to serve two terms in Congress. He had a different assessment of his father's experiment, writing: All cooperative schemes which provide equal remuneration to the skilled and industrious and the ignorant and idle must work their own downfall. For by this unjust plan they must of necessity eliminate the valuable members and retain only the improvident, unskilled and vicious.\n\nTo watch the entire six-part series, The Unauthorized History of Socialism go to Fox Nation and sign up today.\n\nLIMITED TIME ONLY!

The White House on Tuesday announced the re-nomination of 51 federal judicial nominees left over from the previous Congress, kickstarting the administration's effort to install more conservative judges after GOP activists worried that such appointments had stalled.\n\nNine of the 51 appointments are for spots on prestigious and influential federal appellate benches, including two on the mostly liberal San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which President Trump has often derided as disgraceful and politically biased.\n\nI truly appreciate the prompt attention President Trump and his White House team have shown to judicial nominations, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in a statement Wednesday. I also appreciate the list of 51 impressive judicial nominations to fulfill the Senate's constitutional role in advice and consent.\n\nGraham vowed that the committee will immediately begin working on these important nominations and trying to confirm as many as possible, as soon as possible.\n\nNeomi Rao, the president's regulatory czar, who would take now-Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh's vacated seat on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, is on the list. Case Western University School of Law professor and Washington Post commentator Jonathan H. Adler wrote when Rao first joined the administration that Trump's selection of Rao suggests the administration is serious about regulatory reform, not merely reducing high-profile regulatory burdens.\n\nAlso on the roll was Brian Buescher, for a seat as United States district judge for the District of Nebraska. In December, Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, raised concerns about the Omaha-based lawyer's membership in the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic service organization -- prompting legal commentators to suggest the Democrats were engaging in religious discrimination.\n\nHIRONO SUGGESTS KAVANAUGH'S CONSERVATIVE VIEWS ARE A GOOD REASON TO DENY HIM DUE PROCESS\n\nThe Knights of Columbus has taken a number of extreme positions, Hirono said in a questionnaire sent to Buescher. For example, it was reportedly one of the top contributors to California's Proposition 8 campaign to ban same-sex marriage.\n\nHarris, in her questions to the nominee, called the Knights of Columbus an all-male society and asked the Nebraska lawyer if he was aware that the group was anti-abortion and opposed to same-sex marriage when he joined.\n\nThe California senator and 2020 presidential hopeful also referenced Supreme Knight Carl A. Anderson's statement that abortion amounted to the killing of the innocent on a massive scale and asked Buescher if he agreed with the statement.\n\nIn his response, Buescher argued that the Knights of Columbus' official positions on issues do not represent every one of the group's members and said he would recuse himself from hearing cases where he saw a conflict of interest.\n\nThe Knights of Columbus does not have the authority to take personal political positions on behalf of all of its approximately two million members, Buescher wrote. If confirmed, I will apply all provisions of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges regarding recusal and disqualification.\n\nIn an Op-Ed this week in The Washington Post entitled Anti-Catholic bigotry is alive in the U.S. Senate, columnist Michael Gerson wrote that questions like the ones from Harris and Hirono were inappropriate and scare the hell out of vast sections of the country.\n\nMissing from the list of re-nominated judges, for now, were three conservatives the White House has said it will install on the Ninth Circuit without first seeking what's known as a blue slip, or an opinion, from California senators Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Harris.\n\nThe White House announced in October Trump had nominated Patrick Bumatay, Daniel Collins and Kenneth Kiyul Lee (all from the Golden State, and reportedly all members of the conservative Federalist Society) to the 9th Circuit, bypassing the traditional blue slip process in an apparent snub of Feinstein and Harris.\n\nThe liberal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, with a sprawling purview representing nine Western states, has long been a thorn in the side of the Trump White House, with rulings against the travel ban and limits on funding to sanctuary cities.\n\nTRUMP SLAMS 'DISGRACEFUL' NINTH CIRCUIT, SUGGESTS THEY WOULD OVERTURN HIS TURKEY PARDON IF THEY COULD\n\nThe Judicial Crisis Network announced in a statement it would launch a $1.5 million national advertising campaign on both television and the Internet calling on Democrats to support the 51 judges, and noting that there are an unprecedented 163 judicial vacancies in the federal court system.\n\nBecause of Democrats' unprecedented obstruction of judicial nominees, we now have significantly more vacancies than when President Trump took office, Judicial Crisis Network Chief Counsel and Policy Director Carrie Severino said in a statement.\n\nSenator McConnell has restated his commitment to filling the vacancies and has maintained that this is a Senate priority. It's time for Democrats to end the bullying and smear campaigns and confirm the judges, Severino added.\n\nThe nominations seemed poised to quiet growing conservative unrest about the relative lack of news on appointments during the ongoing partial federal government shutdown, which commenced Dec. 22. Six new appointments to federal district courts, which are effectively trial courts, were announced by the White House last week.\n\nPeople are starting to scratch their heads and wonder, 'When are we going to start up again? one source close to the White House told Politico earlier this month.\n\nThe White House, along with Senate GOP leaders, has made appointing conservative judges and justices a key priority.

Queen Elizabeth II called for a face-to-face meeting with her grandson Prince Harry and other members of the royal family on Monday in order to iron out logistics of his and Meghan Markle's decision to step back from their duties and become financially independent of the crown.\n\nBut some are wondering if it was too little, too late, and are hearkening back to how Harry's late mother, Princess Diana, was treated during her time with the royal family.\n\nToday my family had very constructive discussions on the future of my grandson and his family, the Queen said in a statement Monday following the emergency gathering. My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan's desire to create a new life as a young family. Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working Members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family.\n\nThese are complex matters for my family to resolve, and there is some more work to be done, she said. But I have asked for final decisions to be reached in the coming days.\n\nThe meetup marked the first time the queen, 93, and the Duke of Sussex, 35, have been in the same room following his bombshell announcement on social media last week. A palace insider previously confirmed to Fox News some members of the royal family had not been informed of the decision before the surprise announcement was made.\n\nThe resulting scandal has made some think back to the days of Princess Diana, who publicly voiced her distress over the lack of support she received from the queen during her marriage to Harry's father, Prince Charles.\n\nQUEEN CALLS ROYAL FAMILY SUMMIT TO DISCUSS MEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY'S 'MEGXIT' DETAILS\n\nPRINCES WILLIAM, HARRY DENY 'OFFENSIVE' REPORT THAT BULLYING LED TO MEGHAN AND HARRY'S DRASTIC DECISION\n\nIn the documentary Diana: In Her Own Words, Harry's mother claimed she sought help from Elizabeth in 1986 because she believed her marriage was loveless. Diana alleged her mother-in-law was less than sympathetic.\n\nI went to the top lady and said, 'I don't know what I should do,' said Diana. 'I don't know what you should do.' And that was it. That was 'help.\n\nRoyal author Leslie Carroll told Fox News the royal family is now at a tipping point following the ruthless media scrutiny Markle, a biracial American actress, has endured since marrying the British royal in May 2018.\n\nThe monarchy could very well continue to survive and thrive, she explained. The queen has many fine qualities — duty and dedication above all else. But the tone-deafness she displayed when Diana died is rearing its head again, in her lack of compassion for family members in serious emotional and psychological pain for very deep reasons that, because of their ugliness, have widespread implications on the nation. There is a cancer on the blossom that needs to be nipped in the bud now. That cancer is racism. It's time to face it, address it, and start treating the symptoms as well as the rot — not smother it in diamonds and ermine and a stiff upper lip.\n\nPRINCE WILLIAM 'LET DOWN,' DUCHESS KATE 'INCREDIBLY HURT' BY HARRY STEPPING DOWN, REPORT SAYS\n\nAFTER PRINCE HARRY-MEGHAN MARKLE DECISION, BUCKINGHAM PALACE AIDE HAS 'NEVER SEEN' MONARCHY IN SUCH PERIL\n\nIn her lifetime, Diana resorted to speaking with the press about the pressures she endured behind palace walls. She also went on to participate in a book penned by biographer Andrew Morton that wasn't confirmed until after her death in 1997.\n\nWhen Diana and Charles officially divorced in 1996, the Princess of Wales was stripped of her Royal Highness title. While Elizabeth was willing to allow Diana to keep the title, Charles wanted his ex-wife to give it up, the New York Times reported.\n\nWhen Diana died in 1997 at age 36 from injuries she sustained in a Paris car crash, the public famously slammed Elizabeth for the way she handled the tragedy. Reports at the time insisted Elizabeth failed to capture the mood of the country in her address to the nation even after she shared heartfelt words about Diana, UK's Express reported.\n\nThe image of Harry as an adolescent boy walking behind his mother's casket remains burned in our memories, said Carroll. Harry has been extremely candid about his PTSD… [with] the way the media treated his mother, and surely the way the 'Men in Gray,' as Diana referred to the Palace bureaucrats who tried to micromanage her life —treated her — and have treated his own wife.\n\nPRINCE HARRY MAY HAVE LANDED MEGHAN MARKLE DISNEY VOICEOVER JOB\n\nCHANGES FOLLOWING MEGHAN MARKLE AND PRINCE HARRY 'STEP BACK' ANNOUNCEMENT 'WILL TAKE TIME TO BE IMPLEMENTED': REPORT\n\nHe was openly angry from the start of his relationship with Meghan about the British mainstream and tabloid press treatment of her, releasing an unprecedented 379-word statement accusing them of racism. Headlines such as 'Harry's girlfriend is [almost] Straight Outta Compton'… [and comparing] the infant to a 'chimpanzee' should not fall within the Windsor credo of never complain, never explain.'\n\nWhere is the compassion and understanding now? Why are the senior royals pretending that this massive dust-up with the Sussexes is a surprise that came out of the blue when Harry has, all his life, been dealing with the pain of what his mother endured?... He said he still becomes traumatized when the cameras click and whirr during walkabouts… This is the time for the monarchy and the Windsors as a family to adapt in order to survive in a modern, globalist, multicultural era.\n\nBut royal author and broadcaster Neil Sean argued that Elizabeth is handling the ongoing saga with grace — and perhaps the Sussexes should have thought twice before unveiling their announcement to the world without notifying The Firm first.\n\nThe feeling here is that the queen is as ever handling yet another family crisis with great dignity and class — something that both Harry and Meghan could learn from, said Sean. … It's a power game and there will only be one winner and that will be HM The Queen. She fired her favorite son in November from Royal Duty, Prince Andrew, so dealing with the sixth in line to the throne and a former cable TV actress won't be too much of a problem for her. It will, however, will be for Harry when he realizes just what he is throwing away.\n\nPRINCE WILLIAM SAYS HE CAN'T 'PUT MY ARM AROUND' BROTHER HARRY ANYMORE: 'I'M SAD ABOUT THAT'\n\nQUEEN ELIZABETH ORDERS PRIVATE MEETING WITH PRINCE HARRY, PRINCE WILLIAM, PRINCE CHARLES: REPORTS\n\nHarry and Markle's announcement came just months after the couple opened up to host Tom Bradby in ITV's documentary Harry & Meghan: An African Journey, which aired in October 2019 in both the U.K. and U.S.\n\nWhile the special aimed to give audiences a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the couple's recent royal tour of southern African, the couple also spoke out about enduring ruthless tabloid rumors as new parents.\n\nI think the grass is always greener, explained the former Suits actress. You have no idea. It's really hard to understand what it's like. I know what it seems like it should be, but it's a very different thing.\n\nMarkle said she and her husband have had conversations about being in the spotlight and all the negativity that comes with it.\n\nPRINCE HARRY, MEGHAN MARKLE'S EXIT TALKS 'PROGRESSING WELL' WITH ROYAL FAMILY: REPORT\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE AND ARCHIE'S SAFETY DROVE 'MEGXIT' DECISION, PRINCE HARRY'S PAL CLAIMS\n\nI have said for a long time to H, that's what I call him, 'It's not enough to just survive something,' said Markle. 'That's not the point of life. You have to thrive. You have got to feel happy.' I really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a 'stiff upper life.' I really tried, but I think that what that does internally is probably really damaging.\n\nThe royal went on to tell Bradby she would be more understanding about the scrutiny if it were fair.\n\nI never thought that this would be easy, but I thought it would be fair, said Markle. And that's the part that's really hard to reconcile.\n\nMarkle said before she tied the knot with Harry, some of her friends warned her that becoming a member of the royal family would mean being under the constant glare of the public spotlight and losing your privacy.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY MILES APART AS THEY START INDEPENDENT LIFE\n\nTRUMP ON ROYAL 'MEGXIT' DRAMA: 'I DON'T THINK THIS SHOULD BE HAPPENING' TO THE QUEEN\n\nIn all fairness, I had no idea, which probably sounds difficult to understand and hear, said Markle. But when I first met my now-husband, my friends were really happy because I was so happy, but my British friends said to me, 'I'm sure he's great but you shouldn't do it because the British tabloids will destroy your life.'\n\nAnd I, very naively — I'm American, continued Markle. We don't have that there — [I said], 'What are you talking about? That doesn't make any sense. I'm not in any tabloids.' I didn't get it. So it's been, yeah, it's been complicated.
EXCLUSIVE: It was 1980 when Allan Bridge, a restless painter from Washington, D.C., posted flyers around New York City encouraging people to call a mysterious line and apologize for their wrongs… without jeopardizing themselves.\n\nThousands of residents not only dialed in, but they revealed their deepest, darkest secrets involving theft, infidelity and murder.\n\nBridge's widow, Marissa Bridge, is now coming forward and recounting how the once promising project took a horrifying turn in a new Wondery podcast titled The Apology Line where listeners can explore how the former happy go lucky artist got more than what he bargained for. It features interviews with those who knew Bridge, as well as actual recordings made over the years provided by Marissa, who narrated the podcast.\n\nAllan Bridge passed away in 1995 at age 50.\n\n'OVER MY DEAD BODY' PODCAST: SLAIN FLORIDA LAW PROFESSOR'S FATHER, SISTER SAY THEY 'PRAY AND HOPE' FOR JUSTICE\n\nHe died while The Apology Line was still running, Marissa told Fox News. And it always bothered that he wasn't able to complete it in the way he wanted to. So I felt it was my duty as his wife and being a supporter of the line to always make sure it didn't disappear into the dustbin of history, so to speak. And that it would be brought to the public again, in some way, shape or form.\n\nBridge moved to New York City in 1977 where he pursued carpentry to help make ends meet. He also resorted to shoplifting.\n\nIt was a problem that he'd had since he was a kid, Marissa explained. He started to think about how he could do something that would help other people. And then he came up with the idea of the telephone and an answering machine as a way to give people the opportunity to apologize, to let go of the guilt and pain they were feeling for their misdeeds.\n\nThe concept was simple. Bridge solicited the public to call a machine-answered phone line that was secretly connected to his loft and apologize for anything at all. Callers were instructed to not identify yourself and call from a pay phone to prevent tracing, the New York Post reported. According to the outlet, the flyers also made it clear that The Apology Line had no association to police, government or any religious organizations.\n\nRON GOLDMAN'S SISTER SPEAKS OUT 25 YEARS AFTER HIS HORRIFYING MURDER IN 'CONFRONTING O.J. SIMPSON' PODCAST\n\nThe calls came in immediately. By 1983, voyeurs could phone in and listen to recorded sessions, the outlet noted. The line was receiving about 100 calls a day. Bridge, who wanted to conceal his identity, became known as Mr. Apology.\n\nThe calls never stopped for 15 years.\n\nIn the very beginning, callers talked about seeing murders, said Marissa. The first few weeks of the line, someone called and they said that they robbed and killed homosexuals, which corresponded to what was actually happening in New York City at the time. That bothered him from the very beginning… It was a real moral dilemma for Allan. He wrestled with this for a very long time.\n\nIn the podcast, listeners will also learn of Ritchie, a self-confessed serial killer who phoned in for five years. And there was Bernie, who vowed he was going to hunt Bridge down and murder him.\n\nThat really upset me, Marissa admitted. At that point, I wasn't living with Allan because it was in the first year of our relationship. And it bothered Allan very much. This was a rough time in New York City back then when there was a lot of crime. The city had almost gone bankrupt. There were very few police. It was like the Wild West of Midtown, a low point for New York City. So it wasn't outrageous to think that someone would do something like [that]. There was no money and people do a lot of crime when there's no money. It was rampant. So we were very scared.\n\nTEXAS MAN RECALLS LOSING HIS WIFE TO 'DR. DEATH' IN SHOCKING DOC: 'MY WORLD JUST ENDED RIGHT THEN AND THERE'\n\nMarissa was dating Bridge at the time The Apology Line was created and the couple tied the knot in 1984.\n\nThe project would eventually take hold of the marriage. Occasionally, Allan would pick up an incoming call and talk to someone who sounded suicidal. There were also runaways who felt unloved by their families. Vietnam veterans dialed in and detailed the really horrible things they did overseas in the line of duty. Bridge felt committed to The Apology Line, but according to his widow, it ultimately consumed him.\n\nHe was 35 at the time when I met him, said Marissa. He was young, super excited and dedicated to it. And he kept that energy up. But over the years, it just became his primary work. He didn't make money from it. So he had to support himself doing carpentry. And over the years, it certainly took a toll on our relationship.\n\nThese calls were a heavy burden to carry, she continued. How can you unplug something like this when people really need you? It was just murderers that weigh heavy, but people had so many problems. Everything you could possibly imagine, people brought to The Apology Line. Broken hearts, broken families - all kinds of tragic things were happening to people. Allan believed in his work. And I wouldn't have ever told him to stop. Artists have to do what they have to do. He felt this was his life's work until he couldn't do it anymore.\n\nWOMAN WHO KILLED 'DIRTY JOHN' SAYS SHE'S STILL STRUGGLING WITH PTSD: 'I HAD TO LEARN WHAT HAPPENED TO ME'\n\nThe only time Bridge ever made money off of his project was when HBO made a 1986 movie titled Apology. In addition to devoting himself to The Apology Line, he also began publishing monthly collections of the best confessions in 1993, the New York Times reported.\n\nAt the end of his life, he was going through a very difficult time, Marissa admitted. He had three telephone lines at that point… he was just completely overwhelmed and wondering how he could continue doing all of this. He was in a down place. He wasn't as happy go lucky as he once was. At that point, he was struggling under the burden of trying to do all this work pretty much by himself. He had a few volunteers who helped as much as they could, but it just became too much. There was no money and no one was getting paid. It was a tough situation.\n\nIn 1995, Bridge was struck and killed by a jet ski while diving in Shinnecock Inlet on Long Island. While his death was widely covered by the press at the time, the jet skier was never caught.\n\nI would hope that they would apologize, said Marissa. It was an accident. It was not their fault. It was an accidental death, but I'm sure that person carries around a lot of pain about it. And if they did come forward to apologize, I think it would be very healing for them. And for me. Although, I have forgiven that person because I knew that it wasn't done intentionally. It was just a tragic accident. So I don't hold any ill will towards the person at all. Allan was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMarissa hopes that listeners tuning in will not only understand the power of apologizing but also better understand how determined Bridge was in pursuing his beloved art.\n\nWe're all the same under the surface, said she. We all have problems. We all have pain… In spite of all the difficulties Allan faced in running the line, he really believed in what he was doing. And I hope that comes across in this [podcast]. If something is important to you and you believe it, do it. Do it well.\n\nThe Apology Line is available for streaming through Apple Podcasts.

Lee Boyd Malvo, who is serving life in a Virginia prison for his role in a 2002 sniper spree that left 10 people dead in the Washington, D.C., area, got married earlier this month.\n\nThe ceremony between Malvo, 35, and an unidentified woman took place at Red Onion State Prison, said Carmeta Albarus, who has served as an adviser and mentor for Malvo.\n\nOver the past 17 years, he has grown despite his conditions of confinement, she said in a phone interview. He has grown into an adult, and has found love with a wonderful young lady. ... It was a beautiful ceremony.\n\nMalvo and mastermind John Allen Muhammad randomly killed 10 people and injured three others during a three-week rampage in October 2002. They were arrested near Frederick, Md., after an intense search that gripped the nation and the world.\n\nMalvo was 17 when the killings occurred. Muhammad was executed in 2009, and Malvo was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nAs a result of a state law enacted this year that gives those who committed crimes when they were under 18 the chance to seek parole after 20 years, Malvo is eligible for release in 2024.\n\nThe change came as he was in the middle of an appeal to the Supreme Court to have his life sentence rescinded. He later dropped the appeal.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEven if he is released from prison in Virginia, he was also sentenced to life in prison in Maryland.\n\nMarriages in Virginia prisons are highly regulated.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, has come forward with her story of being raped by a former boyfriend, saying she decided to do so after details of her divorce were made public earlier this week.\n\nI didn't want to share it with anybody, and in the era of #MeToo survivors, I always believed that every person is different and they will confront their demons when they're ready, Ernst told Bloomberg News in an interview published late Wednesday. And I was not ready.\n\nErnst, 48, told Bloomberg that she was raped while a student at Iowa State University by a man who she described as very abusive ... physically and sexually abusive. She says that she ended the relationship and called the campus sexual assault counseling center's hotline, but did not report the rape to police.\n\nAfter graduating from Iowa State in 1992, Ernst married her now ex-husband Gail and followed him to Georgia, where he was stationed with the U.S. Army. In court documents, Joni Ernst says she and Gail had an argument that became physical after she confronted him about the time he was spending with their daughter's baby sitter. Ernst elaborated on the alleged assault to Bloomberg.\n\nFLASHBACK: SEN. JONI ERNST ON WHY SHE'S SUPPORTING BRETT KAVANAUGH\n\nHe turned around at the landing, and he grabbed me by the throat with his hands and threw me on the landing floor, she said. And then he pounded my head ... on the landing. It was very sudden and very violent. It scared me. Ernst said that the alleged assault took place in 2007 or 2008 when she was serving as an Iowa county auditor.\n\nIvan Miller, an attorney for 65-year-old Gail Ernst, said the senator's husband is not commenting.\n\nOut of respect for his family, Gail is declining to make any statements at this point, Miller said in a statement to Fox News.\n\nIn her affidavit, Ernst said she did not go to a hospital because I was embarrassed and humiliated. She added that Gail Ernst agreed to attend marriage counseling, but told her not to bring up the assault in our counseling sessions, a request to which she says I stupidly agreed.\n\nWe moved on, Ernst said in the document, although things have never really been the same.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn addition to the alleged physical assault, Ernst describes her ex-husband as mean and verbally abusive in the affidavit. She says she turned down the opportunity to be Donald Trump's running mate in the 2016 presidential campaign because it wasn't the right thing for me or my family.\n\nFLASHBACK: SEN. JONI ERNST IN THE RUNNING TO BE TRUMP'S VP?\n\nI continued to make sacrifices and not soar higher out of concern for Gail and our family, she says. Meanwhile, he hated any success I had, and would belittle me and get angry any time I achieved a goal. Ernst also said her husband threatened to divorce her if she ran for re-election to the Senate in 2020.\n\nIn an affidavit filed by his lawyer, Gail Ernst said Joni's career was all-consuming and impacted the amount of time she spent with her family.\n\nWhen the divorce was finalized this month, neither party was granted alimony. Gail Ernst did receive their home in Red Oak, Iowa, and other properties.\n\nFox News' Kaitlyn Schallhorn contributed to this report.
Oprah Winfrey has a unique view on marriage.\n\nIn an essay published Wednesday in O Magazine, the media mogul, 65, revealed that there is a good reason behind her and longtime partner Stedman Graham never marrying.\n\nI realized I didn't actually want a marriage. I wanted to be asked, Winfrey recalled after accepting Graham's 1993 proposal. I wanted to know he felt I was worthy of being his missus, but I didn't want the sacrifices, the compromises, the day-in-day-out commitment required to make a marriage work.\n\nHe and I agree that had we tied the marital knot, we would not still be together, Winfrey said, explaining that she and Graham are both aware that her work is her priority.\n\nWinfrey said that the relationship, which began in 1986, has worked for decades because he has an identity beyond Oprah's man, as well as the fact that they relish seeing the other fulfill and manifest their destiny and purpose.\n\nWinfrey said they have instead opted for a spiritual partnership, citing Gary Zukav's definition of the term -- partnership between equals for the purpose of spiritual growth -- as a descriptor of their relationship.\n\nMarriage or no marriage, Winfrey couldn't help but gush about her beau.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnyone who's ever met him is always amazed by what a genuine gentleman he is, she said. He's so positive. Wants the best for me and everyone he knows. Truly wishes people well. Doesn't curse... Never have I heard him gossip or say a negative thing about anyone.\n\nShe added: He's appropriately named because he's steady as a mountain. Even-tempered, accountable, trustworthy, patient.

Cooper opted for a more classic look with a traditional black tuxedo.\n\nThe pair were joined by British Vogue's editor-in-chief Edward Enninful, who recently interviewed the supermodel for the fashion magazine's March 2020 cover story.\n\nIRINA SHAYK TALKS EX BRADLEY COOPER, LIFE AS A SINGLE MOM TO 2-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER LEA IN RARE INTERVIEW\n\nBRADLEY COOPER, IRINA SHAYK HAVE A GOOD CO-PARENTING RELATIONSHIP FOLLOWING BREAKUP\n\nIn the issue, the 34-year-old got candid about her four-year-long relationship with the actor, 45, for the first time.\n\nShayk and Cooper share a 2-year-old daughter named Lea De Seine.\n\nI think in all good relationships you bring your best and your worst — it's just the nature of a human being, Shayk reflected to the outlet. Two great people don't have to make a good couple.\n\nI think we've been very lucky to experience what we had with each other, she continued. Life without B is new ground. It's hard to find a balance between being a single mom and being a working woman and provider. Trust me, there are days I wake up and I'm like, 'Oh my God, I don't know what to do, I'm falling apart.'\n\nBack in June 2019, People confirmed that Cooper and Shayk called it quits and were amicably sharing custody of their daughter.\n\nIRINA SHAYK SAYS SHE STILL BELIEVES IN MARRIAGE AFTER BRADLEY COOPER SPLIT: 'I'M NOT AGAINST IT'\n\nIRINA SHAYK HITS THE RUNWAY FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE BRADLEY COOPER SPLIT\n\nAccording to the outlet, the Oscar-nominated star and the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit pinup began dating in the spring of 2015. Throughout their courtship, the couple was fiercely private about their relationship and rarely spoke about their romance even when they were together.\n\nI have a lot of friends who share a lot of their personal life on Instagram or social media, very publicly, Shake told Glamour UK in February 2019. I admire it and I think it's great — but I think it's all about personal choice.\n\nBecause my work requires me to be out there, I just decided my personal life will be quiet, she continued. That's why it's called personal, because it's something for you and your family, and I feel happy with it.\n\nIn 2016, Cooper and Shayk sparked engagement rumors when the model was spotted rocking a large emerald ring, which she wore for more than two years. However, a source told People the couple was more focused on raising their child than getting married.

This quarantine has forced us to actually move in together, Cuoco told the late-night host. It's been great for our relationship. And we like each other, we realized, which is even better!\n\nThe former Big Bang Theory star said she and Cook came to a head last month when she was forced back home to Los Angeles while filming in New York due to the fact that the looming global health crisis has stifled productions throughout the nation and studios have reported delays in program releases because of COVID-19.\n\nI was shooting in New York and got sent back here, obviously, because of everything that was going on and we got to move into the house together, she explained. So we moved in and I can't find anything. But the house is great.\n\nKALEY CUOCO'S SISTER BRIANA SET FOR RECURRING ROLE IN 'THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT'\n\nShe quipped that Cook would love it if I found my makeup at some point, as she donned an oversized T-shirt and went makeup-free during her night show appearance.\n\nIn August 2019, she opened up to E! News about not living with her husband, adding that the arrangement merely worked out for the pair because of their intense travel schedules and the fact they're constantly in different locations.\n\nWe have different locations that we're at a lot, she said at the time. We're not together every single day.\n\nCuoco said in the same interview that she and Cook were building their dream house and would eventually be under the same roof forever.\n\n'BIG BANG THEORY' STAR KALEY CUOCO EXPLAINS WHY SHE AND HUSBAND KARL COOK STILL DON'T LIVE TOGETHER\n\nWe have a very unconventional marriage, you know, Cuoco added at the time.\n\nShe later clarified Cook's reasoning for their living apart on Brad Goreski's podcast Brad Behavior.\n\nKALEY CUOCO CELEBRATES BIRTHDAY OVERSEAS: THIS IS 'THE COOLEST BIRTHDAY TO DATE'\n\nI've obviously never been in a better relationship and I want this to last the rest of my life so, in a way, we're actually taking it slow, she said. We've been together for almost four years. We've not lived together. We are building our house, as you know. We will be under the same roof, eventually, but this has worked for us.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n... I have the best relationship with Karl. We are so happy, but yes, we have separate lives and then our lives come together and he's so supportive of me, she added. He lets me be me, and I let him be him.\n\nCuoco and Cook tied the knot in June 2018.
Marriage starts out with grand vision – a shared way of seeing what you hope your future together will be. It is exciting and full of possibilities. But for many, marriage becomes filled with problems we never anticipated and for which we do not have the tools to navigate. Unanticipated problems throw us off course, and we don't know how to reorient. Some couples lose sight of their destination, while others never had a clear vision in the first place.\n\nYour marriage has a unique identity. Think of the way fingerprints are the physical attribute that help us understand how perfectly unique each person has been created. The tiny ridges, whorls, and valley patterns on a person's finger are entirely distinct to that person. In fact, no two fingerprints have ever been found alike in billions of comparisons.\n\nSimilarly, each marriage also has an identity that cannot be replicated by any other couple. Before a couple gets married, they exist as two separate individuals. Their respective personas are entirely individual and unduplicated. When two people come together in marriage, they create a unique marriage print. Together you and your spouse can leave an imprint on the world in a way no other couple can.\n\nMY WIFE AND I THOUGHT WE KNEW EACH OTHER – THEN THIS HAPPENED\n\nIt is the joint dedication to a greater vision – a vision that is realized through your marriage in a greater way than it could be realized individually. By identifying your unique marriage print and determining how to lean in and maximize it, you can leverage your marriage for meaning and impact.\n\nMost couples have not taken time to consider God's larger purpose for their marriage, but there's great hope for your future if you can start here and now. When you buy into a shared vision, it is like pre-deciding a thousand decisions before they are ever made.\n\nYou may have a strong sense that there is a purpose for your marriage, but it hasn't been revealed to you yet. Years ago my family (Joel) took a vacation to the mountains of Colorado. We arrived late at night and drove to our little cabin in a small town at the base of the mountains. It was dark when we arrived. The air was fresh, and the mood was calm. I had been told of the beauty of the region, but because it was dark, I wasn't able to see it for myself. We went to bed, but when I got up the next morning and walked outside, my jaw dropped. The Rocky Mountains were on full display, spread out before us in full grandeur. The mountains were framed with clouds that brought new revelation to the color silver. It was breathtaking.\n\nThough it had gone unseen the night before, that didn't mean it was not present. But when what was present was revealed to me, I saw it all new. As the apostle Paul writes in Ephesians 1:8–9, With all wisdom and understanding, [God] made known [revealed] to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ.\n\nPerhaps you want clarity on the purpose for your marriage but it feels unclear. Just like the mountains hidden in the night, you know God's vision is there, but you just can't see it yet. You want to know how to get a clear revelation of that vision.\n\nThe unique vision for your marriage will be revealed in prayer. In the Scriptures, each time vision was granted, it was given from God. A passage in Mark's Gospel tells of a miracle Jesus performed. In Mark 8, Jesus pulls a blind man out of his routine and takes him outside the city. He puts mud on his eyes and touches him. The man experiences a miracle and gains his sight! But when Jesus asked him what he saw, the blind man responded in verse 24, I see people; they look like trees walking around. He could see, but his sight was blurry.\n\nThis can be a theologically troubling passage for those who believe in the omnipotence and omniscience of Jesus. Why would Jesus ask the blind man what he saw if He is all-powerful and all-knowing? Jesus would often ask a question not so much to glean information as to impart revelation. Jesus forces the man to acknowledge the work of God on him but also to confront its lack of completion. He wanted him to come back for another touch. Jesus touched the man's eyes again, and he received clear vision. Once more Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.\n\nSome of you feel like God has touched your marriage. You've seen good moments in your marriage. You have a love for the other person. But you also have frustration. There is confusion. Does it often feels like you are pulling in opposite directions? Your vision is cloudy, and if you're honest, God's purpose for your marriage isn't clear right now.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWe suggest that God is not finished with the miracle yet. You have seen evidence that God is at work, even if it doesn't make sense right now. Don't give up on your spouse or yourself in this season. Keep asking God to give you clear sight. In Mark 8, grace happened in the first touch when Jesus put His hand on the man to lead him out of the city. Sight happened in the second touch. But vision didn't come until the third touch! Don't walk away from your marriage before God gives the final touch.\n\nGrace prepares us in marriage. Sight gives faith to us in marriage. But vision launches us forward in marriage. Don't stop short of God's full and clear vision for your marriage. Don't be satisfied with the attachment version of marriage. Ask God to reveal your marriage print. God is doing a completing work. Your invitation is to press into His presence until He grants revelation through prayer.\n\nMark Batterson is the New York Times bestselling author of fifteen books, including The Circle Maker.

The 2020 election cycle has already begun and the superstars of the Democratic Party are now more left-wing than ever before and they're already trying to outdo another on the compassion scale.\n\nWell the first thing I would do is restore what's been lost - The integrity and the compassion of this country, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. said.\n\nNew York loves you if you are L or G or B or T or Q. If you are black or white or brown, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told an audience. If you are Christian, a Muslim or you are Jewish. If you are new immigrant or an old immigrant, New York loves you. And what makes us great is we have no tolerance for hate in our state.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LAURA INGRAHAM.\n\nCatchy. He left off Asians and atheists. When Cuomo says no tolerance for hate, he really means no tolerance for conservatives in the positions that they hold. Because in Cuomo's compassionate New York, there's also no tolerance for the inalienable rights of the unborn. You know, the life in the womb that his own church says is sacred.\n\nI believe we should pass a constitutional amendment, not just a Roe V. Wade law, Cuomo has said. A constitutional amendment. Let's write the rights of Roe V. Wade into the state constitution so it can never be changed.\n\nI think what's going on here is that Cuomo, like so many on the left, is really worried. He's worried that the Supreme Court might reverse Roe, might send it all back to the states. And he has to know that public opinion is shifting a bit toward the more pro-life position. And by the way, if America's declining fertility rate continues, Andy, I have a question: Who's going pay all those taxes to support your pet projects?\n\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.\n\nOf course, with zero regard for facts, Cuomo brags that he has this economic prosperity thing down.\n\nWith the most progressive government in the United States of America, we balanced budgets, he says. We have the most socially progressive accomplishments of any state in the nation and it's not even close. First big state to pass marriage equality, first state to pass $15, the highest minimum wage.\n\nYay! The Democrat zombies are all standing. They're applauding, standing ovation. But they're unconcerned with the real world effects of some of those policies, namely this rise in the minimum wage. Jon Bloostein, who owns six restaurants in New York City, told CBS, We lost control of our largest controllable expense. So in order to live with that and stay in the business here, we're cutting hours.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.\n\nWell, this is the third wage hike in New York since 2016. So, who does that really help? Well, certainly not the restaurants, not the workers getting the hours cut. And not the patrons.\n\nA New York City Hospitality Alliance survey of 574 restaurants found that 75 percent of full service restaurants planned to cut employee hours this year due to that minimum wage hike. But that's not all: 47 percent say they will cut jobs in 2019. And 87 percent say they're going to raise menu prices.\n\nWell, this is the opposite, my friends, of compassion And this brings us to the freshest of congressional freshmen. Fresh people - what can we say now? Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who happily refers to herself as both a socialist and a radical.\n\nNow, by the way, I think it's a mistake for conservatives not to take her seriously, to brush her off as kind of a flash in the pan or an upstart. She's as close to a thought leader that the Democratic Party has today, and she has a massive social media following. She's both charismatic, and she's committed to transforming both our economic system and our culture. First, she aims to create a socialist economic system with sky high marginal tax rates.\n\nAnd it doesn't stop there. On the cultural side, she and others like her intend to use the government and their positions of influence now to mandate campus-style political correctness.\n\nWhat do I mean by that? Well, anyone who dares question this progressive agenda is not just wrong, but they're downright evil. So, there's no room for debate, only demonization. In a recent tweet she asserts, Many have recognized that Fox news has crossed the line beyond conservatism and into outright bigotry, with their financing of Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham.\n\nWhen you say the wrong thing in Ocasio-Cortez world, they put you in detention hall and you never get out. Remember, they believe that they are right and you're evil. And moderates even seem petrified of taking on these new progressives. And Republicans ought to take the progressive takeover of the Democratic Party very seriously and offer a strong counter narrative.\n\nWell, you see my friends, this isn't your daddy's liberalism, where it was all about love and peace and live and let live. This is kind of the old school, New England puritanism with a radical twist. They're going to whip up their followers to try to intimidate and silence anyone who gets in their way.\n\nNow she's only been on the job for, like, six days, but Ocasio-Cortez already practicing Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals. Rule 13: Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it and polarize it. Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people, and not institutions. People hurt faster than institutions.\n\nSo, rather than debating the merits of policies, these new left-wing progressive Puritans aim to shame. A wall is racist, so people who want a wall are racist. End of story.\n\nNow, all of you are doing better in the Trump economy, you should know this: They plan to take your money away and redistribute it to you know, wherever their pet causes are. And to all of our libertarian friends who believe that Trump is the big threat to the free market because of tariffs and so forth, open your eyes. These people, including Nancy Pelosi, who herself has moved left, are going to take it all away. Freedom of speech, freedom of contract, freedom of religion or conscience.\n\nIf you think I'm exaggerating, I'm not. Because when you say the wrong thing in Ocasio-Cortez world, they put you in detention hall and you never get out. Remember, they believe that they are right and you're evil. And moderates even seem petrified of taking on these new progressives. And Republicans ought to take the progressive takeover of the Democratic Party very seriously and offer a strong counter narrative.\n\nIf you want to know what it looks like to be a conservative and perpetually in the fetal position, worried about being branded racist or evil, well, look no further than Theresa May, okay? Didn't work out so well for her, to be on her heels.\n\nNow Trump is the opposite. He fights. He fights for law and order. He fights for sovereignty. He fights for judges who apply the law and don't rewrite it. And he fights for a stronger economy.\n\nAfter two years of President Trump, we have higher wages, we have 500,000 new manufacturing jobs, we have the strongest GDP growth among all the G7 nations. But the progressives, they don't care. Because if enacting their Green contract with America requires your standard of living to go down, then tough cookies.\n\nThese people are fanatics. And they're running for president. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is not ruling it out.\n\nAnd watch your wallet. What are the progressives actually learning themselves? Moderates aren't learning - what are the progressive learning? Well, not much. Americans are fleeing the most progressive states in America due to high costs and high taxes. No wonder they're welcoming illegal immigrants in New York and California. They need the citizens coming in; all the other citizens are leaving.\n\nAre Americans really ready to be ruled by the values and policies of progressives in New York and California? Let's hope not.\n\nAdapted from Laura Ingraham's monologue from The Ingraham Angle on January 16, 2019.
The 2020 presidential race is just beginning, and already several declared or possible Democratic contenders once seen as moderates have shifted markedly to the left, in apparent appeals to the party's powerful progressive wing that have at the same time exposed them to charges of political opportunism.\n\nNew York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, former Texas Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard are among the prominent Democrats whose fiery rhetoric little resembles their more moderate days off the national stage.\n\nWhile Democrats race to the radical left, they are running further away from mainstream Americans, Republican National Committee spokesman Steve Guest told Fox News.\n\nGillibrand, who announced she was planning a presidential run on Tuesday night, boasted in 2009 about receiving a 100 percent A rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA) and said she kept two guns under her bed. She was also a member of the conservative Democratic Blue Dog coalition when she represented New York's rural 20th congressional district in the House.\n\nGillibrand first began recasting her politics upon her appointment by then-Gov. David Paterson to fill the Senate seat vacated by Hillary Clinton in 2009. Liberal groups had savaged Gillibrand at the time not only for her pro-Second Amendment views, but also her strong opposition to illegal immigration -- which included a plan to make English the official language of the U.S. and to empower local law enforcement officials to enforce federal immigration laws.\n\nWHO IS KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND? 5 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW DEMOCRATIC HOPEFUL\n\nNow one of the most outspoken advocates for eliminating Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Gillibrand admitted in 2009 that she would have to change her views because she now represented the whole state, rather than a traditionally conservative enclave.\n\nThe NRA quickly downgraded her perfect gun-rights rating to an F during her first year in the Senate, as she embraced gun-control proposals and described her epiphany on the dangers of unregulated firearms. In 2012, she wrote an op-ed in the New York Daily News asserting that the attempted assassination of Rep. Gabby Giffords in early 2011 at the hands of a mentally ill gunman had convinced her of the need for reasonable limits on the Second Amendment.\n\nIn 2018, Gillibrand told CBS News' 60 Minutes that she was embarrassed by her previous views on gun rights and ashamed of her stance on illegal immigration.\n\nI came from a district that was 98 percent white, Gillibrand told the network. We have immigrants, but not a lot of immigrants. And I hadn't really spent the time to hear those kind of stories about what's it like to worry that your dad could be taken away at any moment.\n\nGROWING NUMBER OF 2020 DEMS SUPPORTING 'GREEN NEW DEAL'\n\nShe added: After I got appointed, I went down to Brooklyn to meet with families who had suffered from gun violence in their communities. And you immediately experience the feeling that I couldn't have been more wrong. You know, I only had the lens of upstate New York. (Prior to becoming a congresswoman, Gillibrand had lived in New York City for approximately a decade.)\n\nGillibrand has also reversed her position on driver's licenses for illegal immigrants, suggesting she supports the idea after previously opposing it years ago.\n\nSome of the senator's overtures to the progressive left have been less well received. Late last year, Gillibrand tweeted that the future is both female and intersectional, prompting a rebuke from Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who responded that the future is American and an identity based not on gender, race, ethnicity or religion.\n\nAdded Donald Trump Jr. :Good to know. My girls will be excited about this. When is it appropriate to let my boys (9, 7 and 6 years old) that there's no future for them? Not sure this is a winning platform but you be you.\n\nGillibrand has also been described by GQ Magazine as the face of #metoo, after she led to charge to secure former Minnesota Democratic Sen. Al Franken's resignation in 2017 amid claims of sexual misconduct. But her role in Franken's ouster rankled some progressives who felt that Franken was a victim of a rush to judgment.\n\nIn 2018, liberal billionaire megadonor George Soros charged that Gillibrand turned on Franken to improve her chances in the 2020 presidential race. I may add that there's only one whom I would not like to see succeed, and that's Gillibrand of New York, Soros told The Washington Post.\n\nI don't think it disqualifies her, former New York lieutenant governor Richard Ravitch told Business Insider. I just don't like or respect what she did.\n\nWhile Democrats race to the radical left, they are running further away from mainstream Americans. — RNC spokesman Steve Guest\n\nFor her part, Gillibrand fired back at Soros, saying that if he has a problem with her handling of the Franken situation, that's on him.\n\nMore recently, Gillibrand has faced claims of misleading voters during her 2018 Senate run. Less than three months ago, Gillibrand promised when asked directly about her possible White House ambitions that I will serve my six-year term in the Senate, rather than run for the presidency. Gillibrand overwhelmingly won re-election in November.\n\nNew York GOP spokeswoman Jessica Proud, in a statement this week, characterized Gillibrand's shifts as disqualifying and cynical.\n\nIt was only three months ago during the campaign that Kirsten Gillibrand point-blank lied to New Yorkers that she would fulfill her term if re-elected, Proud said. In her lackluster career as an elected official, she has demonstrated a disturbing disregard for the truth and principled positions in the name of self-serving personal advancement. If she treats her current constituents with such disrespect, we shudder to think what she'd do to the nation.\n\nLike Gillibrand, the 46-year-old O'Rourke previously served in the House of Representatives, where he built a reputation as a moderate Democrat willing to reach bipartisan compromise -- even though, unlike Gillibrand, he represented a heavily Democratic district. O'Rourke has not formally announced that he is running for president, but is widely considered a potential contender.\n\nGOP ADOPTING TAKE-NO-PRISONERS APPROACH TO EVEN LONGSHOT 2020 DEMS\n\nO'Rourke was one of a handful of Democrats to support the Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization Act in 2017, which permitted the Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) commissioner to waive the polygraph requirement for certain applicants seeking to join the agency.\n\nThe then-congressman said the legislation was needed to help speed up the hiring process and provide the CBP commissioner additional authorities to recruit and hire quality CBP officers and border patrol agents.\n\nBut then-Illinois Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez, at the time, remarked that Anyone who votes for this bill is voting to support and implement Donald Trump's views on immigration, his desire to militarize our southern border, and his fantasy of a mass deportation force.\n\nIn 2015, O'Rourke was among a small number of House Democrats to oppose an oil export ban, and the next year, he rejected an amendment that would have barred spending on research for offshore drilling.\n\nThe votes were typical for O'Rourke, whose outreach to Republicans was cited during his Senate run by numerous newspaper editorial boards, including the El Paso Times. An analysis by FiveThirtyEight found that in his final year in Congress, O'Rourke sided with the Trump administration 30 percent of the time, and ProPublica data showed he was among the top 20 percent of Democrats most willing to buck his own party.\n\nO'Rourke opted not to sponsor Democratic legislation aimed at providing free college and Medicare-for-all, and did not become a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus -- choosing instead to join the moderate New Democrat Coalition.\n\nIn December, O'Rourke even demurred when asked if he is a progressive, saying only, I don't know and insisting that he was not big on labels.\n\nNevertheless, both during the course of his Senate run and afterwards, O'Rourke sharpened his progressive bona fides, calling explicitly for single-payer universal health care, legalizing marijuana, and impeaching President Trump.\n\nIn an interview The Washington Post this week, O'Rourke claimed that border walls like the one proposed by Trump will ensure death, and he even suggested the principles in the Constitution may be outdated and useless in the modern age.\n\nBut The Post's article revealed that O'Rourke, like Gillibrand, faces skepticism about the sincerity of his apparent change of heart. The paper's report included an apparent shot by at O'Rourke from Gutierrez, who told The Post he was very pleasantly surprised that O'Rourke -- who represented a mostly Hispanic district during his three terms in the House of Representatives -- was suddenly interested in immigration reform efforts last year.\n\nANDY PUZDER: WHY BERNIE SANDERS' MINIMUM WAGE PROPOSAL IS IRRELEVANT\n\nThe interview additionally included several comments from O'Rourke calling for debate on various issues, from the White House's Syria pullout to immigration reform, rather than offering specific policy proposals.\n\nBut perhaps the most dramatic shift towards the progressive wing among prospective 2020 Democratic hopefuls has come from Tulsi Gabbard, the 37-year-old Hawaii congresswoman who has served since 2013.\n\nGabbard spoke at the Democratic National Convention in 2012, and her initial congressional bid was endorsed by then-President Barack Obama. She also served as one of four vice chairs on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) -- but has since become a self-described enemy of the party's establishment.\n\nIn 2011, Gabbard wrote a lengthy explainer on her campaign website that delved into her changes of heart on a variety of issues. Gabbard announced in the blog post that she was now committed to preserving a woman's right to choose, even though at one time, I was anti-choice.\n\nI also once supported a state constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman, she added.\n\nAll that changed, Gabbard claimed, when she served two tours of duty in the Middle East, and saw how governments there maintain excessive control of people's personal lives.\n\nThe about-face struck some commentators as unpersuasive. Zack Beauchamp, a senior correspondent for the left-leaning Vox.com, wrote on Wednesday that a skeptic could cast this as mere political convenience: a person who had spent much of her adult life in politics getting a sense of which way the wind was blowing in the party.\n\nSYRIAN EMERGENCY TASK FORCE DIRECTOR: GABBARD SHOWED 'ZERO SYMPATHY' FOR VICTIMS OF SYRIAN GAS ATTACK\n\nIn 2016, Gabbard bucked the Obama administration by aligning herself with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and by criticizing Obama's refusal to use the term radical Islam.\n\nMost dramatically, Gabbard endorsed Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential candidacy. She resigned as DNC vice chair in the process, cementing her abandonment of the party's more centrist establishment in favor of Sanders' rejection of the status quo.\n\nBut the main problem for Gabbard, observers said in the hours after she announced her presidential bid last week, was that she had espoused hardline beliefs on issues like homosexuality in the past.\n\nGabbard was a visible force against same-sex marriage, and in 2004 spearheaded a fight in the state against a same-sex union measure. To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, she said at the time. As Democrats, we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists.\n\nGabbard also gave a lengthy speech at the Hawaii State House against a proposed resolution that addressed the bullying of gay students in public schools. Gabbard argued the resolution would cast homosexuality as normal, and that it would attract homosexual-advocacy organizations into our schools to promote their agenda to our vulnerable youth.\n\nThose comments, gay-rights activists said this week, were politically unforgivable.\n\nWe've seen [people] who may held a particular view and evolved to a place of acceptance, but rarely have we seen someone who was so actively and vehemently and viscerally against LGBTQ equality and acceptance, said Zeke Stokes, the vice president of programs at GLAAD, one of the most prominent LGBTQ advocacy groups, in an interview with Fox News. [Gabbard] was someone who worked so actively against our community when the stakes were so high.\n\nGabbard now says she's evolved, reportedly explaining: Much work remains to ensure equality and civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ Americans and if elected president, I will continue to fight for equal rights for all.\n\nFox News' Elizabeth Llorente contributed to this report.
