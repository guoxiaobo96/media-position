Some are looking to find a home among Freemasons, and what Geiser called the old guard and the new members have differences of opinion.
One of the ways that he's living out his faith is by centering the issues of equity at the heart of his administration, which I find super-exciting, she said. It's never happened before.
Religious liberty means not only freedom to practice our faith as we see fit, but it's also freedom from having the religious views of others imposed on us, she said. That was something that was really missing these last four years.
In the fall, the Grand Lodge of Tennessee suspended two Memphis Freemasons, Dennis Clark and Mark Henderson, who had married in June after the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage, according to Hodapp's blog. A handful of Nashville Freemasons have withdrawn from Tennessee chapters to speak out for the two men.
Biden has become a strong supporter of Roe v. Wade and, in 2019, reversed his support for a longstanding provision that bans federal funding for most abortions.
As someone who lives to rewrite history, Williams' most pressing goal at the moment is to tie the record of 24 Grand Slam singles trophies won by former Australian Margaret Court.
As a skater, Weir often found more popularity with the sport's occasional fans than he did from the traditionalists. He feels the same is true of his commentary.
Another of his earliest actions strengthened anti-discrimination protections for gay and transgender people. On Thursday, Biden was expected to sign a memorandum to protect the rights of LGBTQ people worldwide, including providing protections to gay and lesbian refugees and asylum seekers.
I think, Cox said, that's really going to be challenge.
That brand of irreverent humor isn't appreciated by some of the sport's hardcore and traditionalist fans, but is adored by the wider mainstream set that truly drives ratings. Figure skating hasn't boomed since the 1990s and has been left behind by the rapidly evolving media landscape. Weir and Lipinski are doing their darndest to bring it back.
Kenworthy leaves these Games without a medal, but he won something much bigger. More tolerance and acceptance, both for himself and the entire LGBTQ community.
Two Freemasons confirmed the results to The Tennessean but asked for anonymity because business conducted at the meetings is secret, and revealing information discussed at a meeting could result in them being kicked out of the organization. The vote took place at the Grand Lodge of Tennessee in downtown Nashville.
It is yet one more step in the road to true equality.
The contrast couldn't be starker, said John Carr, co-director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown University. We're going from one of the least overtly religious presidents in modern times to one of the most overtly religious presidents in recent history.
You can't say that marriage is a union between one man and one woman, Alito said. Until very recently, that's what the vast majority of Americans thought. Now it's considered bigotry.
But there are still places in the world where daring to be yourself is dangerous, where being gay can get you killed. There are politicians in our own country, the president and vice president chief among them, who view members of the LGBTQ community as being somehow less, and promote policies that have no other objective than to marginalize them.
The second-longest serving apostle will be designated as the new president of the Quorum of the Twelve after the reorganization of the First Presidency. This would be Dallin H. Oaks, who has served for 33 years and nine months.
The senior apostle will then preside over a meeting of the Quorum of the Twelve to consider two alternatives: should the First Presidency be reorganized or should they just move forward with the Quorum of the Twelve? A formal motion will be made and accepted.
I think character matters, competence matters and treating people with respect matters, Carr said. Lifting up the poor and vulnerable matters, and Trump failed those tests for me.
There are 15 LGBTQ athletes competing in Pyeongchang -- including Rippon and Gus Kenworthy (skiing) from Team USA --- per Outsports.com. There were seven in Sochi four years ago.
So to see Kenworthy and his boyfriend act like any other couple, to be treated like any heterosexual couple, it speaks volumes. So, too, to see Rippon being embraced from Hollywood to the heartland.
While Kenworthy and Rippon are proud of who they are and are willing standard bearers for the LGBTQ community, they look forward to the day when their sexual orientation is irrelevant. When they, or those who follow them, are known as athletes who happen to be gay rather than gay athletes.
Rippon is hardly the first gay male figure skater, a sport that has seen gold medalist Brian Boitano, Rudy Galindoand NBC broadcaster Johnny Weir among the American skaters who have come out. However, they made that choice later in their careers or after their respective retirements.
Trump will leave office having significantly altered the makeup of the federal judiciary, from lower courts to the Supreme Court – an accomplishment made possible by Senate Republicans and one that will create a major obstacle for President-elect Joe Biden.
She explained that she's always going to be vocal online about things like LGBTQ and animal rights, but knows she's another voice amongst other opinions.
Far from creating a more equitable society, Christian conservatives say, Biden's actions are reverse discrimination – particularly his first-day move to ensure workplace and other protections for people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.
I definitely had that fantasy about being a figure skater when I was a young gay kid, said Darrow, who now works for the Cleveland Indians. I think most young gay boys did something of the sort. I think Adam is definitely easier to relate to on that front than somebody like a (football player) like I was.
I was trying to remind myself that win or lose, I still have a lot to be proud of, Kenworthy said.
McGowan said she expects similar cases and rulings to make their way through the federal court system.
NASHVILLE — Tennessee Freemasons overwhelmingly voted Thursday to uphold a ban on gay members, according to Freemasons who witnessed the vote at a members-only meeting here.

Weir and Lipinski are an oddity no more. Somehow, through the force of their own chemistry and personality, they have become a staple of the American Olympic landscape. Last time they were largely tucked away on the NBC Sports Network. Now they are front and center — and ready to shine brighter than the glittering costumes on the ice.
Being true to who you are and not giving a (expletive) about what others think about you is an awesome and liberating thing whether you are gay or not, Rippon wrote on Twitter earlier this week. Sometimes we the gays need to be reminded more often but, LIKE, EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT, FOR REAL. JUST DO IT.
In 2019, Judge James Ho, whom Trump nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, wrote an opinion denying health care to a transgender woman who was seeking sex-reassignment surgery while in a Texas prison. Ho, who referred to the inmate using male pronouns, wrote that while it can be considered cruel and unusual punishment to deny essential medical care to a prisoner, there is much disagreement in the medical community about the necessity of sex-reassignment surgery.
To see somebody like this who is unashamed, unafraid … it's game-changing. It's life-changing. It's reaffirming, said Tyler Oakley, a YouTube host and LGBTQ activist who has become friends with Kenworthy and called him and Rippon possibility models.
I'm not gay myself, but I have friends who are, Chase Geiser of Nashville said Monday. I don't think this is right, and it is something that will prevent younger members from joining the organization that has seen decreasing numbers since World War II.
Biden, only the second Catholic president, has brought to the White House a different approach to faith, both personally and through policy.
When you are trying to reach a younger crowd, this is 2018, the old school way isn't going to work, Lipinski, 35, told USA TODAY Sports in recent joint interview with Weir. You have to be honest and lay it down exactly as you see it. There's a lot of pretty strange things in our sport and you have to have a good chuckle.
Also last year, two Trump-nominated judges to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit voted to strike down local laws protecting LGBTQ minors from conversion therapy, a practice of attempting to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. The American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association have discredited the practice.
Carr, of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life, said he backed Biden, in spite of Biden's going along with the extremism of the Democratic Party on abortion.
It's an awesome time, Mason Darrow, who came out in 2015 while a member of Princeton's football team, told USA TODAY Sports. For the lack of a better word, it's a gay Olympics. I think it's (a) really nice change of pace.
Gus was worried before he came out that he would lose his fan base, said his father, Peter. I said, `You never know. You might gain a whole other fan base.' Which is exactly what happened.
Lipinski remembers them working all day — then we'd cry and have therapy sessions with each other — then get back at it the next day and put together a collective breakout performance.
(Trump) is looking for people with a principled judicial philosophy, Severino said. The fundamental question is making sure we have judges who are going to be faithful to the Constitution.

The interesting thing with Adam is that he's been embraced by the LGBT majority more than most out athletes, Nicodemo said. I think he's a lot of us who go brunching on Sundays and wear glitter. They see themselves in Adam even if they can't skate.
White evangelical Protestants were Trump's strongest supporters, according to the Pew Research Center. That's despite Trump having been one of the least religious to ever run for the presidency.
The pair are close enough now that they sit for interviews with their bodies touching, and finish each other's sentences. Weir, who is openly gay, was bridesman at Lipinski's wedding to television producer Todd Kapostasy last summer.
The feeling of both loss and victimization is reflected in Pew Research Center surveys. In a 2019 poll, a majority of adults who identify with or lean toward the GOP said that religion is losing influence in American life and that this is a bad thing. A 2020 survey suggests that Republicans who have experienced some form of harassment online are more likely than Democrats to say they believe their religion was a reason.
For many, the commentary combo of Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir are more of a reason to tune in to the Winter Olympics than the individuals and pairs populating the competition itself.
White Christians – including white evangelical Protestants and white mainline Catholics – believe the U.S. has a central culture, surveys show. The majority of everyone else believe culture and values adjust, Cox said.
The fact that he happens to have come out as gay and did so as an active athlete is about the only thing that links Rippon to some of the more masc sports figures who courageously came out over the years — and that's part of his appeal.
Nigeria bans gay marriage, gay meetings
Our sport is very political and subjective and you can hide that if you want, Lipinski added. But why would you? If a skater falls five times and wins and the next skater who did stand up, doesn't (win), it is very confusing. Johnny is not afraid to go out on that limb, point it out and let the judges know he didn't agree.

After the first day, then there are customarily four votes per day, trying to reach a two-thirds majority of the cardinals. In 2013, Jorge Mario Bergoglio was chosen on the second day on the fifth ballot and became Pope Francis. Reese noted the last time a conclave lasted more than four days was in 1831.
After morning prayers, the first balloting takes place, the Rev. Thomas Reese, author of Inside the Vatican: The Politics and Organization of the Catholic Church, told USA TODAY in 2013, during the selection of Pope Francis, who succeeded retiring Pope Benedict.
Are we feeling more loved? he said. Really hardcore skating fans … it's hard to impress them. We are getting a lot of love from people who don't watch skating and that's what we want — people to come back to our sport. But the sport itself doesn't change much, or quickly.
Carrie Severino, chief counsel at the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, which has promoted and applauded Trump's nominees, previously said the nomination process under the Trump administration is not about meeting quotas.
Biden's own positions on gay marriage and abortion evolved over the years. After voting to block federal recognition of same-sex marriages 16 years earlier, he backed legalizing gay marriage in 2012 – jumping out ahead of President Barack Obama in his announcement.

Later that year, Judge David Stras, whom Trump nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, wrote an opinion backing wedding videographers' First Amendment rights to refuse to provide services at same-sex weddings. The judge wrote that the videographers have creative control over wedding videos and have the right to decline requests for services from clients who contradict their views that marriage is solely between a man and a woman.
The older masons have very conservative Christian values, he said. The younger masons are theistic. We believe in a creator, but we don't have a problem with homosexual marriage.
More broadly, there's a stark divide along religious lines on whether people see the United States as having an essential culture and values that immigrants take on or whether it's a nation made up of many cultures and values that change as new people arrive, according to Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life.
Trump was a hero to the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns running homes for the elderly, which challenged the federal requirement that insurance plans cover birth control. At Trump's renominating convention, a nun from the Little Workers of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary questioned Biden's religion and called Trump the most pro-life president.
Marriage as political act? Ruby Rose thinks it can be.
Looking back to Sochi in particular, I was going through a divorce – it was awful, the most horrible time of my life as far as dealing with another human being, Weir said. The best thing to come out of it was that Tara and I had to bond so quickly. We were in Russia, there was no one really around, I wasn't close to any of my coworkers or my bosses, I wasn't close to anybody. It was just terror. If I hadn't had her I would have panicked. (I would have) gone home or just crumbled under the pressure.
Following the death of the president, the First Presidency is automatically dissolved and the two counselors in the First Presidency return to positions of seniority in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In this situation, that would be President Henry B. Eyring and President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, who served as Monson's two counselors since he assumed the Prophet role in 2008.
But Biden's emphasis on social justice issues over social policy flashpoints like abortion mirrors an ongoing struggle in the Catholic Church between Pope Francis, with his pastoral approach, and the church's more conservative wing. (A photo of Biden with Francis was among the personal photos arrayed behind Biden when, sitting at his desk in the Oval Office, he took steps last week to expand health insurance access and to allow federally funded family planning groups to provide or refer patients for abortion services.)
Grand Masters nationally and internationally have weighed in on the debate, and California and District of Columbia, grand lodges have suspended Masonic relations with Georgia and Tennessee because of it.

When she met Weir, Lipinski loved the way he spoke frankly and openly, on and off air.
Of deep concern is the liberty of the Church and the freedom of believers to live according to their consciences, wrote Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez.
There is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President, Biden tweeted.
Weir keeps most of his private life out of the commentary spiel but everything else is fair game, and you can confidently bet that the chatter with him and Lipinski won't be restricted to salchows and triple axels.
Gus Kenworthy leaves the Pyeongchang Olympics empty-handed, failing to land a run in the slopestyle final Sunday. But his heart is full, knowing what he did here is far bigger than sport.

Trump's legacy:Biden's influence on federal judiciary may be limited despite liberals' talk of 'court-packing'

Stark contrast to Trump White House
But Trump promised on the 2016 campaign trail that the first priority of my administration will be to preserve and protect our religious liberty. Religious freedom became a signature issue of both his domestic and foreign policy.
Rippon became the first openly gay U.S. figure skater to compete in the Olympics and the first out figure skater overall to medal as he aided Team USA's bronze medal finish at the free skate competition Monday. Eric Radford then became the first openly gay figure skater to win an Olympic gold medal as he and Meagan Duhamel helped Canada win the team figure skating event.

Meet Team USA:Where 2018 Olympians are from
WASHINGTON – Nearly 40% of judges President Donald Trump appointed to federal appeals courts have a history of hostility toward LGBTQ rights, according to a new report by the LGBT advocacy group Lambda Legal.
The 16th-seeded Williams organized that possible good fortune when she defeated 79th-ranked Genie Bouchard of Canada 6-2, 6-2 in the second round Thursday.
But Carr is waiting to see what Biden will prioritize.
Last year, Judge Kyle Duncan, whom Trump also nominated to the 5th Circuit, wrote an opinion rejecting a transgender federal prisoner's request to be referred to in court papers using female pronouns in accordance with the inmate's gender identity. Duncan wrote that doing so could raise delicate questions about judicial impartiality.
We just had this chemistry that came instantly and for the last four years we have been building on that, Lipinski added. America has accepted us as the voices of figure skating.
None of that crossed his mind Sunday when he kissed boyfriend Matt Wilkas before his first run, a moment shown during NBC's prime-time coverage.
We're all God's children, Biden said. We should treat each other as we would like to be treated ourselves.
It's worth remembering that, during the Sochi Games, gay marriage was still about a year and a half from being legal throughout the United States. Attitudes have undergone a significant shift since then, as more and more people realize just how conventional gays and lesbians are.
Lipinski, who won gold at Nagano in 1998, and Weir, a three-time national champion and 2008 world bronze medalist, did not cross paths during their own careers.
Our analysis was ... about calling out the danger to the rule of law, the danger to the integrity and credibility of the judiciary to be putting forth nominees who fundamentally start from a perspective of LGBTQ people as 'less than,' said Sharon McGowan, legal director for Lambda Legal.
A preacher who speaks out against homosexuality and the change of law that made same-sex marriage legal in Australia, Court's views are not popular in tennis circles. Last year many players and fans called for the renaming of the Margaret Court Arena here at Melbourne Park.
The 90s were great, it was such a boom time, and on television in general everything was very airbrushed, very beautiful and packaged, Weir said. Then came the family we all love so much — the Kardashians — and suddenly butt injections were on TV, Lady Gaga was ruling the charts, things changed and people wanted reality. We give them reality.
I need to be busy because, like, I have so much energy, she said. I always thought the older I get, the more calm I'll get. I feel like it's kind of going opposite. I keep getting more energy. It's crazy.
Biden will have to take that into account as he tries to weave together the disparate groups that make up his coalition and fulfill a central campaign promise – one that's also rooted in his faith – of bringing the country together.
To see somebody celebrated when they're often used to being disenfranchised, it's a flip of the script.
I think in many ways, Trump's impact on the judiciary will be his most significant and lasting legacy because it will have a life far beyond the four years of the Trump administration, McGowan said.
I do my best, said Williams, who won her last major while pregnant at the 2017 Australian Open. I don't obviously win them all or I'd have, like, 80 Grand Slams. But I do my best to win the ones I can. Obviously if I don't win, I go home. I go back to the drawing board. I see what I can do better. I come back. That's all I can do.
Rippon has regularly -- on social media and in interviews -- talked about what it means to be an openly gay elite athlete.
It shows the way forward, as one nation in a common purpose, to respect one another, to care for one another, to leave no one behind, he said.
Unlike Trump, Biden regularly attends church. His Catholicism has played as large a role in his life as his outsized family Bible did at his inauguration. Biden wears his son's rosary beads, made the sign of the cross when paying his respects to fallen Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick Tuesday, and quotes Bible passages.
MELBOURNE — If history can be relied on then Serena Williams can count on at least reaching the Australian Open semifinals this year.
Carr, who in a former role with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops helped develop their documents on political responsibilities of Catholics, recently organized a discussion of how Biden's Catholicism affects his presidency and the role its playing in the divide within the church.
We are deeply committed to making sure everyone has access to care – including reproductive health care – regardless of income, race, zip code, health insurance status, or immigration status, Biden said in a joint statement with Vice President Kamala Harris last month recognizing the 48th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that affirmed the right to an abortion.
The report by Lambda Legal – which analyzed publicly available records on Trump's nominees, including statements and writings they've done as private individuals – singled out several appeals court judges who, the authors say, have already issued rulings hostile to LGBTQ rights.
In remarks to the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, Biden said his faith provides hope and solace, clarity and purpose.
While the organization is secretive, bans on allowing gay men to participate in Tennessee and Georgia have prompted public discussion locally and globally, Christopher Hodapp, the author of Freemasons for Dummies, said in a Thursday blog post.
In the Freemasons, Geiser said, each state's grand lodge has its own constitutions and bylaws, separate from others nationally and internationally. In the United States, most Masonic lodges are male only but have sister organizations such as the Order of the Eastern Star.
A senior apostle is then determined based on who has the highest ranking seniority from the date when they were ordained to the Twelve. The longest-tenured member of the governing body is 93-year-old Russell M. Nelson. His appointment will not be officially named until after Monson's funeral services, out of respect.

I'm not doing anything special, she said. I'm just doing what I felt like working parents do, she said. They make it work. I'm just like literally everyone else. I'm making it work. It's not easy. But I have to do, as a mom and wife, what I have to do.
After four years as president, Trump has appointed three Supreme Court justices and 230 lower court judges to lifetime posts, many ny of whom are young, white and male jurists who will have decades to influence and shape federal law.
Biden is praised by Sister Simone Campbell, executive director of Network Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention about caring for all of God's creations. She's thrilled by Biden's efforts to expand health care coverage, address racism and reverse Trump's anti-immigration actions.
The report presents a sobering image for civil rights advocates of Trump's lasting impact on the federal judiciary – one they say threatens to roll back progress made in advancing the rights of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.
Rippon scored 87.95 in the short program Thursday night, putting him 7th out of 21 competitors and tops among the three Team USA skaters. He remains a long shot to medal in the men's individual competition as the free skate takes place Friday night, although Nicodemo said much of LGBTQ community has taken in and appreciated all that Rippon has accomplished so far.
That tenet was echoed during his first days in office, when Biden signed orders to ensure fair treatment for marginalized groups on housing and other issues.
But what to Biden is an advancing equity agenda grounded in his deep Catholic faith appears to some Christian conservatives as attacks on their own intensely held beliefs that will unravel the religious freedom protections championed by the Trump administration. Those protections treated religious beliefs as paramount, even if they conflicted with another person's rights – to an abortion, to marry a person of the same sex, or to be transgender.
The bravery and courage he has is amazing, Austin Parrish, a former swimmer who came out in high school before competing collegiately at Eastern Illinois, told USA TODAY Sports. I personally love that he is taking on Mike Pence. I'm from Indiana, where Pence was my governor while I was a college athlete. I never felt supported by the politicians of Indiana or the support for being an openly gay athlete. The way Pence rejected marriage equality in Indiana brought several emotions to the surface.
It is a double act that works, to the extent that the network has put them together at Super Bowl media day, the Academy Awards, the Kentucky Derby and the National Dog Show.
While the Supreme Court hears only about 100 to 150 cases annually, the 13 federal appeals courts around the country hear thousands of the most consequential cases every year that shape laws and affect the rights of millions of Americans.
Biden's presidency could contribute to the difficult realignment of American Catholicism with Pope Francis's vision – a process resisted by `culture war' bishops since the time of Francis's election, but also interrupted by Trump, Faggioli wrote in his book on Biden and Catholicism. The mere possibility of such a realignment will being a lot of attention to this particular Catholic moment.
Trump provided the kind of fighter, the strong man, to protect their interests, he said.
Weir was having a tough time during Sochi, with his marriage to ex-husband Victor Voronov on the verge of collapse. Things got messy with accusations flying back and forth, the matter ending up in divorce court, Voronov lodging a defamation suit against Weir and even a dispute over a valuable Faberge egg — much of it played out through TMZ and the New York tabloids.
In the past, she said, Lambda Legal has won cases before Republican-appointed judges, but the difference during the Trump administration is the appointment of judges whose records show deep hostility against LGBTQ rights.
In 2014, they were NBC's broadcast experiment, thrown together. They've never looked back. Figure skating commentary may never be the same again.
This outpaced Trump's recent predecessors, none of whom managed to place as many judicial appointees during their first four years in office. During the Obama administration, for example, only 30 federal appeals court nominees were confirmed during his first four years in office, according to the report. Previous administrations going back to President Ronald Reagan's managed to confirm between 30 and 42 nominees to the appeals court bench during the first four years.
While she understands that try as she might she can't win everything, it doesn't mean she has to love that reality.
Biden's focus on the common good is a central concept of the centuries-old Catholic social tradition, Massimo Faggioli wrote in the new book Joe Biden and Catholicism in the United States.
But in the opinion, Judge Britt Grant wrote that the ban on the controversial treatment infringes on therapists' First Amendment rights and that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds it offensive. Judge Barbara Lagoa agreed with Grant, resulting in a split 2-1 decision.

Rippon, 28, certainly hasn't shied from embracing who he is on the international stage -- and that included criticizing Vice President Mike Pence's views on the LGBT issues in an interview with USA TODAY Sports last month.

If the motion to reorganize is passed, the Quorum of the Twelve will unanimously select the new president, who will assume the top role in the nearly 16 million-member church. The decision is predetermined, though.
Issuing his own statement, the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops warned that Biden has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender.
There have been 16 presidents, including Monson, since the founding of the LDS Church by Joseph Smith in 1830.
According to Lambda Legal's report, released Tuesday, the Trump administration has appointed 54 of the 177, about 30%, of actively serving federal appeals court judges.
Anything can be on the agenda, from hairstyles to costumes to whatever happens to be passing through their minds at the time, and unless the viewership's tastes have dramatically changed they'll be lapping it up once more.
The split was highlighted when Pope Francis' congratulatory message to Biden on Inauguration Day emphasized respect for the rights and dignity of every person, especially the poor, the vulnerable, and those who have no voice.
Of course, a semifinal showing is hardly the result Williams is looking for in Melbourne. A 23-time Grand Slam champion, with an Open Era record of seven Australian Open victories, Williams lives to successfully reach the finish line at every tournament she plays.
The speech was widely criticized by Democrats and advocates, including McGowan. Lambda Legal also opposed Alito's nomination to the high court in 2006.

Suspension of the two Memphis Freemasons has cast light on a broader cultural issue within the Freemasons, Geiser said.
They are accountants and bricklayers, teachers and clergy, actors and attorneys. They are moms and dads, husbands and wives. They are your family members, co-workers, neighbors and friends.
The only way to really change perceptions, break down homophobia, break down barriers is through representation, Kenworthy said Sunday afternoon.
In the third round, Williams will play Ukrainian Dayana Yastremska, who upset 23rd-seeded Carla Suarez Navarro of Spain, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1. If she wins that match, a fourth-round encounter awaits against either Venus Williams or No. 1 Simona Halep.
That's a fundamentally different conception of the country and where it ought to be headed, Cox said.

The Tara and Johnny show came to Sochi four years ago, but this time it has hit prime time on NBC and promises to be raucous, outrageous and completely unafraid to pull any punches.
