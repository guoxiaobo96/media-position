Bakersville: The world's worst cat is available for adoption at the Mitchell County Animal Rescue organization. The shelter about 55 miles northeast of Asheville is waiving adoption fees in the hope that someone will take the cat named Perdita off its hands. The group says on its Facebook page, We thought she was sick. Turns out she's just a jerk. A tongue-in-cheek profile of the foul-tempered feline says her dislikes include dogs, children, the Dixie Chicks, Disney movies, Christmas and last but NOT least … HUGS. It says she likes lurking, pretending to be sick and staring into your soul until you feel as if you may never be cheerful again … She's single and ready to be socially awkward with a socially awkward human who understands personal space. Her Facebook post has drawn thousands of likes – and a follow-up post indicated more than 50 applications to adopt her had already been submitted.

So when Biden – whose Cabinet is shaping up to be the most diverse in U.S. history – failed to name a single Cabinet secretary of Asian American or Pacific Islander descent, the backlash was bitter – and compounded by a longstanding sense of feeling left out of federal decision-making.

Montpelier: The state Senate approved a paid family leave bill by enough votes to override a potential veto by Gov. Phil Scott. The legislation was approved by a vote of 20-9 in the Senate on Friday and is now headed to the House. The bill provides up to 12 weeks of paid leave for the birth of a newborn or an adoption. People caring for an ailing loved one would be eligible for eight weeks of benefits. The average Vermont resident will receive 70% of their pay during their leave depending on how much money they make. The bill would use a 0.2% payroll tax on most workers in the state to fund the paid leave benefit. It's unclear how Scott feels about the bill, but he has said he prefers a voluntary paid leave program that workers could opt into.
If we are honest about what's really going on here, it's not about ensuring that same-sex couples in Philadelphia have the opportunity to be foster parents, Alito said, noting no same-sex couples had asked the Catholic group for certification – they had gone elsewhere. It's the fact that the city can't stand the message that Catholic Social Services and the Archdiocese are sending by continuing to adhere to the old-fashioned view about marriage. Isn't that the case?

Lawrence: A task force has recommended steps for the Greek organizations at the University of Kansas to take to eliminate hazing and to connect more with the community. The 27-member task force established in November 2018 to improve safety and efficiency in the Greek community on the Lawrence campus recently released its recommendations. In a public message, Chancellor Douglas Girod said the task force strongly supported Greek life despite national concerns about hazing and substance abuse at fraternities and sororities, The Lawrence Journal-World reports. The group directed its recommendations to the Greek community at large. One of the main recommendations was to develop a partnership composed of Greek students, alumni, university representatives and representatives from the Lawrence community.

Trump's first impeachment ended with all but one Senate Republican voting to acquit him at the outset of his reelection campaign. The celebration for conservatives such as Biggs was short-lived.
Richmond: With a newly empowered Democratic majority at the General Assembly, abortion-rights advocates say the state has a chance to roll back decades of restrictions and become a safe haven for women in neighboring conservative states. Abortion-rights groups laid out their legislative priorities last week, emphasizing a measure to undo Republican-backed laws including a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion, as well a requirement that women seeking an abortion undergo an ultrasound and counseling. A Senate committee passed that bill Thursday morning, a day after a House committee advanced that chamber's version. The bills, which are part of Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam's legislative agenda, would also roll back the requirement that an abortion be provided by a physician, allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to perform them, and undo strict building code requirements on facilities where abortions are performed.

Olympia: Bills that would have limited how many rounds can be stored in gun magazines and what guns can be sold failed to make their way through the Legislature. KING-TV reports neither bill was approved before Wednesday's 5 p.m. deadline. Lawmakers knew earlier this month that the proposed ban on firearms defined as assault weapons did not have the votes to proceed. The high-capacity limit bill passed out of House and Senate committees but never came up on the floor for debate. Republicans opposed to the bill filed an unusually high number of amendments on the bill, meaning debate could last a day or more, according to Democratic staffers. Aberdeen Republican Rep. Jim Walsh, who submitted six amendments, was asked if the long list of amendments was a political ploy to prevent debate. That's part of it, said Walsh. But it's also a very bad policy.

Duluth: Snowplow drivers in northeastern Minnesota ended their strike with St. Louis County on Monday when union members voted to approve a new contract. Teamsters Local 320 members went on strike Wednesday afternoon over differences about health care and accrued sick leave. On Monday morning, union officials posted on Facebook that they had reached an agreement both parties can be proud of. They still needed to vote on it, however, and did so later in the afternoon, according to KBJR-TV. The ratification meeting happened in Eleveth. The snowplow drivers planned to return to work Tuesday at 7 a.m. Public Works supervisors and other licensed and qualified staff from other divisions and departments operated the plows during the strike. St. Louis County spokeswoman Dana Kazel said the replacements had 70% of the roads plowed by the time they finished Saturday.

Lansing: Marijuana will have to carry labels warning pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers about the health risks for their fetuses and infants under newly enacted state laws. Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist signed the two bills Wednesday because Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was out of the state. The labels must be placed on legal recreational and medical marijuana products and warn that use by pregnant or breastfeeding women may result in fetal injury, preterm birth, low birth weight or development problems for children. The laws also require that an informational pamphlet be made available at every point of sale. It must include safety information related to use by minors and include the poison control hotline number – in case children accidentally eat candy or brownies that contain marijuana.
On Wednesday, the Alabama Ethics Commission found probable cause that the governor had violated ethics and campaign finance laws and forwarded its conclusions to Montgomery County's district attorney, Daryl Bailey, for prosecution. Its report proved a major blow to Bentley and what little political capital he had remaining in the Legislature.
Albuquerque: Trappers now have to complete an education course, and new restrictions will be imposed on setting wildlife traps and snares around designated trailheads and on select tracts of public lands in New Mexico, under a measure adopted by the state Game Commission. State wildlife managers suggested they tried to strike a balance, but trappers argued that the changes will be burdensome, requiring them in some instances to walk a mile roundtrip to set a trap. Environmentalists also were displeased with the decision, calling the practice inhumane and indiscriminate. They had pushed for the commission to end trapping all together, saying pets and endangered species such as the Mexican gray wolf have been inadvertently caught. Trapping and snaring triggered emotionally charged debates during last year's legislative session.
Candidates know that religion as a shared culture speaks to many people in a world that no longer offers them a shining future, Philippe Portier, sociologist of religion, told the newspaper 20 Minutes. This talk can quickly resonate with a population that feels more and more culturally Christian, even while it doesn't always follow the rules.
I think it is appropriate at this point for me to admonish both the House managers and the president's counsel in equal terms to remember that they are addressing the world's greatest deliberative body, Roberts said. One reason it has earned that title is because its members avoid speaking in a manner and using language that is not conducive to civil discourse.

New York: Animal rights advocates have lost a bid to get a Bronx Zoo elephant declared to have human-like rights and transferred to a sanctuary, though a judge said the case for sending the pachyderm to a sanctuary was extremely persuasive. Bronx Judge Alison Tuitt on Tuesday dismissed the Nonhuman Rights Project's petition arguing that Happy the elephant is unlawfully imprisoned at the zoo where she has lived since 1977. She has been kept separate from other elephants for more than a decade. New York courts have previously said animals aren't legally considered persons, and Tuitt said those rulings applied to Happy, too. But the judge said she was extremely sympathetic to Happy's plight. This court agrees that Happy is more than just a legal thing, or property. She is an intelligent, autonomous being who should be treated with respect and dignity, and who may be entitled to liberty, the judge wrote, calling the arguments for transferring Happy from her lonely exhibit to a sprawling elephant sanctuary extremely persuasive.

Taswell: The state's newest nature preserve features dramatic limestone outcrops and a cave inhabited by rare animals adapted to life in total darkness. The Natural Resources Commission recently approved the creation of the Patoka Hills Nature Preserve, which spans nearly 27 acres in southern Indiana's Crawford County. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources said the new preserve contains one of Indiana's finest paleontological sites in a small cave that the agency calls highly significant. Staff from the Indiana State Museum have been excavating inside that cave since 1987, and their discoveries have shed light on Indiana's past climate, plants and animals during the latter part of the last ice age. The DNR said the cave is also home to a springtail insect and a cave millipede, both of which lack eyes and pigmentation and are rare worldwide.

Birmingham: The city will pay a $25,000 fine for obstructing the view of a Confederate monument, a judge ordered last week under the direction of the state Supreme Court. Circuit Judge Marshell Jackson Hatcher imposed the fine that had been ordered by the state's high court. Justices in November ruled that Birmingham violated a state law protecting historic monuments and directed the circuit judge to enter an order declaring that Birmingham violated the 2017 Alabama Memorial Preservation Act and to fine the city $25,000. Alabama sued Birmingham in 2017 after municipal officials in the majority-black city erected a wooden box obscuring the inscriptions on a 52-foot-tall obelisk honoring Confederate veterans. The 2017 Alabama Memorial Preservation Act prohibits relocating, removing, altering or renaming public buildings, streets and memorials that have been standing for more than 40 years.

A landmark Supreme Court ruling sanctioning same-sex marriage in 2015 capped an evolution taking place in state legislatures and federal courts on LGTBQ relationships in the first half of the decade. In 2010, only 14 states and the district had some form of relationship recognition for same-sex couples. By 2020, marriage was the law of the land and included access to marriage-related parenting protections.

Fort Belvoir: Plans are underway to completely dismantle the first nuclear power facility that provided electricity to the U.S. power grid. In December, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed fully removing the SM-1 Reactor Facility at Fort Belvoir in Fairfax County, Virginia, WTOP reports. The project will now go out to bid and is expected to begin in 2021 with a projected end date of 2025. The reactor opened in 1957 and was decommissioned in 1973. Dismantling began over 40 years ago when the Army Corps removed a majority of the radioactive material, which was taken to a storage site in South Carolina. Remaining buildings include the reactor plant as well as many labs that were on the site. They will all be removed along with any radioactive contamination exceeding regulatory level, the station reports. The Army Corps of Engineers says there is little to no danger of radioactivity on the site once the facility is removed.

Annapolis: In 1962, Verda Freeman Welcome was a civil rights pioneer, a teacher and the first black woman in the country elected to a state senate. Last week, she became the first black person to have a portrait hung in a chamber of the Maryland State House. Her likeness replaced a 115-year-old canvas depicting a white man – and former governor – who was born when slavery was still legal and had been honored for overseeing construction of the Senate chamber. Welcome, who represented Baltimore, fought for interracial marriage, equal pay for woman, banning harassment of welfare recipients and barring racial discrimination in public places. Her daughter, Mary Sue Welcome, attended the portrait unveiling and recalled spending time with her mother around the Senate chambers more than half a century ago. This is amazing, she said.

Frankfort: State colleges and universities will ask for their first funding increase since the 2007-08 budget, lawmakers have been told. Aaron Thompson, president of the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education, said public colleges will seek a 6.2% increase next fiscal year and an 8.8% increase in the 2022 fiscal year over current base funding levels. Thompson said he is not sure whether the budget Gov. Andy Beshear presents to the General Assembly on Tuesday will include the request but is optimistic. Kentucky has cut higher education funding in each two-year budget since 2008, leaving colleges and universities to increase tuition rates. Thompson told legislators that after more than a decade of higher education cuts, we are down to the point where we are cutting into the bone.

Madison: Gov. Tony Evers announced Sunday that he wants state lawmakers to pass a package of bills aimed at curbing youth vaping and educating the public about vaping's potential dangers. The bills that Evers, a Democrat, is requesting would ban vaping and vapor products on K-12 campuses and expand the definition of public health emergencies. Another bill would fund a public health campaign to address youth vaping in the state, and a fourth proposal would expand the enforcement capacity of the Departments of Revenue and Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection to prevent vaping products from being sold to minors. The governor's office said vaping products pose serious health risks to young users because the nicotine contained in e-cigarettes can harm parts of the brain that control attention and learning.

Denver: A research center at Colorado State University dedicated to studying the chemical compounds in hemp is expected to open this spring, school officials said Thursday. The announcement comes after the university received a $1.5 million donation from a Golden-based company that makes products out of CBD, a popular cannabis compound with unproven health claims. The money would be used to fund research, cover operating costs and purchase equipment, university officials said. The facility would allow faculty and undergraduate and graduate students to study the formulation of cannabinoids, separation efficiencies, efficacy testing and more, The Denver Post reports. Researchers at the facility would work in partnership with Panacea Life Sciences, a company founded by university alumna Leslie Buttorff that manufactures CBD products for people and pets.

Boise: A bill that would reduce the number of people required to report suspected child abuse narrowly won approval from a panel of state lawmakers. The House Judiciary and Rules Committee approved the bill 9-8, The Times-News reports. Currently, anyone in the state who sees evidence of child abuse, abandonment or neglect is required to report that evidence to law enforcement, and those who don't can be charged with a misdemeanor. The legislation approved Wednesday would remove that requirement for most residents, leaving only teachers, doctors, law enforcement officials and social workers as mandatory reporters. Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, says unfounded child abuse claims cost taxpayers money. But Rep. John McCrostie, D-Boise, and Rep. Linda Hartgen, R-Twin Falls, both opposed the legislation, saying it could lead to underreporting of child abuse, causing real harm to Idaho kids. The bill now heads to the full House.

Gregory Sugar Bear Elliot, lead singer of Experience Unlimited; Big G of BackYard Band; and the oldest daughter of Chuck Brown – the godfather of go-go – were all present to see Mayor Muriel Bowser sign a bill designating go-go as the official music of D.C. The creative arts performance space was packed with people wearing green Don't Mute DC hats and T-shirts, and the crowd was pumped up. Before signing the official document, in true call-and-repeat go-go fashion, Bowser asked the crowd to chant with her. When I say go-go, you say 'is D.C.,'  she shouted. The crowd enthusiastically chanted it three times.

Albuquerque: Plans are in the works to redevelop another dilapidated hotel along the longest urban stretch of historic Route 66, but this project on the edge of downtown Albuquerque will be bankrolled in a unique way. ARRIVE Hotels & Restaurants, the California-based hotel and entertainment company behind the effort, is partnering with investment platform NextSeed to raise $6 million through local crowdfunding to pay for part of the project. At nearly $25 million, the work will involve updating rooms at The Hotel Blue, changing the property's name, and adding new food and drink offerings. The approach to funding is common in the technology world but relatively unproven in the world of Albuquerque real estate. Still, NextSeed CEO Youngro Lee told the Albuquerque Journal the funding gives local investors an opportunity to invest in developments that are closer to home than most tech startups.
Langdon: A meeting house originally built in the early 1800s has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Georgian-style Langdon Meeting House was a two-story space that served both town and church functions. In order to comply with New Hampshire's Toleration Act of 1819, which called for physical and financial separation of religious and government public spaces, the town sold 10 feet at the west end of the building and the second-story gallery space to the Universalist Society of Langdon in 1851. That year, a renovation partitioned the spaces and added a three-story Greek Revival steeple over the church entrance that included a belfry with louvered shutters and a 5-foot weathervane. Langdon residents have held their annual town meeting on the first floor from 1803 to the present, the longest-running record in the country.

Phoenix: A 62-year-old man was cited last week after trying to disguise a fake skeleton as a passenger just to use the HOV lane. The Arizona Department of Public Safety says a trooper pulled over the man Thursday after noticing he had placed a fake skeleton in the passenger's front seat. The skeleton was sitting upright, wearing a hat and tied to the front seat. Department spokesman Raul Garcia said troopers cite about 7,000 HOV lane violators every year. Last April, a man was pulled over after driving in the HOV lane with a mannequin wearing a sweatshirt, baseball cap and sunglasses.

Des Moines: The state's industries recovered from the Great Recession at a rate less than half that of the national average, according to a new Iowa State University paper. From 2007 to 2018, the state added about 92,000 jobs. But economist Dave Swenson says Iowa would have added many more jobs if industries here grew at the same rate they did in the rest of the country. Iowa also would have added more jobs if its mix of businesses were closer to the national average. We're simply losing ground, he said. Our competitiveness is waning. Swenson's paper measures how Iowa's recovery from the Great Recession compares to other states. He said Iowa's industrial mix has been a drag on expansion, as the state relies heavily on industries where job growth is either growing slowly or shrinking, such as agriculture and manufacturing.

Salt Lake City: Brigham Young University has revised its strict code of conduct to strip a rule that banned any behavior that reflected homosexual feelings, which LGBTQ students and their allies felt created an unfair double standard not imposed on heterosexual couples. The university is owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which teaches its members that being gay isn't a sin, but engaging in same-sex intimacy is. BYU's revisions to what the college calls its honor code don't change the faith's opposition to same-sex relationships or gay marriage. The changes were discovered by media outlets Wednesday. BYU spokeswoman Carri Jenkins said in an email that the updated version of the code aligns with a new handbook of rules unveiled by the faith, widely known as the Mormon church.

Two years earlier, in the decision in United States v. Windsor, Kennedy wrote, For same-sex couples who wished to be married, the State acted to give their lawful conduct a lawful status ... worthy of dignity in the community equal with all other marriages. He further concluded that the so-called Defense of Marriage Act, which required the federal government to treat married same-sex couples as though they were not legally married, (imposed) a disadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the States, and therefore violated the Constitution.

Mount Vernon: George Washington's Mount Vernon estate says it will no longer sell a souvenir depicting the founding father's false teeth amid criticism that Washington's dentures were made with teeth pulled from the mouths of his slaves. Critics said selling a souvenir magnet depicting Washington's famous false teeth trivialized the fact that Washington's slaves had to give up their own teeth. On Wednesday, Mount Vernon said on Twitter that it would remove the magnet from its online store. The webpage on which the magnet had been offered for sale was disabled as of Wednesday afternoon. The old story that Washington's dentures were made of wood has long been known to be false. It has been known for years that Washington paid about six pounds for nine teeth that were pulled from slaves' mouths. The payment is recorded in a 1784 ledger. The fact has received renewed attention following publication of a revisionist biography.

Robbinsdale: A man scaled a fence at a hospital last month and shut off oxygen to the entire facility, according to a search warrant affidavit filed in Hennepin County. No charges have been filed in the Dec. 27 incident at North Memorial Hospital, and the search warrant affidavit filed Friday makes no mention of injuries. But the Star Tribune reports the document says the situation could have been deadly under different circumstances. Hospital spokeswoman Katy Sullivan says hospital officials quickly identified the issue and resolved it without harm to patients. According to the affidavit, after the oxygen was shut off, engineers detected a pressure drop in the hospital's oxygen levels and discovered the vandalism. A 39-year-old man has been identified as a possible suspect. He was also seen inside the hospital the previous month unplugging computers and televisions.

Milwaukee: A group monitoring a legal settlement over the Milwaukee Police Department's stop-and-frisk practices reports officers failed to document a justification in 80% of such incidents in the first half of 2019. The Crime and Justice Institute found many of the officers' report narratives lacked the details necessary to establish reasonable suspicion that the people being frisked were armed or dangerous to others around them. The Boston-based institute is monitoring the police department's compliance as part of a $3.4 million settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin in 2018 over stop-and-frisk practices. The ACLU had argued in its lawsuit that over the past decade, tens of thousands of minority residents in Milwaukee have been stopped by police without reasonable suspicion of a crime.

St. Louis: The St. Louis Zoo announced Thursday that it has a new resident in Teak, a black and white colobus monkey born Feb. 3. Colobus monkeys are born white with a pink face. By age 6 months, the little monkey will get his adult coloration – mostly black hair but with white hair around the face and part of the tail, though adults also have a distinctive mantle of long white hair from their shoulders around the edge of their backs. Colobus monkeys live in families with several females sharing in the care of newborns, a behavior called allomothering. Teak's mother, Cecelia, has raised five babies of her own along with three other babies in the family, the zoo said. Teak's father, Kima, watches over the family and often interacts with the youngsters, the zoo said. Teak's sister and his half-sister also interact with and help care for Teak. The monkeys, also known as Guereza colobus, are native to east and central Africa.
Sacramento: In an unusual reversal, federal regulators this week agreed to cover about $300 million in repair costs at the Oroville Dam, where a spillway collapse three years ago prompted the evacuation of nearly 190,000 people in Northern California. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said last March that it wouldn't pay for repairs involving damage regulators said existed at the Sierra Nevada dam before the collapse. But after an appeal, FEMA agreed to cover the repairs, the Sacramento Bee reports. The state now expects to be reimbursed for about $750 million of the $1.1 billion in repair costs, Erin Mellon, spokeswoman for the state Department of Water Resources, said in an email to the Bee. This is pretty rare, and for California it's huge money, Jerry Quinn, a Sacramento consultant who helps government agencies recover money from FEMA, told the paper.

Anchorage: The state Department of Fish and Game will conduct its fourth survey of moose in the Anchorage area with the help of citizen scientists. The three-day survey relies on citizens to call or text in sightings of moose. The 2020 survey begins at 8 a.m. Friday and runs through 5 p.m. Sunday. Biologists in less populated areas conduct moose surveys from the air. Pilots fly paths close to the ground and circle when they spot moose. Anchorage air traffic and flight restrictions make that impossible, said Dave Battle, area biologist. It's just not something that can be done in the Anchorage Bowl, he said. Anchorage spans 1,963 square miles, an area the size of the state of Delaware, with a population as of July 2018 of 291,500. Residents embrace moose as part of the landscape, and the animals at times can be seen in the busiest parts of the city.

The San Francisco Chronicle reports the 2-year-old male arrived from the Los Angeles Zoo, where he was known as Flin. He gets to assume a new identity in his new home, however, following the San Francisco Zoo's fundraising tradition of allowing donors to name new arrivals. The winner of the name-the-koala contest will be selected next month, and proceeds will be sent to an emergency wildlife fund organized by Australia's Zoos Victoria. Australia's unprecedented wildfires season has so far charred more than 40,000 square miles of brushland, rainforests and national parks – killing by one estimate more than a billion wild animals.

Missoula: The University of Montana is working to learn from criticism after four white students won an essay contest about Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy, the school said. A majority of the 1,000 comments posted on social media were critical of selecting only white students, The Missoulian reports. The contest sought submissions from students, faculty and staff on how they had worked to implement King's legacy at the university. Only six submissions were received, all from white students, the university said. The university deleted the photos and names of the contest winners out of concern they could be targets of harassment, the school said. Many commenters noted the lack of people of color entering the contest may have indicated they did not believe it was a productive use of their time or energy. African-American Studies program head Tobin Miller Shearer and Murray Pierce, special assistant to the provost and adviser to the Black Student Union, speculated that many of the union members were likely busy planning the Black Solidarity Summit, the group's upcoming keystone event.

Great Falls: Montana Cowboy Hall of Fame officials say they are saddling up with the C.M. Russell Museum on an inaugural exhibit within the internationally known museum in Great Falls that will add to the celebration of the American West. The exhibit, a two-year pilot project planned to open in September, would be a blend of Cowboy Hall of Fame honorees and their history. Efforts are underway to curate the specific content for the initial exhibit, Cowboy Hall of Fame board member Mike Gurnett said at a Feb. 7-8 meeting. The exhibit in Great Falls gives something of a foothold for the hall of fame. The Montana Cowboy Hall of Fame, established by the Legislature, has spent nearly 17 years looking for a permanent home after an effort failed in Big Timber. Earlier attempts in Wolf Point and other communities never came to fruition.

Despite our feelings about Jessa and Adam, this episode did a really great job of setting up some big conflicts. When Hannah returns to her apartment where Fran happens to be cohabiting, will she tell him about her affair? Will they finally put an end to their relationship? We're also wondering if Shosh will soon break Yoshi's heart and make her way back to America. And, with Jessa and Adam becoming more serious, it seems like only a matter of time before Hannah is aware of their relationship.

St. George: A rockfall in late August dumped 435,712 cubic feet of debris onto Weeping Rock trail and nearby trails at Zion National Park, and a new report from the Utah Geological Survey finds similar rockfalls could happen at any time in the area. With annual visitation exceeding 4.3 million in 2018, the likelihood of geologic hazards affecting park visitors and infrastructure continues to rise, the survey says. The rockfall Aug. 24, 2019, injured three visitors. A piece of Navajo sandstone weighing more than 31,000 tons broke off Cable Mountain, about 3,000 feet above Weeping Rock. The rockfall caused an avalanche of debris to fall on the Weeping Rock trailhead parking lot, the trail itself, Hidden Canyon trail and East Rim trail, with some rocks flowing across the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive to the Virgin River.

Columbia: The Columbia Housing Authority was fined just under $11,000 after pleading guilty Wednesday to 24 safety violations found after two residents died from carbon monoxide poisoning from a poorly maintained heater. One code violation was dropped as city officials appeared in court, and they asked for a jury trial on one other violation, WLTX-TV reports. The violations included broken smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors and fire extinguishers, as well as failing to do routine maintenance. Calvin Witherspoon Jr., 62, and Derrick Roper, 31, died in separate units in the same building in January 2019 at Allen Benedict Court in Columbia. Investigators immediately inspected all 244 of the units at the 80-year-old complex and found hundreds of problems missed as employees in the Housing Authority's maintenance department either retired or left and weren't replaced, authorities said. Prosecutors said they could not file criminal charges because South Carolina lacks a criminal negligence law.

Colorado Springs: Graduates from the U.S. Air Force Academy in the state are expected to cross-commission into the Space Force this spring, military officials said. About 60 cadets would be commissioned into the new armed service branch, which formed in December with the signing of the $738 billion National Defense Authorization Act, the Gazette reports. They're doing Air Force Academy curriculum, and they'll just be directly commissioned into the Space Force, academy Vice Superintendent Col. Houston Cantwell said. Academy leaders and members of the Colorado's congressional delegation announced the cross-commission plan at an oversight Board of Visitors meeting Wednesday. The plan would be similar to how the U.S. Naval Academy commissions Marine officers. It is unclear how exactly academy leaders plan to commission cadets into the Space Force.

Miami: Eighty Burmese pythons were caught during a 10-day pre-Super Bowl hunt, designed to raise awareness about the invasive species decimating the Everglades. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission announced Saturday that 80 pythons were caught during the competition. Pro grand prize winner Mike Kimmel won an ATV for capturing eight pythons, and rookie grand prize winner Kristian Hernandez removed six pythons and also won an ATV. Pro grand prize winner Tom Rahill won $2,000 for bagging a 62-pound python. Several other cash prizes were also awarded. The game's organizing committee worked with Florida to promote the Python Bowl. The pythons, which can grow to 20 feet, are descended from pets released starting five decades ago. Wildlife officials estimate the population may exceed 100,000. The big serpents have been devouring native mammal and bird populations.

Columbus: The state prison system wants to replace or renovate some of its high-security prisons in the near future, saying its current facilities for violent inmates are functionally obsolete and creating security risks for the agency, the Associated Press has learned. More low-security inmates are now being housed at community facilities instead of prisons at the same time more violent inmates are being housed in state prisons, and for longer terms, the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said in its capital budget request to Gov. Mike DeWine. Furthermore, this population is particularly violent and disruptive while in prison and requires unique programming needs, the agency said in its budget documents. The agency wants approval for a two-year design study of its options, with construction possible by mid-2023.

Boise: Boise Fry Co. is adding crickets to the selection of seasoning-salt mixtures it offers customers to sprinkle on their french fries. The locally owned restaurant chain debuted four new salt blends last week that include pulverized crickets at its three locations in Boise and one each in Meridian and Nampa, the Idaho Statesman reports. The response has been overwhelming, with reactions mostly positive, though some people are a little skittish, CEO Brad Walker says. Some have been 'this is icky,' and others have been 'this is awesome,'  Walker says. It's exciting to do something different. The crickets come from Orchestra Provisions, a small business in Carmen, a hamlet north of Salmon, that produces eight spice mixtures with crickets that it sells at retail. They range from curry powder to a Mexican-inspired mix, from a chai spice to a Sichuan pepper.
Empathy is among the last words that come to mind when thinking of Justice Alito and his record on the Supreme Court, said Jennifer Pizer, director of law and policy at Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ advocacy group.

Honolulu: Tax collections in the state were up by about 5% last year, a report says. The state Department of Taxation sent the annual report in December to Democratic Gov. David Ige and the Legislature, Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. The report showed $8.2 billion was collected in fiscal year 2019, which ended June 30, compared to $7.9 billion collected the year prior. Revenue from the general excise tax and income tax accounted for most of the increase, department officials said. Hawaii County received $10.2 million from its general excise tax of 0.25% but is expected to increase its take after the tax went up to the maximum 0.5% at the start of the new year, the report says.

Rapid City: Arrests for drugs, aggravated assaults and vehicle thefts are the highest they've been since 2012, the city's police chief says. Drug arrests in particular are at an all-time high and have more than doubled since 2012, Chief Karl Jegeris says. The Rapid City Journal reports police officers made 1,567 drug arrests in 2019, compared with 734 in 2012, according to police data. Jegeris says the increase is due to the state's meth crisis and repeat offenders. He wants lawmakers to increase funding for meth treatment programs and create alternatives to prison. But he also wants repeat meth offenders to receive tougher punishments. Regarding aggravated assaults, police data shows officers handled 389 aggravated assault cases last year, the highest since 2012 and up from 379 in 2018.

Portland: U.S. Justice Department lawyers said Friday that they've found the Portland Police Bureau in substantial compliance with 190 reforms required as part of a city settlement adopted six years ago. The settlement came after a federal investigation determined officers used excessive force against people with mental illness. Now that a community oversight group is staffed and has met regularly for more than a year, the Justice Department said the city meets the settlement's accountability requirements. The bureau also has instituted needed changes to its use-of-force policies, training, crisis intervention tactics and employee information system developed to identify officers with excessive complaints or uses of force, the Justice Department said in court documents. The community oversight group will discuss the Justice Department's findings at a Tuesday meeting, according to the group's co-chair Lakayana Drury.

Charleston: Foster parents may soon get more money for adopting children under a measure passed by the House of Delegates this week aimed at alleviating the state's overburdened foster care system. Delegates voted 96-1 to approve the bill, with Republican Del. Pat McGeehan as the lone no vote after he was told the measure would cost the state about $17 million. Great emphasis has been placed on the projected cost of this bill, but we must acknowledge that this is an investment, an investment in West Virginia children, said Del. Jason Barrett, a Berkeley County Democrat. The proposal, sent to the Senate, would give families at least $900 a month for each child adopted. Child placing agencies would also get $1,000 every time they finalize an adoption. The bill also establishes a foster care bill of rights, which would ensure children and parents understand their rights in the state's foster system.

Nashville: The state has become the latest to assure continued taxpayer funding of faith-based foster care and adoption agencies even if those organizations exclude LGBT families and others based on religious beliefs. Republican Gov. Bill Lee signed the bill Friday without fanfare or an official announcement, making it the first law to be implemented in Tennessee this year. Previously, Lee said he endorsed the law because he believed defending religious liberty is very important. The Republican has often cited his Christian faith throughout his first term as governor. The protections afforded to religious agencies have sparked criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, which has raised legal concerns surrounding the proposal because it authorized the use of a religious test to participate in a government program.

The premise of the ad with Reynolds: the fact that nearly every guy in town looks like him distracts two women cruising in a new 2017 Hyundai Elantra.

Wailuku: A paddleboarder earned the Maui Police Department's highest civilian honor for fighting off an attack by a tiger shark to protect members of a tour group he was leading. The department awarded its Civilian Medal of Valor to Triston Kahookele-Santos on Tuesday, The Maui News reports. The 20-year-old employee of the Andaz Beach Crew, part of the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, was leading five stand-up paddle-boarders about a quarter-mile offshore about 9:30 a.m. Feb. 5. The group was watching whales and following fish and a manta ray, Maui police spokeswoman Lt. Audra Sellers said. A 10-foot tiger shark appeared and launched an attack at a Washington man in the group, violently thrashing his board, Sellers said. Kahookele-Santos used the blade of his paddle to strike the shark, which let go of the board and turned on Kahookele-Santos. The others paddled safely to shore as he fought off the shark with the paddle while it circled him three times. No injuries were reported as a result of the attack.

Oklahoma City: Leaders in this conservative state say they are looking for more legislative progress for LGBTQ people this year after notable strides in 2019. Tulsa and Oklahoma City updated their personnel policies to ban discrimination against city employees based on gender identity or expression, The Oklahoman reports. Norman went further and became the first in the state to amend its civil rights ordinance to ban discrimination against LGBTQ people in housing, employment or public accommodations. Oklahoma City also elected its first openly gay council member, and the mayor declared the city's first official Pride Week to celebrate LBGTQ accomplishments. Allie Shinn, executive director of Freedom Oklahoma, an advocacy organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, said 2019 was a landmark year. A top priority in the upcoming legislative session is pushing for a ban on the widely discredited practice of conversion therapy.

Jackson: Protesters outside the Capitol on Friday condemned conditions in state prisons where inmates have died violently in the past month. People with relatives in the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman said at a rally that some prison cells have no working lights or toilets, and inmates are given sparse meals sometimes served with cockroaches on the trays. Parchman is a prison farm plantation, said Jaribu Hill, a longtime Mississippi human-rights attorney. Shut it down! A few hundred protesters responded: Shut it down! Shut it down! Their voices echoed in downtown Jackson, but many of the state's top policymakers were not in town to hear it. Most members of the Legislature left the Capitol on Thursday and won't return until Monday. At least 10 inmates have died in Mississippi prisons since late December – most of them at Parchman. The rally Friday was organized by Team Roc, the charity affiliated with entertainment mogul Jay-Z's company Roc Nation.

Trenton: A former top aide to Gov. Phil Murphy alerted him to allegedly inappropriate behavior by his former campaign manager, including rank misogyny and retaliation, according to documents released Sunday. The campaign manager, Brendan Gill, who is now one of Murphy's closest advisers, also notified Murphy directly that he apologized to that aide for losing his temper and using language and tone he regretted, according to an email. The documents appear to contradict Murphy's own words in an interview last year. When asked if he was personally aware of any incident of sexual harassment or complaints of a toxic work environment during the campaign, Murphy said: Not that I know of. No. Murphy was included on at least two emails that showed Gill had acted inappropriately. The campaign said it conducted an investigation and found that the behavior happened only once with the woman who made the allegation, Julie Roginsky, who left the campaign in July 2017.

Denver: A proposal to rewrite the state's rules for workplace harassment claims is expected to be introduced soon at the Capitol. It would change things for employers by limiting the use of confidentiality agreements in court and would potentially make businesses liable even if a person doesn't come forward internally before filing a lawsuit. The bill would also change things for employees by allowing independent contractors, subcontractors and unpaid interns to file harassment claims, Colorado Public Radio reports. All employees would be given two years to file a complaint, up from six months now. With the gig economy that we have these days, more and more people don't have regular jobs in the traditional sense, said one of the bill's main sponsors, Rep. Susan Lontine, D-Denver. And so they don't have any way to address when they've been harmed by harassment.

Bob Jones University says it will regain its federal tax-exempt status Wednesday, more than three decades after the IRS stripped its nonprofit ranking following a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling. One of the main issues stemmed from the university's refusal to allow interracial dating or marriage among students, staff or faculty of the university, a rule it has since abandoned. The case has been cited many times through the years, and most recently, it arose in an exchange before the Supreme Court in the Obergefell v. Hodges decision which legalized gay marriage.

Dover: Some lawmakers want the state to start compensating people who were put in prison and then later found to be not guilty. A bill waiting on a vote in the state House would compensate people as much as $50,000 per year they were incarcerated, as well as some attorney's fees. Emeka Igwe, an attorney, said his client Elmer Daniels was the catalyst for the legislation. After Daniels served 39 years for a rape he says he didn't commit, he was basically released with just a T-shirt on his back and left to fend for himself. Under the proposed bill, if someone were imprisoned in Delaware for one or more crimes that they didn't commit, they could file a complaint in Superior Court within three years of the wrongful conviction being reversed or vacated. If an eligible person had been in prison for less than a year, their compensation would be $137 for each day they were incarcerated.

One thing I do tell guys, if they come out, is that your play on the field has to speak louder than everyone in the media or public talking about your sexuality. I think a great political comparison is Pete Buttigieg. At first, he was known as the 'gay politician.' But then all the sudden he stood out because he was bright, elegant and a war veteran. Then the gay title was taken out and he was Mayor Pete. Being gay was a part of who he was. It has to be the same kind of thing for an athlete.

WASHINGTON — Advocates for gay, lesbian and transgender rights urged the Senate on Monday to reject President Trump's choice for Army secretary, calling him a social issues warrior who has worked to undermine LGBT rights at every turn.
All of us, including those identifying as LGBT, are made in God's image, are endowed with profound dignity and thus deserve respect. It's because of this dignity and out of such respect that the institutions serving the human good — like the marriage-based family — should be supported, not undermined or redefined. That basic rights like religious freedom ought to be upheld, not infringed. That a healthy moral and physical ecology — especially for children — must be preserved.
Providence: The University of Rhode Island is using a $1 million federal grant to offer education and training about opioids to residents in rural areas of the state. Officials with the university in South Kingstown say health professionals and students have been preparing to start the outreach campaign. Funding from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration will be used to send students and staff to farmers markets, fairs, festivals and other events to discuss issues related to opioids, hand out information about how to obtain overdose-reversal medication and offer related health counseling. Deborah Sheely, of URI's Cooperative Extension, says the goal is to remove the stigma associated with opioid misuse and ensure that residents in rural areas have the information and technical assistance they need.

Only 65% of students born with disabilities complete high school, and 7% complete college. Key barriers include low expectations and the fact that many school systems either fail to diagnose our kids early enough or address their issues at all. This often pushes children with disabilities into the school-to-prison pipeline. Appropriate early intervention, positive supports and basic training for educators, parents and guardians is vital.

Not only do they hold their events at the bar from time to time, but some group members also now count themselves as regulars. Davis and some staff have become regulars of sorts as well, going to funerals when a member's spouse died or attending the group's vigil for Orlando nightclub shooting victims in 2016.
It also undercuts any reasonable justification for marital norms. After all, if marriage is about romantic connection, why require monogamy? There's nothing magical about the number two, as defenders of polyamory point out. If marriage isn't a conjugal union uniting a man and a woman as one flesh, why should it involve or imply sexual exclusivity? If it isn't a comprehensive union inherently ordered to childbearing and rearing, why should it be pledged to permanence?
In an interview Thursday with the Catholic News Network EWTN, Mike Pence said his family will let the critics roll off our backs.
Ganges Township: The owners of a home along Lake Michigan decided to demolish it before nature did the job. Relentless waves and high water have scoured the lakeshore, destroying or threatening properties that have been in families for generations. Helen Curtis-Foster and family members decided to bring their house down in Allegan County's Ganges Township, between Saugatuck and South Haven. The house was just feet away from the edge of a collapsing dune. We really felt we were in the fight against time, Curtis-Foster told MLive.com. It was getting scary. The demolition was completed last week, leaving only a cement pad. The job cost less than $20,000, Curtis-Foster said, compared to hundreds of thousands of dollars necessary to move the house or recover the pieces if it collapsed into the lake. The family plans to put a gazebo on the site.
Generally speaking, the Republicans in the House do not want to be defined by people like Biggs and Greene and Jordan, Sabato said.

Fifteen years into his tenure, Samuel Anthony Alito Jr., a New Jersey native who replaced Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, has hewn closely to what conservatives had hoped for when President George W.

New Orleans: Dozens of protesters marched from the site of the partially collapsed Hard Rock Hotel on the edge of the French Quarter to City Hall on Friday, demanding that something be done about the hotel and that the two bodies still inside be recovered. The Hard Rock Hotel was under construction when it partially collapsed Oct. 12, sending plumes of dust into the air, killing three people and injuring dozens. The bodies of two of the three workers who died are still inside what is left of the building, which city officials have decided to take down through implosion in March. People in the city were outraged last week when a tarp at the site shifted, exposing the remains of one of the workers who died. The tarp has since been replaced, but it sparked cries for greater accountability. City Council member Jason Williams addressed the crowd, specifically questioning why a worker who had been in the building when it collapsed was later deported.

The pageant's new titleholder, Amini Bonane, is a Harvard graduate student who says one of the reasons she competed for the crown was to expand her platform on mentoring and efforts to find missing women of color. She has a campaign called Find My Sister that's dedicated to raising awareness. Her coronation ceremony will be coupled with a charity fundraiser for the cause. According to Black and Missing in America Inc., nearly 40% of missing people are persons of color. Bonane's coronation ceremony and charity fundraiser will be held Saturday from 7:30 to 10 p.m. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other D.C. government officials and professionals are expected to attend the evening of networking, performances and philanthropy.
The court also punted on a challenge to a state definition of marriage adopted in a 2008 constitutional referendum by which a majority of Californians — yes, Californians — overturned an activist court.

Wilmington: Long-proposed plans to outfit police in the state's largest city with body cameras may now hinge on negotiations with the police union later this year. The union that represents Wilmington officers has told the mayor's administration any disciplinary procedures or consequences stemming from a body camera program would constitute a condition of employment that must be negotiated before officers begin wearing them. The union's labor contract with the city expires June 30. The parties have not yet begun negotiations. Proposals to outfit officers with body cameras have been discussed since 2015. Activists have renewed the call for them in the aftermath of two police shootings last year. The number of municipalities across the country using body cameras has grown significantly following high-profile police shootings of unarmed black men.
WASHINGTON — Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch says judges should focus backward, not forward when deciding cases by looking, among other things, to past court precedents.

Finally, we would urge the next wave of Democratic candidates to set their sights as high as possible while also keeping a disciplined eye on the electoral prize. The best contenders combine a sweeping vision or campaign strategy with the resolute ability to stay on message, come hell or high water. Think Bill Clinton 1992, Barack Obama 2008 or, for that matter, Donald Trump 2016.
The clearest use of this phrase actually derives from Mahatma Gandhi in his 1929 autobiography: Hate the sin and not the sinner. But Gandhi's full statement has a bit different flavor: Hate the sin and not the sinner is a precept which, though easy enough to understand, is rarely practiced, and that is why the poison of hatred spreads in the world. Gandhi rightly observed that it is difficult — perhaps impossible — to see someone else firstly as a sinner and to focus on hating their sin without developing some level of disdain for the person. Perhaps this is why Jesus did not ask us to love sinners but to love neighbors and enemies.
The high court asked both sides to weigh in after the new administration announced last week that it was withdrawing Obama-era guidelines instructing school districts to let transgender students use bathrooms corresponding to their chosen gender. That guidance provided the basis for a federal appeals court's ruling last year in Grimm's favor.

There's no question the data suggests we're seeing a higher number of scholastic and college-level students to come out because they're inundated with amazing friends.

Salt Lake City: The state's unemployment rate is now the lowest ever recorded at 2.3%, which also ties for lowest among U.S. states, state officials said Friday. The milestone comes in December data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. The job market is humming along at a feverish pace and is absorbing as much labor as possible, said Mark Knold, chief economist at the Utah Department of Workforce Services. Utah was also a leader in job creation for 2019, up about 3%. The fastest growth by percentage occurred in construction, education and health services, and leisure and hospitality services. Washington County had the biggest job growth, followed by Rich and Iron counties. The national unemployment rate was 3.5% in December. Utah tied Vermont and South Carolina for the lowest unemployment rate in the nation.

Elko: The Silver Dollar Club, an iconic bar dating to the Prohibition era in one of the city's oldest buildings, is closing after 86 years of stories and songs rooted in the Wild West days. Sam Horvitz, the club proprietor, told the Elko Daily Free Press he's closing Jan. 30. I've been waiting to buy the building for years now, Horvitz posted Jan. 3 on his Facebook page, and my faith and patience have finally run out. The brick building was Elko's first bank, founded in 1880. Henderson Bank moved in 1929 to a four-story building across the railroad tracks, and the old bank became a grocery store. Local historian Jan Petersen, director of the nearby Cowboy Arts and Gear Museum, said the building became a soft drink parlor during the Prohibition era of the 1920s. Robert Doby Doc Caudill, anticipating constitutional approval for the 21st Amendment repealing Prohibition in December 1933, opened the Silver Dollar Club a month earlier, in November 1933.

Portland: Marijuana sales in Oregon along the Idaho state line are 420% the statewide average, according to a state report. Idaho residents are purchasing recreational marijuana in Oregon because it is illegal in their own state, says the report released Friday by the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis. The sales in counties along the Idaho border were much stronger than I anticipated, analyzer Josh Lehner said. Obviously recreational marijuana is not legal in Idaho, but even after throwing the data into a rough border tax model that accounts for incomes, number of retailers, tax rates and the like, there remains a huge border effect. A border effect occurs when two neighboring jurisdictions have different rules prompting residents to travel to nearby regions to take advantage of the different regulations, experts said.

Albany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday announced a new Census Council that will oversee outreach and other efforts to make sure the upcoming census counts as many New Yorkers as possible. The Democrat said Lin-Manuel Miranda, Lucy Liu and Martin Luther King III have been tapped to co-chair the new council, which he said will hold conferences and work in hard-to-reach communities to make sure they're counted. Unfortunately, people of color are the ones most often undercounted, which leads to negative consequences for their communities, King said in a statement. Cuomo said he also plans to propose another $10 million for the state's census efforts in this year's budget, which if approved would bring state funding efforts up to $70 million.
Trump's war of words with professional athletes has been well documented. LGBTQ advocates also argue that Trump's policies went beyond disputes and were discriminatory to their community, particularly to the transgender community, where Trump oversaw the rollback of rights targeting them.

Honolulu: The Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office has identified the remains of two people found in a burnt-out home where a man allegedly shot and killed two Honolulu police officers and attacked a neighbor before setting the house ablaze last weekend. Officials on Friday released a statement identifying the homeowner, Lois Ann Cain, 77, as one of the two people found in the house that was destroyed by fire in an upscale neighborhood near Waikiki Beach. A tenant, Jaroslav Jerry Hanel, is accused of shooting police who were responding to the home after he allegedly attacked and stabbed a woman who also lived in the house. Cain was in the process of evicting Hanel when the violence erupted Sunday. The medical examiner also identified the second set of remains but withheld a name pending notification of next of kin.

Ogallala: The Game and Parks Commission is delaying action on a set of restrictions that would drastically limit overnight campers and beachgoers at the state's largest reservoir, Lake McConaughy in western Nebraska. Commission Director Jim Douglas said Saturday that the commission is going to take additional time to consider all the suggestions offered by hundreds of people who showed up for a hearing on the proposed rules last week. Most people at Thursday's meeting said they wanted more law enforcement and greater attention to checkpoints, not a crackdown to limit access to the lake. The proposed restrictions the commission had been set to consider were developed following complaints about overcrowding and rowdy behavior last Fourth of July. The number of annual visitors to Lake McConaughy has grown significantly from 500,000 in the 1990s to more than 1 million in 2012 to nearly 2 million last year.

The 15-member committee, which released its report this month, also advises improving civilian oversight of police, Vermont Public Radio reports. The City Council formed the panel in June following several interactions in which officers allegedly used excessive force. The council told the committee to focus on the police department's use-of-force policy and the police commission. Committee Chair Randall Harp told the council Tuesday that the panel advises making de-escalation a priority in the use-of-force policy. And emphasize that officer behavior can escalate the level of force required, and it sanctions officers that do so, he said.

Atlanta: Lawmakers are considering raising the state's minimum dropout age from 16 to 17. But a Wednesday hearing on Senate Bill 343 revealed concerns about how much additional students would cost the state, as well as whether it's worthwhile for the state to try to force uninterested teens to remain in school. The Senate Education and Youth Committee didn't vote on the bill. Chairman P.K. Martin, a Lawrenceville Republican, promised another hearing, but it's unclear if the measure will move forward. Some Democrats have been seeking for years to raise past 16 the age for students choosing to leave school. If we allow young people to leave our schools at 16, there are no jobs for them, said the bill's sponsor, Democrat Lester Jackson of Savannah. He argues the 16-year-old age was set when unskilled jobs such as being a farmhand were widely available.

The court noted that the donor was not involved in pre-natal doctor visits, was not present at the birth and did not see the child until she was 1 or 2 months old. The child was 7 months old when the paternity action was filed.

Who is in the White House is like the 12th most important influence for not coming out, Zeigler said. Donald Trump is not homophobic so I don't think we're going to see an incredible wave of people coming out because of the Biden administration. If anything, (Biden's) presidency could just accelerate the momentum already in place.
But midway through the decade, backlashes also started to sprout. Some targeted transgender people's rights. Many took the form of religious exemption laws that let people, churches and sometimes businesses cite religious beliefs as a reason not to enforce a law, such as declining to marry a same-sex couple or letting state-funded foster agencies refuse to place kids with LGBTQ parents.
Outsports tracked 184 coming-out stories in 2017. Zeigler said that female athletes' coming out stories, in particular, have significantly increased.
Those cases and more will be decided in the midst of the 2020 presidential election, making the Supreme Court – with five conservative justices named by Republican presidents and four liberals named by Democratic presidents – a political issue.

This question so often comes from a place of concern, as FKA twigs pointed out in the interview with Gayle King, but it so often makes survivors feel like it is their responsibility to make the abuse stop, said Deborah Vagins, president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. Abuse is an intentional pattern of controlling behavior, and the only person who can make the abuse stop is the person responsible for choosing to abuse in the first place.
Graham emphasized the joy to be found in belief, in contrast to evangelists such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, who routinely issued glowering condemnations of politicians or blamed natural disasters on modern culture. However, Graham did take an uncharacteristically political stand before the 2012 presidential election. He authorized full-page ads in major newspapers in October urging people to vote for politicians who opposed same-sex marriage on biblical principles.

►Don't trim your sails. Jones is a moderate Democrat willing to work across the aisle and find common ground to get things done for Alabama and our country. However, he did not alter his support for reproductive rights, immigration or gay marriage — or downplay his role in prosecuting and convicting two of the Ku Klux Klan members who murdered four African-American girls at a Birmingham church in 1963 — to curry favor with certain constituencies. Not every Democrat will agree with every other Democrat on policy issues. We have had, and still possess, a big tent. Voters would rather you say what you mean and mean what you say than believe you are willing to sacrifice your principles in exchange for a few votes.

Fargo: State officials say it's time for property owners in flood-prone areas of the Red River Valley to think about buying flood insurance. The push comes as early signs suggest a heightened risk of flooding this spring. The Red River Basin in eastern North Dakota has seen record precipitation totals for the fall and winter period starting Sept. 1, National Weather Service spokesman Greg Gust said Friday after the agency released its first flood outlook of the season. This year's flood could be a top five event, although it's still too early to predict hard numbers, and much is left to be determined, Gust said. The state Water Commission and Department of Emergency Services have scheduled flood preparation meetings this week in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown that will focus on insuring homes and other structures.

Oklahoma City: A state House committee overwhelmingly rejected a bill Thursday to repeal a new law that allows most adults to carry firearms without a background check or training. Despite the 11-1 vote against his bill by the House Public Safety Committee, Rep. Jason Lowe, an Oklahoma City Democrat, vowed to continue fighting the law with a signature-gathering effort to put a question on the ballot to repeal it. I believe this law is absolutely dangerous, Lowe said. It's a ticking time bomb, and it's been an absolute disaster. Dubbed permitless carry by its opponents, the new law allows most adults to carry firearms, concealed or openly, without a license. It was the first measure signed into law by Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt and took effect in November. Oklahoma's Republican-led Legislature has embraced numerous bills that expand gun rights in the state. The committee on Thursday approved a bill to expand the state's Stand Your Ground law. Last week, the Senate approved a bill that would allow more public school teachers to carry firearms in their classrooms.

Granting the request of a sperm donor for a paternity test would effectively disrupt, if not destroy, this family unit and nullify the child's established relationship with the wife, her other mother.

One voter at Tuesday's town hall described himself as a Rubio supporter shopping for a new candidate to support who is not named Donald Trump.

Krvaric, 21, a senior studying international security and conflict resolution, said he'd rather the group focus less on helping conservative students land political jobs, a traditional role for College Republican groups, and instead work to wage the culture war.

Many group members oppose abortion rights and hold hard-line views on immigration.
The report also depicted the governor becoming emotionally unstable over the relationship, wavering between tearful contrition and angry defiance, to the point of threatening staffers who knew or who he believed knew about the existence of the tapes.

Since his victory in a very competitive Republican primary in 2016, Trump has relied on evangelical Christians and other influential religious groups as powerful voting blocs to shore up his influence. He has appointed more than 200 federal judges and three conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who support limits on abortion and gay marriage and other policies favored by many conservative religious leaders. In the presidential election in November, 76% of white evangelicals voted for Trump and 24% for Joe Biden, according to Edison Research exit polls.

Nelsonville: The ongoing theft of historic bricks has frustrated officials in this small city who spent a lot of time tracking down the bricks for downtown sidewalks. At least 50 so-called Nelsonville Star Bricks have been taken since early January, city manager Chuck Barga says. The bricks are a legacy of Nelsonville's brick-making history and won first prize at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis. Each has a star imprinted in its center. At least three brick producers once called Nelsonville home thanks to large clay deposits in the area. Though millions of Star Bricks were manufactured between the late 1800s and about 1920, the bricks are no longer made, which makes the thefts all the more frustrating, Barga told The Columbus Dispatch. The city tracked down the bricks for a renovation of Nelsonville's downtown a couple of years ago.
I think Jesus knew that if he commanded his disciples to 'love the sinner,' they would begin looking at other people more as sinners than neighbors. And that, inevitably, would lead to judgment. If I love you more as a sinner than as my neighbor, then I am bound to focus more on your sin. I will start looking for all the things that are wrong with you. And perhaps, without intending it, I will being thinking about our relationship like this: You are a sinner, but I graciously choose to love you anyway. If that sounds a little puffed up, self-righteous, and even prideful to you, then you have perceived accurately.

The Republican-led Legislature already has taken the first steps to pass the legislation for a constitutional ban on sanctuary cities, or jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The state already has an existing ban on sanctuary cities, implemented in 2011. The Arizona Daily Star reports that while no local jurisdictions in Arizona meet the definition of a sanctuary city, and the city of Tucson overwhelmingly rejected a ballot proposition to become one in November, law enforcement agencies in Tucson have adopted immigrant-friendly policies.

Chicago: Marijuana was stolen last week from a box placed at Chicago's Midway International Airport for travelers who dispose of their marijuana before they board a plane, police said Friday. The marijuana amnesty boxes were placed at Midway and O'Hare International Airport after it became legal this year to possess marijuana in Illinois. The boxes, owned by the Department of Aviation and serviced by the police, were installed so air travelers can be in compliance with federal law as well as the local laws at their destination. Police officers regularly empty the boxes, file a report for the items inside and dispose of any surrendered marijuana. Tampering with them, or attempting to remove anything placed inside, is a crime, said Chicago police spokesman Antony Gugliemi, who added that an investigation is underway.

Phoenix: The state's budding hemp-growing industry is suffering growing pains as levels of THC that are too high force some farmers to destroy crops instead of harvesting them. About 41% of hemp plants tested for THC, the compound that gives marijuana its high, have failed, according to the Arizona Department of Agriculture's Plant Services Division, which oversees the program. Growers in other states around the country have had issues managing the THC content of hemp plants, but none as much as in Arizona's early months. The state began issuing hemp-growing licenses to farmers in 2019, and harvesting started later that year. At 40%, that's off the charts, Sully Sullivan, executive director of the Hemp Industry Trade Association of Arizona, said of the state's THC findings. I'm taken aback by that. That's substantial.

Wichita: Local police are looking into using genetic genealogy databases to help solve cold murder and rape cases. Capt. Jeff Weible said the department isn't ready to decide whether it will use the technique, which has revolutionized cold-case investigations across the U.S. while also raising legal and privacy concerns. But to help find out how the technique could be used, the department co-hosted a two-day training conference on it last week. The Wichita Eagle reports it drew more than 60 people from law enforcement agencies and other organizations across the state and nation to downtown Wichita. The conference's co-host, Gene by Gene, is allowing law enforcement agencies to submit DNA samples and lab data files from certain kinds of cold cases. Gene by Gene then queries its DNA database, Family Tree DNA, for any matches that investigators can use to track down suspects or identify remains.
At the University of Washington last May, a group calling itself College Republicans hosted such a bake sale.

Members said they feared for their safety.

Same-sex marriage didn't create these problems. Many in America had unwisely already gone along with the erosion of marital norms in the wake of the sexual revolution — with the rise of cohabitation, nonmarital childbearing, no-fault divorce and the hookup culture. It was no surprise that many would then question the relevance of the male-female norm. Legal redefinition is a consequence of the cultural breakdown of marriage.

Biloxi: Replicas of Christopher Columbus' Nina and Pinta have arrived along Mississippi's Gulf Coast, sailing into a Biloxi harbor as spectators aimed their phones out to the horizon. About a dozen spectators lined a pier Wednesday as the ships arrived. Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic on the Nina on his three voyages of discovery to the New World beginning in 1492. He was long celebrated in the U.S., but in recent years a reckoning has been held with the brutal aspects of his legacy. Columbus' arrival brought violence, disease, enslavement, racism and exploitation to the native people. The original Nina was last heard from in 1501, but this replica, finished in 1991, serves as a floating museum. It was built entirely by hand, without the use of power tools, and is considered the most historically accurate Columbus ship replica ever built. The Pinta replica was built in Brazil and launched in 2005 to accompany the Nina on travels. While in port, the ships will be open for public tours. They are scheduled to leave Biloxi on March 2.
Right, and my personal views have nothing to do with my job as a judge, Gorsuch shot back.

Indianapolis: The state has just seen the biggest decrease in its infant mortality rate in six years, officials say. In 2018, 7.3 out of every 1,000 babies born in Indiana died in their first year of life – one of the highest rates in the nation. Last year, the rate dipped to 6.8 per 1,000. In all, 559 infants died in 2018, compared to 602 the previous year. Quite honestly this is a culmination of a number of years of very intensive efforts from multiple state agencies and Gov. Eric Holcomb, said Dr. Kristina Box, Indiana state health commissioner. I celebrate those babies that were saved, but we still have a long way to go. One of the initiatives the state took to combat its infant mortality rate was an OB navigator program that provides personal, at-home support for women living in the 20 counties with the highest infant mortality rate. The program follows mother and baby for six months to a year after birth.

Columbia: The University of Missouri is tracking all new students on campus this semester through a cellphone app to learn whether they're attending class. It's a test expansion of a program the university has used for four years to track class attendance of freshmen student athletes and athletes in academic trouble. Supporters of the program say it helps attendance, which in turn improves students' academic performance. Critics worry the university could someday add uses for the program that will violate student privacy, The Kansas City Star reports. The expanded use of the program began Tuesday on a test basis. Faculty volunteered to use the program in their classes, but students won't have a choice about participating. Every student in the program will be told attendance is being monitored, said Jim Spain, vice provost for undergraduate studies. The university will help students who don't have a phone participate.

There's a deeper logic, too. Implicit in the push for same-sex marriage was body-self dualism — the idea that we're actually nonphysical entities inhabiting physical bodies, or ghosts in machines. That's why the plumbing in sexual acts seemed not to matter.

Croydon: The police chief took it literally when he was stripped of his duties at a local board meeting, disrobing to his underwear and walking out into a snowstorm. Richard Lee has been chief in the small town of Croydon for 20 years. On Tuesday night, the three-member selectboard voted to eliminate the one-man department and move to 100% coverage by the New Hampshire State Police. Lee, who was at the meeting, was told to turn in the key to his cruiser, his guns and his uniform – immediately. He went into an office he shared with town officials and took off his clothes before the board chairman. I gave them my uniform shirt. I gave them my turtleneck. I gave them my ballistic vest. … I sat down in the chair, took off my boots, took off my pants, put those in the chair and put my boots back on, and walked out the door, Lee said. He didn't have spare clothes or a ride home. He walked nearly a mile before his wife picked him up.

Annapolis: Lawmakers hope to repeal archaic provisions in the state's spousal defense for sex crimes and sodomy laws with the reintroduction of legislation this session. Lawmakers on Thursday expect to hear a Senate bill that would repeal the use of marriage as a defense to prosecution of some sex crimes, and last week the House introduced a bill that would repeal the crimes of sodomy and unnatural or perverted sexual practice. Under current state law, a person may not be prosecuted for first- or second-degree rape or third- or fourth-degree sexual offenses if the victim is the legal spouse of the assailant at the time of the offense. The bill's lead sponsor, Sen. Susan Lee, D-Montgomery, told Capital News Service she thinks current law treats a spouse as property. It's really disrespectful, it's wrong, and it's antiquated, Lee said.

Lewes: The public needs to keep a safe distance from the seals that will be present along beaches and other waterways through April, according to the state's official marine mammal and sea turtle stranding response organization. The MERR Institute recommends the public stay at least 150 feet from seals and always keep pets on a leash and at a safe distance because seals are wild animals that can bite if they feel threatened. It is common at this time of the year to see seals on area beaches, docks and other locations where they can rest, the Delaware State News reports. Four species of seals may visit Delaware. Oftentimes these animals are healthy, but at other times they may be suffering from illness or injury and in need of veterinary care, officials said. Anyone who encounters a seal is asked to contact MERR as soon as possible at (302) 228-5029. More information can be found on MERR's website.
Juneau: The Legislature failed to override more than $70 million in vetoes dealing with school construction projects and the state ferry system. Gov. Mike Dunleavy issued the vetoes last summer, after lawmakers had adjourned. The veto override session was announced late Thursday, with no clear indication of sufficient support. House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, an independent from Dillingham, said in a statement that Alaskans deserve to know where their elected officials stand. House Minority Leader Lance Pruitt, in response, said the vote was about nothing more than creating material to use against other members in the next election cycle. Lawmakers attempted to override a $5 million veto of funds for the ferry system and vetoes of funds for school debt reimbursement to municipalities and a construction fund for rural schools. The issues were considered as part of one vote.

Oklahoma City: A top Republican legislator wants to eliminate the state Board of Corrections after a former board member allegedly overstepped his authority. Sen. Roger Thompson, R-Okemah, pre-filed legislation to get rid of the nine-member board first formed roughly 50 years ago. In mid-September, gang-related inmate fights broke out at six state prisons, leading the Oklahoma Department of Corrections to lock down the prisons for days. Behind the scenes, then-interim director Scott Crow and other corrections officials were discussing how to handle the situation. That's when a board member tried to step in, Thompson said. We had a board member in that control room trying to give orders and trying to be in charge, and we're dealing with public safety, he said. We can keep the people safe without board members actually trying to interfere. Thompson declined to name the individual.

New York: Some 85,000 artifacts that tell the story of the Chinese migration to the United States may have been lost in a fire that struck a building in the heart of Manhattan's Chinatown, a museum official said Friday. The president of the Museum of Chinese in America told The New York Times most of the thousands of historic and artistic items in its collection were probably lost in the fire that started Thursday night and tore through a building where the museum's acquisitions were stored. One hundred percent of the museum's collection, other than what is on view, said Nancy Yao Maasbach, the president of the museum. She said the collection was one of a kind, and she was just distraught after receiving the news. The fire started in a former school that more recently housed a senior center, the Chen Dance Center and a number of community groups. The museum is nearby and stored its collection in the structure that was hit by fire.
While lawyers for 17-year-old Gavin Grimm said the case should be argued later this month as scheduled, those representing the Gloucester County School Board suggested a delay to get the Trump administration's full views.

Huntington: Marshall University is investigating three separate incidents of hate graffiti on its campus. A statement from the school said its police department is trying to identify who wrote the graffiti. Disciplinary action up to expulsion or dismissal could be taken if the incidents are linked back to a student or employee, the school said. The college didn't specify what exactly was written but said two of the markings were found Thursday, and one was reported earlier this month. All three were found in restrooms on the Huntington campus. School staffers have since removed the graffiti. This hate speech is against everything we stand for. We will do everything we can to identify the perpetrators, President Jerome Gilbert said.

Barring the state from recognizing same-sex marriage
Harrisburg: As many of the state's counties adopt new hand-marked ballot voting systems, a persistent criticism is a perceived loss of privacy in polling places when filling them out and scanning them. The criticism, raised again Wednesday by state lawmakers, has emerged repeatedly ahead of the presidential elections, after a two-year push by Gov. Tom Wolf to get counties to switch to paper-based voting systems as an election security bulwark against hacking. Some lawmakers say they have heard from unhappy voters accustomed to electronic touchscreen voting machines that, in the past, had been screened off or arranged to allow voters to make selections unseen. Now, other voters or poll workers may be able to see how someone voted while they are filling out their ballot or while they feed their ballot into an electronic scanner that reads it. I think we're disenfranchising so many voters who don't like the new system, Rep. Doyle Heffley, R-Carbon, told top state election officials at an Appropriations Committee hearing Wednesday. It's not a secret ballot. Other people can see how they vote.

Virginia, a unanimous ruling that invalidated state laws against interracial marriage.
Critics say Alito's empathy extends only one way: Toward conservatives.
It's hard to say Donald Trump hasn't played a significant role in impeding progress for LGBTQ people as a whole, said Greenburgh-North Castle (New York) High School athletic director Anthony Nicodemo, a gay high school basketball coach who teaches politics. Then in the sports world, where homophobia and toxic masculinity already exist, we're talking about a lot of fear factors that can make being your true self challenging.

(The Trump administration) will go down in history as one of the most blatantly hostile administrations to LGBTQ equality, said Sharon McGowan, chief strategy officer and legal director of Lambda Legal, a national nonprofit organization working for the civil rights of the LGBT community and those living with HIV. And again, you have to put that in context, because obviously going back not that long ago one might look to the indifference and hostility of the Reagan administration during the first days of the AIDS crisis as sort of another example.
For a judge to start tipping his or her hand about whether they like or dislike this or that precedent would send the wrong signal, he said. It would send a signal to the American people that the judge's personal views have something to do with the judge's job.

Fort Gay: The community has passed a resolution declaring itself a Second Amendment sanctuary. The Fort Gay town council passed the resolution Friday night, news outlets report. Supporters say it is a defense against possible federal or state legislation that could limit access to firearms, ammunition or gun accessories. Mayor Joetta Hatfield says Fort Gay is the first municipality in West Virginia to adopt such a resolution. She says the move was made in response to recent events in Virginia, where the new Democratic majority leadership plans to enact a slew of gun restrictions. Fort Gay is located in Wayne County along the West Virginia-Kentucky border. Last week the Putnam County Commission passed a similar resolution.
Thousands of protesters broke into the Capitol as Congress tried to finalize the Electoral College vote count and acknowledge Biden as the election winner. The attack led to five deaths and nearly 100 arrests and motivated House Democrats to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump for allegedly inciting the crowds. During a speech before the violence broke out, Trump told his followers, We're going to have to fight much harder.

Just as no LGBT couples are prevented from marrying because a particular church does not perform same-sex weddings, no LGBT couples are prevented from fostering because a particular church cannot provide an endorsement, lawyers for Catholic Social Services said in court papers. Yet many churches will be prevented from exercising religion by caring for at-risk children, all due to a disagreement with the government about marriage.
Biggs' conservative bona fides are undeniable.
It's all about 'WWRD,' Winkler says. What would Roberts do?
I don't see him changing, Ciongoli added of Alito. What I do see is the landscape of the debate shifting in a way that very interestingly puts his philosophy and his personality and orientation as a figure in the middle of that debate.
►Common ground works as a message, even in, and perhaps especially because of, these polarized times. Jones' willingness to cross the aisle was an integral part of his message from the beginning of the campaign and became a constant in our advertising. Our polling showed that Jones won two in five voters who had favored Luther Strange (the establishment choice) in the September GOP runoff, and Jones also won independents by nearly 10 points on Election Day. The truth is that the actions of President Trump and his GOP majority in Congress have made them vulnerable to the charge that they are unwilling to compromise — thus failing to achieve any progress on health care and other key issues. In contrast with Jones' strengths, by election eve, 49% of Alabamians felt that Moore would make things worse in Washington.
In his self-published The Con of the Con-Con, Biggs argues against a constitutional convention, comparing a desire to fix problems in government through such a process to overhauling an engine to fix a flat tire. In the book, Biggs said his family was targeted by liberals in Tucson when he was growing up.
San Francisco: The western monarch butterfly population wintering along the state's coast remains critically low for the second year in a row, according to an environmental group. The count of the orange-and-black insects by the Xerces Society, a nonprofit environmental organization that focuses on the conservation of invertebrates, recorded about 29,000 butterflies in its annual survey. That's not much different from last year's tally, when an all-time-low 27,000 monarchs were counted. By comparison, about 4.5 million monarch butterflies wintered in forested groves along the California coast in the 1980s. Scientists say the butterflies are at critically low levels in the western United States due to the destruction of their milkweed habitat along their migratory route as housing expands into their territory and use of pesticides and herbicides increases. Researchers also have noted the effect of climate change.
The President of the United States sets the tone for the country and I think Trump's discrimination made it less safe but it made us braver as a country in some ways, Nicodemo said. What happened in the last four years for the country was a social justice movement that actually got us somewhere now as a country we've never been before – ready for serious change. We don't have an out athlete in the NBA, the NFL, the MLB or the NHL. It's hard to imagine that will stay the same with our country being more welcoming at the top.
Memphis: Vice President Mike Pence gave a speech Sunday in remembrance of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at a service at the Holy City Church of God, the day before the federal holiday named after the civil rights leader. I'm here to pay a debt of honor and respect to a man who from walking the dirt roads of the Deep South, to speaking to hundreds of thousands on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, touched the hearts of the American people and led the civil rights movement to triumph over Jim Crow, Pence said. Before the service, Pence toured the National Civil Rights Museum at the Lorraine Motel, where King was fatally shot April 4, 1968, while standing on a balcony. Local church leaders noted commonalities between their faith and Pence's, with Bishop Vincent Mathews Jr., COGIC World Missions president, calling Pence one of the most persecuted Christians in America.
MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Billie Jean King thinks one of the main venues at the Australian Open should be renamed because of Margaret Court's comments about the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.

Annapolis: The state would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2030, under an ambitious measure outlined Wednesday as the coastal state grapples with increasing concerns about sea-level rise. The legislation would increase the state's current goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 40%, based on 2006 levels. It also would set the state on a path toward achieving net-zero statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. Supporters of the Climate Solutions Act of 2020 say Maryland, which has about 3,100 miles of tidal shoreline, must be a leader in addressing rising sea levels. Environmentalists say the measure is the the most comprehensive approach to addressing greenhouse gas emissions before lawmakers this session in a Legislature controlled by Democrats. The measure's goals include planting 1 million trees a year in the state for a decade. It also calls for requiring new commercial buildings with 25,000 square feet of rooftop to use solar panels.
It's unsurprising that once a campaign that used to cry live and let live prevailed, it began working to shut down Catholic adoption agencies and harass evangelical bakers and florists. This shows it was never really about live and let live — that was a merely tactical stance.

Loreen needs to get away so she can contemplate if she really wants to divorce Hannah's out father, Tad. She's on the brink of 60 and not sure that she wants to spend the rest of her life alone.

Montpelier: A bill in the state would take vanity license plates into new territory with the introduction of emojis. State Rep. Rebecca White, a Democrat from Windsor, introduced the proposal to let drivers add one of six available emojis to their license plate, MyNBC5 reports.

The symbols would not replace letters or numbers assigned by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, nor those selected by a vehicle's owner. At this point, it's unclear what the new plates would would look like or what emojis would be allowed. Of the state's current vanity plates, the most expensive for cars and trucks is the state conservation series, which carry a $26 annual fee.

Melbourne: An algae toxin 1,000 times deadlier than cyanide lingers at trace levels in the livers of bottlenose dolphins in the Indian River Lagoon, a new study shows, remaining there even when the algae is not blooming. The long-term health implications for the lagoon's top predator and other marine life remain uncertain. We're not making any conclusions about what it's doing to them, said Spencer Fire, an assistant professor at Florida Tech. The study for the first time establishes a baseline level of the toxin in lagoon dolphins by which to compare future toxin levels during dolphin strandings or die-offs. This is what we expect to be sort of background levels, Fire said. The poison, called saxitoxin, comes from the same algae that glows like fairy dust at night in the lagoon. The study, led by Florida Tech, is the first report of saxitoxin being detected in marine mammals absent an algae bloom.

Dallas: The state will close two of its more than 100 state prisons amid a years­long decline in the incarcerated population and serious understaffing at some facilities, officials said Thursday. The closures of a prison in South Texas and another in suburban Houston will result in annual savings of about $20 million, according to the office of state Sen. John Whitmire, who heads the Senate Criminal Justice Committee. The Garza East Transfer Facility in Beeville, 100 miles southeast of San Antonio, is set to close in May, but a date has not been set for the closure of the Jester I Unit in Sugar Land, according to Whitmire's chief of staff, Lara Wendler. She said both prisons were at more than 90% population capacity as of Thursday, and those inmates will be transferred to other prisons.
Even though the events are held at a bar or restaurant, it's a bit of a different scene than a gay bar with live entertainment or loud music. It's more about making friendships and networking than partying — not that the group can't do that as well.
Kennedy's words are more important today than ever before, now that many LGBT people feel their rights are becoming increasingly vulnerable.

Montgomery: Transgender students would be required to play sports under their gender assignment at birth instead of how they live under a bill approved Wednesday by a committee in the state House of Representatives. The House State Government Committee voted 8-4 for the Gender Is Real Legislative Act, or GIRL Act, by Republican Rep. Chris Pringle. The bill, which awaits input from the full House, would ban K-12 schools from allowing trans athletes to compete under their gender identity. It would instead require students to participate under the gender listed on their original birth certificate. Opponents criticized the measure as motivated by fear and discrimination toward trans people. Pringle said the bill is designed to ensure a level playing field in girls' sporting events. Pringle acknowledged he knew of no competition problems in Alabama but said disputes have arisen in other states.

The rally, held by the Louisville-based Fairness Campaign every legislative session, featured activists and legislators advocating for those bills and against a slew of bills targeting transgender youth. Beshear threw his support behind legislation banning discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, which has failed to pass either chamber in each legislative session over the past decade.

The state Civil Service Commission voted to allow Jeffrey Godere to return to the Chicopee Police Department at a lower rank after winning an appeal of his termination, MassLive.com reports. Godere was fired by then-Mayor Richard Kos in November 2018 after he and three other officers were implicated in sharing images of a victim's body and the crime scene in the 2011 killing of 20-year-old Amanda Plasse. The commission ruled last week that Godere would be demoted to patrolman because of his misconduct and prior disciplinary record.

Baker said the bill would cut down the hidden costs that currently blindside consumers and would require walk-in clinics to treat low-income patients on Medicaid. He said the bill would also hold drug companies accountable for excessive prices and unjustified price increases, as well as support distressed community hospitals and community health centers. The hearing is scheduled for Tuesday at the Statehouse. When he unveiled the legislation in October, Baker said it would address the challenges associated with supporting an aging population, individuals with a chronic illness, or those in need of behavioral health services. The proposal would outlaw surprise bills for emergency room care and rein in certain hospital fees.

They met as Harriett accompanied her father on a trip with the drum and bugle corp in which he played. Jack was behind the wheel of a charter bus that drove the group to some of its concerts.

True one-flesh union, the foundation of conjugal marriage, was thought illusory. What mattered was emotional union and partners' use of their bodies to induce desirable sensations and feelings.

If the body is mere plumbing, then sex matters less than identity.

His national stature as a political outlier only has grown in the stormy aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, when Biggs repeatedly raised doubtsto undermine the process and sought to set aside millions of legitimate votes. He also is among a group of Republican lawmakers under scrutiny over their roles in the run-up to the Jan. 6 riot in which supporters of former President Donald Trump ransacked the U.S. Capitol and five people died.

New Brunswick: Rutgers University is planning to name Jonathan Holloway, the current provost of Northwestern University, as its 21st president on Tuesday, according to NJ Advance Media. A former Stanford football player, Holloway, 52, will be the state university's first black president. A joint meeting of the university's Board of Governors and Board of Trustees has been called for 9 a.m. Tuesday. Rutgers spokesperson Dory Devlin confirmed the session's agenda is to vote on an executive-level position matter. Holloway would replace President Robert Barchi, who has served in his post since September 2012. Barchi announced in July that he will step down at the end of the 2019-20 school year. Gov. Phil Murphy tweeted about the expected hiring Sunday, saying Holloway has the vision & experience to put the needs of students first & lead Rutgers to the next level.

Ash Wednesday ushers in Lent, the 40-day period (excluding Sundays) of penance that precedes Easter, which is when Christians believe Jesus was resurrected. It's often a time of fasting and reflection. Now, followers can mark the period by posting photos with hashtags to Instagram, or watching a priest answer questions on Facebook Live. In the past several years, more churches are using digital tools to meet believers where they are — on social media. But whether or not Christians use any or all of these tools at their disposal, experts say the goal of Lent remains the same: improving a relationship with God.

Nationwide, the people who open marijuana stores in newly legal states have a significant advantage over late-comers, especially as multi-state operators have begun consolidating independent stores and squeezing down the margins. Because consolidation favors deep-pocketed investors, and because previous equity efforts were tentative at best, the cannabis industry nationally remains largely white and wealthy. New York's legislation aims to help correct that.
The left-leaning Campaign for Accountability has asked for ethics and criminal investigations of Biggs and Gosar, among others whose words helped light the match.
Of course, complicating all of this is your future spouse's French pension. The receipt of a public pension based on work that was not covered under Social Security triggers the application of the windfall elimination provision (WEP), the government pension offset (GPO) or both, says Czarnowski. Because (your) future spouse has no Social Security earnings, WEP does not apply. However, GPO does apply, and the Social Security Administration will be required to reduce any spousal or survivor benefit due him by 2/3 of the amount of his pension. Thus, while he may meet the eligibility requirements after you have been married for a year, he may not end up actually receiving anything, depending on the amount of his French pension.

Providence: A state representative is pushing for a bill that would allow school districts to raise money for extracurricular activities, including field trips and dances. Rep. Joseph McNamara, a Warwick Democrat, said many school districts canceled field trips last year after the state's former education commissioner established a policy stating that school departments may not charge students to participate in public school field trips. Schools interpreted that to mean no fundraising could be done either, McNamara said. The bill he recently introduced would add a provision to state law to say that school districts are not prohibited from requesting money from students, their parents or legal guardians to help pay for school-sponsored field trips, dances, clubs and other activities, provided the district pay the costs to meet any deficit.

Concord: The state's Democratic congressional delegation says New Hampshire will get more than $700,000 in federal funding to help youth suicide prevention efforts. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan and Reps. Annie Kuster and Chris Pappas said the state will receive $735,844 that will go to the the National Alliance on Mental Illness New Hampshire. The funding will be used to raise awareness about youth suicide, educate the public and ensure those in crisis can get the help they need. Pointing to data that shows suicide was the second-most-common cause for death among young Americans in 2017, Shaheen said the issue demands our full attention. Pappas described youth suicide as a mental health emergency and said that we must ensure that our young people here in New Hampshire get the help and support they need.

But what this experience made clear is that, even in 2019, we still have a long way to go to reach true equality.
Portland: Lobsters have long delighted tourists as the state's most beloved seafood. But one company thinks the crustaceans can save human lives by providing their blood for use in new drugs. The company working on the lobster blood project, Lobster Unlimited of Orono, is investigating whether lobster blood can be used as a potential weapon against viruses and cancer. Representatives with the company said results are promising – the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued them a patent in late October related to their work. The blood is easy to come by because it's a byproduct of lobster processing, company head Robert Bayer said. Lobster blood is likely a long way from playing a role in new drugs, Bayer said, but there's no question it has antiviral and anticancer properties based on research needed to apply for the patent. Right now, this blood is literally thrown out on the floor and goes down the drain, said Bayer, a professor emeritus of Animal and Veterinary Sciences at University of Maine.
New York's legalization effort is being closely watched in part because the state has so many residents, but also because Cuomo is hoping to persuade Connecticut and Pennsylvania to adopt similar plans, while New Jersey residents may approve a similar one via a ballot initiative.

Cheyenne: State regulators have issued a one-time permit for a company to test whether its technology to treat oil drilling and manufacturing wastewater can help vegetation grow on a farm. The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality permit issued this month allows Encore Green Environmental to apply about 7,000 barrels of the treated water to private farmland outside Pine Bluffs near the Nebraska state line by the end of the year. The Wyoming company's co-founder, Marvin Nash, told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle the permit marks the project's transformation to reality after several years of planning. Stock growers have said they see how this could work and that it's going to be an opportunity for agriculture to improve, Nash said. The company says on its website that it wants to solve the problem of too much oil and manufacturing wastewater being produced at industrial sites while nearby agricultural lands are in need of water.

The decision on one of the key state permits for the project is a rebuke that comes just before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is scheduled to issue a final environmental analysis on the project, approving or denying its primary federal license.

The old group, the California College Republicans, didn't return a request for comment.
Then, in 2012, Obama evolved, and the Supreme Court took cases involving marriage law. Nothing in the Constitution answered the actual question at hand: What is marriage?

Tallahassee: State lawmakers are transmitting a news bulletin: The telegraph era is over. Before there was instant messaging, emails or even corded telephones, there was the reliable telegraph to instantaneously transmit messages far and wide. Now, people turn to the internet, text messaging, Twitter, gifs and emojis to write their long-distance notes. While thumbing through a volume of Florida laws, state Rep. Tommy Gregory and a colleague came upon old statutes regulating the telegraph industry. I wondered if they were now obsolete, said Gregory, a former lieutenant colonel in the Air Force who has moved to rip the laws out of the state's books. A state House committee on Wednesday agreed unanimously to repeal Chapter 363 of the Florida Statute in its entirety. One lawmaker cheekily registered his vote by using his fingers to tap into the dais as if using Morse code.

Helena: Members of the state House of Representatives and legislative staffers have evaluated two chair designs to replace the seating that has been used by lawmakers for more than a century. We need to do this right because these chairs may be around another 100 years, House Speaker Greg Hertz, R-Polson, said Thursday, adding that the chairs should fit the historic atmosphere of the House. Lawmakers set aside $200,000 to purchase 106 wooden chairs for the House along with furniture for the Senate. The current chairs in the House are uncomfortable, unstable and have broken on occasion, sending a lawmaker tumbling to the floor. The designs reviewed Thursday included a rounded-back chair from Appleton Furniture of Helena and a high-backed chair manufactured by Montana Correctional Enterprises at the prison in Deer Lodge. Appleton furniture's design came out ahead in Thursday's scoring.

Isle of Palms: The owner of an island home is suing Airbnb, claiming it only reimbursed him for a fraction of the damages that a guest who threw a big party did to his home. In a federal lawsuit filed this week, Scott Shaw said the party left his home smelling of a mixture of marijuana, cigarettes, beer and vomit. Blood and vomit were found on the walls, towels and bedding, the lawsuit states. Shaw says he believes he is owed about $150,000 in both property and punitive damages. He did not say what the company paid him. He said Airbnb claims in its marketing materials that it guarantees up to $1 million reimbursement for property damage. Airbnb's 'host guarantee' is nothing close to any type of 'guarantee' and in fact it is false, misleading and deceptive, the lawsuit says. The company says it plans to vigorously defend against these allegations. Shaw says aside from the smell, the guests also left holes in the walls and broke a staircase railing, door and countertop, among other things.
For critics, however, federal legalization remains unlikely for the foreseeable future. Anti-legalization campaigner Kevin Sabet of the group Smart Approaches to Marijuana helped coordinate opposition to the New York plan last year in part by arguing that while most Americans want to see penalties for marijuana use eliminated, creating cannabis stores remains unpopular in many places. He said his group hopes to play the same role this year, although Cuomo appears more engaged this time around.
Like many tech companies, Amazon has long been a supporter of gay rights and anti-discrimination legislation. It has had a robust gay and lesbian employee group, GLAmazon, since 2005. Before it was common, advertisements for the e-tailer featured gay couples. And CEO Jeff Bezos contributed heavily to the push for gay marriage in Washington state. The company was one of the more than 50 tech firms that last year signed a friend of the court brief in a case involving a transgender high school student in Virginia.
Lincoln: A state senator who is pushing the Legislature's main bill to lower property taxes says she hopes to reach a deal with opponents who are trying to derail it out of concern that it could hurt the state's K-12 public schools. Sen. Lou Ann Linehan, of Omaha, said Thursday that she and other senators will try to find an agreement with school officials who are lobbying against the measure. The bill has won support from farm and business groups and Gov. Pete Ricketts because it would lower taxes that have risen over the past decade. But school administrators, school boards and the state teachers' union argue it would hinder their long-term spending flexibility. This bill is bad for Nebraska, and it's bad for our kids, said Sen. Wendy DeBoer, of Bennington, who opposed the measure. The bill would boost state aid to schools by about $520 million over three years and redistribute it so that smaller, rural schools get a larger increase.

Lawmakers in New York last year failed to agree on the legalization plan's specifics to aid minority communities — provisions known as equity — and it ultimately died after also facing strong opposition from lawmakers outside New York City, particularly those from conservative areas. While Cuomo wanted a new office controlled by his administration to decide how to aid minority communities, some African American legislators insisted that the specifics be set out in the law itself.

Athens: Hundreds of people have shown their support for an armless street artist whose artwork, supplies and donation box were stolen near the University of Georgia. Nearly $42,000 had been raised online as of late Sunday for Michael Davenport, who is known in Athens for sketching the university's bulldog mascot. He holds a pen in his mouth to create his art because he lost his arms as a child. Davenport, 53, said his belongings were stolen Jan. 15 when he took a break to use the restroom at a nearby business. Athens-Clarke police said detectives were looking to identify the suspect, seen on surveillance video in what appears to be a gold-colored minivan. Stephen Frazier, the general manager at Budget Host Inn in Athens, said he set up the online fundraising account in Davenport's name. Davenport told WAGA-TV he plans to use the money for a truck to carry his supplies and for medical treatment for his leg, injured in an attack last year.

The Georgia Department of Public Health said in a news release that car seats will be distributed among 107 counties using money awarded from the Child Passenger Safety Mini Grant program. Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death for children, and it's up to all of us to do everything we can to protect our children on the road, Public Health Commissioner Kathleen Toomey said.

Pine Bluff: Prison officials said Sunday that a state prison inmate has died after being found hanging in his cell. The state Department of Correction said in a news release that David Shabazz, 53, was found by guards about 6:30 p.m. Saturday in his one-man cell, hanging from a bed sheet that was wrapped around the cell's bars. The department said Shabazz was taken to a Pine Bluff hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly before 7:30 p.m. The department said Shabazz was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2002 following a drug-related conviction in Miller County and was later paroled but was back in custody for being a parole absconder. Shabazz's body was sent to the state medical examiner to determine the cause of death, and the death is also being investigated by Arkansas State Police.

Las Vegas: Virgin Trains Las Vegas has released plans to build a proposed train station near the South Premium Outlets mall south of the Strip. The $4.8 billion high-speed rail link with Southern California would be two stories tall and span more than 273,000 square feet, with a seven-story-tall parking garage, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Construction is scheduled to begin later this year, according to planning documents submitted to Clark County. Operations are scheduled to begin in 2023. Plans call for the two-story station to include a self-ticketing area, departure lobby, retail space, baggage claim, office space, passenger waiting areas and security. Plans also include a parking garage that would connect to the train terminal and have more than 2,600 parking spaces. The project would be designed to provide easier access to California, while also providing thousands of jobs and opportunities in the area, company officials said.

Cuomo's proposal is similar to plans proposed by Democratic state legislators and creates a new Office of Cannabis Management to oversee and regulate the entire industry.

But both agree minority communities should have the opportunity to benefit from new business opportunities

Salem: Thieves have stolen the old school bell that hung at the top of the steps at the historic Old Main schoolhouse. Friends of Old Main Board of Directors member Ron Plumlee recently discovered the bell was missing while checking on maintenance at the old schoolhouse. The bolts holding the bell in place were apparently sawed off, Plumlee said. The theft is suspected to have required at least two people because of the bell's size and weight, he said. The bell has been at the top of the steps for at least 70 years. The school was built in 1930 and is now operated by Friends of Old Main as a nonprofit activity center. The bell was brass with an inscription around the top and has many marks from ringing over the years. Anyone with information that might lead to the recovery of the bell or the apprehension of those responsible is asked to contact the Fulton County Sheriff's Office at (870) 895-2601.

But the scriptural reasoning behind this phrase is unclear. Jesus never asked us to Love the sinner, hate the sin and neither did any other Biblical writer. The closest phrases to this in Christian history — as pastor and Bible scholar Adam Hamilton writes in Half Truths: God Helps Those Who Help Themselves and Other Things the Bible Doesn't Say — are a letter from St. Augustine to a group of nuns (encouraging them to have love for mankind and hatred of sins).

Chicago: The city's former police chief has been receiving a pension of more than $15,800 a month since the mayor fired him in December for allegedly lying about a night he was found asleep in his city-issued SUV, according to a newspaper report. Eddie Johnson was awarded the pension by the Policemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago, the Chicago Tribune reports, citing records it obtained under Illinois' Freedom of Information Act. The pension adds up to nearly $190,000 annually, or 75% of his average salary of just over $253,000 per year during his final four years with the Chicago Police Department. Johnson, 59, blamed medication for making him drowsy before he was found asleep in his SUV, but media reports disclosed that the married superintendent had been drinking for hours and kissing a woman on his security detail and that the responding officers took steps to keep it secret.

The bill would allow members of the General Assembly, state and municipal police officers, firefighters and state judges to be exempt from state law that says most car windows must allow 70% of the light in. We have a lot of disgruntled individuals, Williams said. In the court system, law enforcement, and the General Assembly, we tend to get a bum rap, and we can face retaliation when we least expect it.

However, Holmes is the series' big breakout.

Boise: The number of residents who have signed up for Medicaid under the state's voter-approved expanded coverage has passed 60,000. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare posted updated numbers Thursday. The agency estimates 91,000 residents meet requirements. Coverage started Jan. 1, but enrollment is year-round. Those who sign up for Medicaid will be covered for doctor visits that occurred earlier in the same month. Voters authorized Medicaid expansion in 2018 with an initiative that passed with 61% of the vote after years of inaction by state lawmakers. But legislators in 2019 added restrictions requiring five waivers from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Waivers are required when states want to deviate from Medicaid rules. Federal officials have yet to approve any of Idaho's requested waivers.

Egg Harbor Township: A Superior Court judge has denied a neighborhood's attempt to leave the township and join a neighboring borough. Judge Julio Mendez ruled that Egg Harbor Township's refusal to allow Seaview Harbor residents to join Longport was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The township argued against the move, declaring that it would harm the township economically and socially and benefit the homeowners only economically, the Press of Atlantic City reports. The homeowners stood to pay significantly less in property taxes in Longport, which does not have a school system. Mendez said court decisions have not favored de-annexation for tax shopping. Mendez's opinion said the township stood to lose over $500,000 a year in municipal tax revenue and $1.8 million in revenue to township schools. The average homeowner would save almost $18,000 a year in property taxes, based on 2015 numbers.

Underneath their touchy-feely talk of tolerance, they seek to undermine American culture. They argue that culture, society and politics have been defined - and presumably defiled - by white, male heterosexuals hostile to their way of life.

It may be kinder and gentler, but can you build a bridge with it?
Cheyenne: Environmental groups are suing over plans for a potentially huge gas field they say would endanger antelope in Grand Teton National Park by hindering a migration route between the park and a basin. The Upper Green River Alliance, Western Watersheds Project and the Center for Biological Diversity sued the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in U.S. District Court in Cheyenne on Wednesday. The groups say the agency insufficiently took into account a 170-mile pronghorn antelope migration corridor between Grand Teton and the Upper Green River Basin before approving a plan to develop the Normally Pressured Lance gas field in the basin in 2018. The Jonah Energy project would potentially add 350 gas wells a year to the gas field over a decade. With 3,500 wells, the Normally Pressured Lance field could become one of the biggest onshore gas fields in the U.S.

Hattiesburg: The mayor is moving forward with a plan to install a camera surveillance system across town as a way to reduce crime. WDAM-TV reports Mayor Toby Barker brought up the idea of a partnership with Project NOLA during a Facebook video message to his constituents during which he also discussed a recent crime spree. This partnership will deploy high-definition cameras throughout the city. These cameras can detect gunshots and read license plates. Cities that have used these cameras have seen significant decreases in violent crime over time, he said. Project NOLA is a New Orleans-based organization that works with cities and towns, organizations and individuals to put cameras and gunshot detectors in needed areas. The video is transmitted to a center in New Orleans, where an analyst then provides information to officials on the ground.

Jackson: Grand Teton National Park stayed near its highest visitation levels in 2019, while Yellowstone National Park had its slowest tourism year since 2014, officials said. Grand Teton's 2019 attendance trailed only 2018 for tourists visiting the park, The Jackson Hole News and Guide reports. A Grand Teton park spokeswoman credited increased visits during historically slow shoulder seasons, the periods between peak and off-peak seasons. Grand Teton attracted 3.4 million recreational visitors, a category excluding people who only passed through, such as commercial truckers, officials said. July was Grand Teton's busiest month, with 776,000 visitors, while February, November and December saw fewer than 50,000 recreational visits each, officials said. Yellowstone, also in Wyoming, attracted slightly more than 4 million recreational visitors last year, a 2.3% decrease since 2018 and 5.6% decrease from the all-time high in 2016.
Nashville: A state panel won't vote on whether to remove or add context to a bust of a Confederate general and early Ku Klux Klan leader in the Capitol until a board vacancy is filled, the board's chairman said at a meeting Thursday. Finance Commissioner and Capitol Commission Chairman Stuart McWhorter said he's unsure when Gov. Bill Lee will replace Tyreece Miller, who recently left the commission as the nominee for U.S. marshal in western Tennessee. McWhorter said he doesn't want to act on Nathan Bedford Forrest's bust before Miller is replaced. The Tennessee Heritage Protection Act also requires the state Historical Commission's approval to remove the bust. Forrest amassed a fortune before the Civil War as a plantation owner and slave trader in Memphis. After the war, he was a leader of the Klan, which terrorized black people as it sought to reverse Reconstruction efforts and restore white supremacy.

Bellaire: Police have found the gun they believe a 16-year-old student used to fatally shoot his classmate last week inside a Houston-area high school, officials said. Police characterized the shooting in an ROTC room at Bellaire High School last Tuesday as an accident. Nineteen-year-old Cesar Cortes was killed, and the teenage gunman, who fled after the shooting, was captured more than three hours later and charged as a minor with manslaughter. The city of Bellaire announced Monday that authorities have recovered the weapon. Lt. Greg Bartlett declined to say when or where the gun was found. Bartlett said last week that the younger student took a semiautomatic pistol out of his waistband and pulled the trigger, killing Cortes. There were four other students in the room at the time but no adults. Police could not find the gun for days.

Seattle: The Washington State Ferries saw ridership fall 3.2% last year, held down by February's snowstorm and ongoing waterfront construction and alternative ferry service from Kitsap Transit. The Seattle Times reports the ferry agency tallied 23.9 million passengers in 2019, down about 800,000 from 2018. Despite the decrease, officials said there's no cause for concern. We've had a seven-year run of going up and up. It's not a huge red flag for us, said Ian Sterling, spokesperson for Washington State Ferries. Last February saw a 19% decline in ferry ridership during the record-setting snowstorm, and the numbers never caught up throughout the rest of the year. In fact, every month except for January and April had fewer passengers than in 2018. The Seattle-Bremerton route recorded the largest drop, with ridership down by 15%.

Indianapolis: The governor has told state agencies to calculate the damage along the Lake Michigan shoreline that's been caused by high water ahead of possibly seeking federal assistance. The order announced Thursday comes as several lakeshore communities have already declared local beach erosion emergencies with waves damaging property and threatening roads. The Indiana Department of Homeland Security has declined to declare a state emergency, but Gov. Eric Holcomb said he wanted a new review after viewing the shoreline by helicopter Sunday. The erosion is happening as Lake Michigan approaches its highest levels in recorded history, and forecasters expect the Great Lakes to remain high well into 2020. State Sen. Karen Tallian, an Ogden Dunes Democrat, called Holcomb's action long overdue, as she asked the governor for an emergency declaration almost two months ago.

When we looked at this information, these were elk that were born into the west and brought into the east, said Gabe Jenkins, deer and elk coordinator with the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources. Now nearly all of those animals from the west are dead. We have almost a completely new Kentucky bred, Kentucky-born population.

Loessfest was established in 2013 and has become the community's traditional kick-off to summer. Last year, Loessfest was initially postponed to Labor Day weekend, then canceled altogether due to ongoing flooding. Other locations were considered before canceling this year's festival, officials said. But it was ultimately decided that a critical component of Loessfest was its easy proximity to Omaha.

Los Alamos: A conservation group is calling on members of the state's congressional delegation to rethink proposed legislation that would change the designation of Bandelier National Monument to a national park. While one of the goals is to attract more tourists to the region with the national park brand, the nonprofit group Caldera Action said Bandelier would not be able to cope with additional crowding because of inadequate and crumbling infrastructure and limited staffing. The group also is worried about opening up part of Bandelier to hunting and trapping, saying there are other locations throughout the Jemez Mountains that already allow for hunting, and doing so at Bandelier would complicate management for the National Park Service. Tucked into northern New Mexico's ancient canyons, Bandelier has a long history that stretches back more than 11,000 years to the days when nomadic hunters and gatherers tracked wildlife across the region's mesas and canyons. Grand multistory structures were built into the walls of Frijoles Canyon and along Frijoles Creek centuries ago, but all that remains are stone and mortar outlines of the settlements.
Bismarck: Ten communities in the state will use part of a settlement with Volkswagen to build electric vehicle charging stations. The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality will send $2.7 million to the local governments and businesses for clean vehicle projects, including 17 charging stations statewide.

Just 187 electric vehicles are registered in the state, and North Dakota has no Level 1 fast chargers. Several dozen Level 2 chargers exist in the state, however. They are cheaper to install, but they take hours to provide a full charge. The stations will be somewhat spread across the state, with the Interstate 29 corridor in the Red River Valley having the highest concentration.

Baton Rouge: A month after delaying a decision, the state's higher education policy-making board voted Wednesday to bolster its minimum admission standards for public universities by adding the threat of financial penalties for campuses that disobey the requirements. The Board of Regents approved the adjustments to the state's existing, 15-year-old admissions standards without objection, after weeks of behind-the-scenes negotiations to get board members comfortable with the changes. Most of the rewrites were modest. But the penalty provisions represent the first real effort to force compliance with the policy. The board has never penalized schools for not complying with admissions criteria. Still, financial penalties won't be automatic for campuses that violate the admissions criteria, and the threat of reduced funding doesn't come unless a school has breached the policy for two consecutive years.

Philadelphia: The union representing public school teachers in the city is suing the district over its handling of asbestos contamination in schools, the union said Monday. The Philadelphia Federation of Teachers' suit comes after the city school district was forced to close a north Philadelphia elementary school for a second time Friday after tests demanded by teachers and union leaders showed elevated levels of asbestos, a known carcinogen, in the air.

Time and again, the School District has claimed that their actions are out of an abundance of caution, union president Jerry Jordan said in a statement. The school district said in a statement that it would thoroughly review the legal filings while remaining focused on improve environmental conditions in schools.

Bismarck: State regulators on Wednesday unanimously approved expanded capacity for the Dakota Access pipeline, saying they believed the project had met exhaustive state and federal requirements. The 3-0 vote by the all-Republican Public Service Commission came after the body signaled last month that it was likely to approve a permit to expand the capacity of the pipeline, despite objections from opponents who said it would increase the probability of a disastrous oil spill. Commissioners said they expect their decision to be challenged in state court. Commissioner Julie Fedorchak said she welcomed such a review. Texas-based Energy Transfer proposed doubling the capacity of the pipeline last year to meet growing demand for oil shipments from North Dakota, without the need for additional pipelines or rail shipments. Commissioner Brian Kroshus said Wednesday that he believes the project would help take oil trucks off the road, reducing traffic fatalities.

Topeka: The Legislature's auditing division says state agencies have significant information technology security weaknesses and haven't made progress since previous reports showed the same problems. More than half of 19 state agencies studied failed to comply with IT security practices that protect sensitive information against data loss or theft. The findings were presented to the Legislative Post Audit Committee in an executive session and published online. The audit division studied IT functions at agencies from January 2017 to December 2019. Most agencies failed to scan and patch computers to keep them secure. They didn't have adequate response plans and didn't encrypt, back up or destroy electronic data. The report blamed a lack of management attention and inadequate resources for the failures.
Portland: Maine home sales surged at the end of 2019, which was a record-breaking year for real estate in the state. The Pine Tree State set records for sales volume and median sales price, the Portland Press Herald reports. Home buyers finished strong at the end of the year, as December sales increased 23% compared with the same month the previous year. Total sales for 2019 reached 18,140 homes, which was a 1.5% increase from the previous year, according to the Maine Association of Realtors. The median sales price increase 4.7% from the previous record of $215,000 to $225,000, the association said. One of the factors helping spur the increase in price is a lack of inventory in Maine. Houses also aren't staying on the market very long.

Little Rock: The state Supreme Court on Thursday said it won't reconsider its ruling rejecting a death row inmate's request for new DNA testing of evidence that his attorneys say could exonerate him. In a 5-2 decision, justices rejected Stacey Johnson's petition for rehearing over the court's decision last year that he wasn't entitled to the additional testing of evidence from the 1993 killing of Carol Heath. Johnson was one of eight inmates Arkansas sought to execute over an 11-day period in 2017 before its supply of a lethal injection drug expired. Johnson and three other inmates were spared by the courts, and Arkansas ultimately put the other four men to death. Arkansas doesn't have any executions scheduled, but Attorney General Leslie Rutledge in December said the court's ruling cleared the way for Johnson's. Arkansas doesn't currently have any execution drugs.

While these were the early effects of redefinition, the more profound consequences will be to marriage itself. Law shapes culture; culture shapes beliefs; beliefs shape action. The law now effectively teaches that mothers and fathers are replaceable, that marriage is simply about consenting adult relationships, of whatever formation the parties happen to prefer. This undermines the truth that children deserve a mother and a father — one of each.

Pyramid Lake: State wildlife officials and the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe teamed up last week to release 20 bighorn sheep into the hills above the desert lake on tribal land in an effort to reintroduce the species to part of its native habitat for the first time in nearly a century.

Past the crowds, they hoofed it through the rocky hills jutting out above the picturesque waters of Pyramid Lake, some 50 miles north of Reno, at a frenetic pace as the sun set behind the snow-capped mountains. It marked the first time since the early 1900s that the species has been spotted on the range there. As part of a reintroduction program several years in the works, the Nevada Department of Wildlife captured the animals earlier in the day in the Sheep Creek Range near Battle Mountain.

Lansing: Some state lawmakers believe the federal government should open Isle Royale National Park to moose hunters. MLive.com reports the House Natural Resources Committee heard testimony last week on a resolution supporting a limited moose hunt on the Lake Superior island. A vote could come at the next meeting. There could be more than 2,000 moose on Isle Royale. Wolves are the main predator, but the wolf population is struggling. You can continue to establish that wolf pack, but why not do a moose hunt in the meantime to help cull the herd down to help manage that population, so you don't destroy the vegetation on the island, said Rep. Steven Johnson, a Wayland Republican. Any hunt would be up to the National Park Service. A 2018 report dismissed the idea, MLive reports. The park is accessible only by boat or seaplane.

► 2016: Scandal-plagued Ala. governor faces new impeachment articles
Portland: The state's smelts, a small fish beloved by ice fishermen, appear to be continuing a rebound in population after years of decline. Rainbow smelts come to shallow freshwater streams to spawn every spring, making them a popular target of ice fishermen in the winter. Ice fishing shacks on frozen rivers are a common sight in some Maine towns, where fishermen sit for hours in the hopes of catching the fish and eating them fried and with the head on. But the health of the fish's population is in question, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration listed it as a federal species of concern in 2004. The Maine Department of Marine Resources has described the reasons for the decline as not well understood. Loss of habitat is one possibility. Maine made it more difficult to fish for the smelts about five years ago with new restrictions, and recent years have shown positive signs.

Birmingham: Months of headaches for daily commuters, long-haul drivers and downtown businesses have come to an end with the reopening of Interstate 59/20 through the city. Workers have virtually completed finishing touches like yellow striping and installing signs on a mile-long section of the highway that was demolished and rebuilt after the old road was shut down about a year ago. The project forced east-west traffic to take alternate routes through Birmingham. Officials opened the westbound lanes Friday night after a ribbon-cutting ceremony, and both sides were open by Sunday night. The land beneath the elevated road will be used for community spaces including parks and food truck parking in what planners hope will be a way to tie together the north and south sides of the city, where a new outdoor football stadium is being built near I-59/20.

Omaha: The mayor wants voters to decide whether they're willing to raise their property taxes to fund a long-term plan for improving city streets – often the objects of residents' wrath and complaints. Mayor Jean Stothert announced Thursday that she will ask the City Council to put a $200 million bond issue on the May 12 ballot. It would cost owners $35 more a year in property taxes for every $100,000 in valuation. We can stop the deterioration of our infrastructure, Stothert said. But it will take all of us to agree that it's worth the expense. The city spends $41 million a year on street repairs, she said, but needs to be spending at least $75 million a year. The $200 million in bond funding would cover only part of what's needed, and Omaha would need a series of voter-approved bond issues to keep the initiative going, Stothert said. Councilman Pete Festersen said he thinks the street repairs need to be part of a comprehensive plan that improves public transit and bike and pedestrian infrastructure.

Pierre: Legislation to prevent the spread of zebra mussels is headed for the state Senate after it received unanimous approval from the Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee on Tuesday. The bill, which has already passed the House, requires people to decontaminate their boats by cleaning and draining them after leaving the water. It also creates inspection stations. Senators were told the invasive species has now been found in four South Dakota lakes. Zebra mussels can cause a foul taste and smell in drinking water, increase algae and alter aquatic food chains. The widespread invasive species wasn't found in South Dakota until 2016, when the zebra mussels were discovered in Lewis and Clark Lake and McCook Lake. It was found to have spread to Sharpe and Francis Case lakes last year.

Pierre: Gov. Kristi Noem says she has concerns about a bill in the House that would make it illegal for physicians to administer gender-change treatments to children under 16. But she declined Friday to offer full support or disapproval. The bill would allow for physicians who perform surgeries, administer hormone therapy or prescribe puberty-blocking medication to minors to be prosecuted with a misdemeanor.

When you take public policy and try to fill parenting gaps with more government, you have to be very careful about the precedent you're setting, Noem told reporters. Democrats and LGBT activists say the bill targets transgender children and could lead to an increase in suicides. Supporters, including many Republicans in the House, say the bill would prevent children from receiving ideologically motivated treatment that harms them.
Raleigh: The state's online archival military collection now includes installation camp newsletters and newspapers that contain little-known information about life in the state during World War II. The collection is available as part of a two-year digitization project that the State Archives of North Carolina began in 2018 to commemorate the 75th anniversary of WWII. The project includes newsletter issues from installations such as Camp Lejeune, Camp Davis, Morris Field and Elizabeth City Naval Air Station. People have been able to use the newsletters for research since 1947, but they had to do that at the State Archives rather than online. State officials say the newsletters provide important information, including names of individuals in military units, civilian workers in various departments on base, female civilian and military personnel working at the installations, and news of casualties of people formerly stationed at those bases.

Same-sex couples can marry in every state in our country, yet many of us still live in fear that we might be fired from our jobs or lose our homes. This is not just about Bev and me — it's about all LGBT people. While Bev and I plan to continue our legal battle against Friendship Village, it is critical that we push for state and federal laws expressly protecting LGBT people from discrimination so others won't need to go through what we did. No one should be denied the opportunity for housing because of who they are or whom they love.
