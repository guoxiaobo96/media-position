montpelier: the state senate approved a paid family leave bill by enough votes to override a potential veto by gov. phil scott. the legislation was approved by a vote of 20-9 in the senate on friday and is now headed to the house. the bill provides up to 12 weeks of paid leave for the birth of a newborn or an adoption. people caring for an ailing loved one would be eligible for eight weeks of benefits. the average vermont resident will receive 70% of their pay during their leave depending on how much money they make. the bill would use a 0.2% payroll tax on most workers in the state to fund the paid leave benefit. it's unclear how scott feels about the bill, but he has said he prefers a voluntary paid leave program that workers could opt into.
if we are honest about what's really going on here, it's not about ensuring that same-sex couples in philadelphia have the opportunity to be foster parents, alito said, noting no same-sex couples had asked the catholic group for certification – they had gone elsewhere. it's the fact that the city can't stand the message that catholic social services and the archdiocese are sending by continuing to adhere to the old-fashioned view about marriage. isn't that the case?

richmond: with a newly empowered democratic majority at the general assembly, abortion-rights advocates say the state has a chance to roll back decades of restrictions and become a safe haven for women in neighboring conservative states. abortion-rights groups laid out their legislative priorities last week, emphasizing a measure to undo republican-backed laws including a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion, as well a requirement that women seeking an abortion undergo an ultrasound and counseling. a senate committee passed that bill thursday morning, a day after a house committee advanced that chamber's version. the bills, which are part of democratic gov. ralph northam's legislative agenda, would also roll back the requirement that an abortion be provided by a physician, allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to perform them, and undo strict building code requirements on facilities where abortions are performed.

new york: animal rights advocates have lost a bid to get a bronx zoo elephant declared to have human-like rights and transferred to a sanctuary, though a judge said the case for sending the pachyderm to a sanctuary was extremely persuasive. bronx judge alison tuitt on tuesday dismissed the nonhuman rights project's petition arguing that happy the elephant is unlawfully imprisoned at the zoo where she has lived since 1977. she has been kept separate from other elephants for more than a decade. new york courts have previously said animals aren't legally considered persons, and tuitt said those rulings applied to happy, too. but the judge said she was extremely sympathetic to happy's plight. this court agrees that happy is more than just a legal thing, or property. she is an intelligent, autonomous being who should be treated with respect and dignity, and who may be entitled to liberty, the judge wrote, calling the arguments for transferring happy from her lonely exhibit to a sprawling elephant sanctuary extremely persuasive.

des moines: the state's industries recovered from the great recession at a rate less than half that of the national average, according to a new iowa state university paper. from 2007 to 2018, the state added about 92,000 jobs. but economist dave swenson says iowa would have added many more jobs if industries here grew at the same rate they did in the rest of the country. iowa also would have added more jobs if its mix of businesses were closer to the national average. we're simply losing ground, he said. our competitiveness is waning. swenson's paper measures how iowa's recovery from the great recession compares to other states. he said iowa's industrial mix has been a drag on expansion, as the state relies heavily on industries where job growth is either growing slowly or shrinking, such as agriculture and manufacturing.

denver: a proposal to rewrite the state's rules for workplace harassment claims is expected to be introduced soon at the capitol. it would change things for employers by limiting the use of confidentiality agreements in court and would potentially make businesses liable even if a person doesn't come forward internally before filing a lawsuit. the bill would also change things for employees by allowing independent contractors, subcontractors and unpaid interns to file harassment claims, colorado public radio reports. all employees would be given two years to file a complaint, up from six months now. with the gig economy that we have these days, more and more people don't have regular jobs in the traditional sense, said one of the bill's main sponsors, rep. susan lontine, d-denver. and so they don't have any way to address when they've been harmed by harassment.

it also undercuts any reasonable justification for marital norms. after all, if marriage is about romantic connection, why require monogamy? there's nothing magical about the number two, as defenders of polyamory point out. if marriage isn't a conjugal union uniting a man and a woman as one flesh, why should it involve or imply sexual exclusivity? if it isn't a comprehensive union inherently ordered to childbearing and rearing, why should it be pledged to permanence?

the clearest use of this phrase actually derives from mahatma gandhi in his 1929 autobiography: hate the sin and not the sinner. but gandhi's full statement has a bit different flavor: hate the sin and not the sinner is a precept which, though easy enough to understand, is rarely practiced, and that is why the poison of hatred spreads in the world. gandhi rightly observed that it is difficult — perhaps impossible — to see someone else firstly as a sinner and to focus on hating their sin without developing some level of disdain for the person. perhaps this is why jesus did not ask us to love sinners but to love neighbors and enemies.

but midway through the decade, backlashes also started to sprout. some targeted transgender people's rights. many took the form of religious exemption laws that let people, churches and sometimes businesses cite religious beliefs as a reason not to enforce a law, such as declining to marry a same-sex couple or letting state-funded foster agencies refuse to place kids with lgbtq parents.

oklahoma city: a state house committee overwhelmingly rejected a bill thursday to repeal a new law that allows most adults to carry firearms without a background check or training. despite the 11-1 vote against his bill by the house public safety committee, rep. jason lowe, an oklahoma city democrat, vowed to continue fighting the law with a signature-gathering effort to put a question on the ballot to repeal it. i believe this law is absolutely dangerous, lowe said. it's a ticking time bomb, and it's been an absolute disaster. dubbed permitless carry by its opponents, the new law allows most adults to carry firearms, concealed or openly, without a license. it was the first measure signed into law by republican gov. kevin stitt and took effect in november. oklahoma's republican-led legislature has embraced numerous bills that expand gun rights in the state. the committee on thursday approved a bill to expand the state's stand your ground law. last week, the senate approved a bill that would allow more public school teachers to carry firearms in their classrooms.

harrisburg: as many of the state's counties adopt new hand-marked ballot voting systems, a persistent criticism is a perceived loss of privacy in polling places when filling them out and scanning them. the criticism, raised again wednesday by state lawmakers, has emerged repeatedly ahead of the presidential elections, after a two-year push by gov. tom wolf to get counties to switch to paper-based voting systems as an election security bulwark against hacking. some lawmakers say they have heard from unhappy voters accustomed to electronic touchscreen voting machines that, in the past, had been screened off or arranged to allow voters to make selections unseen. now, other voters or poll workers may be able to see how someone voted while they are filling out their ballot or while they feed their ballot into an electronic scanner that reads it. i think we're disenfranchising so many voters who don't like the new system, rep. doyle heffley, r-carbon, told top state election officials at an appropriations committee hearing wednesday. it's not a secret ballot. other people can see how they vote.

►common ground works as a message, even in, and perhaps especially because of, these polarized times. jones' willingness to cross the aisle was an integral part of his message from the beginning of the campaign and became a constant in our advertising. our polling showed that jones won two in five voters who had favored luther strange (the establishment choice) in the september gop runoff, and jones also won independents by nearly 10 points on election day. the truth is that the actions of president trump and his gop majority in congress have made them vulnerable to the charge that they are unwilling to compromise — thus failing to achieve any progress on health care and other key issues. in contrast with jones' strengths, by election eve, 49% of alabamians felt that moore would make things worse in washington.

san francisco: the western monarch butterfly population wintering along the state's coast remains critically low for the second year in a row, according to an environmental group. the count of the orange-and-black insects by the xerces society, a nonprofit environmental organization that focuses on the conservation of invertebrates, recorded about 29,000 butterflies in its annual survey. that's not much different from last year's tally, when an all-time-low 27,000 monarchs were counted. by comparison, about 4.5 million monarch butterflies wintered in forested groves along the california coast in the 1980s. scientists say the butterflies are at critically low levels in the western united states due to the destruction of their milkweed habitat along their migratory route as housing expands into their territory and use of pesticides and herbicides increases. researchers also have noted the effect of climate change.
the president of the united states sets the tone for the country and i think trump's discrimination made it less safe but it made us braver as a country in some ways, nicodemo said. what happened in the last four years for the country was a social justice movement that actually got us somewhere now as a country we've never been before – ready for serious change. we don't have an out athlete in the nba, the nfl, the mlb or the nhl. it's hard to imagine that will stay the same with our country being more welcoming at the top.

annapolis: the state would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2030, under an ambitious measure outlined wednesday as the coastal state grapples with increasing concerns about sea-level rise. the legislation would increase the state's current goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 40%, based on 2006 levels. it also would set the state on a path toward achieving net-zero statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. supporters of the climate solutions act of 2020 say maryland, which has about 3,100 miles of tidal shoreline, must be a leader in addressing rising sea levels. environmentalists say the measure is the the most comprehensive approach to addressing greenhouse gas emissions before lawmakers this session in a legislature controlled by democrats. the measure's goals include planting 1 million trees a year in the state for a decade. it also calls for requiring new commercial buildings with 25,000 square feet of rooftop to use solar panels.

nationwide, the people who open marijuana stores in newly legal states have a significant advantage over late-comers, especially as multi-state operators have begun consolidating independent stores and squeezing down the margins. because consolidation favors deep-pocketed investors, and because previous equity efforts were tentative at best, the cannabis industry nationally remains largely white and wealthy. new york's legislation aims to help correct that.

of course, complicating all of this is your future spouse's french pension. the receipt of a public pension based on work that was not covered under social security triggers the application of the windfall elimination provision (wep), the government pension offset (gpo) or both, says czarnowski. because (your) future spouse has no social security earnings, wep does not apply. however, gpo does apply, and the social security administration will be required to reduce any spousal or survivor benefit due him by 2/3 of the amount of his pension. thus, while he may meet the eligibility requirements after you have been married for a year, he may not end up actually receiving anything, depending on the amount of his french pension.

providence: a state representative is pushing for a bill that would allow school districts to raise money for extracurricular activities, including field trips and dances. rep. joseph mcnamara, a warwick democrat, said many school districts canceled field trips last year after the state's former education commissioner established a policy stating that school departments may not charge students to participate in public school field trips. schools interpreted that to mean no fundraising could be done either, mcnamara said. the bill he recently introduced would add a provision to state law to say that school districts are not prohibited from requesting money from students, their parents or legal guardians to help pay for school-sponsored field trips, dances, clubs and other activities, provided the district pay the costs to meet any deficit.

portland: lobsters have long delighted tourists as the state's most beloved seafood. but one company thinks the crustaceans can save human lives by providing their blood for use in new drugs. the company working on the lobster blood project, lobster unlimited of orono, is investigating whether lobster blood can be used as a potential weapon against viruses and cancer. representatives with the company said results are promising – the u.s. patent and trademark office issued them a patent in late october related to their work. the blood is easy to come by because it's a byproduct of lobster processing, company head robert bayer said. lobster blood is likely a long way from playing a role in new drugs, bayer said, but there's no question it has antiviral and anticancer properties based on research needed to apply for the patent. right now, this blood is literally thrown out on the floor and goes down the drain, said bayer, a professor emeritus of animal and veterinary sciences at university of maine.

then, in 2012, obama evolved, and the supreme court took cases involving marriage law. nothing in the constitution answered the actual question at hand: what is marriage? the court should have left the issue to the people. but in 2013, it struck down the federal definition of marriage as a male-female union in a 5-4 ruling.

helena: members of the state house of representatives and legislative staffers have evaluated two chair designs to replace the seating that has been used by lawmakers for more than a century. we need to do this right because these chairs may be around another 100 years, house speaker greg hertz, r-polson, said thursday, adding that the chairs should fit the historic atmosphere of the house. lawmakers set aside $200,000 to purchase 106 wooden chairs for the house along with furniture for the senate. the current chairs in the house are uncomfortable, unstable and have broken on occasion, sending a lawmaker tumbling to the floor. the designs reviewed thursday included a rounded-back chair from appleton furniture of helena and a high-backed chair manufactured by montana correctional enterprises at the prison in deer lodge. appleton furniture's design came out ahead in thursday's scoring.

isle of palms: the owner of an island home is suing airbnb, claiming it only reimbursed him for a fraction of the damages that a guest who threw a big party did to his home. in a federal lawsuit filed this week, scott shaw said the party left his home smelling of a mixture of marijuana, cigarettes, beer and vomit. blood and vomit were found on the walls, towels and bedding, the lawsuit states. shaw says he believes he is owed about $150,000 in both property and punitive damages. he did not say what the company paid him. he said airbnb claims in its marketing materials that it guarantees up to $1 million reimbursement for property damage. airbnb's 'host guarantee' is nothing close to any type of 'guarantee' and in fact it is false, misleading and deceptive, the lawsuit says. the company says it plans to vigorously defend against these allegations. shaw says aside from the smell, the guests also left holes in the walls and broke a staircase railing, door and countertop, among other things.
for critics, however, federal legalization remains unlikely for the foreseeable future. anti-legalization campaigner kevin sabet of the group smart approaches to marijuana helped coordinate opposition to the new york plan last year in part by arguing that while most americans want to see penalties for marijuana use eliminated, creating cannabis stores remains unpopular in many places. he said his group hopes to play the same role this year, although cuomo appears more engaged this time around.

lincoln: a state senator who is pushing the legislature's main bill to lower property taxes says she hopes to reach a deal with opponents who are trying to derail it out of concern that it could hurt the state's k-12 public schools. sen. lou ann linehan, of omaha, said thursday that she and other senators will try to find an agreement with school officials who are lobbying against the measure. the bill has won support from farm and business groups and gov. pete ricketts because it would lower taxes that have risen over the past decade. but school administrators, school boards and the state teachers' union argue it would hinder their long-term spending flexibility. this bill is bad for nebraska, and it's bad for our kids, said sen. wendy deboer, of bennington, who opposed the measure. the bill would boost state aid to schools by about $520 million over three years and redistribute it so that smaller, rural schools get a larger increase.

lawmakers in new york last year failed to agree on the legalization plan's specifics to aid minority communities — provisions known as equity — and it ultimately died after also facing strong opposition from lawmakers outside new york city, particularly those from conservative areas. while cuomo wanted a new office controlled by his administration to decide how to aid minority communities, some african american legislators insisted that the specifics be set out in the law itself.

baton rouge: a month after delaying a decision, the state's higher education policy-making board voted wednesday to bolster its minimum admission standards for public universities by adding the threat of financial penalties for campuses that disobey the requirements. the board of regents approved the adjustments to the state's existing, 15-year-old admissions standards without objection, after weeks of behind-the-scenes negotiations to get board members comfortable with the changes. most of the rewrites were modest. but the penalty provisions represent the first real effort to force compliance with the policy. the board has never penalized schools for not complying with admissions criteria. still, financial penalties won't be automatic for campuses that violate the admissions criteria, and the threat of reduced funding doesn't come unless a school has breached the policy for two consecutive years.

little rock: the state supreme court on thursday said it won't reconsider its ruling rejecting a death row inmate's request for new dna testing of evidence that his attorneys say could exonerate him. in a 5-2 decision, justices rejected stacey johnson's petition for rehearing over the court's decision last year that he wasn't entitled to the additional testing of evidence from the 1993 killing of carol heath. johnson was one of eight inmates arkansas sought to execute over an 11-day period in 2017 before its supply of a lethal injection drug expired. johnson and three other inmates were spared by the courts, and arkansas ultimately put the other four men to death. arkansas doesn't have any executions scheduled, but attorney general leslie rutledge in december said the court's ruling cleared the way for johnson's. arkansas doesn't currently have any execution drugs.

portland: the state's smelts, a small fish beloved by ice fishermen, appear to be continuing a rebound in population after years of decline. rainbow smelts come to shallow freshwater streams to spawn every spring, making them a popular target of ice fishermen in the winter. ice fishing shacks on frozen rivers are a common sight in some maine towns, where fishermen sit for hours in the hopes of catching the fish and eating them fried and with the head on. but the health of the fish's population is in question, as the national oceanic and atmospheric administration listed it as a federal species of concern in 2004. the maine department of marine resources has described the reasons for the decline as not well understood. loss of habitat is one possibility. maine made it more difficult to fish for the smelts about five years ago with new restrictions, and recent years have shown positive signs.

omaha: the mayor wants voters to decide whether they're willing to raise their property taxes to fund a long-term plan for improving city streets – often the objects of residents' wrath and complaints. mayor jean stothert announced thursday that she will ask the city council to put a $200 million bond issue on the may 12 ballot. it would cost owners $35 more a year in property taxes for every $100,000 in valuation. we can stop the deterioration of our infrastructure, stothert said. but it will take all of us to agree that it's worth the expense. the city spends $41 million a year on street repairs, she said, but needs to be spending at least $75 million a year. the $200 million in bond funding would cover only part of what's needed, and omaha would need a series of voter-approved bond issues to keep the initiative going, stothert said. councilman pete festersen said he thinks the street repairs need to be part of a comprehensive plan that improves public transit and bike and pedestrian infrastructure.
