omaha: the mayor wants voters to decide whether they're willing to raise their property taxes to fund a long-term plan for improving city streets – often the objects of residents' wrath and complaints. mayor jean stothert announced thursday that she will ask the city council to put a $200 million bond issue on the may 12 ballot. it would cost owners $35 more a year in property taxes for every $100,000 in valuation. we can stop the deterioration of our infrastructure, stothert said. but it will take all of us to agree that it's worth the expense. the city spends $41 million a year on street repairs, she said, but needs to be spending at least $75 million a year. the $200 million in bond funding would cover only part of what's needed, and omaha would need a series of voter-approved bond issues to keep the initiative going, stothert said. councilman pete festersen said he thinks the street repairs need to be part of a comprehensive plan that improves public transit and bike and pedestrian infrastructure.

why he could stay: teams may be cautious to pursue hanzal because of his injury history. he has been mostly healthy this season but has yet to log a complete season with his back giving him trouble before he had surgery on it in 2015. it's unclear if the coyotes' asking price could be met; a package that revolves around a first-rounder may be tough to receive for a perceived rental. there could also be a case made for retaining hanzal and trying to negotiate an extension to avoid a gaping hole at the top of their depth chart. the team has learned firsthand this season the value of experienced centers and how there's no set timeline for when a young player will be ready for the nhl. keeping hanzal would ensure the coyotes have support in place while their youth matures.

salisbury: as rising seas drive saltwater farther inland, state officials are urging local governments, drinking water suppliers, farmers and others to start preparing now for a saltier future. gov. larry hogan's administration in december released the state's first plan to combat saltwater intrusion. the 76-page report doesn't forecast how widely impacts will be felt, citing a lack of existing research, but it identifies the resources facing the highest risk, ranking agriculture at the top. wetlands, coastal forests, freshwater streams and aquifers also are in danger of turning salty, according to the report. melting ice at the poles and the ocean's thermal expansion – both triggered by climate change – are causing seas to rise across the globe, carrying salt into new places above and below ground. saltwater intrusion is of even greater concern in the chesapeake bay region, climate scientists say, because the area's land surface is sinking.

birmingham: the city will pay a $25,000 fine for obstructing the view of a confederate monument, a judge ordered last week under the direction of the state supreme court. circuit judge marshell jackson hatcher imposed the fine that had been ordered by the state's high court. justices in november ruled that birmingham violated a state law protecting historic monuments and directed the circuit judge to enter an order declaring that birmingham violated the 2017 alabama memorial preservation act and to fine the city $25,000. alabama sued birmingham in 2017 after municipal officials in the majority-black city erected a wooden box obscuring the inscriptions on a 52-foot-tall obelisk honoring confederate veterans. the 2017 alabama memorial preservation act prohibits relocating, removing, altering or renaming public buildings, streets and memorials that have been standing for more than 40 years.

lawrence: the university of kansas will close its school of languages, literatures and cultures, but departments within the school will remain open, and students will not be affected, according to a school official. the closing at the end of the academic year will change only the administrative structure for languages at kansas, said john colombo, interim dean of the college of liberal arts and sciences. the degree offerings and curriculum will not be affected, he said. budget problems prompted the closing, the lawrence journal-world reports. one staff position will be lost because of the closing. the director and co-director of the school will return to their respective positions within their academic units, colombo said in an email. the creation of the school about five years ago did not increase enrollment for language departments or raise substantial private support to sustain the language programs as anticipated, he said.

boise: a bill that would reduce the number of people required to report suspected child abuse narrowly won approval from a panel of state lawmakers. the house judiciary and rules committee approved the bill 9-8, the times-news reports. currently, anyone in the state who sees evidence of child abuse, abandonment or neglect is required to report that evidence to law enforcement, and those who don't can be charged with a misdemeanor. the legislation approved wednesday would remove that requirement for most residents, leaving only teachers, doctors, law enforcement officials and social workers as mandatory reporters. rep. heather scott, r-blanchard, says unfounded child abuse claims cost taxpayers money. but rep. john mccrostie, d-boise, and rep. linda hartgen, r-twin falls, both opposed the legislation, saying it could lead to underreporting of child abuse, causing real harm to idaho kids. the bill now heads to the full house.

taxslayer classic taxslayer asks for the basic information you would expect from a tax-filing service. early on, you're asked if you received your stimulus payment to determine recovery rebate credit eligibility. one gripe while filing taxes for our fictitious personas: the software plan would sometimes change tiers, and there wasn't a way to start over or change the plan back. cost: taxslayer's simply free version supports w-2 income and unemployment income, and similar to h&r block, it also allows for student loan interest and education expenses. the classic plan—$17 at the time of publishing, plus additional fees for state filings—might offer a higher return for people with dependents who want to maximize deductions, as you get access to all deduction and tax credit forms. that said, you may be able to avoid this fee if you qualify for taxslayer's free file program. to qualify, your agi has to be $72,000 or less, and you have to be 51 years or younger. you can also qualify if you're eligible for the eitc or you're an active duty service member who has an agi of less than $72,000. email and phone support is included in each service plan, free or paid. however, upgrading to taxslayer premium ($37) will help you skip the line for phone and live chat support, and it gets you three years of irs audit assistance. the self-employed plan for people with 1099 income and business expenses costs $47.

biloxi: replicas of christopher columbus' nina and pinta have arrived along mississippi's gulf coast, sailing into a biloxi harbor as spectators aimed their phones out to the horizon. about a dozen spectators lined a pier wednesday as the ships arrived. christopher columbus sailed across the atlantic on the nina on his three voyages of discovery to the new world beginning in 1492. he was long celebrated in the u.s., but in recent years a reckoning has been held with the brutal aspects of his legacy. columbus' arrival brought violence, disease, enslavement, racism and exploitation to the native people. the original nina was last heard from in 1501, but this replica, finished in 1991, serves as a floating museum. it was built entirely by hand, without the use of power tools, and is considered the most historically accurate columbus ship replica ever built. the pinta replica was built in brazil and launched in 2005 to accompany the nina on travels. while in port, the ships will be open for public tours. they are scheduled to leave biloxi on march 2.

olympia: bills that would have limited how many rounds can be stored in gun magazines and what guns can be sold failed to make their way through the legislature. king-tv reports neither bill was approved before wednesday's 5 p.m. deadline. lawmakers knew earlier this month that the proposed ban on firearms defined as assault weapons did not have the votes to proceed. the high-capacity limit bill passed out of house and senate committees but never came up on the floor for debate. republicans opposed to the bill filed an unusually high number of amendments on the bill, meaning debate could last a day or more, according to democratic staffers. aberdeen republican rep. jim walsh, who submitted six amendments, was asked if the long list of amendments was a political ploy to prevent debate. that's part of it, said walsh. but it's also a very bad policy.

if you didn't know much about the jacksonville jaguars, atlanta falcons or tampa bay buccaneers, the places dirk koetter has served as offensive coordinator over the last few years, you'd probably assume that a dude named dirk, who was so coveted by the bucs that they pushed out lovie smith for him after just two years, would be a hotshot young coordinator like gase or someone else ranked high on this list. well, surprise! koetter is nine months younger than lovie smith (he'll be 57 when the season starts) which makes him about the same age as marvin lewis and mike smith and the 10th oldest coach in the nfl. now, as aalyiah taught us, age ain't nothin' but a number. and though bucs management isn't exactly the model for which nfl teams should strive, the fact that they really wanted koetter gives this some bonus points. unlike in philly, this wasn't a change for the sake of change.

seven years before he got his crack at one of the 32 head-coaching jobs in the nfl, the 35-year-old was a defensive backs coach in college. then he took the same job in the nfl, followed by a single season as a defensive coordinator before getting hired out of obscurity. that was mike tomlin, who has had great success (with one super bowl ring) in his nine years with pittsburgh. mcadoo's path is similar: now 38, he was a graduate assistant at pittsburgh (the college) just 13 years ago. then he had some quality control jobs until 2005 before serving as a tight ends coach for six years, then two seasons as a quarterbacks coach and two seasons as an offensive coordinator before getting his call. so, while tomlin's rise was more meteoric, he and mcadoo rode a similar path (minus the defense vs. offense thing). that, of course, means nothing — they're two different men. but give me a young up-and-comer over a retread or a guy who's been passed over for more jobs than your hippie uncle any day.

yarmouth: a massive elm tree nicknamed herbie is long gone, but it will live on, thanks to cloned trees being made available to the public. at 110 feet and more than 200 years, herbie was the tallest and oldest elm in new england and survived 14 bouts of dutch elm disease thanks to the devotion of his centenarian caretaker, frank knight, the late tree warden of yarmouth. the duo became famous after knight spent half of his life caring for the tree, which he referred to as an old friend. knight realized he couldn't save the town's elms as they succumbed by the hundreds to dutch elm disease. so he focused his efforts on herbie. over five decades, knight oversaw selective pruning of herbie's diseased limbs, plus applications of insecticides and fungicides. the tree was cut down jan. 19, 2010, as the 101-year-old knight looked on. knight died two years later. but before herbie was chopped down, the elm research institute in new hampshire worked with knight to collect some cuttings from herbie to preserve the tree's legacy with clones. the hope is that herbie's descendants will have some resistance to dutch elm disease.

underneath their touchy-feely talk of tolerance, they seek to undermine american culture. they argue that culture, society and politics have been defined - and presumably defiled - by white, male heterosexuals hostile to their way of life. for example, homosexuals want to redefine marriage and parenthood; feminists in women's studies programs want to replace so-called male rationality with more sensitive responses common to women. it may be kinder and gentler, but can you build a bridge with it?

langdon: a meeting house originally built in the early 1800s has been placed on the national register of historic places. the georgian-style langdon meeting house was a two-story space that served both town and church functions. in order to comply with new hampshire's toleration act of 1819, which called for physical and financial separation of religious and government public spaces, the town sold 10 feet at the west end of the building and the second-story gallery space to the universalist society of langdon in 1851. that year, a renovation partitioned the spaces and added a three-story greek revival steeple over the church entrance that included a belfry with louvered shutters and a 5-foot weathervane. langdon residents have held their annual town meeting on the first floor from 1803 to the present, the longest-running record in the country.

scott carried headset cords during his dad's stint as the head coach at south carolina from 1994-98, allowing him to listen and follow the decision-making process at every sideline huddle. that position also allowed scott to keep tabs on the opposing coaching staff, and he grew adept at tracking defensive signals: in a game against arkansas, for example, scott deciphered the razorbacks' blitz schemes by watching then-defensive coordinator joe lee dunn.

from the failed annals of don't fire for the sake of firing, we have the philadelphia eagles who, unhappy with all the power they bestowed upon chip kelly, were forced to fire a promising coach because, like a parent who gives a nine-year-old the keys to the car, then gets mad when the nine-year-old crashes, they couldn't take back that power and just let kelly what he does best. so what did jeffrey lurie have in mind when he sought out to find kelly's replacement? well, he had to, uh, be a football coach. and knowing the game was a definite plus. and, i guess just wanting to come to philadelphia to sign a contract was pretty much the main prerequisite. that's how you end up with the blergh hire of doug pederson, who was coaching in high school just eight years ago (the eagles love those quick-risers, don't they) and served as offensive coordinator under andy reid for the past three seasons in kansas city. and had never been interviewed by an nfl team. and was as nondescript as kelly was high profile. pederson might be perfectly fine, though i look at him and, i don't know why, just see a younger norv turner. inspiring! oh, pederson, who didn't call plays for kansas city, was reportedly calling plays during the chiefs' reid-esque drive against the patriots — the one that seemed to defy all conventions of space and time and felt like it lasted as long as the revenant.

charleston: foster parents may soon get more money for adopting children under a measure passed by the house of delegates this week aimed at alleviating the state's overburdened foster care system. delegates voted 96-1 to approve the bill, with republican del. pat mcgeehan as the lone no vote after he was told the measure would cost the state about $17 million. great emphasis has been placed on the projected cost of this bill, but we must acknowledge that this is an investment, an investment in west virginia children, said del. jason barrett, a berkeley county democrat. the proposal, sent to the senate, would give families at least $900 a month for each child adopted. child placing agencies would also get $1,000 every time they finalize an adoption. the bill also establishes a foster care bill of rights, which would ensure children and parents understand their rights in the state's foster system.

okay, first of all, let's have a semantical chat: this is not the 50th anniversary of the super bowl. this is the 50th super bowl. anniversaries start one year after an event while an event takes a full year to have its first anniversary. (it's why a baby is zero years old until they turn one, but since they lived that year zero, the moment they turn one actually begins the second year of their life. let's say a couple had been married on jan. 15, 1967, the day of the first super bowl. their 50th anniversary wouldn't have been until 2017, even though their 50th year of marriage would begin on jan. 16, 1967. so, while you're guaranteed to hear some misinformation about anniversaries this week, remember this is only the 49th for the super bowl. the reason the nfl is celebrating something everyone else would wait another year to celebrate is because the league rigidly stuck to the idiotic numbering of super bowls, meaning its hand was forced because you can't celebrate a 50th anything at super bowl li. it has to come at super bowl 50. that was a lot of words for one small plea: don't call this the 50th anniversary game, please.

atlanta: one of republican brian kemp's first acts as governor involved revamping the state's handling of sexual harassment complaints and placing state inspector general deborah wallace in charge of the issue. kemp now wants to expand wallace's office, adding $435,182 to fund five new positions in his proposed fiscal 2021 budget, according to the atlanta journal-constitution. kemp's budget proposal must be approved by lawmakers. the expansion, which would represent a 43% budget increase for the small agency, comes as other state agencies are being asked to trim their budgets amid a revenue shortfall. kemp also proposed an additional $250,000 in the current year's budget, as the agency already brought on new staff to handle complaints.

annapolis: the state would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2030, under an ambitious measure outlined wednesday as the coastal state grapples with increasing concerns about sea-level rise. the legislation would increase the state's current goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 40%, based on 2006 levels. it also would set the state on a path toward achieving net-zero statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. supporters of the climate solutions act of 2020 say maryland, which has about 3,100 miles of tidal shoreline, must be a leader in addressing rising sea levels. environmentalists say the measure is the the most comprehensive approach to addressing greenhouse gas emissions before lawmakers this session in a legislature controlled by democrats. the measure's goals include planting 1 million trees a year in the state for a decade. it also calls for requiring new commercial buildings with 25,000 square feet of rooftop to use solar panels.

the clearest use of this phrase actually derives from mahatma gandhi in his 1929 autobiography: hate the sin and not the sinner. but gandhi's full statement has a bit different flavor: hate the sin and not the sinner is a precept which, though easy enough to understand, is rarely practiced, and that is why the poison of hatred spreads in the world. gandhi rightly observed that it is difficult — perhaps impossible — to see someone else firstly as a sinner and to focus on hating their sin without developing some level of disdain for the person. perhaps this is why jesus did not ask us to love sinners but to love neighbors and enemies.
