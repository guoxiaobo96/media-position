The feeling of both loss and victimization is reflected in Pew Research Center surveys. In a 2019 poll, a majority of adults who identify with or lean toward the GOP said that religion is losing influence in American life and that this is a bad thing.

And an acquisition of Watt's caliber might mollify suddenly publicly disgruntled QB Russell Wilson, a University of Wisconsin product like Watt.

Remember the 2015 summer of divorce? Ben and Jen, Gwen and Gavin, Miss Piggy and Kermit. It was horrible. Apparently now it's the winter of reveals. Gwen Stefani talked to The New York Times in a story Thursday about the morning she found out her marriage to Gavin Rossdale was over. The gist: After the Grammys she went to eat Mexican with Adam Levine. The next day she woke up to her life being blown up by a story so juicy and shocking that she can't tell you about it but felt like she was going to die. In a made-for-Hollywood twist, Stefani is now dating Blake Shelton, who split with wife Miranda Lambert that same tragic summer. Her reveal follows Jennifer Garner's public comments a couple of weeks ago about her breakup with husband Ben Affleck. We had been separated for months before I ever heard about the nanny, the actress told Vanity Fair. As for Kermit and Miss Piggy, he said this month he's still in love with her. All is not lost.

But Biden's emphasis on social justice issues over social policy flashpoints like abortion mirrors an ongoing struggle in the Catholic Church between Pope Francis, with his pastoral approach, and the church's more conservative wing.

The tax-exempt group does not accept corporate money or donations from federal lobbyists and voluntarily discloses all contributions larger than $250 on its website. OFA has advocated for everything from Obama's push to overhaul the criminal-justice system to urging the Republican-controlled Senate to take action on his Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland.
Only one thing could rival the couple's dominance, says CNN royal commentator Victoria Arbiter, who grew up the daughter of a royal press secretary.
5. Magnolia Table by Joanna Gaines, Marah Stets
Dan Quayle praised Trump on the Today show Thursday, claiming he is more qualified to be president than Hillary Clinton because voters' main qualification is that a candidate not be qualified to be president. Makes sense, actually.
You're a successful fiftysomething author and former federal prosecutor with four kids, a quite famous husband (novelist Michael Chabon), and raging mood swings that therapy and the usual pharmaceuticals no longer blunt. What do you do?
Mary's relationship with her real sister, Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael), is fractious, leading to plenty of drama. There's some really great stuff between the sisters, especially late in the season, Dockery says.
According to a late medieval legend reprinted in the Acta, which was accompanied by Bollandist critique about its historical value, a Roman priest named Valentinus was arrested during the reign of Emperor Gothicus and put into the custody of an aristocrat named Asterius.
McPherson's and Allingham-Hawkins' skills meshed together well to create the testing panel for miscarriages.
Mendez was detained and turned over to the federal government after he was stopped in November for driving without a license.
The vaccine supply coming to San Francisco is limited, inconsistent, and unpredictable, making vaccine planning difficult, the city's COVID Command Center said, as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle.
The Stillbirth Project is an amazing, amazing resource in helping clinicians, hospitals and patients find out the causes of stillbirths. And as the director, McPherson has expanded the knowledge base regarding miscarriages and stillbirths, helping create large databases that hospitals can use as resources, and because she has the deep genetic knowledge that doctors who specialize in obstetrics and gynecology generally don't have.
DAN WOLKEN:Urban Meyer's 'character and leadership' con continues in Jacksonville
The 'Me Too' movement, as I understand it, deals with sexual assault, unwanted sexual advances, and demands for sex by a superior over a subordinate. This instance, setting aside the photo / blackmail allegations which may or may not be true or provable, seems to involve a consensual sexual affair, Hancock said in an email. Marital infidelity is tragic for those families involved and may require years to process before healing. The current situation does not, however, appear to me to be analogous with the kinds of offenses brought to light by the recent 'Me Too' movement.
McPherson has three decades worth of experience working with patients and she has a deep understanding of the genetic problems that cause pregnancy loss. One of the reasons McPherson specialized in genetics 30 years ago was because she foresaw how the study of the DNA could impact the future of medicine. Through her professional career, she has seen a science revolution in the field of genetics.

There are big changes coming, so even if you don't expect to see much of a change, it's still a worthwhile investment to consult a tax professional — whether that's a CPA or just a tax preparer. They may be able to spot problems with your filing or even help you get deductions you didn't know you qualified for.

For believers, relics of the martyrs signified the saints' continuing their invisible presence among communities of pious Christians. In 11th-century Brittany, for instance, one bishop used what was purported to be Valentine's head to halt fires, prevent epidemics and cure all sorts of illnesses, including demonic possession.
Oh, we're not here to weep for baseball. With industry revenues approaching $11 billion, nobody is going broke. With countless ways to access the game – via mobile apps, social media channels or even still through the magic of television – today's big leaguers can touch many more corners of the world than their predecessors.
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — Gov. Eric Greitens' affair was known to his political opponents more than a year ago, before he was elected. But despite the buzzing rumor mill, his infidelity wasn't in the public eye until last week.
David Schwimmer and wife Zoe Buckman are separating after six years of marriage.
There are some very wonderful people in that group, she warns Colton. Find them. Figure out who they are. Don't be distracted by shiny things, especially now.
Also last year, two Trump-nominated judges to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit voted to strike down local laws protecting LGBTQ minors from conversion therapy, a practice of attempting to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. The American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association have discredited the practice.
Doug and Nicke Stevenson gave them as much care as they possibly could.
AVONDALE, Ariz. -- Aside from recovering from a particularly nasty concussion and learning more about his craft from outside a race car, something else happened to Dale Earnhardt Jr. during his time away from work.
In TV, however, there are few worse sins than being uninvolving — and despite the best efforts of a strong cast, that's where The Path lands. Lives and happiness are at stake here, yet the dramatic stakes somehow linger between low and medium. Monaghan's Sarah is a blind zealot; Paul's Eddie is a liar who allows his wife to suffer under the belief that he has been unfaithful rather then admit he's questioning his faith. No matter how much these two lovely people love each other, this is not a marriage we're left crying out to see saved.
Knowing that our little girl was directly involved in the validation of the test that can help so many families is comforting, Gruber said. For many families, getting an answer is closure, relief, and allows for you to be at peace with the situation.
I said, 'Oh, my god, she's hot,'  Emhoff, 56, told Chasten Buttigieg in an interview last year that's recounted in the book.
Berman is not shy about her ambitions.
► Houston had never won a playoff game prior to Watt's arrival in 2011. But starting in his rookie season, when Watt returned an interception 29 yards for a touchdown to help beat the Bengals in the wild-card round, the Texans won four playoff games. However Watt, a man long driven to achieve glory on Super Sunday, has never even reached an AFC title game. He'll surely be looking for a team he believes can win now.
I definitely had that fantasy about being a figure skater when I was a young gay kid, said Darrow, who now works for the Cleveland Indians. I think most young gay boys did something of the sort. I think Adam is definitely easier to relate to on that front than somebody like a (football player) like I was.
From the time of Josh's arrest last year, I have done everything in my power to secure his freedom. I have enlisted help from the highest levels of government, including from secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has encouraged our diplomats on the ground to stand firm in their negotiations with Venezuelan authorities. I even raised the issue of Josh's captivity with President Trump, who not long after, enacted heavy sanctions on Venezuela and called on President Nicolas Maduro to set Josh free.
The last few months have been quite good for them — they realize they are not infallible, that they need to take advice and to make sensible choices, she says. No one can keep an upward trajectory forever... They're just going to have to step up in a bigger capacity at home, because people want to see them and the children more.

I can't support something that's going to delay the safe reopening of schools for our youngest kids, he said.
We were all in the same room as they were holding hands. Dad passed away to a song of Elvis, 'My Way,' which was another poignant moment for us. Even though we were not ready for them to go, they both went out on their own songs and on their own way, said Redden.
It is a double act that works, to the extent that the network has put them together at Super Bowl media day, the Academy Awards, the Kentucky Derby and the National Dog Show.
At stake: The unity of the Republican party, perhaps, should Trump become president and Ryan remain House speaker. The result: It's complicated.
Erivo was the lone woman of color nominated in a predominately white acting field that also snubbed Golden Globe winner Awkwafina (The Farewell), Screen Actors Guild nominee Jamie Foxx (Just Mercy) and Globe nominee Eddie Murphy (Dolemite Is My Name).
The closest thing to a favorite is director Sam Mendes' World War I thriller, about two British soldiers (George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman) racing to deliver orders in time to save 1,600 fellow military men. The film has had big wins at the Directors Guild Awards and Producers Guild Awards, the latter a strong predictor for the Oscars: The PGA honoree has gone on to win best picture 21 out of 30 times, including the past two years with The Shape of Water and Green Book. Also in its favor is a Golden Globe victory for best drama and an impressive box office, scoring $104 million with only a few weeks of nationwide release. One troublesome statistic remains: 1917 doesn't have an acting nomination, and only 11 films in Oscar history – most recently Slumdog Millionaire in 2009 – have won best picture without one.
I was so upset that I had to have a wedding. I was so (mad), she remembered. I went crying down the freakin' aisle getting married.
Someone will get themselves a whale of a quarterback, just turning 33 in a league where guys are playing beyond 40. And if you like Stafford, part of you might be happy if he gets to play, say, for Bill Belichick in New England, or with all those weapons in New Orleans, or with that young aggressive group in Washington.
Norman puts Dylan in a position where he has no choice. We hope there was a certain beauty to Norman having this final moment of clarity where he recognized he had no options that were better than this, says executive producer Carlton Cuse. He forces Dylan to do something, and that action is the final act in his tragedy.

The agency turned to Maheu, a private investigator in Los Angeles, to line up the dates, the CIA memo said. Maheu then contacted a prominent Los Angeles attorney and Hollywood figure whose name was redacted in the report.
Roman, the Times reported on Oct. 11, 1989, was born a dwarf but had grown to the height of 5 feet, 4 inches through thrice-weekly injections of a hormone derived from the pituitary glands of cadavers. A former attorney once called him a 'failed human experiment.'

Anderson made sure not to let Walker off the hook, pouring it on, even as Walker made his way back to his feet. He would take him right back down, dropping some more ground and pound. Walker was in survival mode, stumbling all over the place, until he was met with another big right hand, and the referee stopped the fight with Walker almost out on his feet.
The PreventionGenetic miscarriage panel is not just one simple test. It's a battery of tests that first scrutinizes for chromosome abnormalities (chromosomes are larger, and therefore easier to study). Then, if the cause isn't found, the tests go deeper into the DNA to scrutinize specific genes for problems, the most common first. In the past, all those tests were done individually. The PreventionGenetic procedure is unique because it uses one cohesive process and can find genetic disorders more efficiently.
That applies from the other direction, too, Dockery says. A lot of the time, Mary doesn't really care what other people think, especially the family. But it's important that she gets approval from Anna.
English audiences embraced the idea of February mating. Shakespeare's lovestruck Ophelia spoke of herself as Hamlet's Valentine.

Jeff Gordon: Alex Bowman should be first call if Hendrick needs a sub
Calling for smart gun safety laws, Harris would frequently bemoan the slaughter of babies, as she recalled seeing harrowing autopsy photographs of young people killed by guns, Morain writes. She took this approach while speaking at an event in downtown San Francisco in late 2016, only to stop mid-speech.
It's getting a little real, says Julie Bowen, whose Claire Dunphy is married to Phil (Ty Burrell) and the mother of three now-grown children. I don't like table reads to begin with. I hate them as a performative thing, because they make me very anxious. It's like doing a play. And so I thought I wouldn't care, that I'd be thrilled when we were done.
A team that took a quantum leap in 2020 under coach of the year Kevin Stefanski could use help on a defense that ranked 22nd against the pass. Imagine the damage Watt could do playing opposite All-Pro DE Myles Garrett and alongside disruptive DT Sheldon Richardson. And given the way the Browns' run-heavy offense can both milk and control the clock, Watt wouldn't find that he has to play nearly as many snaps.
What Ayelet Waldman did was break the law and secretly consume minuscule doses of LSD every third day for a month, monitoring and recording the changes in her moods, relationships and productivity.
They wouldn't make a ton of sense for Watt schematically or from a cap standpoint given Pittsburgh needs to shed about $32 million to be compliant by the time the new league year starts. But if a scenario arises for J.J. to join his brothers, OLB T.J. Watt and FB Derek Watt, in Pittsburgh with the reigning AFC North champions, is he going to say no?
There were over 100 people in our text chain when they were sick, said Pickering.

Gerwig scored a nomination for Little Women in adapted screenplay, a category that also features Joker, Irishman, Jojo Rabbit and The Two Popes. Up for original screenplay are Once Upon a Time, Parasite, 1917, Marriage Story and Rian Johnson's murder mystery Knives Out.
When we first started to realize there was something not right with our little girl, my first concern was if my husband and I were carriers for a disorder.

After a stirring first half, Prisoner treads into less affecting territory in its second, as Adams continues to wallow in pain while offering little insight into what may have actually transpired between them.

As the story goes, Asterius made the mistake of letting the preacher talk. Father Valentinus went on and on about Christ leading pagansout of the shadow of darkness and into the light of truth and salvation. Asterius made a bargain with Valentinus: If the Christian could cure Asterius's foster-daughter of blindness, he would convert. Valentinus put his hands over the girl's eyes and chanted:

Of course, whether Hogan or any Republican could launch a successful primary challenge is in doubt as long as Trump's cult of personality does not crack and approval of the president among Republicans hovers in the 80s. Even so, the fluidity of American politics and Trump's mounting troubles raise the possibility of the SS Trump sinking abruptly to the bottom of the sea.

But what to Biden is an advancing equity agenda grounded in his deep Catholic faith appears to some Christian conservatives as attacks on their own intensely held beliefs that will unravel the religious freedom protections championed by the Trump administration.

But what to Biden is an advancing equity agenda grounded in his deep Catholic faith appears to some Christian conservatives as attacks on their own intensely held beliefs that will unravel the religious freedom protections championed by the Trump administration. Those protections treated religious beliefs as paramount, even if they conflicted with another person's rights – to an abortion, to marry a person of the same sex, or to be transgender.
A: That's non-public at this point, but what I would say is that it is important that we reach out to brides in the market and let them know that David's is there for them and they can trust us. This business is built on trust, and they have to know that's part of the equation.
My mother was living in the moment, very strong, super sweet, probably the nicest person I ever met, said Pennie Pickering. She outlived her first two husbands, and was a caretaker for both husbands. She really had a reputation of being a caretaker. She always had children in her life. She has always been a mother or grandmother and is the favorite aunt to a lot family.
The need for a new genetic testing panel became obvious to McPherson when she became the director of the Wisconsin Stillbirth Service Program in 2009.

All this time at home is making us very aware of the dirt on our floors. Instead of your partner asking you for the millionth time to pick up the vacuum, get them a robot vacuum to do the dirty work. The Eufy RoboVac 11s is our favorite affordable robot vacuum because of its impressive dirt pickup and quiet operation, meaning it won't interrupt date night. The slim profile also makes it easier to reach every nook and cranny, and since it's reasonably priced, you can splurge a little on your loved one.

When you think this through, you know what you feel like saying to Stafford? Send us a postcard. We're not going anywhere.
Worse yet for the show's dramatic purposes, the belief system they're battling over is so indistinct that it barely exists. The cult emerges as a hazy, marijuana-drenched mix of dated clichés, kept vague, perhaps, to avoid offense to any particular group. We're meant to be moved by the power of faith rather than faith itself, but that's a fine line for a series that gives us too little of substance or interest to hang on to otherwise.

For context: LeBron James has 54 million Instagram followers; his 15-year-old son, Bronny, has more than double Trout's total, with 3.9 million. Trout may mean the world to baseball, a far more significant figure than, say, the Utah Jazz's Donovan Mitchell is to the NBA. Yet even Mitchell (2.7 million) enjoys a far healthier social media presence than Trout.

A marriage between Watt and a Western New York community saturated with Bills Mafia would surely be a happy (if brief) one. Buffalo, which finished one win shy of the Super Bowl last season, didn't have a player with more than five sacks on a middling defense. Watt's five sacks in 2020 were his fewest over a 16-game season. However, his 17 quarterback hits would have easily paced the Bills, who would have to make some cap room to accommodate him. Still, for a team that might only be a player or two away, Watt might just be one of those players.

We live in a time when the freedom of religion is under assault, then-Vice President Mike Pence told Liberty University graduates in 2019. During the Trump administration, Pence's strong faith-based views on abortion and homosexuality made him a target of Democratic criticism, including from those seeking the party's 2020 presidential nomination. Biden had to backtrack after being lambasted by progressives and LGBTQ activists for calling Pence a decent guy.

This is bad news on many fronts. First of all, with the story now out there, teams know the Lions are seeking to trade Stafford, and maybe even have to. So much for leverage. Plus, these days starting quarterbacks tend to fetch draft picks, and even if the Lions get a first rounder, unless it's Jacksonville's No. 1 pick and they take Trevor Lawrence, everything else is a crap shoot.
That tenet was echoed during his first days in office, when Biden signed orders to ensure fair treatment for marginalized groups on housing and other issues.

We've spent long hours rigorously testing candy bars and determined that Take 5 is the best candy in existence. Seriously, trying it changed my life and I have brought a bag of them to many movie dates (when those were still a thing) to spread the word of its pure perfection. But general heart-themed candy is always a good choice, too.

The PreventionGenetic miscarriage panel is not just one simple test. It's a battery of tests that first scrutinizes for chromosome abnormalities (chromosomes are larger, and therefore easier to study). Then, if the cause isn't found, the tests go deeper into the DNA to scrutinize specific genes for problems, the most common first. In the past, all those tests were done individually. The PreventionGenetic procedure is unique because it uses one cohesive process and can find genetic disorders more efficiently.
When you don't have equal rights, it trickles down to kids who think, 'My aunt's gay so she can't get married, or I'm weird because I feel the same way,' she said.

The measures, approved by Francis, focus on how the Holy See handles applications for sainthood, a lengthy process that involves examining claims made by supporters of a would-be saint.

Of course, with Trump's total domination of the GOP and the national conversation, Hogan and the others most frequently mentioned — such as Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former Ohio Gov. John Kasich — seem like guppies up against a shark. But that could change, and Hogan would be positioned well for a challenge.

I have a platform and I can open up a dialogue, but I also know that I'm just an actor. I'm just another person with an option no better than anyone else's opinion, she said. I don't overanalyze. I just write from the heart, post it and hope for the best.

Elected officials defend their use, saying nonprofits can move more nimbly than government agencies to advance civic initiatives and are less likely to draw the public's ire over using taxpayer funds for pet projects or quasi-political expenses, such as polling. Campaign-finance watchdogs, however, said they are just another way for unregulated money to seep into the political process and give big donors a back-door method to curry favor with decision makers.
Next week, Kamala Harris will make history as the first woman, Black person and South Asian American person inaugurated vice president of the United States.
Skill-wise, director Marc Abraham calls Hiddleston so facile it's infuriating. That means on-set instead of staying in character, the actor easily switched between dialects.

Because Harris, 56, and her family declined interviews for the book amid President-elect Joe Biden's campaign, Kamala's Way isn't particularly revelatory, dryly detailing her early days in the Alameda County district attorney's office in California, as well as the political allies and adversaries she encountered during her rise. Although meticulously reported, it occasionally reads like a slapdash Wikipedia page rather than a compelling narrative.

Quentin Tarantino's star-packed Tinseltown fable – one that intertwines the lives of a washed-up actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), his steely stuntman (Brad Pitt) and the Manson Family – has been a favorite among movie lovers ever since its summer release. Once Upon a Time won best comedy at the Golden Globes and best picture at the Critics' Choice Awards, it's a strong contender in the 10 Oscar categories where it's nominated (Pitt's pretty much a lock for supporting actor and Tarantino has a good shot at original screenplay), and the Academy Awards since their inception have always adored movies about Hollywood. This one has it right in the title.

Being true to who you are and not giving a (expletive) about what others think about you is an awesome and liberating thing whether you are gay or not, Rippon wrote on Twitter earlier this week. Sometimes we the gays need to be reminded more often but, LIKE, EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT, FOR REAL. JUST DO IT.
Rippon became the first openly gay U.S. figure skater to compete in the Olympics and the first out figure skater overall to medal as he aided Team USA's bronze medal finish at the free skate competition Monday.

Martin Scorsese's Netflix gangster epic came into Oscars like a heavyweight, but like A Star Is Born last year, is starting to look like an also-ran. The film, which tracks World War II veteran and Mob hitman Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) over multiple bloody decades, received widespread critical acclaim but has lost out on every major honor so far. Still, don't count out The Irishman yet: Crime dramas tend to do well at the Oscars (Scorsese's The Departed marked his first and only best picture in 2007), Netflix put a lot of horses behind its campaign, everyone involved is a Hollywood favorite – not only Scorsese and De Niro, but also supporting-actor nominees Al Pacino and Joe Pesci – and it could benefit from the preferential ballot if it's the second or third choice for a majority of voters.

Weir was having a tough time during Sochi, with his marriage to ex-husband Victor Voronov on the verge of collapse. Things got messy with accusations flying back and forth, the matter ending up in divorce court, Voronov lodging a defamation suit against Weir and even a dispute over a valuable Faberge egg — much of it played out through TMZ and the New York tabloids.
Mascola estimates that she can ascertain causes for about a third to half of the stillbirths in her patients. That leaves a significant number left in doubt. The PreventionGenetics panel can help determine hard-to-find causes in those cases, Mascola said.
I often describe labor relations as a marriage where you can't get a divorce. You have to find a way to work it out, she said. Collective bargaining requires a lot of patience and compromise and understanding the big picture. It's about winning the war, even if you lose some small battles.

Here are all the theatrics in today's For the Record, the politics newsletter from USA TODAY.
There are interesting questions here, including how we decide what we're willing to embrace (or at least accord grudging respect) as a religion and what we dismiss as a cult. And respect is the watchword here: While we're clearly meant to see worrisome aspects in Meyerism — led by the use of force to retain straying members — it's just as clear that we're not meant to mock its followers. There are, after all, worse sins in life than being painfully earnest.

Looking back to Sochi in particular, I was going through a divorce – it was awful, the most horrible time of my life as far as dealing with another human being, Weir said.

In 1959, Hussein had been Jordan's king for almost six years. He assumed the throne of the Hashemite kingdom in 1953 after his father, Talal, was forced to abdicate because of illness. At 17, Hussein had witnessed the assassination of his grandfather, King Abdullah I, in Jerusalem.
A marriage between Watt and a Western New York community saturated with Bills Mafia would surely be a happy (if brief) one. Buffalo, which finished one win shy of the Super Bowl last season, didn't have a player with more than five sacks on a middling defense. Watt's five sacks in 2020 were his fewest over a 16-game season. However, his 17 quarterback hits would have easily paced the Bills, who would have to make some cap room to accommodate him. Still, for a team that might only be a player or two away, Watt might just be one of those players.

► Houston had never won a playoff game prior to Watt's arrival in 2011. But starting in his rookie season, when Watt returned an interception 29 yards for a touchdown to help beat the Bengals in the wild-card round, the Texans won four playoff games.

He holds virtually all the Lions passing marks. From 2011 to 2019 he started every single game. He's played through all kinds of injuries. Put up big numbers. Made one Pro Bowl and led the Lions to three playoff games in three separate years. I know that sounds pathetic. But it's actually more than any previous Lions' starter in more than 50 years.

Biden is praised by Sister Simone Campbell, executive director of Network Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention about caring for all of God's creations. She's thrilled by Biden's efforts to expand health care coverage, address racism and reverse Trump's anti-immigration actions.
They are trying to preserve their family life, just as then-Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip, early in their marriage, were allowed to preserve their family life in the few years they had before she became queen, Smith says.
At least that's what Beth suspects is what caused the uproar that followed. Because she doesn't actually listen to his show.
Weir keeps most of his private life out of the commentary spiel but everything else is fair game, and you can confidently bet that the chatter with him and Lipinski won't be restricted to salchows and triple axels.
We pick up this week right where we left off with last week's to be continued cliffhanger: with Colton frustrated on the beach. Heather dubs the Onyeka/Nicole/Colton drama the moment of the century, because, sure, there's nothing more important going on in the world.

We've watched the nation move through the five stages of grief since Trump closed in on the GOP, from denial to anger and bargaining to depression. Now, one step remains: acceptance.

It's a given that if Kerber journeys to the final, win or lose, she retains the No. 1 status.
This is the real life. It's not just fantasy.
As a working mom, you're always trying to be conscious of 'where am I most needed?'  she said.
For me, it wasn't a great season, Williams said of 2016. I think for other people it would have been wonderful. It was what it was.
Yet even as Friends eventually climbed to No. 1, its audience dropped from that point onward, a harbinger of what all media would face in coming decades.
Thousands of people from around the globe flood Yosemite National Park each February for a chance to see the fleeting firefall phenomenon, where a trick of the sunlight appears to send molten lava down the eastern slope of El Capitan. The otherworldly vista can be seen only when conditions are perfect for about 10 minutes at sunset mid-February. Head on over to the Visalia Times Delta to see what park visitors thought of the experience Tuesday.
The report by Lambda Legal – which analyzed publicly available records on Trump's nominees, including statements and writings they've done as private individuals – singled out several appeals court judges who, the authors say, have already issued rulings hostile to LGBTQ rights.
I hope there will be a day when lawmakers' paternity leave is no longer news, he said.
I Saw the Light, which received shaky reviews at its debut at the Toronto Film Festival, despite applause for Hiddleston's performance, charts the genesis of those songs, while folding in Williams' tumultuous marriage to Audrey Williams (Elizabeth Olsen), his unreliability and the ultimately fatal mix of alcohol and drugs he used in part to control chronic pain caused by spina bifida.
The BlueBird singer, 37, said on Instagram Thursday the couple cut their road trip short and made it safely back to Nashville after they were side swiped near Atlanta.
Late Monday, lawyers Charleston Wang and Nazly Mamedova completed an emergency application for a stay of removal that says irreparable harm will befall a 6-year-old paraplegic boy named Ricky Solis. The son of Mendez's wife, Sanda Mendoza, is now legally related to Mendez as his stepfather.
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — Gov. Eric Greitens' affair was known to his political opponents more than a year ago, before he was elected. But despite the buzzing rumor mill, his infidelity wasn't in the public eye until last week.
89. The Midnight Line by Lee Child
The 'Me Too' movement, as I understand it, deals with sexual assault, unwanted sexual advances, and demands for sex by a superior over a subordinate. This instance, setting aside the photo / blackmail allegations which may or may not be true or provable, seems to involve a consensual sexual affair, Hancock said in an email. Marital infidelity is tragic for those families involved and may require years to process before healing. The current situation does not, however, appear to me to be analogous with the kinds of offenses brought to light by the recent 'Me Too' movement.
The move is aimed at jumpstarting in-person learning after nearly a year of distance classes for most of California's 6 million K-12 students. The news comes a day after California's legislative leaders announced a $6.5 billion proposal aimed at reopening schools in the spring. Newsom said that wasn't fast enough and suggested he could veto it.
Quentin Tarantino's star-packed Tinseltown fable – one that intertwines the lives of a washed-up actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), his steely stuntman (Brad Pitt) and the Manson Family – has been a favorite among movie lovers ever since its summer release. Once Upon a Time won best comedy at the Golden Globes and best picture at the Critics' Choice Awards, it's a strong contender in the 10 Oscar categories where it's nominated (Pitt's pretty much a lock for supporting actor and Tarantino has a good shot at original screenplay), and the Academy Awards since their inception have always adored movies about Hollywood. This one has it right in the title.
Mark my words. If Stafford gets with a real coach and a reliable offensive line, his biggest achievements are ahead of him.
There's a playful give and take between the two actors as they discuss swapping their Downton roles.
I know him well enough to say if he indeed approached the Lions about this, then he's been bottling it inside for a long time. The last time he spoke with the media, following another dismal season, he reiterated that he loves it here in Detroit. I believe that's true. His kids have been raised here. His marriage blossomed here. He's intricately involved with the community and charities here.
Is it going to be overcoming COVID, bringing us together, caring for creation? Or is it going to be sort of a culture war? he asked. I think what Biden campaigned on, and who he is, is pursuing justice in unity – not a culture war agenda.
As someone who lives to rewrite history, Williams' most pressing goal at the moment is to tie the record of 24 Grand Slam singles trophies won by former Australian Margaret Court.
It's not that I'm condoning certain actions of his, but I hope we feel sympathy for him at the very end. I think he's always tried to be a good person, tried to be nice and do what he thought was best, Highmore says. What makes him appealing is that he's never really been out to get people.
We have one last chance, one last chance, Mendoza said.
The last few months have been quite good for them — they realize they are not infallible, that they need to take advice and to make sensible choices, she says. No one can keep an upward trajectory forever... They're just going to have to step up in a bigger capacity at home, because people want to see them and the children more.
Waldman's underlying bias — that LSD was and is safe and effective in therapeutic settings and hasn't been all that risky when used recreationally, either — might challenge mainstream thinking. But she produces some very decent data and arguments. It's worth noting that she taught a course on the War on Drugs at UC Berkeley School of Law, so she knows where the good stuff about drugs and policy and vested interest is buried.
After fighting for a week and a half, the couple died within two hours of each other while holding hands at the hospital – on Elvis Presley's birthday, Jan. 8.
84. Fire & Blood by George R.R. Martin
Venezuela and the United States have significant policy differences, to be sure. But working out our disagreements should not require the life of an innocent American and his wife, who is herself a native of Venezuela. Josh and Thamy deserve to live as free citizens — not as bargaining chips in a game of global politics.
McGowan said she expects similar cases and rulings to make their way through the federal court system.

It absolutely is a direct conflict with Trump's approach, said history professor John Fea, author of Believe Me: The Evangelical Road to Donald Trump.
64. Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury
Although hers was a journey few will take, A Really Good Day reads almost like an Everywoman's experience, because Waldman's fears and reactions are so commonplace. She is so likable in her flaws and her determination that it's a relief to learn that the microdoses (or possibly her therapy sessions or maybe even a placebo effect, she acknowledges) allowed enough of a head shift that her life has become easier, lighter.
It's an awesome time, Mason Darrow, who came out in 2015 while a member of Princeton's football team, told USA TODAY Sports. For the lack of a better word, it's a gay Olympics. I think it's (a) really nice change of pace.
The pair are close enough now that they sit for interviews with their bodies touching, and finish each other's sentences. Weir, who is openly gay, was bridesman at Lipinski's wedding to television producer Todd Kapostasy last summer.
95. Dog Man: A Tale of Two Kitties by Dav Pilkey
Ricky was injured in a car crash a year ago in the Cincinnati suburb of Fairfield, Ohio. Mendez proposed shortly after the incident and lived in Ricky's hospital room with his fiancée for several months until the boy's release.

During a recent interview, when talking about Pacquiao's political career, Roach did not express concern about whether Pacquiao could juggle politics and boxing. Rather, Roach mused about the possibility of Pacquiao running for president in the Philippines — and then becoming the first president to win a boxing championship.
In other vaccination news, public health clinics in Riverside County have lost 263 doses of the vaccine, according to county spokesperson Jose Arballo Jr., who had previously told The Desert Sun that the county did not track this information. This week he said he'd been mistaken.
Dealing with ongoing concussion symptoms didn't feel great at all. It's been a long road back, Earnhardt said, and he used the time between the fog and the headaches to consider his future. And not just retirement.
Lord Jesus Christ, en-lighten your handmaid, because you are God, the True Light.
Throwing other wrenches into the works: Best picture is voted on through a preferential ballot, where academy members rank their choices rather than just pick one winner, plus a voting body that is slowly getting younger and more diverse every year.
With those thoughts in mind, here are 10 teams (listed alphabetically) that could be fits, some better than others, for JJW:
Martin Scorsese's Netflix gangster epic came into Oscars like a heavyweight, but like A Star Is Born last year, is starting to look like an also-ran. The film, which tracks World War II veteran and Mob hitman Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) over multiple bloody decades, received widespread critical acclaim but has lost out on every major honor so far. Still, don't count out The Irishman yet: Crime dramas tend to do well at the Oscars (Scorsese's The Departed marked his first and only best picture in 2007), Netflix put a lot of horses behind its campaign, everyone involved is a Hollywood favorite – not only Scorsese and De Niro, but also supporting-actor nominees Al Pacino and Joe Pesci – and it could benefit from the preferential ballot if it's the second or third choice for a majority of voters.
With the exception of a serene saxophone solo on the sanguine Tightrope, Prisoner hews closer to the bare-bones arrangements of 2011's Ashes & Fire than his more rock-heavy self-titled album in 2014. Some fans may gripe that Adams is simply doing more of the same, but overall, it's a solid, sincere addition to his prolific catalog.
While Anna has a husband, the widowed Lady Mary, who has a young child, is seeking a new partner.

During their recent six-day state visit to India and Bhutan, the pair looked to be endearingly affectionate judging from little signs: He, lightly, protectively touching her back, she, leaning in close to him to talk and laugh.
This outpaced Trump's recent predecessors, none of whom managed to place as many judicial appointees during their first four years in office. During the Obama administration, for example, only 30 federal appeals court nominees were confirmed during his first four years in office, according to the report. Previous administrations going back to President Ronald Reagan's managed to confirm between 30 and 42 nominees to the appeals court bench during the first four years.
Carol's blood pressure started going up, said Bert's daughter-in-law, Nicke Stevenson. Both of them went to the ER together and both of them got released from the hospital. New Year's Eve, we thought they were doing pretty good.

My fear is that if William, Kate, and Harry continue at their current level of involvement in official royal duties and try to shut off the rest of their lives from the public for the next decade, there will be little left to interest people, Palmer says.
Donald Trump and Paul Ryan met Thursday. It was dramatic. Shakespearan, even. And like two of the Bard's characters of yore, Trump and Ryan pledged their undying devotion (to work together for Republicans this fall).
Or as Pacquiao cagily said, I don't have any problem with Freddie Roach.
For context: LeBron James has 54 million Instagram followers; his 15-year-old son, Bronny, has more than double Trout's total, with 3.9 million. Trout may mean the world to baseball, a far more significant figure than, say, the Utah Jazz's Donovan Mitchell is to the NBA. Yet even Mitchell (2.7 million) enjoys a far healthier social media presence than Trout.
Stafford was the top pick in the 2009 draft, Detroit's reward for enduring an 0-16 season. He became the fastest player in NFL history to 20,000, 30,000 and 40,000 yards. He holds virtually all the Lions passing marks. From 2011 to 2019 he started every single game. He's played through all kinds of injuries. Put up big numbers. Made one Pro Bowl and led the Lions to three playoff games in three separate years. I know that sounds pathetic. But it's actually more than any previous Lions' starter in more than 50 years.
The Governor denies it, and right now it is his word against her and her former husband, Robertson said in an email. In a case like this, Americans are more skeptical of the denier. Fair or unfair, the #MeToo movement undoubtedly has reduced the number of people willing to give Governor Greitens the benefit of the doubt, because it seems common for public figures to deny the first allegations.
So it came as no surprise that when meeting the international press ahead of the Australian Open on Saturday, she primarily chose cagey over confessions.

Colton confesses his greatest fear in all this is that he's going to be with somebody who's not ready to be engaged the end of this. He tells the remaining women that Katie's the third person this week to warn him that there's someone or some people here not ready for the future he wants.
The finale includes plenty of action before Norman's death. Early in the episode, Norman — taken from jail at gunpoint by Norma's vengeful husband, Alex Romero (Nestor Carbonell) — shows Alex her corpse, beautifully situated in the snow. Norman then turns the tables and kills Romero before returning to the motel and his own eventual demise.
President Trump said he would release all of the documents without redactions, but FBI and CIA officials prevailed upon him to keep some still secret or to release others with key details blacked out.

Asked whether the fundraising gave donors a behind-the-scenes opportunity to build relationships with the governor, Adler said: You could also look at it, though, that there are people who want to help in Flint and may not necessarily want to be out there cutting a check and making it public because they don't want the publicity.
Elected officials defend their use, saying nonprofits can move more nimbly than government agencies to advance civic initiatives and are less likely to draw the public's ire over using taxpayer funds for pet projects or quasi-political expenses, such as polling. Campaign-finance watchdogs, however, said they are just another way for unregulated money to seep into the political process and give big donors a back-door method to curry favor with decision makers.

Skill-wise, director Marc Abraham calls Hiddleston so facile it's infuriating. That means on-set instead of staying in character, the actor easily switched between dialects.

Nonprofit groups have become a fixture in federal politics, allowing secret donors to pump unlimited sums into advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts in elections. But their use has spread rapidly to statehouses from Lansing, Mich., to Nashville, Tenn., and city halls from New York to Los Angeles, as another source of cash that elected officials of both parties can tap to help shape public policy.

While advanced metrics and a general sense he was merely an average defensive shortstop have haunted Jeter the past two decades, he is objectively, overwhelmingly qualified for Cooperstown.

The most interesting part of this story is the relationship between the two worlds. Mary has her most sisterly relationship with Anna.

In a made-for-Hollywood twist, Stefani is now dating Blake Shelton, who split with wife Miranda Lambert that same tragic summer.

While one movie hasn't risen to rule them all quite yet, some have been left in the dust. The racing drama Ford v Ferrari may win some technical awards but that's it, the best chances for coming-of-age adaptation Little Women and divorce drama Marriage Story are in the screenplay categories, and the World War II satire Jojo Rabbit looms as a dark horse with key guild nominations but has yet to make a splash this season.
Waldman's underlying bias — that LSD was and is safe and effective in therapeutic settings and hasn't been all that risky when used recreationally, either — might challenge mainstream thinking. But she produces some very decent data and arguments. It's worth noting that she taught a course on the War on Drugs at UC Berkeley School of Law, so she knows where the good stuff about drugs and policy and vested interest is buried.

The 42-year-old singer/songwriter sets the scene with the stomping Do You Still Love Me?, as he ponders what went wrong and attempts to salvage the dying embers of their relationship. Recalling an '80s-era Bruce Springsteen on the harmonica-assisted title track and Doomsday, Adams fights to hold on, singing on the latter, My love, we can do better than this / My love, how can you complicate a kiss? It's an aching sentiment that eventually turns into defeat on Shiver and Shake, in which he describes the physical distress of heartbreak and how if I wait here any longer, I'll just fade away.
