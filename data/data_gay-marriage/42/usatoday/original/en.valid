Katrease Stafford\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nDETROIT — The wife of alleged Kalamazoo shooter Jason Dalton saw no signs ahead of time that he planned the rampage that left six people dead and two others wounded, according to one of the lawyers representing Carole Dalton.\n\nThe day of the shooting, there was nothing until dinnertime, attorney Paul Vlachos told the Detroit Free Press Monday. There was no estrangement, no financial difficulties, they were not separated. ... There was nothing out there that would indicate something like this would happen.\n\nVlachos declined to go into detail about what transpired between Jason Dalton and his wife that day, but knocked down speculation that the couple were having marital or financial issues before the shootings.\n\nKalamazoo shooting victim, 14, breathing on her own\n\nCarole Dalton filed for divorce Thursday, according to Kalamazoo Circuit Court records.\n\nMichigan State Police 1st Lt. Dale Hinz of the Paw Paw post last week confirmed to the Free Press that investigators had heard allegations that the couple were having marital issues before the fatal shootings, but said they were unsubstantiated at that point.\n\nVlachos said the family led a relatively normal life. Jason Dalton worked as an insurance adjuster and worked as an Uber driver on the side. He said Carole Dalton works for an investment firm. They have two children, ages 15 and 10.\n\nKalamazoo shootings: Father and son remembered\n\nThe circuit court said the filing says: There has been a breakdown in the marriage relationship to the extent the objects of matrimony have been destroyed and there remains no reasonable likelihood that the marriage can be preserved, according to the MLive report.\n\nThe two were married in 1995.\n\nDalton, 45, is charged with six counts of open murder, two counts of assault with intent to murder and six counts of using a firearm to commit a felony in the Feb. 20 shooting that occurred over a four-hour period in the Kalamazoo area. He moonlighted as a driver for the Uber ride service, and authorities said he continued picking up Uber fares in between randomly shooting people. None of the victims were fares.\n\nThe police are continuing to investigate these incidents, said prosecuting attorney Jeffrey Getting, who said there were no new details to release yet.\n\nNeighbor: Kalamazoo suspect liked shooting guns at home\n\nBut Getting said a pre-exam conference is set for Thursday morning in circuit court and he'll be meeting with Dalton's attorney to discuss the case and what steps to take next.\n\nDalton's wife released a statement through Vlachos last week condemning the shootings and offering condolences to the victims and their families.\n\nOur hope is for peace and healing for the victims, the families of the victims, the Kalamazoo community and those touched by these events throughout the nation, Carole Dalton said in the statement released to the Free Press. This type of violence has no place in our society, and we express our love and support for everyone involved. We intend to cooperate in every way that we can to help determine why and how this occurred.\n\nContributing: Daniel Bethencourt, Detroit Free Press.

AP\n\nRENTON, Wash. (AP) — Marshawn Lynch strolled through the locker room he's called home for most of the past six seasons on Monday followed closely by a pack of cameras.\n\nWhether this was Lynch's final time in the Seattle Seahawks locker room remains to be determined.\n\nI don't know how that's going to go, Seattle coach Pete Carroll said on Monday. I don't know how any of these guys are going to go right now. I don't know.\n\nThe future of Lynch in Seattle is one of the big questions the Seahawks face entering the offseason.\n\nAfter an injury-filled season where Lynch played in just seven regular-season games, the Seahawks must determine whether it's time to move on or keep Beast Mode around for another season at a hefty cost.\n\nAll signs point to the marriage ending, especially with Lynch costing $11.5 million against Seattle's salary cap for the 2016 season if he returns.\n\nBut no one was willing to go so far as make declarative statements one day after Seattle's season ended in a 31-24 loss to Carolina in the NFC divisional playoff game.\n\nWe'll figure it out. It depends on how he comes back and how he works at it and all that kind of stuff, Carroll said. He had a difficult year physically.\n\nLynch was limited to just 111 carries and 417 yards in the regular season because of a hamstring injury early in the season and abdominal surgery in late November that sidelined him for the final seven games of the regular season.\n\nLynch appeared ready to return for the NFC wild-card game at Minnesota, but backed out of making the trip to Minneapolis on the Friday before the game telling the team he didn't think he could play.\n\nLynch returned for Sunday's game at Carolina, but was barely a factor in the run game with Seattle quickly falling behind 14-0 and trailing 31-0 at halftime. Lynch had six carries for 20 yards and caught two passes.\n\nWhile Lynch was out, rookie Thomas Rawls emerged as a potential replacement long term. Rawls led Seattle with 890 yards rushing in the regular season and averaged 5.6 yards per carry before suffering a broken ankle in Week 14 at Baltimore. Rawls said Monday he'll be out of his cast in the next few weeks.\n\nI let things work out the way that they work out, Rawls said. Everything is out of my control. What I can control is going out there and preparing, and showing what I can do. Everything thing else is for the guys upstairs.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL
While the majority of the top 100 best-sellers in 2018 are fiction, it was one heartfelt memoir that topped this year's list. Former first lady Michelle Obama, a.k.a.

Orrin G. Hatch\n\nRight now, one of our own is suffering in a leaky prison cell in Latin America, cut off from family, friends and many of the people he loves the most. Joshua Holt, a constituent of mine and an upstanding American citizen, was arrested by Venezuelan authorities in June 2016 and jailed on false charges. His health is quickly failing, and he desperately needs our help.\n\nJosh's story is the nightmare of any American traveling abroad.\n\nMore:Iran unrest threatens Tehran's tyrants. Can protesters drive them out?\n\nMore:On immigration, Trump is positioned to do what Obama and Bush couldn't\n\nJosh first flew to Venezuela last year to marry his fiancée, Thamara Caleno Holt, a young Venezuelan woman whom he fell in love with after months of constant correspondence. Just days after their marriage, the newlyweds were detained on spurious charges — for allegedly possessing weapons and engaging in espionage. In clear violation of the Vienna Convention, Venezuelan authorities not only denied Josh medical attention but also barred access to U.S. Consular officials for the first several weeks of his incarceration.\n\nFor months, Josh's case has languished in Venezuelan courts. And while Venezuelan authorities dither, Josh continues to suffer in prison, alone and afraid in an alien country. With his case scheduled to move to trial in January, government authorities have offered no clarification as to how long the trial will take, or if U.S. officials will even be able to help Josh in legal proceedings. The Venezuelan government has also refused to guarantee that Josh will receive much-needed medical attention, even as his health continues to deteriorate.\n\nThe tragedy is that Josh is completely innocent of the crimes for which he stands accused. I know Josh to be a good and honorable man with a pure heart. As a case in point, Josh served for two years as a Mormon missionary in Washington prior to his marriage. It was in this setting that he learned Spanish and developed a deep love for the Hispanic people, culture and customs. That he would ever inflict harm on anyone, let alone the good people of Venezuela, is unthinkable.\n\nFrom the time of Josh's arrest last year, I have done everything in my power to secure his freedom. I have enlisted help from the highest levels of government, including from secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has encouraged our diplomats on the ground to stand firm in their negotiations with Venezuelan authorities. I even raised the issue of Josh's captivity with President Trump, who not long after, enacted heavy sanctions on Venezuela and called on President Nicolas Maduro to set Josh free.\n\nAs a leader looking to do what is good and just, President Maduro has an opportunity to change his country's course with the release of Josh and Thamy on humanitarian grounds. This action would be a historic step in opening the channels of communication between our two countries. With this gesture of goodwill, the governments of Venezuela and the United States could move forward together towards a better future.\n\nThe path to greater peace begins with simple steps, and I invite President Maduro to take the first step. Doing so would bring relief to the Holt family and usher in a new era of U.S.-Venezuela relations, initiating a conversation from which both nations could benefit.\n\nMore:The second 'Persian Spring' is upon us. Here's how we can make it last.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nVenezuela and the United States have significant policy differences, to be sure. But working out our disagreements should not require the life of an innocent American and his wife, who is herself a native of Venezuela. Josh and Thamy deserve to live as free citizens — not as bargaining chips in a game of global politics.\n\nAs the senior member and former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I recognize the importance of state sovereignty and of a fair judicial process. But I believe just as strongly in protecting human rights and upholding the principles of justice.\n\nThat's why President Maduro should release Josh and Thamy Holt. He must honor human life and recognize longstanding international conventions.\n\nI call on him to help us bring Josh home.\n\nOrrin Hatch is the senior senator from Utah, and president pro tempore of the United States Senate.
Gabriel Schoenfeld\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nDonald Trump's presidency has struck an iceberg on both sides of its hull. Starboard, with the indictment of Roger Stone, special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is circling ever closer to the president himself. Port side, the disastrous 35-day government shutdown has left a growing number of Republican pols unlashing themselves from the SS Trump's mast and searching for life jackets. The question now, as we enter another presidential election cycle, is whether they will actually jump off the foundering ship.\n\n\n\nAn increasingly attractive rescue vessel sailing by is Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of heavily Democratic Maryland, who according to multiple news reports is contemplating a 2020 primary challenge to Trump.\n\nOf course, with Trump's total domination of the GOP and the national conversation, Hogan and the others most frequently mentioned — such as Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former Ohio Gov. John Kasich — seem like guppies up against a shark. But that could change, and Hogan would be positioned well for a challenge.\n\nIf Trump is a scraping-from-the-bottom-of-the-barrel excuse of a human being — an ignorant, entitled, dishonest, braggadocious thug — Hogan, in character, policy and political appeal, is in every respect the reverse, in full measure an anti-Trump and more.\n\n\n\nTrump, of course, was born with a golden spoon in his mouth. For decades, he has used his inherited fortune to posture as a successful businessman, running serial scams (like Trump University) and bringing about serial bankruptcies (like the Trump Taj Mahal casino).\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nHow billionaires like Schultz and Bloomberg can help America: Don't run for president\n\nHoward Schultz: A third-party centrist candidate like me could win the presidency\n\nHow the Democrats could blow it in 2020\n\nBefore he won elective office in 2014, Hogan, 62, was also a businessman. Hogan Companies, however, is not a shell game but a genuinely successful real estate firm with $2 billion in transactions under its account, built from the ground up, without daddy's largesse. Hogan, though born into a political family, made his own way up.\n\n\n\nHogan did inherit one extremely valuable thing from his father. Lawrence Hogan Sr., a onetime FBI agent, represented Maryland in Congress. In 1974, he was the first Republican on the House Judiciary Committee to call for President Richard Nixon's impeachment. His readiness to put country before party is something his son regularly mentions in speeches.\n\nThe implication for Trump is left clear but unsaid. That episode taught a lesson in fidelity to principle, which goes a considerable distance in explaining why Hogan is one of the few Republican elected officials who has never endorsed let alone truckled to the weakling bully in the White House.\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, when it comes to private life, the contrast between the two men is stark. Trump is a serial philanderer/sexual predator whose partners include multiple wives and a paid-off porn star. Hogan has been married only once, and he and his wife, Yumi Hogan — a first generation Korean-American — have never given the tabloids any occasion to visit their marriage.\n\nHogan style is civility and moderation\n\nMore centrally, Trump has both campaigned and governed by stoking racial and religious resentment, allowing him to gain and retain the fierce loyalty of a narrow base of disaffected voters. Hogan's philosophy is to govern with civility and moderation and so he has, regularly reaching across the aisle of the Annapolis statehouse to advance a bipartisan agenda.\n\n\n\nTrump is renowned for the art of the deal, but that is a marketing slogan cooked up by a ghost writer. It has never borne any relation to Trump's long career of shady business practices burnished only by boastfulness.\n\n\n\nHogan, for his part, speaks of the art of the possible. His political pragmatism is precisely what has made him a success. His signature initiatives don't grab headlines — like walling off Mexico or banning Muslims from entering the United States — but they are the unsexy work of good government: development of infrastructure, stewardship of the environment, innovation in K-12 education, access to affordable health care and fiscal responsibility.\n\n\n\nAs a national candidate, Hogan has his liabilities. In this age of celebrities, his is hardly a household name. His reasoned brand of charisma would not rouse crowds to chant demagogic slogans at rallies. His foreign policy experience is a blank that would need to be filled. His 2015 diagnosis of lymphoma, now pronounced in complete remission, will raise worries over his long-term health.\n\nTrump's troubles are mounting\n\nOf course, whether Hogan or any Republican could launch a successful primary challenge is in doubt as long as Trump's cult of personality does not crack and approval of the president among Republicans hovers in the 80s. Even so, the fluidity of American politics and Trump's mounting troubles raise the possibility of the SS Trump sinking abruptly to the bottom of the sea.\n\n\n\nShould that come about, and were Hogan to emerge against long odds as the Republican nominee, he would likely prove to be a formidable force in a general election, particularly if the Democrats lurched left.\n\n\n\nHogan regularly ranks as one of the most popular governors in the country, drawing support from Democratic and Republican voters alike, and earning approval numbers in the 70s. Running for re-election last November, Hogan beat Democrat Ben Jealous by 12 percentage points, a striking accomplishment in one of the country's bluest states.\n\n\n\nOf course, at this early stage, Hogan must be considered, as other potential Republican challengers, an exceedingly long shot. Nonetheless, anyone who wants to glean the future of American politics should prepare to hear more from this serious and determined man.\n\nGabriel Schoenfeld, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and the author of Necessary Secrets: National Security, the Media, and the Rule of Law, was a senior adviser to the 2012 Romney for President campaign.

WASHINGTON – Nearly 40% of judges President Donald Trump appointed to federal appeals courts have a history of hostility toward LGBTQ rights, according to a new report by the LGBT advocacy group Lambda Legal.\n\nThe report presents a sobering image for civil rights advocates of Trump's lasting impact on the federal judiciary – one they say threatens to roll back progress made in advancing the rights of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.\n\nOur analysis was ... about calling out the danger to the rule of law, the danger to the integrity and credibility of the judiciary to be putting forth nominees who fundamentally start from a perspective of LGBTQ people as 'less than,' said Sharon McGowan, legal director for Lambda Legal.\n\nTrump will leave office having significantly altered the makeup of the federal judiciary, from lower courts to the Supreme Court – an accomplishment made possible by Senate Republicans and one that will create a major obstacle for President-elect Joe Biden.\n\nAfter four years as president, Trump has appointed three Supreme Court justices and 230 lower court judges to lifetime posts, many ny of whom are young, white and male jurists who will have decades to influence and shape federal law.\n\nA whiter judiciary:Trump's 87 picks to be federal judges are 92% white with just one black and one Hispanic nominee\n\nAccording to Lambda Legal's report, released Tuesday, the Trump administration has appointed 54 of the 177, about 30%, of actively serving federal appeals court judges.\n\nThis outpaced Trump's recent predecessors, none of whom managed to place as many judicial appointees during their first four years in office. During the Obama administration, for example, only 30 federal appeals court nominees were confirmed during his first four years in office, according to the report. Previous administrations going back to President Ronald Reagan's managed to confirm between 30 and 42 nominees to the appeals court bench during the first four years.\n\nI think in many ways, Trump's impact on the judiciary will be his most significant and lasting legacy because it will have a life far beyond the four years of the Trump administration, McGowan said.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court hears only about 100 to 150 cases annually, the 13 federal appeals courts around the country hear thousands of the most consequential cases every year that shape laws and affect the rights of millions of Americans.\n\nTrump's legacy:Biden's influence on federal judiciary may be limited despite liberals' talk of 'court-packing'\n\nCarrie Severino, chief counsel at the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, which has promoted and applauded Trump's nominees, previously said the nomination process under the Trump administration is not about meeting quotas.\n\n(Trump) is looking for people with a principled judicial philosophy, Severino said. The fundamental question is making sure we have judges who are going to be faithful to the Constitution.\n\nTrump judges:Trump's conservative judges begin takeover of federal appeals courts\n\nConversion therapy, misgendering and wedding vendor disputes\n\nThe report by Lambda Legal – which analyzed publicly available records on Trump's nominees, including statements and writings they've done as private individuals – singled out several appeals court judges who, the authors say, have already issued rulings hostile to LGBTQ rights.\n\nIn 2019, Judge James Ho, whom Trump nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, wrote an opinion denying health care to a transgender woman who was seeking sex-reassignment surgery while in a Texas prison. Ho, who referred to the inmate using male pronouns, wrote that while it can be considered cruel and unusual punishment to deny essential medical care to a prisoner, there is much disagreement in the medical community about the necessity of sex-reassignment surgery.\n\nLater that year, Judge David Stras, whom Trump nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, wrote an opinion backing wedding videographers' First Amendment rights to refuse to provide services at same-sex weddings. The judge wrote that the videographers have creative control over wedding videos and have the right to decline requests for services from clients who contradict their views that marriage is solely between a man and a woman.\n\nLast year, Judge Kyle Duncan, whom Trump also nominated to the 5th Circuit, wrote an opinion rejecting a transgender federal prisoner's request to be referred to in court papers using female pronouns in accordance with the inmate's gender identity. Duncan wrote that doing so could raise delicate questions about judicial impartiality.\n\nAlso last year, two Trump-nominated judges to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit voted to strike down local laws protecting LGBTQ minors from conversion therapy, a practice of attempting to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. The American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association have discredited the practice.\n\nBut in the opinion, Judge Britt Grant wrote that the ban on the controversial treatment infringes on therapists' First Amendment rights and that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds it offensive. Judge Barbara Lagoa agreed with Grant, resulting in a split 2-1 decision.\n\nIn a candid speech in November to the conservative Federalist Society, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito lamented society's hostility against traditional views on marriage.\n\nYou can't say that marriage is a union between one man and one woman, Alito said. Until very recently, that's what the vast majority of Americans thought. Now it's considered bigotry.\n\nThe speech was widely criticized by Democrats and advocates, including McGowan. Lambda Legal also opposed Alito's nomination to the high court in 2006.\n\nMcGowan said she expects similar cases and rulings to make their way through the federal court system.\n\nIn the past, she said, Lambda Legal has won cases before Republican-appointed judges, but the difference during the Trump administration is the appointment of judges whose records show deep hostility against LGBTQ rights.\n\nWe can and should be able to expect fair and impartial justice from judges regardless of whether they were appointed by Republicans or Democrats. We did not oppose every single Trump nominee. We did not paint them with the same brush, McGowan said. But, she added, There should be a baseline below which we would never fall.\n\nContributing: Richard Wolf
Next week, Kamala Harris will make history as the first woman, Black person and South Asian American person inaugurated vice president of the United States.\n\nHer climb from California attorney general to senator to vice president-elect has been well-documented in the news, as well as Harris' own books, including 2008's Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor's Plan to Make Us Safer and 2019's The Truths We Hold: An American Journey.\n\nKamala's Way: An American Life (Simon & Schuster, 257 pp.), out Tuesday, promises a revelatory look at how a daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants became one of this country's most effective power players, according to a press release.\n\nVogue:Kamala Harris' team says they were blindsided by controversial cover\n\nThe new biography was written by veteran California journalist Dan Morain, who covered Harris' career for decades at the Sacramento Bee and Los Angeles Times. He aims to show not only the confident former top cop known for her fierce takedown of Brett Kavanaugh at a 2018 Senate hearing but also the empathetic human fighting for racial justice, police reform and marriage equality.\n\nBecause Harris, 56, and her family declined interviews for the book amid President-elect Joe Biden's campaign, Kamala's Way isn't particularly revelatory, dryly detailing her early days in the Alameda County district attorney's office in California, as well as the political allies and adversaries she encountered during her rise. Although meticulously reported, it occasionally reads like a slapdash Wikipedia page rather than a compelling narrative.\n\nBut after the circus of the outgoing presidential administration, there is a level of comfort reading an exhaustive account of a lawmaker just putting in the work. It isn't a mere puff piece either, as Morain rightfully holds Harris accountable for her past support of capital punishment and mass incarceration policies.\n\nHere are some of the more illuminating stories that we learned from Kamala's Way about her life on and off the political stage:\n\nKamala Harris' VP win:'Powerful, emotional' moment for African American and South Asian American women\n\nHarris once comforted a young girl who was scared of gun violence\n\nCalling for smart gun safety laws, Harris would frequently bemoan the slaughter of babies, as she recalled seeing harrowing autopsy photographs of young people killed by guns, Morain writes. She took this approach while speaking at an event in downtown San Francisco in late 2016, only to stop mid-speech.\n\nErin, I am so sorry. I forgot, Harris said to Erin Lehane, a donor in the audience who had brought along her 7-year-old daughter, Rose.\n\nHarris, who had known Rose since she was a baby, promised to talk to the young girl after the event. She pulled two chairs together as the room cleared out, and asked Rose if her remarks frightened her.\n\nRose later told her mom that Harris told her not to worry, that there were so many people who would protect her – her mom, her teachers, the police, Morain writes.\n\nShe tried to be reassuring, Lehane says in the book. She asked if Rose had questions. She spent a huge chunk of time. There was no camera. There was no press. Nobody knew. She was very human in that moment and wanted Rose to feel safe.\n\nShe met her now-husband on a blind date\n\nHarris' husband, lawyer Doug Emhoff, will make history as the first second gentleman of the United States. The couple met on a blind date in 2013, set up by Harris' good friend Chrisette Hudlin, a public relations consultant.\n\nHudlin and her husband arranged a meeting with Emhoff about a knotty legal issue, which they ended by asking if he was single. She told Emhoff about Harris, then-California attorney general and her friend of 30 years.\n\nI said, 'Oh, my god, she's hot,'  Emhoff, 56, told Chasten Buttigieg in an interview last year that's recounted in the book.\n\nHudlin gave Emhoff Harris' number, and they met in Los Angeles that weekend. The two kept their courtship under the radar and were engaged in 2014. They were married that summer in a ceremony incorporating both Indian and Jewish traditions.\n\nThe couple share two children – Cole, 26, and Ella, 21 – from Emhoff's previous marriage. The kids affectionately call Harris Momala, which she proudly displays in her Twitter bio.\n\nHer late mom is a beacon in political career\n\nKamala's Way touches on Harris' close relationships with her family, particularly her sister Maya Harris, 53, a lawyer who was also a senior adviser for Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign. She has long been Harris' closest confidante and political adviser.\n\nDuring campaigns, Kamala and Maya would talk several times a day, Morain writes. Often, a call with Maya was the first of the day and last at night. Their sense of humor is similar and the sound of their laugh is all but identical. They're brilliant, detail oriented, tough and competitive, sometimes even with each other in the ways big and little sisters can be.\n\nThe book also discusses Harris' private struggles as her mom, scientist Shyamala Gopalan, underwent chemotherapy for colon cancer in 2008. In a 2018 op-ed for the New York Times, Harris recalled how her mom continued to support her even while she was hospitalized, shortly before her death in February 2009 at age 70.\n\nI remember I had just entered the race for California attorney general and she asked me how it was going, Harris wrote.  'Mommy, these guys are going to kick my a**,' I told her.\n\nShe rolled over and looked at me and unveiled the biggest smile, Harris continued. She knew who she'd raised. She knew her fighting spirit was alive and well inside me.
David Schwimmer and Zoe Buckman taking a break\n\nDavid Schwimmer and wife Zoe Buckman are separating after six years of marriage.
Kaja Whitehouse\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK -- Yet another pharmaceutical mega-merger is on the books.\n\nMore than five months after making its initial bid, biopharmaceutical company Baxalta Incorporated (BXLT) agreed to buy Dublin, Ireland-based Shire (SHP) in a deal valued at $32 billion, the companies said Monday.\n\nThe companies reached a deal after overcoming concerns that a tie-up could create tax problems due to Baxalta's spin-off from parent company Baxter International last year. After conducting some due diligence, Shire concluded that the merger will maintain the tax-free status of the Baxalta spinoff from Baxter, the companies said.\n\nIt has been a record period for global mergers and acquisitions, led in good part by marriages among large pharmaceuticals and biotech companies.\n\nPfizer's $160 billion purchase of drug company Allergan, for example, marked the single largest deal of 2015, and helped to boosted total U.S.-based M&A to a record $4.28 trillion in 2015. That's 16.6% above the previous 2007 peak, and 29.9% above 2014, according to data from Mergermarket, which tracks deals.\n\nThe marriage of Baxalta and Shire will create a portfolio that reaches into more than 100 countries, and is expected to result in over $20 billion in annual revenue by 2020, the companies said.\n\nTogether, we will have leadership positions in multiple, high-value franchises and become the clear partner of choice in rare diseases, Shire CEO Flemming Ornskov said.\n\nUnder the agreement, Baxalta shareholders will receive $18 in cash and 0.1482 of Shire's U.S. listed stock for each Baxalta share, the companies said Monday. Based on Shire's closing price on January 8, 2016, the deal implies a value of $45.57 per Baxalta share, or a 37.5% increase to the value of Baxalta's shares as of August 3, 2015 — one day prior to Shire's initial public offer for Baxalta.\n\nThe transaction will give shareholders of Bannockburn, Ill.-based Baxalta roughly 34% ownership in the combined company. The deal is expected to close in mid-2016.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kaja Whitehouse on Twitter @kajawhitehouse
Holly Meyer and Jordan Buie\n\nThe Tennessean\n\nNASHVILLE — Tennessee Freemasons overwhelmingly voted Thursday to uphold a ban on gay members, according to Freemasons who witnessed the vote at a members-only meeting here.\n\nTwo Freemasons confirmed the results to The Tennessean but asked for anonymity because business conducted at the meetings is secret, and revealing information discussed at a meeting could result in them being kicked out of the organization. The vote took place at the Grand Lodge of Tennessee in downtown Nashville.\n\nSpokesmen for the Grand Lodge of Tennessee Free & Accepted Masons did not return a request for comment. The organization has about 41,000 members in Tennessee and more than 300 lodges across the state, according to the Grand Lodge's website.\n\nWhile the organization is secretive, bans on allowing gay men to participate in Tennessee and Georgia have prompted public discussion locally and globally, Christopher Hodapp, the author of Freemasons for Dummies, said in a Thursday blog post.\n\nChurch asks Boy Scouts to leave over gay rights\n\nGrand Masters nationally and internationally have weighed in on the debate, and California and District of Columbia, grand lodges have suspended Masonic relations with Georgia and Tennessee because of it.\n\nIn the fall, the Grand Lodge of Tennessee suspended two Memphis Freemasons, Dennis Clark and Mark Henderson, who had married in June after the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage, according to Hodapp's blog. A handful of Nashville Freemasons have withdrawn from Tennessee chapters to speak out for the two men.\n\nI'm not gay myself, but I have friends who are, Chase Geiser of Nashville said Monday. I don't think this is right, and it is something that will prevent younger members from joining the organization that has seen decreasing numbers since World War II.\n\nGeiser, a 25-year-old Freemason who joined the order in 2011 and became a full member in 2012, said the grand lodges of Georgia and Tennessee have drawn particular criticism for their bylaws banning homosexual members.\n\nIn the Freemasons, Geiser said, each state's grand lodge has its own constitutions and bylaws, separate from others nationally and internationally. In the United States, most Masonic lodges are male only but have sister organizations such as the Order of the Eastern Star.\n\nSuspension of the two Memphis Freemasons has cast light on a broader cultural issue within the Freemasons, Geiser said.\n\nThe organization saw a spike in membership following World War II, and then a large falloff in the baby boomer generation. Now, he said many young men are looking to align themselves with socially conscious fraternal organizations.\n\nSome are looking to find a home among Freemasons, and what Geiser called the old guard and the new members have differences of opinion.\n\nNigeria bans gay marriage, gay meetings\n\nThere's this cultural and ideological divide, he said. Now, we are at 25% of the membership just after World War II. The average mason in Tennessee is a 69-year-old man.\n\nThe older masons have very conservative Christian values, he said. The younger masons are theistic. We believe in a creator, but we don't have a problem with homosexual marriage.\n\nFollow Holly Meyer and Jordan Buie on Twitter: @HollyAMeyer and @JordanBuie
WASHINGTON — Eager to please the young leader of a promising potential ally in the Middle East, the CIA enlisted the help of billionaire Howard Hughes's longtime fixer to find women for Jordan's King Hussein, according to documents recently made public.\n\nThat help for Hussein during his spring 1959 trip to the United States, newly released documents from the investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy show, likely turned into a relationship between Hussein and B-movie actress Susan Cabot that may have produced the son who eventually beat Cabot to death in 1986.\n\nA CIA memo released Dec. 15 shows how the agency used private investigator Robert Maheu, a former FBI agent, to find female companionship for the 23-year-old King during his trip to Los Angeles in April 1959.\n\nThe document refers only to a foreign head of state but the timeline included in the memo corresponds to the times Hussein was in the United States. A March 28, 1959, New York Times story laid out Hussein's itinerary and plans to increase U.S. aid to his nation.\n\nThe foreign official was especially desirous of female companionship during his Los Angeles visit and it was requested that appropriate arrangements be made through a controlled source of the [CIA's] Office [of Security] in order to assure a satisfied visit, said the anonymously written memo.\n\nThe agency turned to Maheu, a private investigator in Los Angeles, to line up the dates, the CIA memo said. Maheu then contacted a prominent Los Angeles attorney and Hollywood figure whose name was redacted in the report.\n\nAn April 9, 1959, story in the Los Angeles Times said Cabot and Hussein met a party at the house of California oilman Edwin Pauley, a longtime Democratic Party donor for whom UCLA's basketball arena, Pauley Pavilion, is named.\n\nOn to New York\n\nCabot and Hussein got along so well during the Los Angeles portion of his trip that he wished to meet with her during his stay in New York City from 14 through 18 April 1969, the CIA memo said.\n\nThe agency, the memo said, rented a house in Long Beach, Long Island, N.Y., for the time Hussein was in New York, while Cabot was registered at the Hotel Barclay in New York under an assumed name.\n\nHussein's budding relationship with Cabot was well known at the time, and numerous news reports mentioned that the Jewish heritage of Cabot, born Harriet Shapiro, might cause a problem for the Muslim king.\n\nDuring the stay at the Long Beach site, [Cabot] discussed the publicity in the case at some length with the Security representatives, the CIA memo said. She speculated about the possible sources of certain personal information that she felt had been leaked to the press.\n\nCabot's film career started in 1947 with an uncredited appearance in the film noir Kiss of Death and continued throughout the 1950s with roles in low-budget science fiction films such as War of the Satellites and The Wasp Woman.\n\nJordan's mission\n\nIn 1959, Hussein had been Jordan's king for almost six years. He assumed the throne of the Hashemite kingdom in 1953 after his father, Talal, was forced to abdicate because of illness. At 17, Hussein had witnessed the assassination of his grandfather, King Abdullah I, in Jerusalem.\n\nOnce a British colony, Jordan lost British military and economic aid in 1957 when the United Kingdom cut off its annual subsidy. Hussein came to United States in 1959 to ensure the continued flow of U.S. aid to his country.\n\nThe United States officials were impressed by the King's personality, the New York Times reported on March 28, 1959. They discussed the possibility that in time he might develop into an Arab leader comparable to his grandfather.\n\nHussein led Jordan until February 1999, when he died from cancer. He was married four times, and his son from his second marriage, Abdullah, succeeded him as king.\n\nA brutal murder\n\nCabot was beaten to death in Los Angeles home on Dec. 10, 1986, and her son, Timothy Scott Roman, was charged with her murder.\n\nDuring Roman's 1989 trial, his defense attorney Chester Leo Smith introduced evidence that showed the Cabot received a regular sum of $1,500 a month from the Keeper of the King's Purse, Amman, Jordan. There is written indication in the handwriting of Susan Roman this money is from a trust. ... For better or worse, it looks like child support, Smith wrote.\n\nThe Jordanian government, the Los Angeles Times reported on April 13, 1989, had no comment on Smith's claims about Roman's paternity.\n\nRoman, the Times reported on Oct. 11, 1989, was born a dwarf but had grown to the height of 5 feet, 4 inches through thrice-weekly injections of a hormone derived from the pituitary glands of cadavers. A former attorney once called him a 'failed human experiment.'\n\nHe was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, not premeditated murder, for bludgeoning his mother to death with a barbell.\n\nThe Hughes-Mafia-Castro connection\n\nHussein had nothing to do with the Nov. 22, 1963, Kennedy assassination, but various government agencies had investigated the theory that Cuban dictator Fidel Castro or the Mafia were involved in Kennedy's killing. That's because Kennedy, along with his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, were actively trying to assassinate Castro in the early 1960s.\n\nOne assassination plan involved the CIA's use of Maheu to recruit someone 'tough enough' to handle the job, reported the Senate's Church Committee in 1976. A former FBI associate of Maheu's was employed in the CIA's Office of Security and had arranged for the CIA to use Maheu in several sensitive covert operations in which 'he didn't want to have an Agency person or a government person get caught,' the Church report said.\n\nMaheu contacted Johnny Rosselli, a Mafioso with connections in Las Vegas, to handle the job along with Sam Giancana, a Chicago-based Mafia leader also active in Las Vegas. While Rosselli was reluctant to handle the job, he and Maheu eventually met with a CIA official at New York's Plaza Hotel in September 1960 to handle the details.\n\nMaheu was also reluctant to pursue the plot, because he feared it would conflict with his new client, the reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes, who also had major business interests in Las Vegas. He finally agreed to participate because he felt that he owed the Agency a commitment, the Church report said.\n\nAn investigation by a House committee in 1976 mentioned Maheu's procurement of women for Hussein, but it did not mention any specific women.\n\nThe JFK files\n\nThe CIA's Maheu memo was part of an unveiling of more than 35,500 documents related to the JFK investigation that were required to be released under the provisions of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. Many had nothing to do with the actual assassination but with people, agencies and countries implicated in the various investigations of the killing and related conspiracy theories.\n\nPresident Trump said he would release all of the documents without redactions, but FBI and CIA officials prevailed upon him to keep some still secret or to release others with key details blacked out.\n\nAny information that is still redacted is subject to Trump's review and could be released in full in the coming months, the National Archives said.\n\nMore:JFK files: Soviet defector told how KGB compromised Americans living in Soviet Union\n\nMore:JFK files: House Assassinations Committee was suspicious of defector's claims about KGB and Oswald\n\nMore:JFK files: Controversy surrounding CIA counterspy chief fed assassination conspiracies\n\nContributing: Alia Dastagir
Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThis is what the truth feels like\n\nRemember the 2015 summer of divorce? Ben and Jen, Gwen and Gavin, Miss Piggy and Kermit. It was horrible. Apparently now it's the winter of reveals. Gwen Stefani talked to The New York Times in a story Thursday about the morning she found out her marriage to Gavin Rossdale was over. The gist: After the Grammys she went to eat Mexican with Adam Levine. The next day she woke up to her life being blown up by a story so juicy and shocking that she can't tell you about it but felt like she was going to die. In a made-for-Hollywood twist, Stefani is now dating Blake Shelton, who split with wife Miranda Lambert that same tragic summer. Her reveal follows Jennifer Garner's public comments a couple of weeks ago about her breakup with husband Ben Affleck. We had been separated for months before I ever heard about the nanny, the actress told Vanity Fair. As for Kermit and Miss Piggy, he said this month he's still in love with her. All is not lost.\n\nAnother reason to eat Taco Bell before work\n\nThe dollar menu isn't dead yet. McDonald's may have phased it out, but for those who like to Live Más in the morning, Taco Bell unveiled a $1 breakfast menu Thursday. It's offering 10 breakfast items for a buck each, including new additions like a mini skillet bowl with potatoes and scrambled eggs and a sausage flatbread quesadilla. Light and healthy to start your day, you know? One thing going for McDonald's is that its breakfast menu is offered all day.

He's the son of the storied former PM, Pierre Trudeau. Sophie, who's been compared to Jackie Kennedy, practically popped with color. (Her entire outfit was Canadian, according to Canadian media reports.) Washington is abuzz about the visit, and especially Thursday's state dinner: It's the first one we've hosted for a Canadian leader in 19 years.\n\nIt's expensive to saint someone. Pope Francis is on it.\n\nDid you know that Pope Francis is expected next week to announce the date for the canonization of Mother Teresa? And did you know the process for making someone a saint is super expensive? Documents leaked four months ago revealed abuses and high costs, which can average $550,000. The Vatican responded Thursday with new rules for the whole process. The measures, approved by Francis, focus on how the Holy See handles applications for sainthood, a lengthy process that involves examining claims made by supporters of a would-be saint. They also bake in more supervision and oversight.\n\n#MustRead: USA TODAY NETWORK investigation of untested rape kits is leading to actual change\n\nA USA TODAY NETWORK investigation published in July identified more than 70,000 untested sexual assault kits in the custody of more than 1,000 law enforcement agencies in communities large and small, pointing to a national accumulation of untested kits that likely reaches well into the hundreds of thousands.

Miranda Lambert is thankful that nobody was hurt after she and husband Brendan McLoughlin were involved in a hit-and-run accident in Georgia.\n\nThe BlueBird singer, 37, said on Instagram Thursday the couple cut their road trip short and made it safely back to Nashville after they were side swiped near Atlanta.\n\nAn (expletive) in a small car with temp plates was driving erratically and tried to squeeze between us and (a) semi truck going 70, the country music star wrote, sharing a video of the damage. It hit the airstream (trailer) on the passenger side and sent us into the left lane. We fishtailed pretty good but got on the shoulder as quickly as possible to assess the damage.\n\nLambert continued: Nobody was hurt thank the good Lord…We are so thankful that nothing worse happened.\n\nMiranda Lambert,Ingrid Andress lead country nominations for Grammy Awards 2021\n\nAlthough the erratic driver sped away without stopping, Lambert said their vehicle and trailer were driveable, thanks to her husband's quick actions.\n\n@brendanjmcloughlin kept our trailer pretty steady for being side swiped, she applauded her husband, who she quietly married in January 2019.\n\nLambert also thanked her mother: I called mama right away to say that I know her prayers are always heard cause I know she prays for us every morning about 4:30 am. Especially when we are on the road.\n\n'Sure won't!': Miranda Lambert jokes with troll who suggested her marriage won't last\n\nDespite the scare, Lambert called their road trip beautiful, sharing additional shots from the journey.

We learned we have a lot to see and a lot to be grateful for.\n\nFor his part, McLoughlin said the trip not only left me speechless, but also 10 pounds heavier and made me realize exactly why I keep my gym membership.\n\nAttach the airstream to the hitch, get in the car and go, he wrote on Instagram Wednesday. Traveling, no matter where it is, has always been a love of mine. Walking the streets of a place you've never been, learning the history, it's absolutely fascinating.

Bob McManaman\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nAVONDALE, Ariz. -- Aside from recovering from a particularly nasty concussion and learning more about his craft from outside a race car, something else happened to Dale Earnhardt Jr. during his time away from work.\n\nNASCAR's Peter Pan decided it finally was time to grow up.\n\nI'm 42 years old, Earnhardt told azcentral sports Tuesday. I can't be a kid forever.\n\nEarnhardt, who was cleared by doctors to get back in the car after a stint at Darlington Raceway in December, was speaking between testing runs at Phoenix International Raceway in his No. 88 Chevrolet. He said it was his marriage to longtime girlfriend Amy Reimann on New Year's Eve that made him see the light.\n\nActually, Amy made him see it. She's changed his life, he said.\n\nShe just helped me mature as a person, Earnhardt said. She showed me a lot of things that were important. She helped me sort some priorities out in my life and get some things in a row.\n\nI've still got a lot to learn, a lot of growing to do, but she's a big part of that. She's helped me accelerate my maturity and I really needed it. I had a lot of things that I needed to get to doing better.\n\nEarnhardt didn't wish to elaborate other than to say, Nobody's perfect.\n\nMORE NASCAR COVERAGE:\n\nPIR unveils $178 million facelift\n\nJeff Gordon: Alex Bowman should be first call if Hendrick needs a sub\n\nThere's still plenty of youthfulness in the jovial Junior, who is getting ready to embark on his 19th NASCAR Cup season after sitting out half of the 2016 campaign while suffering from issues related to his concussion.\n\nHe keeps adding, for instance, new attractions to his 200-acre spread in Mooresville, N.C., which already includes an entire western town, a dirt go-kart track, a 66,000-square-foot race shop, a freshly built luxury treehouse and a massive race car graveyard.\n\nBut as his driving career winds down, there's no mistaking that Earnhardt is making it his business to be more dutiful to the business. That's why he isn't whining during his two days of testing here, something he's disliked to do anywhere. It's also why he didn't overreact to the small brake fire in his car Tuesday morning.\n\nAfter being forced to sit out for the longest time during a Cup career that began in 1999, Earnhardt absolutely was giddy to get behind the wheel for his first real action on a track. Oh sure, he took a few laps at Darlington Raceway to meet doctors' approval, but this was different. You could tell by the country-wide smile on his red-bearded face.\n\nIt's great to be able to get on the track some, run some laps before the season starts, get to work with my guys again and kind of get in the groove, he said. It's been a real good day so far and I'm looking forward to the season getting going. We've only got a few more weeks before we get after it big time (at Daytona).\n\nHe plans to return at Daytona International Speedway in the Daytona 500 on Feb. 26 (Fox, 2 p.m. ET) for his first points-paying Cup race since early July.\n\nAsked if it was an emotional moment or just another day at the track, Earnhardt said, No, not really. Actually, I was just super happy, probably more so than usual. The guys were pumped. The day's been going well, we're learning some stuff and we've had good speed. … The car feels good and I felt great in the car.\n\nDealing with ongoing concussion symptoms didn't feel great at all. It's been a long road back, Earnhardt said, and he used the time between the fog and the headaches to consider his future. And not just retirement.\n\nYeah, you contemplate everything, Earnhardt said. You've got to do what's right for your health and your body and make the best decision you can for yourself. It affects a lot more people than just you, though. You've got to make the right decision that's going to be right for the long haul.\n\nOne thing that helped was attending an October race at Dover, Del., where he watched from the pit box as four-time Cup champion Jeff Gordon, who had retired from racing in 2015, filled in behind the wheel. Alex Bowman split time with Gordon as Earnhardt's replacement drivers. Watching that particular race in Dover, however, was an out-of-body experience to Earnhardt.\n\nIt just really gave me a unique perspective on just being a fan and being a pair of eyes in the garage, getting out of the suit and seeing it from that vantage point and watching everybody operate, he said. It was just really impressive. You can't see that when you're actually in there doing it, when you're in the middle of it. You just can't really see how everything is moving all along, so I enjoyed it. It was fun.\n\nMORE NASCAR COVERAGE:\n\nJames: Dale Earnhardt Jr. relishes chance to return on his terms\n\nDale Earnhardt Jr. envies Jimmie Johnson's beard game\n\nEarnhardt said he'll know when it's time to retire when racing is no longer fun, when it takes too much effort to keep up with the schedule and be away from home for so long.\n\nI guess you show up and don't enjoy it one day, I don't know, he said. There's been a lot of races where we didn't end up where we wanted to and weren't that fun because of circumstances. But you're never just generally in the car not having fun, not enjoying it. Once that starts happening, I think you've got to think about doing something else.\n\nThere's always that humongous, fun treehouse in Mooresville if the former Peter Pan of NASCAR wants to be a kid again for a spell. That, or he can just drive through the woods and take a gander at his collection of wrecked race cars – those belonging to him and others from the racing world.\n\nWhich place does he like the best?\n\nThe old race car junkyard is a lot of fun. It never gets old riding around looking at some of that stuff, Earnhardt said. You always see something new. There's probably 60 to 80 out there in the woods on about 70 acres. The treehouse is great, though. It's hard to beat that treehouse. I spent the night before my wedding up there by myself.\n\nPerfect place to be the day before a kid becomes a man.\n\nMcManaman writes for the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nFollow him on Twitter @azbobbymac\n\nPHOTOS: DALE EARNHARDT JR.

Robert Bianco\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSo many paths, so little time.\n\nWhatever you may think of the quality of TV shows these days, there's no debating their abundance: Week after week, hour after hour, on outlet after outlet, new series arrive. Lines must be drawn, which means that despite a trio of top stars — Aaron Paul, Hugh Dancy and Michelle Monaghan — and an admirably unusual premise, Hulu's The Path (Wednesday, ** ½ out of four) simply may not be one you want to follow.\n\nThe Path, created by Jessica Goldberg, explores the communal lives and faith of the followers of Meyerism — a made-up religion that seems to be a combination of Scientology, EST and New Age veganism. Living together on a compound, these Meyerists are both intensely private and intensely committed, shunning publicity as they follow the Ladder toward the Light.\n\nBut change is in the wind. The religion's founding father is in Peru and out of touch, leaving day-to-day operations in the hands of Cal (Dancy), who thinks Meyerism needs to stop hiding its Light under a bushel.\n\nThat switch does not sit well with Sarah (Monaghan), but she has more immediate problems. Her husband, Eddie (Paul), has returned from Peru troubled and distant — the result, she thinks, of a sexual affair. The truth, which Eddie keeps to himself, is that something has rocked his faith.\n\nAaron Paul loses his religion in Hulu's 'The Path'\n\nHulu forges 'Path' to a cult phenomenon\n\nThere are interesting questions here, including how we decide what we're willing to embrace (or at least accord grudging respect) as a religion and what we dismiss as a cult. And respect is the watchword here: While we're clearly meant to see worrisome aspects in Meyerism — led by the use of force to retain straying members — it's just as clear that we're not meant to mock its followers. There are, after all, worse sins in life than being painfully earnest.\n\nIn TV, however, there are few worse sins than being uninvolving — and despite the best efforts of a strong cast, that's where The Path lands. Lives and happiness are at stake here, yet the dramatic stakes somehow linger between low and medium. Monaghan's Sarah is a blind zealot; Paul's Eddie is a liar who allows his wife to suffer under the belief that he has been unfaithful rather then admit he's questioning his faith. No matter how much these two lovely people love each other, this is not a marriage we're left crying out to see saved.\n\nWorse yet for the show's dramatic purposes, the belief system they're battling over is so indistinct that it barely exists. The cult emerges as a hazy, marijuana-drenched mix of dated clichés, kept vague, perhaps, to avoid offense to any particular group. We're meant to be moved by the power of faith rather than faith itself, but that's a fine line for a series that gives us too little of substance or interest to hang on to otherwise.\n\nOn the plus side, Hulu is giving you only two hour-long episodes Wednesday, with the other eight to follow on a weekly basis. That limited commitment leaves you a week to decide whether you want to return.\n\nI wouldn't, but hey: Your time; your path.
SALINA, Kan. – Albert Bert and Carol Stevenson met later in life, after previous marriages that happened years before, at a Kansas restaurant in 2009. The couple loved to camp and go on their pontoon across the lake.\n\nThey said they were just going to date, then my dad ended up moving into the house with her, said Bert's daughter Sharolyn Hoffman, of Salina, Kansas.\n\nThey said they were too old to get married, and one day they called me and told me they were getting married. I thought they were joking, Hoffman said. Turns out they were not.\n\nThe couple both tested positive for the coronavirus at the end of December and started out the new year battling the virus.\n\nAfter nearly two weeks of several ups and downs, they died less than two hours apart while holding each other's hands in bed at the Salina Regional Health Center.\n\nBefore marriage\n\nBert, who had two marriages before finding Carol, met her when he was starting to accept that his Alzheimer's disease was going to have a major effect on his life.\n\nBert was a recovered alcoholic for 39 years, who helped with AA meetings in Salina and was a mentor to a lot of people, said Nicke Stevenson, Bert's daughter-in-law. When you asked him how he was doing, he would say 'Better than I deserve' every time.\n\nCarol also had two previous marriages. She has two daughters, both of whom live in the Seattle area.\n\nMy mother was living in the moment, very strong, super sweet, probably the nicest person I ever met, said Pennie Pickering. She outlived her first two husbands, and was a caretaker for both husbands. She really had a reputation of being a caretaker. She always had children in her life. She has always been a mother or grandmother and is the favorite aunt to a lot family.\n\nTogether, the couple has more than a dozen grandchildren, and Carol has several great-grandchildren.\n\nWhen they were first dating, I was visiting my mother for a couple of weeks, said Carol's daughter Jody Lentz. She was telling me that Bert was really nervous to meet me and I told her that was kind of funny as I was a little nervous to meet him for the first time.\n\nThe wedding day\n\nThe couple married on June 30, 2012, on a warm summer day at Carol's homestead near Kanopolis Lake in Kansas. Carol was 72, while Bert was 69.\n\nBert, who sings exactly like Elvis Presley, sang Elvis' Hawaiian Wedding Song, which was in the film Blue Hawaii.\n\nBert always loved to sing Elvis songs, he was good at it, Hoffman said. We had a big shindig for them. Carol's family came from Washington, it was hotter than donut glaze, but it was a great time.\n\nShelli Redden, Bert's daughter, remembers the love and compassion they had for one another.\n\nHe (Bert) would have never let us kids take care of him, especially when he got further into having his Alzheimer's, she said. Carol saved his life, because he allowed her into his life and let her take care of him. He was able to do things that he would not have been able to do if he did not have his partner with him. She loved him unconditionally, she knew what she was getting into.\n\nRedden said family members asked her several times if she wanted to marry Bert, not because we did not want her to marry him, but because she was marrying a man who was struggling with this disease and we knew it was going to be hard.\n\nFamily members knew his Alzheimer's was not going to get any better, but Carol went into it with her eyes wide open, Redden said.\n\nWhen you were around them, you knew they were in love. The smiles on their faces, the way they treated each other and took care of each other, Redden said. Carol really brought all of us back together.\n\nVoices:We were cautious. And yet, somehow, my entire household got COVID-19.\n\nTraveling to see family and dancing to Elvis\n\nA favorite pastime of Bert and Carol's was to travel and see family, so much so they bought a motorhome to help accommodate their travel. Most of the time, their designations were not tourist attractions, but where they had family they could visit.\n\nWe have family in seven states and all over the country. Their fun pastime was going out with family. She (was) constantly doing things with family, they were going to events. They traveled out here to come see us, said Pickering.\n\nIt did not matter which restaurant or what environment they were in. If Elvis was playing, they would always get up and dance. Sometimes they would be the only ones dancing, but they were fun to watch, said Lentz.\n\nHow they got COVID-19\n\nThe couple went to a family Christmas Eve gathering, and on Dec. 26th they were diagnosed with the coronavirus.\n\nMy mother knew of the risk, but she could not help herself. She had to give presents, Pickering said. Christmas is a big deal for her to see family. They were literally 30 days from being vaccinated and they had made it since early March of quarantining. ... They were in the high age-risk group, with a few prior medical issues.\n\nPickering said Carol was warned by several family members that it was not a good idea to go to a family gathering for the holidays, but she went.\n\nTheir fight together\n\nAfter testing positive for the virus, the couple both had their good days and their bad days in fighting the virus.\n\nCarol's blood pressure started going up, said Bert's daughter-in-law, Nicke Stevenson. Both of them went to the ER together and both of them got released from the hospital. New Year's Eve, we thought they were doing pretty good.\n\nDoug and Nicke Stevenson gave them as much care as they possibly could.\n\nIt was a rollercoaster ride for the past two weeks. They went to the hospital three times. The staff at the Salina Regional Health Center did a phenomenal job. There were three or four individuals working there that I cannot thank enough. We had a lot of ups and downs, Doug Stevenson said.\n\nBert was sedated for three days with COVID-19. The virus made his Alzheimer's worse.\n\nDad with the Alzheimer's did not know who we were. He had lost his awareness of who we were, but I think he knew we belonged to him, said Redden.\n\nThere were over 100 people in our text chain when they were sick, said Pickering.\n\nAfter fighting for a week and a half, the couple died within two hours of each other while holding hands at the hospital – on Elvis Presley's birthday, Jan. 8.\n\nI talked to her the night before, they talked about putting her on a ventilator. They both loved Elvis Presley. It is sad, but the way they went was really good, said Jan Lytle, a niece-in-law to Bert.\n\nRedden decided to play music on her phone in the last few hours with the couple.\n\nThey wanted to go out of the world together and they were able to. It was devastating, but at least they were together, she said.\n\nCarol died when the song Stand By Me by Ben E. King played, less than two hours before Bert.\n\nWe were all in the same room as they were holding hands. Dad passed away to a song of Elvis, 'My Way,' which was another poignant moment for us. Even though we were not ready for them to go, they both went out on their own songs and on their own way, said Redden.\n\nThere were lots of tears, nurses were crying with us. The nurses were amazing, they helped us every step of the way.\n\nThe family is planning on having a celebration for Bert and Carol on the Fourth of July weekend.\n\nWe have family in seven states and all over the country, Pickering said.\n\nMy dad always said he did not want a funeral, he wanted a party, said Redden. They both loved to sing and dance. We cannot do it now; we hope by July things will be safe and we can gather together with family and friends.\n\nFollow the Salina Journal on Twitter: @salinajournal\n\nCoronavirus Watch newsletter:Sign up for daily updates right in your inbox\n\nShould you wear a mask after getting a COVID-19 vaccine?:5 reasons why the answer is 'Yes.'
For the Record\n\nTwo Republicans, somewhat alike in dignity, in fair Washington, where we lay our scene. A pair of star-cross'd politicians met in real life, who hope to with their meeting bury their party's strife.\n\nDonald Trump and Paul Ryan met Thursday. It was dramatic. Shakespearan, even. And like two of the Bard's characters of yore, Trump and Ryan pledged their undying devotion (to work together for Republicans this fall).\n\nHere are all the theatrics in today's For the Record, the politics newsletter from USA TODAY.\n\nTrump and Ryan are now seeing each other; Ryan does not DTR\n\nAs we previewed yesterday, Trump and Ryan swiped right (though not too far right) and met up to see see if they had any connection.\n\nAt stake: The unity of the Republican party, perhaps, should Trump become president and Ryan remain House speaker. The result: It's complicated.\n\nWe're off to a very good start, said Ryan, who added that he and Trump plan on seeing each other again. But Ryan still hasn't formally endorsed Trump, making this whole thing feel more like an arranged marriage.\n\nOver the course of 45 minutes, Trump and Ryan chatted about free trade, immigration, party unity and probably their hobbies. Reince Priebus, dad of the GOP, chaperoned the whole thing (ugh, so embarrassing) but the Republican national chairman issued his approval:\n\nThe meeting was great, Priebus tweeted. #ProudDad\n\nThis is the real life. It's not just fantasy.\n\nWe've watched the nation move through the five stages of grief since Trump closed in on the GOP, from denial to anger and bargaining to depression. Now, one step remains: acceptance.\n\nCue Lindsey Graham, the GOP senator who once likened a Trump nomination to being shot or poisoned.\n\nGraham spoke with Trump Wednesday, he said, calling the conversation cordial and pleasant. And while Graham congratulated Trump on becoming the face of the GOP, Graham still says he won't vote for him.\n\nAlso not endorsing Trump: George H.W. Bush. But Bush's former V.P.? Sure, why not.\n\nDan Quayle praised Trump on the Today show Thursday, claiming he is more qualified to be president than Hillary Clinton because voters' main qualification is that a candidate not be qualified to be president. Makes sense, actually.\n\nBernie Sanders' plan for New Jersey: Get a 28-year-old to run for sheriff\n\nWith only a narrow path to the nomination (by his words, not ours), Bernie Sanders is still hustling in early states and picking up some primary wins. His real goal: to beef up his delegate count, giving him more sway to shape his party's platform at the Democratic convention this summer.\n\nHe looks now to the June 7 primary in New Jersey, a state whose wacky ballot system requires Sanders to get a 28-year-old guy named Alex to run for sheriff. Alex doesn't want to be a sheriff. Alex doesn't think he'll be a sheriff. But such is this convoluted process we call democracy.\n\nMore from the campaign trail\n\nGet ready for (one, maybe two?) decades of constant Ted Cruz burns\n\nMemo to Ted Cruz: You may be out of the 2016 race. You may be back to running for Senate. But you'll never be free from the scorn of John Boehner. He's retired, has plenty of free time, and seems committed to publicly insulting you at every opportunity for the rest of his days.
Lisa Bitel\n\nPRI.org\n\nValentine's Day originated as a liturgical feast to celebrate the decapitation of a third-century Christian martyr, or perhaps two. So, how did we get from beheading to betrothing on Valentine's Day?\n\nEarly origins of St. Valentine\n\nAncient sources reveal that there were several St. Valentines who died on Feb. 14. Two of them were executed during the reign of Roman Emperor Claudius Gothicus in 269-270 A.D., at a time when persecution of Christians was common.\n\nHow do we know this? Because an order of Belgian monks spent three centuries collecting evidence for the lives of saints from manuscript archives around the known world.\n\nThey were called Bollandists after Jean Bolland, a Jesuit scholar who began publishing the massive 68-folio volumes of Acta Sanctorum, or Lives of the Saints, beginning in 1643.\n\nSince then, successive generations of monks continued the work until the last volume was published in 1940. The Brothers dug up every scrap of information about every saint on the liturgical calendar and printed the texts arranged according to the saint's feast day.\n\nThe Valentine martyrs\n\nThe volume encompassing Feb. 14 contains the stories of a handful of Valentini, including the earliest three of whom died in the third century.\n\nThe earliest Valentinus is said to have died in Africa, along with 24 soldiers. Unfortunately, even the Bollandists could not find any more information about him. As the monks knew, sometimes all that the saints left behind was a name and day of death.\n\nWe know only a little more about the other two Valentines.\n\nAccording to a late medieval legend reprinted in the Acta, which was accompanied by Bollandist critique about its historical value, a Roman priest named Valentinus was arrested during the reign of Emperor Gothicus and put into the custody of an aristocrat named Asterius.\n\nAs the story goes, Asterius made the mistake of letting the preacher talk. Father Valentinus went on and on about Christ leading pagansout of the shadow of darkness and into the light of truth and salvation. Asterius made a bargain with Valentinus: If the Christian could cure Asterius's foster-daughter of blindness, he would convert. Valentinus put his hands over the girl's eyes and chanted:\n\nLord Jesus Christ, en-lighten your handmaid, because you are God, the True Light.\n\nEasy as that. The child could see, according to the medieval legend. Asterius and his whole family were baptized. Unfortunately, when Emperor Gothicus heard the news, he ordered them all to be executed. But Valentinus was the only one to be beheaded. A pious widow, though, made off with his body and had it buried at the site of his martyrdom on the Via Flaminia, the ancient highway stretching from Rome to present-day Rimini. Later, a chapel was built over the saint's remains.\n\nSt. Valentine was not a romantic\n\nThe third third-century Valentinus was a bishop of Terni in the province of Umbria, Italy.\n\nAccording to his equally dodgy legend, Terni's bishop got into a situation like the other Valentinus by debating a potential convert and afterward healing his son. The rest of story is quite similar as well: He too was beheaded on the orders of Emperor Gothicus and his body buried along the Via Flaminia.\n\nIt is likely, as the Bollandists suggested, that there weren't actually two decapitated Valentines, but that two different versions of one saint's legend appeared in both Rome and Terni.\n\nNonetheless, African, Roman or Umbrian, none of the Valentines seems to have been a romantic.\n\nIndeed, medieval legends, repeated in modern media, had St. Valentine performing Christian marriage rituals or passing notes between Christian lovers jailed by Gothicus. Still other stories romantically involved him with the blind girl whom he allegedly healed. Yet none of these medieval tales had any basis in third-century history, as the Bollandists pointed out.\n\nIn any case, historical veracity did not count for much with medieval Christians. What they cared about were stories of miracles and martyrdoms and the physical remains or relics of the saint. To be sure, many different churches and monasteries around medieval Europe claimed to have bits of a St. Valentinus' skull in their treasuries.\n\nSanta Maria in Cosmedin in Rome, for example, still displays a whole skull. According to the Bollandists, other churches across Europe also claim to own slivers and bits of one or the other St. Valentinus' body: For example, San Anton Church in Madrid, Whitefriar Street Church in Dublin, the Church of Sts. Peter and Paul in Prague, Saint Mary's Assumption in Chelmno, Poland, as well as churches in Malta, Birmingham, Glasgow, and on the Greek isle of Lesbos, among others.\n\nFor believers, relics of the martyrs signified the saints' continuing their invisible presence among communities of pious Christians. In 11th-century Brittany, for instance, one bishop used what was purported to be Valentine's head to halt fires, prevent epidemics and cure all sorts of illnesses, including demonic possession.\n\nAs far as we know, though, the saint's bones did nothing special for lovers.\n\nUnlikely pagan origins\n\nMany scholars have deconstructed Valentine and his day in books, articles and blog postings. Some suggest that the modern holiday is a Christian cover-up of the more ancient Roman celebration of Lupercalia in mid-February.\n\nLupercalia originated as a ritual in a rural masculine cult involving the sacrifice of goats and dogs and evolved later into an urban carnival. During the festivities half-naked young men ran through the streets of Rome, streaking people with thongs cut from the skins of newly killed goats. Pregnant women thought it brought them healthy babies. In 496 A.D., however, Pope Gelasius supposedly denounced the rowdy festival.\n\nStill, there is no evidence that the pope purposely replaced Lupercalia with the more sedate cult of the martyred St. Valentine or any other Christian celebration.\n\nChaucer and the love birds\n\nThe love connection probably appeared more than a thousand years after the martyrs' death, when Geoffrey Chaucer, author of The Canterbury Tales decreed the February feast of St. Valentinus to the mating of birds. He wrote in his Parlement of Foules:\n\nFor this was on seynt Volantynys day. Whan euery bryd comyth there to chese his make.\n\nIt seems that, in Chaucer's day, English birds paired off to produce eggs in February. Soon, nature-minded European nobility began sending love notes during bird-mating season. For example, the French Duke of Orléans, who spent some years as a prisoner in the Tower of London, wrote to his wife in February 1415 that he was already sick of love — by which he meant lovesick. And he called her his very gentle Valentine.\n\nEnglish audiences embraced the idea of February mating. Shakespeare's lovestruck Ophelia spoke of herself as Hamlet's Valentine.\n\nIn the following centuries, Englishmen and women began using Feb. 14 as an excuse to pen verses to their love objects. Industrialization made it easier with mass-produced illustrated cards adorned with smarmy poetry. Then along came Cadbury, Hershey's, and other chocolate manufacturers marketing sweets for one's sweetheart on Valentine's Day.\n\nToday, shops everywhere in England and the US decorate their windows with hearts and banners proclaiming the annual Day of Love. Merchants stock their shelves with candy, jewelry and Cupid-related trinkets begging Be My Valentine. For most lovers, this request does not require beheading.\n\nInvisible Valentines\n\nIt seems that the erstwhile saint behind the holiday of love remains as elusive as love itself. Still, as St. Augustine, the great fifth-century theologian and philosopher argued in his treatise on Faith in Invisible Things, someone does not have to be standing before our eyes for us to love them.\n\nAnd much like love itself, St. Valentine and his reputation as the patron saint of love are not matters of verifiable history, but of faith.\n\nLisa Bitel, Professor of History & Religion, University of Southern California – Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

Jaleesa M. Jones\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nRemember he was straying from home? And Where I Wanna Be was his favorite song? Well, it appears that J. Cole is no longer on his Donnell Jones.\n\nDuring #MLKNow, a live-streamed special commemorating the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Creed director Ryan Coogler attempted to interview Cole and inadvertently put the 2014 Forest Hills Drive rapper on front street.\n\nHow did getting married change you, bro? he asked.\n\n#PAUSE. He's married? Since when?!\n\nEven Cole seemed to forget (to tell his fans, anyway). As he grasped for words, Coogler chimed in sheepishly: I told you I never interviewed somebody before. Is that off-limits? Oh, my bad, bruh!\n\nThat was like one thing to not do, Cole said. No, I'm just joking. I'm joking. It's all good...They know now.\n\nWhat? That it's a Cole world and all our Dreams are now dead? Yes. Yes, we do.
Sara M Moniuszko\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nMarriage as political act? Ruby Rose thinks it can be.\n\nIn Cosmopolitan's March issue, the Orange is the New Black star shares\n\nWhen you don't have equal rights, it trickles down to kids who think, 'My aunt's gay so she can't get married, or I'm weird because I feel the same way,' she said. So it's important to break down that barrier. I'm more interested in having a loving, healthy, long-term relationship with someone I might want to have kids with someday.\n\nHear that, ladies?\n\nThe Australian actress and model, who is known in part for her androgynous style and gender fluidity, also said she feels blessed to be confident and in tune with her sexuality, noting how that can be difficult for people in different places around the world.\n\nI'm lucky I can explore, she said. I have a very healthy sex life, and there's something very empowering, strong and feminist about being open and comfortable in that world.\n\nAnother place she seems to feel open and comfortable is on social media.\n\nShe explained that she's always going to be vocal online about things like LGBTQ and animal rights, but knows she's another voice amongst other opinions.\n\nI have a platform and I can open up a dialogue, but I also know that I'm just an actor. I'm just another person with an option no better than anyone else's opinion, she said. I don't overanalyze. I just write from the heart, post it and hope for the best.\n\nRose's cover issue is on newsstands Feb. 7.
Andrea Mandell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. – To date, a few viral karaoke videos have been the most the world has heard Tom Hiddleston sing.\n\nThat will change Friday, when Hiddleston, 35, makes his debut in the Hank Williams biopic I Saw the Light, in which he impressively adopts the country legend's distinct warble. He laughs. I apologize unreservedly for those, the British actor says on a warm day in Los Angeles. Professionally, I haven't really sang before, he says. I mean I was in musicals (in school), but I was always a singing actor. I was never in a band, I was never in the choir or anything like that.\n\nI Saw the Light is full of tumult, genius and pain, chronicling the country legend's six years in infamy as Williams charted 33 hit singles, until he died abruptly at the age of 29 in the backseat of a Cadillac in 1953.\n\nInside Tom Hiddleston's very big spring\n\nI thought about this a lot, says Hiddleston. You think of all of those people who burned twice as bright but not for long, like Janis Joplin and Amy Winehouse and James Dean and Marilyn Monroe and Kurt Cobain and Jimi Hendrix. There's a club, what do they call it, the 27 club or something? Heath Ledger was 27.\n\nHe continues: They become canonized, because they lived at a pitch of such intensity just before the lights went out. And they become frozen in time, so there is never a moment where you see the maturation of their talent or their personality. In some respects, it's basically a tragedy because you don't know where they would have gone or how they would have developed.\n\nMore than 60 years have passed since Williams' death, and classics like Your Cheatin' Heart, I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry and Cold, Cold Heart still play on the radio.\n\nI Saw the Light, which received shaky reviews at its debut at the Toronto Film Festival, despite applause for Hiddleston's performance, charts the genesis of those songs, while folding in Williams' tumultuous marriage to Audrey Williams (Elizabeth Olsen), his unreliability and the ultimately fatal mix of alcohol and drugs he used in part to control chronic pain caused by spina bifida.\n\nHiddleston, who has become beloved to Marvel fans worldwide as the impish god Loki, embedded himself in Nashville for five weeks to get Williams right.\n\nSee Tom Hiddleston shimmy like Hank Williams\n\nThere were some dark days where I just wasn't sure if I was going to get it, he admits. There was a moment where I canceled everything. I canceled my life, I didn't pick up the phone, I didn't do anything else but what was related to Hank.\n\nHe puts a lot of pressure on himself with everything he does, says Olsen, adding that Hiddleston took on responsibility to do right by Williams' legacy and family.\n\nSkill-wise, director Marc Abraham calls Hiddleston so facile it's infuriating. That means on-set instead of staying in character, the actor easily switched between dialects. Let's put it this way: When we would have a disagreement about how something was coming down, he reverted to the king's English, the director laughs.\n\nNow, despite big-budget films such asThor: Ragnarok and Kong: Skull Island in the wings, it's Williams who stayed with Hiddleston. Looking back at it, it was one of the most fulfilling things I've ever done, he says.
Sandra Harwitt\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nMELBOURNE — If history can be relied on then Serena Williams can count on at least reaching the Australian Open semifinals this year.\n\nThe 16th-seeded Williams organized that possible good fortune when she defeated 79th-ranked Genie Bouchard of Canada 6-2, 6-2 in the second round Thursday.\n\nBouchard, an Australian Open semifinalist in 2014, has played in the main draw in Melbourne on six occasions and all five previous opponents she's lost to have gone on to at least the semifinals.\n\nOf course, a semifinal showing is hardly the result Williams is looking for in Melbourne. A 23-time Grand Slam champion, with an Open Era record of seven Australian Open victories, Williams lives to successfully reach the finish line at every tournament she plays.\n\nWhile she understands that try as she might she can't win everything, it doesn't mean she has to love that reality.\n\nI do my best, said Williams, who won her last major while pregnant at the 2017 Australian Open. I don't obviously win them all or I'd have, like, 80 Grand Slams. But I do my best to win the ones I can. Obviously if I don't win, I go home. I go back to the drawing board. I see what I can do better. I come back. That's all I can do.\n\nThat's the strategy she's employing here after failing to hoist the trophy at Wimbledon and the US Open last year, where she lost in the finals to Angelique Kerber and Naomi Osaka, respectively.\n\nWilliams, 37, believes it's innate that she has the attitude of wanting to do it all and do it well — tennis career, small-business owner in the fashion industry, wife, mother.\n\nMore:Venus Williams loves her niece's Qai Qai doll as much as social media does\n\nMore:Doll Qai Qai holds special place in Serena Williams' family\n\nI need to be busy because, like, I have so much energy, she said. I always thought the older I get, the more calm I'll get. I feel like it's kind of going opposite. I keep getting more energy. It's crazy.\n\nDisregarding fame and fortune, Williams lumps herself together with the vast majority of people.\n\nI'm not doing anything special, she said. I'm just doing what I felt like working parents do, she said. They make it work. I'm just like literally everyone else. I'm making it work. It's not easy. But I have to do, as a mom and wife, what I have to do.\n\nAs someone who lives to rewrite history, Williams' most pressing goal at the moment is to tie the record of 24 Grand Slam singles trophies won by former Australian Margaret Court.\n\nIf she does accomplish the feat of tying the record here, Court is not expected to be in the crowd to applaud the achievement.\n\nA preacher who speaks out against homosexuality and the change of law that made same-sex marriage legal in Australia, Court's views are not popular in tennis circles. Last year many players and fans called for the renaming of the Margaret Court Arena here at Melbourne Park.\n\nIn the third round, Williams will play Ukrainian Dayana Yastremska, who upset 23rd-seeded Carla Suarez Navarro of Spain, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1. If she wins that match, a fourth-round encounter awaits against either Venus Williams or No. 1 Simona Halep.
Corey Anderson was eager to let people know that there are levels to this game.\n\nDisrespected going into the fight, Anderson (13-4 MMA, 10-4 UFC) had a point to prove when he was matched up with highly-touted rising star Johnny Walker at this past November's UFC 244. Anderson, who had been continuously campaigning for a title shot, was the betting underdog going into the fight, but it wouldn't take long for him to prove his point.\n\nRound 1 started with Walker delivering his patented fakes and awkward movements, switching stances back and forth. Anderson would eventually charge forward, grabbing Walker's leg and stacking him against the cage to work for a takedown.\n\nWalker stuffed the first takedown attempt, a good early sign, but just seconds later, Anderson cracked Walker with a big overhand right, followed by a few shots that didn't fully connect, but ended the combination with a left hook that dropped Walker to the floor.\n\nAnderson made sure not to let Walker off the hook, pouring it on, even as Walker made his way back to his feet. He would take him right back down, dropping some more ground and pound. Walker was in survival mode, stumbling all over the place, until he was met with another big right hand, and the referee stopped the fight with Walker almost out on his feet.\n\nAn infuriated Anderson taunted his way across the cage, screaming in Walker's face, and even mocking his celebratory dance. Big city, bright lights, and Anderson was not going to be denied.\n\nAnderson returns to action this Saturday in the UFC on ESPN+ 25 headliner in Rio Rancho, N.M., when he rematches Jan Blachowicz in what could very well be a No. 1 contender fight.\n\nAnderson won their first meeting in 2015 at UFC 191 via unanimous decision, and he looks to replicate his performance on Feb. 15. Before then, check out the video above to watch Anderson's big finish over Walker.
Maria Puente\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nTheir wedding was spectacular, their happiness plain, and five years on, Prince William and the former Kate Middleton are still living the blissful life.\n\nThe fifth anniversary of the nuptials watched by multiple millions around the world is Friday, which seems like a good time to contemplate the state of their union — and the state of their royal brand.\n\nBoth seem to be more than sound: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, a future king and his queen consort, appear to be still in love and very happy together. As such they remain the most-watched members of the royal family after granny Queen Elizabeth II, who just turned 90.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II marks 90th birthday on Thursday\n\nOnly one thing could rival the couple's dominance, says CNN royal commentator Victoria Arbiter, who grew up the daughter of a royal press secretary.\n\nPrince Harry getting married would be the only thing that could take away the attention, she jokes. (Don't hold your breath: Harry, 31, is too busy even to have a girlfriend lately.)\n\nBut Will and Kate are really important to Britain, says royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith, author of a forthcoming book on Prince Charles. They are the faces of the future of the monarchy in the new generation.\n\nTheir appeal is obvious: They are a young couple with two young children, and appear to be a 'normal' couple that people (in the U.K. and abroad) can relate to, says Charlie Proctor, editor-in-chief of Royal Central, a leading royal-news website in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Cambridges remain incredibly popular, says Charlotte Crawley, who runs the British blog HRHDuchessKate, a must-read for Kate watchers. People who meet them find them very personable and engaging — their story has resonated globally and they have fans from all over the world. On the blog, over 50% of readers are from the U.S.\n\nDuring their recent six-day state visit to India and Bhutan, the pair looked to be endearingly affectionate judging from little signs: He, lightly, protectively touching her back, she, leaning in close to him to talk and laugh.\n\nThey seemed to be in a permanent state of delight as they traveled around India and the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, doing their royal thing: meeting excited well-wishers and laying wreaths, feeding baby elephants and rhinos, hiking hours up to monastery on a mountain, and posing at the Taj Mahal, the world's most famous monument to love.\n\nThey are clearly a couple very much in love, Crawley says. They are very natural together, very much at ease, and I would say they bring out the best in each other.\n\nWill and Kate's visit to Taj Mahal may banish sad memories of Princess Diana\n\nWhy does it matter? Some will remember that at this point in Will's parents' marriage, the relationship between Prince Charles and Princess Diana was already beginning to fray, although the public didn't know it yet.\n\nIt was an entirely different story for Charles and Diana, as their marriage was fraught with problems and professional jealousy, Crawley says. With the Cambridges, it's a very successful partnership.\n\nSo it's likely to be a happy anniversary for Will, 33, and Kate, 34. As with the previous four anniversaries, it is expected to be privately celebrated with few details released by their media team at Kensington Palace.\n\nFrom a royal point of view, the couple have already achieved one of their most important duties: They have produced an heir and a spare. Three days after the anniversary, on May 2, their second child, Princess Charlotte, turns 1 year old. And on July 22, their first child and third-in-line to the throne, Prince George, turns 3.\n\nExpect more pictures (many fans can't get enough) of both children, probably some by keen photographer Duchess Kate herself.\n\nBut even the most popular royals can't escape some criticism, and lately the Cambridges have heard some, especially in the British media, about not working hard enough, not being transparent enough, blowing off some royal engagements and, worst of all, blowing off the hometown media.\n\nWill & Kate set to depart for India, leaving carping critics behind\n\nSmith says the Cambridges are feeling their way, trying to find a balance between their royal duty to be visible in public and their desire for as normal a life as possible for their family — in an age of 24-7 social media scrutiny. So far, Smith thinks, they have handled themselves well, have not put a foot wrong as the British say.\n\nThey are trying to preserve their family life, just as then-Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip, early in their marriage, were allowed to preserve their family life in the few years they had before she became queen, Smith says.\n\nAs a young mum, Kate would be criticized today if she were perceived as neglecting her children for months-long overseas trips, as was routine when the queen was a young mother in the 1950s, says Smith, also the author of an acclaimed biography of the queen.\n\nThey're hands-on parents, very involved in their children's lives, Smith says. And everyone agrees that parents who are engaged with kids, particularly in the early years, are to be applauded.\n\nStill, for the monarchy to remain respected, beloved and financially supported in modern Britain, there is a risk when royal heirs choose privacy too often over public accountability, says Express royal correspondent Richard Palmer.\n\nMy fear is that if William, Kate, and Harry continue at their current level of involvement in official royal duties and try to shut off the rest of their lives from the public for the next decade, there will be little left to interest people, Palmer says.\n\nArbiter, for one, thinks that Will and Kate and their advisers are fully aware of such pitfalls, and are prepared.\n\nThe last few months have been quite good for them — they realize they are not infallible, that they need to take advice and to make sensible choices, she says. No one can keep an upward trajectory forever... They're just going to have to step up in a bigger capacity at home, because people want to see them and the children more.
Derek Jeter won't be the first player elected to baseball's Hall of Fame in unanimous fashion. His old New York Yankee teammate, Mariano Rivera, beat him to that distinction just a year ago.\n\nYet, as ballots are tallied in January and induction ensues on July 26 in Cooperstown, Jeter, unanimous or not, will represent a final checkpoint in baseball's shrine: the last Hall of Famer for whom widespread fame was truly a part of the equation.\n\nWhile advanced metrics and a general sense he was merely an average defensive shortstop have haunted Jeter the past two decades, he is objectively, overwhelmingly qualified for Cooperstown. With 3,465 hits and a .310 average over 20 seasons, and a postseason dossier extensive enough to comprise a 21st season, Jeter has more than enough ammo to quiet the naysayers.\n\nHe will have his day at the Hall, and if his 2014 farewell tour is any indication, the grassy expanses of Cooperstown will be overflowing with pinstriped and gray No. 2 jerseys. And as the final single numeral in Yankee history enters Cooperstown, it in a way closes the book on an era when baseball – and its greatest stars – enjoyed a prominent place in the nation's zeitgeist.\n\nOh, we're not here to weep for baseball. With industry revenues approaching $11 billion, nobody is going broke. With countless ways to access the game – via mobile apps, social media channels or even still through the magic of television – today's big leaguers can touch many more corners of the world than their predecessors.\n\nYet since the time Jeter first stepped on the field in 1995 to this year when he'll earn Hall of Fame induction, baseball has faced a vexing and ruthless dichotomy: As it stacks cash, it withers away cultural currency.\n\nMuch has been made of Major League Baseball's inability to market its stars, and many of those critiques are fair. Yet, consider the cultural landscape in 1996, when Jeter claimed AL Rookie of the Year honors and the first of five championships with the Yankees, and today.\n\nJeter and the Yankees' Game 6 conquest of the Atlanta Braves was watched by 30.4 million people, earning a 19.1 rating and 34 audience share, according to Nielsen. The four top-rated shows that week? World Series Game 5, Game 6, Game 4 and Game 3.\n\nGame 2 ranked ninth that week but it drew 19.4 million viewers and a 14 rating, out-drawing Monday Night Football's 17.8/12, and relegating MNF – entrenched on ABC for 25 years at that point – to a 19th-place finish.\n\nThis year? The Nationals and Astros provided a compelling and occasionally controversial seven-game drama that was a delight for baseball aficionados – but a relative blip at the proverbial water cooler.\n\nSome 23 million viewers watched the decisive Game 7, but the Series-wide numbers were cut almost exactly in half from Jeter's Fall Classic debut: An 8.1 rating, a 16 share, with 13.9 million average viewers, compared to 17.4/29/25.2 million in '96.\n\nThe head-to-head, over-the-air showdown with Big Football also flipped: This year's Game 5 World Series notched a 2.4 rating and 10.2 million viewers, no match for Sunday Night Football's Kansas City-Green Bay tilt that attracted a 5.1 rating and 16.9 million viewers.\n\nOf course, this relevance drain is not unique to baseball, or virtually anything that's not the NFL.\n\nThe same year the Jeter-era Yankees won their first title, NBC's Friends saw its viewership peak at 29.4 million viewers per episode; even still, its 18.7 rating was only good for third place that year, behind ER (22) and Seinfeld (21.2).\n\nYet even as Friends eventually climbed to No. 1, its audience dropped from that point onward, a harbinger of what all media would face in coming decades.\n\nLike World Series ratings, TV's mega-franchises aren't what they were; CBS' The Big Bang Theory finished first, second or third in its last four seasons, but its best rating was just 12.7 in those four years leading up to its 2019 finale.\n\nIn that vein, Sheldon can be No. 1 on a ratings chart, but never connect in a manner Ross and Rachel and Chandler and Monica did – and even still do, in our nostalgia-obsessed present.\n\nSame for Jeter, whose good looks, benign manner and placement on one of the world's most iconic franchises made for a near perfect storm of marketability.\n\nNever mind the decades-long relationships with Gatorade and Nike – where he ranked just below MJ himself on the Jordan Brand masthead. Jeter's borderline A-list status looks even more stark in this era when baseball stars starve for recognition.\n\nHe guested 11 times on David Letterman's show. Sat down with Barbara Walters. Remains the only baseball player ever to host an episode of Saturday Night Live. Made an appearance on Seinfeld and acted alongside Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler and Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell on the silver screen.\n\nLittle wonder, then, that at the time of his retirement, Jeter ranked second to only Peyton Manning among active athletes in name recognition, according to Forbes.\n\nToday's stars are far from that lofty status, even if they're better baseball players than Jeter.\n\nWhile the Q Ratings system is not a perfect science, it's nonetheless notable that three-time AL MVP and burgeoning all-time great Mike Trout is familiar with just 22% of the public, and 50% of sports fans, according to an August survey. (Steph Curry and Drew Brees doubled his number in the former category, and Tom Brady and LeBron James in the latter).\n\nToday's stars may be objectively better baseball players but operate in a far different media landscape than the relatively barren turn-of-the-century world Jeter navigated.\n\nOh, for the days when AOL Instant Messenger was a TV show's or a sport's or a star's chief rival. The Internet, MySpace, Netflix, Facebook, PS1, 2, 3 and 4, the iPhone, Pokemon Go, TikTok – the only guarantee in this environment is audience will be subjected to further fragmentation as new platforms arrive.\n\nThere's a multitude of reasons why baseball – with its slower pace and structure that makes star-making far less conducive than the NBA or NFL - struggles in this environment. TV ratings tell one story; social media followings tell another.\n\nTrout and the occasionally brash Bryce Harper each have 1.7 million Instagram followers. Mookie Betts, an MVP and World Series champion on the highly popular Boston Red Sox, has 691,000.\n\nFor context: LeBron James has 54 million Instagram followers; his 15-year-old son, Bronny, has more than double Trout's total, with 3.9 million. Trout may mean the world to baseball, a far more significant figure than, say, the Utah Jazz's Donovan Mitchell is to the NBA. Yet even Mitchell (2.7 million) enjoys a far healthier social media presence than Trout.\n\nHow would a young Jeter fare in this environment if he debuted in 2016 instead of 1996? Would his high-profile relationships (Mariah Carey, Jessica Biel, Minka Kelly, etc.) help him win the proverbial Internet and burnish his fame?\n\nOr would his reserved public manner, combined with baseball's overall challenge to maintain its foothold in a buzzier, busier world, confine him to fringe celebrity?\n\nRegardless, it still feels as if he's the last of his kind.\n\nTwo years from now, Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz will be eligible for the Hall of Fame, though the former's strong ties with performance-enhancing drugs may keep him out. Both he and Big Papi are certainly recognizable, and the many red carpets in A-Rod's future thanks to his impending marriage to Jennifer Lopez will certainly boost his image.\n\nBeyond that, it seems baseball only has the greatness of its players to rely on, which should be good enough.\n\nComing years will see Carlos Beltran, Adrian Beltre, Chase Utley and Ichiro Suzuki voted into Cooperstown. Fast forward a decade or more, and Trout, Clayton Kershaw, Justin Verlander and other contemporaries will have their day of glory.\n\nAll will be deserving. Many were Jeter's superior on the field.\n\nNone could match his fame, however. And you wonder if anyone ever will.
Maria Puente\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFrom romantic and girlishly demure to knock-out, drop-dead glamour, the late Princess Diana's journey from naive teen to global fashion goddess will be on display at Kensington Palace next year, nearly 20 years after her shocking death.\n\nDiana: Her Fashion Story will open Feb. 24 at the palace, the former home of the late Princess of Wales and the current home of both her sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, and her two grandchildren, Prince George and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge.\n\nThe exhibit, the first Diana-focused show at the palace in 10 years, will trace the evolution of Diana's look and explore how she learned to use her image and her fashion to help showcase the causes she cared about, according to Historic Royal Palaces,the charity that operates royal palaces and estates that also are open to the public as museums.\n\nThe exhibit will explore the story of a young woman who had to quickly learn the rules of royal and diplomatic dressing, who in the process put the spotlight on the British fashion industry and designers, says Eleri Lynn, curator of the show. We see her growing in confidence throughout her life, increasingly taking control of how she was represented, and intelligently communicating through her clothes. This is a story many women around the world can relate to.\n\nThe exhibit will also feature a temporary White Garden, dedicated to her life, image and style, in the palace's historic Sunken Garden, which will be planted with such flowers and foliage as tulips and scented narcisii, a carpet of forget-me-nots and pots of classic English white roses.\n\nBut the main event will be the celebrated outfits from throughout Diana's short public life, from 1981 until she was killed in a Paris car crash on Aug. 31, 1997, at age 36. From glamorous gowns worn in the 1980s after her 1981 marriage to Prince Charles, to the chic Catherine Walker suits she wore on engagements in the 1990s, the exhibit will explore Diana's relationships with her favorite designers through some of their original fashion sketches created for her during the design process.\n\nFamiliar highlights will include the pale pink Emanuel blouse worn for Diana's engagement portrait by Lord Snowdon in 1981; and Victor Edelstein's inky blue velvet gown that she wore to dance with John Travolta at the White House in 1985.\n\nSome outfits are going on public display for the first time, such as a blue tartan Emanuel suit (David and Elizabeth Emanuel also designed her memorably pouf-y wedding gown) that she wore on an official visit to Venice in the 1980s. The suit, a rare survival of Diana's day-wear, was only recently rediscovered and acquired by Historic Royal Palaces at auction.\n\nDiana's clothes and artifacts have been traded at auction for years; just weeks before her death, she auctioned off some of her outfits in New York to raise more than $3 million for charity, at the suggestion of Prince William.\n\nThe Travolta gown has been bought and sold multiple times; among the most recent was an auction in London in 2013 when it sold for more than $360,000 to an anonymous British man who wanted it to cheer up his wife.
Happy Friday, everyone! I'm Winston Gieseke, philanthropy and special sections editor for The Desert Sun in Palm Springs, and I'm looking forward to a nice relaxing weekend of staying home and continuing my quarantine. What about you?\n\nIn California brings you top Golden State stories and commentary from across the USA TODAY Network and beyond. Get it free, straight to your inbox.\n\nCalifornia will set aside 10% of first vaccine doses for educators, school staff\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom said Friday that the Golden State plans to set aside 10% of first vaccine doses for educators, school staff and childcare providers starting in March as a way to get children back in classrooms.\n\nThe move is aimed at jumpstarting in-person learning after nearly a year of distance classes for most of California's 6 million K-12 students. The news comes a day after California's legislative leaders announced a $6.5 billion proposal aimed at reopening schools in the spring. Newsom said that wasn't fast enough and suggested he could veto it.\n\nI can't support something that's going to delay the safe reopening of schools for our youngest kids, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the state's virus cases, infection rates and hospitalizations have dropped precipitously after reaching record highs in early January. Cases have fallen to 6,700 per day from a peak of more than 40,000, and hospitalizations are a third of what they were six weeks ago.\n\nWinter storm delays more than half of California's weekly vaccine supply\n\nApproximately 702,000 vaccine doses en route to the Golden State have been stymied by the winter storm ravaging the middle of the country, Newsom said Friday at a news conference.\n\nState officials had anticipated receiving 1.2 million doses this week. As a result of the delay, pharmacies in multiple counties have reported canceling hundreds of first-dose appointments. Others expressed frustration with the lack of resources and information available.\n\nThe vaccine supply coming to San Francisco is limited, inconsistent, and unpredictable, making vaccine planning difficult, the city's COVID Command Center said, as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nWhile the governor didn't know when the doses would arrive, he said after the storm passes he expects a ramp-up of vaccine allotment from the federal government with modest increases every week.\n\nIn other vaccination news, public health clinics in Riverside County have lost 263 doses of the vaccine, according to county spokesperson Jose Arballo Jr., who had previously told The Desert Sun that the county did not track this information. This week he said he'd been mistaken.\n\nArballo said vaccinations could be lost in a number of ways, including a syringe breaking either during vaccination or from being dropped, a vial being dropped, or a vial being exposed to too much light or sunshine.\n\nCalifornia loosens rules for high school sports\n\nThe California Department of Public Health issued new guidelines Friday for youth and high school sports, opening the door for a quicker return to action for several sports, including football.\n\nAccording to the report, outdoor high-contact sports can be played in counties in the purple or red tier with a case rate at or below 14 per 100,000. There are currently 27 counties in the state with less than 14 cases per 100,000.\n\nThose sports include football and water polo from the current season. Under the new guidance, those sports can resume once the county reaches that threshold if all players and coaches get tested once per week.\n\nBefore Friday, outdoor contact sports would not have been allowed until a county had reached the orange tier, which would've meant less than four cases per 100,000.\n\nThis new guidance, which not include indoor sports, will go into effect Feb. 26.\n\nEasily digestible bite-sized news bits\n\nFor those of you who fear commitment to larger news bits.\n\nThousands of people from around the globe flood Yosemite National Park each February for a chance to see the fleeting firefall phenomenon, where a trick of the sunlight appears to send molten lava down the eastern slope of El Capitan.

Matthew Stafford is the best player the Detroit Lions have. And the most dedicated. So when your best and most dedicated player comes to and you and suggests maybe parting company would be the best thing, you ought to be worried about your team.\n\nSo much for the happy glow the Lions front office put out last week. It turns out they knew all the time that Stafford had pretty much had enough. If we are to believe the reports, the 32-year-old quarterback approached them after the season and said he'd be open to going elsewhere. Supposedly, the Lions brass has agreed.\n\nWhich means the first task facing the nascent duo of Brad Holmes and Dan Campbell — neither of whom have ever made an NFL trade on their own — will be trying to find fair value for their most important player.\n\nGood luck.\n\nThis is bad news on many fronts. First of all, with the story now out there, teams know the Lions are seeking to trade Stafford, and maybe even have to. So much for leverage. Plus, these days starting quarterbacks tend to fetch draft picks, and even if the Lions get a first rounder, unless it's Jacksonville's No. 1 pick and they take Trevor Lawrence, everything else is a crap shoot.\n\nAnswer honestly. Do you really trust this franchise with drafting? They've turned a No. 2 pick into Charles Rogers, a No. 3 into Joey Harrington, a No. 5 into Ezekiel Ansah and a No. 10 into Eric Ebron.\n\nAnd don't tell me there is any quarterback besides Lawrence who is a sure thing in this draft. Certainly not as sure as Stafford now and for another year.\n\nYes, the Lions have a new man pulling the draft strings. The former college scouting director of the Rams. Does that make you confident or nervous?\n\nWhatever the case, it'll be a shakeup of seismic proportions. Stafford is a known entity. The only star player the Lions really have. Go ahead. Who's next? The injured Kenny Golladay? Frank Ragnow in the distance? There's no one on the defense, just a few names past their glory days. They've got a really good punter, if that makes you feel better.\n\nThe rebuild is on\n\nBut take Stafford off this team, and you are truly starting over. And maybe that's the only thing they can do. Living in the middle at 5-11 and 6-10 gets you nowhere.\n\nBut this news, which broke on Saturday, is another bang to the gong that signals how long and consistently the Lions mess things up.\n\nStafford was the top pick in the 2009 draft, Detroit's reward for enduring an 0-16 season. He became the fastest player in NFL history to 20,000, 30,000 and 40,000 yards. He holds virtually all the Lions passing marks. From 2011 to 2019 he started every single game. He's played through all kinds of injuries. Put up big numbers. Made one Pro Bowl and led the Lions to three playoff games in three separate years. I know that sounds pathetic. But it's actually more than any previous Lions' starter in more than 50 years.\n\nOn top of that, Stafford is a quality guy. I've gotten to know him fairly well over the years. What you see is what you get. He's a stand-up person. The ultimate teammate. A leader. A grinder. A spotlight-avoider. A non-complainer. His stand over the summer during the George Floyd protests revealed a man who's fully morphed from taking things seriously to doing things seriously.\n\nI know him well enough to say if he indeed approached the Lions about this, then he's been bottling it inside for a long time. The last time he spoke with the media, following another dismal season, he reiterated that he loves it here in Detroit. I believe that's true. His kids have been raised here. His marriage blossomed here. He's intricately involved with the community and charities here.\n\nHe's a Lion through and through. But anyone who's that much a Lion must know the following feelings: Heartbreak. Frustration. Aggravation. Depression.\n\nCan you blame him for seeking greener pastures?\n\nHard to blame him\n\nSomeone will get themselves a whale of a quarterback, just turning 33 in a league where guys are playing beyond 40. And if you like Stafford, part of you might be happy if he gets to play, say, for Bill Belichick in New England, or with all those weapons in New Orleans, or with that young aggressive group in Washington.\n\nMark my words. If Stafford gets with a real coach and a reliable offensive line, his biggest achievements are ahead of him.\n\nBut it's shame he never had that here. He was coached by Jim Schwartz, Jim Caldwell, Matt Patricia and Darrell Bevell. Not exactly a Hall of Fame group. And his coordinators were even less remarkable. Turn him loose with that arm and some innovative minds and who knows what will happen?\n\nAnd maybe that's what he's after. Maybe he realizes there are only so many autumns left. He's got tools. He's got talent. But he can't coach the team, can't build the roster, can't make the trades. At some point, maybe, like every Lions fan, a player throws his hands up. Heck, it took Bobby Ross less than two seasons before he was screaming I don't coach this ----!\n\nIt's not the city. It's not the fans. It's the franchise. Would YOU want to spend your entire career here if you had enough talent to possibly make a Super Bowl?\n\nSo begins the long goodbye to the best quarterback the Lions have ever had. And the long hello to a rebuild that could try the patience of even us, the league's longest-suffering fans base. When you think this through, you know what you feel like saying to Stafford? Send us a postcard. We're not going anywhere.\n\nContact Mitch Albom: malbom@freepress.com. Check out the latest updates with his charities, books and events at MitchAlbom.com.
Josh Smith\n\nCredit.com\n\nWith the recent passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, many Americans are wondering how their finances will be affected. That's a fair question, since a tax overhaul of this size and scope hasn't happened since the 1980s.\n\nNews reports have come out since the signing of the bill detailing how some companies have been able to provide new raises, bonuses, and benefits to employees. Since many Americans are employed by someone else, you may want to know: how will the new tax bill affect me as an employee?\n\nHire an accountant\n\nThere are big changes coming, so even if you don't expect to see much of a change, it's still a worthwhile investment to consult a tax professional — whether that's a CPA or just a tax preparer. They may be able to spot problems with your filing or even help you get deductions you didn't know you qualified for.\n\nRun a projection\n\nIt's not all that difficult to run a projection of how much your taxes will cost or return to you, even if you aren't quite ready to file. If you do it now, you can get an estimate of how much you may owe, if anything. This will leave you with more time to file an extension if necessary.\n\nMore:Residents in this city owe the IRS more than $7,000 during tax time\n\nMore:Timing is everything: The 4 best times to file your taxes\n\nMore:These are the most important tax forms and documents you need for filing\n\nUpdate your withholdings\n\nWhen we first start a job, we all have to fill out paperwork about our tax withholdings. Contact your HR representative to ask about updating your withholdings. This is worth doing every year or every time you and/or your family experience a life event, such as the marriage, birth of a child, or buying a home.\n\nRethink buying or selling your home\n\nSpeaking of homes, your mortgage interest is still deductible, but only up to $750,000 now. (Previously it was up to $1 million.) If you were planning on taking out a mortgage over that amount this year, consult a financial advisor to decide if this is the right move for you.\n\nDon't count on deducting your moving expenses\n\n2017 will be the last tax year where employees can deduct expenses if they relocate specifically for a job. If you are considering doing that this year, see if your employer will foot part of the bill, especially if it's not a voluntary move on your part. Their answer might pleasantly surprise you!\n\nAssess your retirement situation\n\nIf you have a 401k or Roth IRA, consider increasing your contribution. It may help your tax game in the long run. The tax rules around rolling over these types of retirement accounts have changed, so make sure you're taking advantage of them.\n\nReconsider taking out a home equity loan\n\nUnder the new tax law, home equity loans will be taxed differently. Previously, the amount was tax deductible. This will no longer be the case after this tax year. Many expect home equity loans to become more expensive moving forward.\n\nDon't rely on a SALT deduction\n\nThose who live in states with famously high tax rates (such as New York and California) will be disappointed to learn that state and local taxes can no longer be deducted. If you live in one of these states, or any other highly taxed state, begin saving now.\n\nDouble check on your commuter benefits\n\nPreviously, employers were incentivized through tax breaks to offer commuter benefits to employees. This deduction is going away for businesses, but with the other tax breaks for corporations, it may end up being a wash. Check with your employer on the future of this benefit. Personal contributions are still deductible up to $255.\n\nAssess your financial situation holistically\n\nWhether or not you're financially savvy, you may want to take this opportunity to assess your financial situation as it currently stands and weigh it against your long-term financial goals. While the tax reform bill may not affect your day-to-day life right now, it's always a good idea to take a step back and look at the big picture once in a while.\n\nMore from Credit.com\n\nProperty Taxes & Your Mortgage\n\nA Tax Audit: Will It Happen to You?\n\nCan My Taxes Mess With My Credit?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Credit.com.\n\nJosh is the Content Manager at Credit.com.

With Manny Pacquiao set to fight Adrien Broner Saturday night in Las Vegas, the curious case of Freddie Roach lingers.\n\nIn short, how is it that Roach, the esteemed boxing trainer, is back in Pacquiao's corner?\n\nOver the past 15 years, he has played an instrumental role in the rise of Pacquiao (60-7-2, 39 KOs), the Filipino boxer who has won world titles in eight divisions. But unceremoniously, Roach then became a castoff.\n\nIn July 2017, after Pacquiao suffered a controversial loss to Australian Jeff Horn, Pacquiao didn't bother to call Roach before Pacquiao's next fight. And without Roach in his corner, Pacquiao delivered his first knockout in nine years with a TKO victory in July over Argentine brawler Lucas Matthysse.\n\nYet now, with the 40-year-old Pacquiao fighting the 29-year-old Broner in a bout to be televised by SHOWTIME PPV, there in plain view have been the signature black, horn-rimmed glasses, the 5-6 frame and cheerful disposition of Roach.\n\nHe's back.\n\nMore:Quite the contrast: Senator Manny vs Adrien Broner\n\nThey're like a married couple,'' said Justin Fortune, Pacquiao's strength and conditioning coach, and it's like they had a trial separation.''\n\nPacquiao has dodged questions about what went wrong between him and Roach.\n\nIt's been a long time that I didn't speak to Freddie,'' he said. I was busy in the Philippines.''\n\nBut in an interview with USA TODAY Sports, Roach, 58, talked in detail about what transpired.\n\nIn 2017, Pacquiao was juggling responsibilities as a senator while preparing for his fight against Horn. Sometimes it meant Pacquiao's work days lasted up to 18 hours a day, according to Fred Sternburg, Pacquiao's publicist.\n\nRoach said the demanding schedule contributed to Pacquiao losing to Horn by unanimous decision.\n\nManny fought one good round in that fight, I thought,'' Roach said. And he almost knocked (Horn) out in the ninth. And then I told him give me one more round like that, he'll be all set, and he just couldn't do it. It wasn't there.''\n\nAfter the fight, Roach said, he spoke bluntly to Pacquiao.\n\nI told him being a senator and being a professional boxer at this level is not working,'' Roach recalled. I said, 'I think that it's really hurting you to do both. I think you should pick one or the other.' \n\nPacquiao walked away without saying a word, Roach said.\n\nAt a Nov. 20 press conference in Beverly Hills, Calif., to promote his fight with Broner, Pacquiao said Roach would be part of his team again. Only he still hadn't talked to his longtime trainer.\n\nPacquiao made the call later in the day and a deal was in place soon after, according to Roach.\n\nRoach was asked to play more of a supervisory role and work alongside Filipino trainer Buboy Fernandez, Pacquiao's close friend. But Roach was glowing one day during training camp after he'd held the mitts and caught Pacquiao's punches. Just like the old days.\n\nLike always, I'll go till he's finished,'' Roach said. And like always, 12 rounds later he says, 'That's enough.'\n\nEveryone says that's the best work he's had in a long, long time, OK? Me and him work well together. We know each other quite well.''\n\nLikely factors behind the reconciliation have become clear.\n\nDuring a recent interview, when talking about Pacquiao's political career, Roach did not express concern about whether Pacquiao could juggle politics and boxing. Rather, Roach mused about the possibility of Pacquiao running for president in the Philippines — and then becoming the first president to win a boxing championship.\n\nPacquiao, meanwhile, has spent less time focused on political responsibilities and has taken more time off during training to make sure his body recovers. With Roach supervising, of course.\n\nYou can't replace that knowledge that Freddie has,'' said Fortune, the strength and conditioning. And if Manny's happy, I'm happy.''\n\nOr as Pacquiao cagily said, I don't have any problem with Freddie Roach.
Bill Keveney\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSpoiler alert: This story contains significant details from Monday's series finale of A&E's Bates Motel.\n\nIn the end, Norman Bates got his wish: He'll be with his mother for eternity.\n\nThe psychologically damaged killer at the heart of A&E'sBates Motel — a prequel to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho that charted a different course —- came to his own end, buried next to his mother in Monday's series finale of the five-season drama.\n\nNorman (Freddie Highmore), obsessed with his dead mother, Norma (Vera Farmiga), died at the hands of her other son, Dylan (Max Thieriot), after his delusions could no longer stand up to reality.\n\nIn the episode, Norman comes home and is consumed by images of the (series) pilot and is thinking he's back at that time and his mother is alive and they're going to make things great, Highmore says. But his dream starts to unravel when Dylan says, 'She's dead. She really isn't here, Norman.' \n\nAs Norma's embalmed corpse sits at an immaculately set dinner table, Norman charges at Dylan with a knife after his half-brother challenges his view of reality. Dylan then fatally shoots him in self-defense, an action producers say Norman instigated as he saw his fantasy world crumble.\n\nNorman puts Dylan in a position where he has no choice. We hope there was a certain beauty to Norman having this final moment of clarity where he recognized he had no options that were better than this, says executive producer Carlton Cuse. He forces Dylan to do something, and that action is the final act in his tragedy.\n\nExecutive producer Kerry Ehrin sees this final Bates killing as an act of brotherly love.\n\nNorman is in such a hopeless place that he's reaching out to his brother to fix it for him in the only way he can think of in the moment, she says. There's caring and love, even though the incident itself is horrific and tragic and heartbreaking.\n\nThe finale includes plenty of action before Norman's death. Early in the episode, Norman — taken from jail at gunpoint by Norma's vengeful husband, Alex Romero (Nestor Carbonell) — shows Alex her corpse, beautifully situated in the snow. Norman then turns the tables and kills Romero before returning to the motel and his own eventual demise.\n\nAmid Bates' bloodshed, there is at least one bright sign. In a scene that takes place some time after Norman's death, Dylan, whose marriage to Emma (Olivia Cooke) was frayed by his support for Norman's legal defense, is happily reunited with his wife and their growing daughter.\n\nFrom very early on, we thought that Dylan and Emma deserved to survive this tragedy and come out the other side, Cuse says. There's so much sadness and loss that we wanted there to be one story that had a ray of hope to it.\n\nHighmore acknowledges the severity of Norman's lethal crimes, but still feels for a character who struggles with and eventually succumbs to his delusions. He points to Norman's urging, earlier this season, that Marion Crane (Rihanna) leave the motel, knowing that would prevent him from acting on his murderous urges.\n\nIt's not that I'm condoning certain actions of his, but I hope we feel sympathy for him at the very end. I think he's always tried to be a good person, tried to be nice and do what he thought was best, Highmore says. What makes him appealing is that he's never really been out to get people.
Sharon Peters\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nYou're a successful fiftysomething author and former federal prosecutor with four kids, a quite famous husband (novelist Michael Chabon), and raging mood swings that therapy and the usual pharmaceuticals no longer blunt. What do you do?\n\nWhat Ayelet Waldman did was break the law and secretly consume minuscule doses of LSD every third day for a month, monitoring and recording the changes in her moods, relationships and productivity.\n\nA Really Good Day: How Microdosing Made a Mega Difference In My Mood, My Marriage and My Life (Knopf, 219 pp., ***½ out of four stars) is the chronicle of Waldman's short experiment with what most regard as a dangerous mind-bending psychedelic. She, on the other hand, asserts that the tiny doses she consumed amounted mostly to a sip of serenity, or something close to it.\n\nRelentlessly honest and surprisingly funny (in parts), the book is also an energetically researched history of this drug (which until it was criminalized in the 1960s was regarded by many researchers and counselors as a helpful tool in addressing several forms of mental illness).\n\nWaldman's underlying bias — that LSD was and is safe and effective in therapeutic settings and hasn't been all that risky when used recreationally, either — might challenge mainstream thinking. But she produces some very decent data and arguments. It's worth noting that she taught a course on the War on Drugs at UC Berkeley School of Law, so she knows where the good stuff about drugs and policy and vested interest is buried.\n\nIn modified diary form, Waldman details her use of and reactions to LSD microdoses (two drops, about one-tenth of a typical recreational dose), branching off for sweeping forays into drug history, drug law and some of the most private corners of her life. She was motivated by a lifetime held hostage by the vagaries of mood, and writes that at the worst times she's beset with self-loathing, and knotted with guilt and shame….overtaken by a pervasive sense of hopelessness.\n\nOnce she embarked on this experiment, she experienced the probably predictable moments of fretting over whether she would have to be resuscitated by EMTs and worrying about how wretchedly irresponsible she was, what with all those children counting on her.\n\nAlthough hers was a journey few will take, A Really Good Day reads almost like an Everywoman's experience, because Waldman's fears and reactions are so commonplace. She is so likable in her flaws and her determination that it's a relief to learn that the microdoses (or possibly her therapy sessions or maybe even a placebo effect, she acknowledges) allowed enough of a head shift that her life has become easier, lighter.\n\nShe had the courage, the credentials and the insight to make this journey and tell us about it. They all add up to a fine read.\n\n—————\n\nSharon Peters is author of Trusting Calvin: How A Dog Helped Heal A Holocaust Survivor's Heart.
Don't believe the rumors. Howard Stern's 20-year marriage is still going strong.\n\nThat's the message Beth Ostrosky Stern, 46, brought to The Ellen DeGeneres Show that aired Friday.\n\nTwenty years of marital bliss. I'm setting the record straight right here. I love my Howard, Beth said while sitting on the stage next to DeGeneres. He's a great guy.\n\nThe rumor mill started up last week when Howard and Beth had a disagreement, and Beth told her husband that he was being grumpy and a Debbie Downer.\n\nHe then talked about their problems on his SiriusXM show.\n\nAt least that's what Beth suspects is what caused the uproar that followed. Because she doesn't actually listen to his show.\n\nThe Google alerts come: 'Howard and Beth are breaking up. Marital problems' There's pictures of us with lighting bolts between our heads. I don't know what's going on, said Beth. Apparently, he spoke about us on the air. This was last week. And it spread like wildfire.\n\nStrangers even stopped her in the street and wished her well.\n\nThe other day, someone comes up to me and said, 'I'm so sorry about what's going on with you and Howard, I hope you make it.' I had no idea what was going on, said Beth.\n\nConsider that discussion closed.\n\nBut things are getting ugly on the animal front for Beth, the host of Hallmark Channel's Kitten Bowl VI.\n\nShe and Howard foster a one-eyed kitten named Pebble.\n\nShe's the biggest jerk. I love her to the last day, forever and ever, says Beth. She attacks me, Howard can't even touch her. I love you so much Pebble, but you are a jerk.
J.J. Watt will be 32 next month, but the man can still move. Heck, he just beat a guy more than six years his junior, Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson, out of Houston.\n\nAnd good for Watt.\n\nHis best years are almost certainly behind him, and there was definitely no Super Bowl trophy in front of him had he remained with the Texans, who drafted him 11th overall in 2011 but are currently an organization seemingly in complete disarray. But now, by forfeiting what would have been a $17.5 million non-guaranteed salary in 2021 with Friday's release – a move that simultaneously helps extricate Houston from its salary cap issues – Watt has the freedom to sign with any team immediately rather than wait for the start of NFL free agency March 17, when the contracts of pending free agents officially expire.\n\nSo where does Watt, one of three men in NFL history to win defensive player of the year three times (along with Lawrence Taylor and Aaron Donald), go next? A number of factors are likely to be in play.\n\nNFL POWER RANKINGS:Buccaneers are No. 1, but who's next?\n\nDAN WOLKEN:Urban Meyer's 'character and leadership' con continues in Jacksonville\n\nTROY AIKMAN:Dallas Cowboys, Dak Prescott are not in rebuild mode\n\n► Watt left a lot of money on the table to leave the Texans and surely knows he can no longer command top dollar at his age after coming off the least productive full season of his 10-year career. Assuming money isn't the variable driving him to his next destination, a world of possibilities could open up for him.\n\n► Houston had never won a playoff game prior to Watt's arrival in 2011. But starting in his rookie season, when Watt returned an interception 29 yards for a touchdown to help beat the Bengals in the wild-card round, the Texans won four playoff games. However Watt, a man long driven to achieve glory on Super Sunday, has never even reached an AFC title game. He'll surely be looking for a team he believes can win now.\n\n► Watt spent most of his career as a left defensive end, often devouring helpless right tackles, in Houston's base 3-4 defense. Though scheme fit for his next team will surely be a consideration for both sides, it seems unlikely to be the overriding determination.\n\nWith those thoughts in mind, here are 10 teams (listed alphabetically) that could be fits, some better than others, for JJW:\n\nBaltimore Ravens\n\nMatt Judon, their leading sack man each of the past two seasons, is headed for free agency and seeking a contract that will average $20 million annually, per ESPN. Watt could be a far more cost-effective option, especially if he falls into more of a rotational role on passing downs. Quarterbacks wouldn't enjoy staring across the line of scrimmage and seeing Watt and Calais Campbell, even at their advanced ages.\n\nBuffalo Bills\n\nA marriage between Watt and a Western New York community saturated with Bills Mafia would surely be a happy (if brief) one. Buffalo, which finished one win shy of the Super Bowl last season, didn't have a player with more than five sacks on a middling defense. Watt's five sacks in 2020 were his fewest over a 16-game season. However, his 17 quarterback hits would have easily paced the Bills, who would have to make some cap room to accommodate him. Still, for a team that might only be a player or two away, Watt might just be one of those players.\n\nChicago Bears\n\nThey were a wild-card team in 2020 but don't have available cap space right now ... or a good idea who their quarterback will be in 2021. But the Bears do provide the unique opportunity to play in the Windy City – where Watt's wife, Kealia, is a member of the National Women's Soccer League's Chicago Red Stars. Watt probably also wouldn't mind a defensive union with Bears OLB Khalil Mack.\n\nCleveland Browns\n\nA team that took a quantum leap in 2020 under coach of the year Kevin Stefanski could use help on a defense that ranked 22nd against the pass. Imagine the damage Watt could do playing opposite All-Pro DE Myles Garrett and alongside disruptive DT Sheldon Richardson. And given the way the Browns' run-heavy offense can both milk and control the clock, Watt wouldn't find that he has to play nearly as many snaps.\n\nGreen Bay Packers\n\nThe Pack have massive cap issues, roughly $28 million overspent at present, per Over The Cap, a figure they'll have to reduce to zero by March 17. But they also represent a singular chance for Watt, a proud Badger, to return to his native Wisconsin. And given how this defense was exposed in the last two NFC championship games, adding Watt might be a very nice to way to give league MVP Aaron Rodgers help at a discount.\n\nLos Angeles Rams\n\nThey boast the league's No. 1 defense and are clearly going after the brass ring following their damn-the-torpedoes trade for QB Matthew Stafford. A pairing of Donald and Watt is not only extremely tantalizing, but perhaps wholly necessary given OLB Leonard Floyd, L.A.'s No. 2 sack man in 2020, is poised to cash in during free agency – an arena where the Rams don't seem able to compete for prime talent given they're $27 million in the red cap-wise.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers\n\nThey wouldn't make a ton of sense for Watt schematically or from a cap standpoint given Pittsburgh needs to shed about $32 million to be compliant by the time the new league year starts. But if a scenario arises for J.J. to join his brothers, OLB T.J. Watt and FB Derek Watt, in Pittsburgh with the reigning AFC North champions, is he going to say no?\n\nSeattle Seahawks\n\nThey haven't had a premier edge rusher since the days of Michael Bennett and Frank Clark and relied heavily on S Jamal Adams to create havoc in 2020, when his 9½ sacks established a single-season league record for defensive backs. But it would make more sense to get pressure up front from Watt and not expose the back end so regularly by bringing Adams into the box. And an acquisition of Watt's caliber might mollify suddenly publicly disgruntled QB Russell Wilson, a University of Wisconsin product like Watt.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nWhy not help the Bucs run it back? Rickey Jackson, Neil Smith and DeMarcus Ware are just a few all-time great pass rushers who switched teams late in their careers to successfully snatch a first Super Bowl ring. The Bucs have nearly $30 million in available cap space, though face decisions on what to do about soon-to-be free agents like OLB Shaq Barrett, WR Chris Godwin and DL Ndamukong Suh. Regardless, Watt seems like an ideal short-term fit for a group of mercenaries in win immediately mode.\n\nTennessee Titans\n\nAFC finalists in 2019 and AFC South champions in 2020, they seem close to a breakthrough – especially if they can upgrade a pass rush that managed only 19 sacks last season. Going to Nashville would reunite Watt with coach Mike Vrabel, his defensive coordinator in Houston in 2017, and allow him two opportunities to play the division rival Texans in 2021.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

Jessica Simpson pulls back the curtain on her highly publicized breakup with Nick Lachey and her relationship with John Mayer in her upcoming Open Book memoir.\n\nIn excerpts published by People before the release Feb. 4, the Do You Know artist revealed that being in the spotlight caused her marriage with Lachey to crumble.\n\nSimpson, who was 22 years old when she married Lachey in 2002, said they were both trying to find their places in the music industry. They filmed the reality show Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica about their union. It ran from 2003 to 2005.\n\nWe worked and we were great at it, but when it came time to being alone, we weren't great at it anymore, Simpson wrote. We really got crushed by the media and by ourselves. ... I couldn't lie to our fans and I couldn't give somebody hope that we were this perfect golden couple.\n\nThe actress said the 98 Degrees member was her first love and she will always have respect for him.\n\nI was really young, and my success hadn't really begun, she said. He knew me as this young, innocent 18-year-old that had never been introduced to the world in so many ways. I went straight from my father to him. Nick's very smart. He was eight years older than me, but he was also young.\n\nThe pair divorced in 2006, and Lachey married Vanessa Minnillo in 2011. Simpson married NFL pro Eric Johnson in 2014, but before she found love with Johnson, she dated John Mayer, a romance she details in her book.\n\nSimpson wrote that despite her intense connection to Mayer, the singer made her feel insecure in their relationship, and she started drinking to control her nerves.\n\nI constantly worried that I wasn't smart enough for him. ... He was so clever and treated conversation like a friendly competition that he had to win, she wrote in her book. My anxiety would spike, and I would pour another drink. It was the start of me relying on alcohol to mask my nerves.\n\nTheir relationship ended after he detailed their sex life in a Playboy interview in 2010 when he referred to her as sexual napalm.\n\nMore:Jessica Simpson reveals sexual abuse as a child, alcohol addiction in new memoir, 'Open Book'\n\nMore:Jessica Simpson joins Pink, disables Instagram comments after mom shaming\n\nI was floored and embarrassed that my grandmother was actually gonna read that, she said. A woman and how they are in bed is not something that is ever talked about.\n\nSimpson's memoir reveals she endured sexual abuse as a child.\n\nIt would start with tickling my back and then go into things that were extremely uncomfortable. ... I wanted to tell my parents. I was the victim, but somehow I felt in the wrong, she wrote.\n\nShe said she revealed the abuse to her parents when she was 12.\n\nSimpson opened up about how trauma from the abuse coupled with stress over her career led her to become dependent on alcohol and drugs. I was killing myself with all the drinking and pills, she wrote.\n\nShe said she's been sober since November 2017 and therapy helped her heal. Giving up the alcohol was easy, she said. I was mad at that bottle. At how it allowed me to stay complacent and numb.\n\nContributing: Hannah Yasharoff
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — Gov. Eric Greitens' affair was known to his political opponents more than a year ago, before he was elected. But despite the buzzing rumor mill, his infidelity wasn't in the public eye until last week.\n\nRumors of the affair percolated since at least the summer of 2016, said Roy Temple, who at the time was the chair of the Missouri Democratic Party.\n\nAmong Democrats and Republicans alike, Greitens' affair was just kind of common knowledge in political circles, said Temple, whom the News-Leader contacted after St. Louis television station KMOV reported Greitens' admission of an affair and denial that he allegedly blackmailed his hairdresser.\n\nGOP observers — not candidates — whispered rumors of the affair after Greitens won the primary in August 2016, Temple said. And as the year passed, the rumors became more specific, including the woman's identity and eventually, her ex-husband's name.\n\nAt this point, Temple said, he recognized the man and reached out through a mutual acquaintance, if for no other reason than to see whether there was any truth to what he had heard.\n\nMore:Blackmail allegations prompt investigation of Missouri governor\n\nMore:Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens admits to affair, denies blackmail\n\nTemple and the man spoke by phone in August 2016 and met later that month. Then, Temple said he learned a great deal more detail and was presented with documents the man retained and a recording of a March 25, 2015, conversation.\n\nIn the recorded conversation, the man assured his wife that what she tells him about her March 21 encounter with Greitens won't leave the car.\n\nOn the recording, the woman says Greitens allegedly invited her into his home, talked her into his basement, bound her, blindfolded her, pulled her pants down, took a photograph of her and told her that she was never going to mention (Greitens') name, otherwise there will be pictures of (her) everywhere.\n\nGreitens' attorney has said any blackmail allegation is false and denied that any such photograph was ever taken. The allegations have triggered a criminal investigation by the St. Louis Circuit Attorney.\n\nAt the time of that first encounter with his hairdresser, Greitens had created an exploratory committee to lay the groundwork for his gubernatorial run, and two days later, the former Navy SEAL was in Chicago to promote his book Resilience: Hard-Won Wisdom for Living a Better Life.\n\nThe woman's ex-husband knew Greitens was considering running for office and urged the woman to risk the embarrassment in publicly challenging Greitens' image as a manly hero.\n\nAnd I'll have you know, I can destroy his career in a half an hour ..., the man tells the woman at one point on the tape. He took a picture of my wife naked as blackmail. There is no worse person. (The man's attorney, Al Watkins, has said that the man's agenda is to protect his children and their opinion of their mother.)\n\nThough the ex-husband did not follow through with the threat at the time, he did try to alert the future governor's wife.\n\nWatkins provided the News-Leader with a message the man sent to Sheena Greitens using a pseudonym. The email was sent in early July 2015, at a time when the man believed his wife and Eric Greitens were again together at the Greitens residence.\n\nThere is another woman in your home right now, the man wrote to Sheena Greitens, according to the email provided by Watkins. I'm assuming you're out of town again. If you want to know more contact me here. I'm sorry. This isn't fake or spam. They are at the Maryland address (in the Central West End neighborhood of St. Louis).\n\nSheena Greitens' email provided an automatic reply that thanked the sender and said she was traveling with limited access to email. The man wrote again that day, several hours later: Today was not the first time he has had her in your home.\n\nWhy Democrats didn't go public\n\nTemple told the News-Leader that he was struck by what he termed extraordinary attempts by Eric Greitens at that time to maintain secrecy, based on the ex-husband's account and the documents Temple reviewed.\n\nGreitens has been since scrutinized for accepting millions of dollars in untraceable donations, the anonymously sourced political contributions he has received through a non-profit set up by senior aides and the illegal transfer of a donor list from the pro-veteran charity he founded to his political campaign. Attorney General Josh Hawley is investigating Greitens' and his senior staff members' use of a communication tool that deletes messages after they are read.\n\nTemple said he was supposed to meet with the ex-husband again in mid-September of 2016. Instead, the Democratic operative was contacted by Watkins, the ex-husband's attorney. From their conversation, Temple said, he understood that the ex-husband wanted time to think and that Watkins was to be the go-between from then on.\n\nBy then, the race between Democratic Attorney General Chris Koster and Greitens was heated — but the ex-husband, who was worried about the effect on his children, did not want to go public with what he knew.\n\nIf the man had expressed a desire to go public, Temple said, I would have connected him to a reporter and let them make a news judgment about the affair involving Greitens — who presented himself as a towering symbol of virtue and family values Temple said — and allegations related to violence and threats.\n\nWatkins has pointed out that if the ex-husband had a political agenda or aimed to damage Greitens' reputation, he could have gone on the record when Greitens and Koster were locked in a tight contest during their race's final weeks.\n\nA Koster campaign official confirmed to the News-Leader that before the November election, they discussed with Temple substantiated rumors that Greitens had an extramarital affair. The Koster staffer said top campaign aides did not hear about the alleged blackmail then and did not talk of the affair to Koster, who could not be reached for comment.\n\nSpeaking to Greitens' general counsel hours before news of the affair broke Wednesday, Watkins said he attempted to reach out to Greitens through back channels before the election to let him know that the ex-husband wanted to put the affair behind him. Watkins said he was hired to put the kibosh on it and credited the Democrats who knew of the affair with not going public.\n\nSince the election\n\nGreitens was elected in November 2016 and started implementing parts of his conservative agenda throughout 2017, while he continued to project the image of a patriarch of a solid, happy family. The Democratic party replaced Temple as state party chair, and Koster's campaign staffers dispersed.\n\nRumors of the affair remained in circulation throughout the first year of the Republican governor's term — and according to Watkins, interest rose sharply in early to mid-December.\n\nWatkins has facilitated contact with media outlets interested in his client's story, but he has rejected the notion that he is shopping the story to various news outlets. Several weeks ago, Watkins said, media interest on the local and national levels reached a frenzied pitch — including a phone call by a national reporter to one of the ex-husband's children.\n\nThe dam starts to break\n\nSince KMOV broke the story Wednesday — based on an interview with the ex-husband, his surreptitious recording and the governor's own admission, but without on-the-record comments from the woman — the governor's private attorney has released several statements from Eric and Sheena Greitens, and from himself.\n\nA few years ago, before Eric was elected Governor, there was a time when he was unfaithful in our marriage, the joint statement said, in part. This was a deeply personal mistake. Eric took responsibility, and we dealt with this together honestly and privately.\n\nWhen the ex-husband went public, I knew it was him, said Temple, who reiterated that he kept his word to the ex-husband to not publicize the affair.\n\nTemple said he felt free to comment to other media outlets after the news broke.\n\n#MeToo's role in the reaction\n\nThe News-Leader has not spoken with either the ex-husband or the woman with whom the governor cheated on his wife, instead communicating through attorneys for all three parties. The News-Leader has declined to name the former couple. The woman's attorney has said his client wants to have her privacy respected.\n\nAnd therein lies another problem, as pointed out to the News-Leader by multiple lawmakers, including Rep. Crystal Quade, D-Springfield.\n\nWe're essentially re-victimizing her by having this come forward without her consent, Quade said last week. And if these allegations are true, this woman had terrible things happen to her without her consent, and it's happening all over again.\n\nQuestions of power, consent and consequences gained national prominence with the rise of the #MeToo movement, through which women have come forward with allegations and evidence that they have been wronged by men in positions of power.\n\nJohn Hancock, a GOP consultant and former chair of the Missouri Republican Party, questioned whether the #MeToo movement was the proper context when the News-Leader asked about the movement's possible impact on Greitens' scandal.\n\nThe 'Me Too' movement, as I understand it, deals with sexual assault, unwanted sexual advances, and demands for sex by a superior over a subordinate. This instance, setting aside the photo / blackmail allegations which may or may not be true or provable, seems to involve a consensual sexual affair, Hancock said in an email. Marital infidelity is tragic for those families involved and may require years to process before healing. The current situation does not, however, appear to me to be analogous with the kinds of offenses brought to light by the recent 'Me Too' movement.\n\nDave Robertson, a political science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said the best test of the impact of the #MeToo movement is the accusation that he threatened the woman involved if she exposed him.\n\nThe Governor denies it, and right now it is his word against her and her former husband, Robertson said in an email. In a case like this, Americans are more skeptical of the denier. Fair or unfair, the #MeToo movement undoubtedly has reduced the number of people willing to give Governor Greitens the benefit of the doubt, because it seems common for public figures to deny the first allegations.\n\nBennett, Greitens' attorney, referred to previous statements and declined to comment further when asked Tuesday by the News-Leader. Despite some calls for the governor to step down, Greitens has not indicated that he will resign.\n\nFollow Will Schmitt on Twitter: @ws_missouri
Jessica Berman has never played lacrosse, but that hasn't stopped her from becoming one of the top executives in the National Lacrosse League.\n\nIn August, she was appointed deputy commissioner of the National Lacrosse League and is now the highest-ranking woman in a men's professional sports league. Her immediate goal? To expand the NLL, which now has 13 professional teams, to 16 teams.\n\nI love it, said Berman, who lives in Larchmont, New York. If I could have scripted the next best opportunity for me, it would be exactly this.\n\nBerman said she knew by age 15 that she wanted a career in sports.\n\nShe remembers the excitement at a New York Islanders game where spectators, who didn't seem to have much in common, were high-fiving and even hugging each other when their team scored a goal.\n\nLISA WILLIS: First female coach for New York Knicks' franchise\n\nSomething in that moment clicked as I watched the power of sports in bringing people together, said Berman, 42.\n\nGrowing up in Brooklyn, Berman always found ways to be part of the sports culture, from cheerleading in her high school to tracking statistics for her school's baseball team.\n\nAt the University of Michigan, where she majored in sports management, she was the manager of the school's hockey, football and baseball teams.\n\nWhen I went to college back in the '90s there was no clear path on how to obtain that kind of experience, she said of managing the teams. I just went to the athletic department and I offered my services to help the different teams to kept statistics on the different players and liaised with the local newspapers on storytelling about the players.\n\nSummers were spent on professional internships with sports agents and sports marketing agencies.\n\nThose experiences led her to sports law.\n\nThe way that my mind works, I knew I would really enjoy a very analytical way of thinking and I was specifically interested in collective bargaining and understanding labor and management relationships, she said.\n\nAfter graduating from the Fordham University School of Law, Berman began her career at Proskauer Rose LLP, in New York City specializing in labor and employment.\n\nOne of the firm's clients was the National Hockey League.\n\nWorking on labor relations issues, particularly collective bargaining agreements, convinced her she was in the right field, she said.\n\nI often describe labor relations as a marriage where you can't get a divorce. You have to find a way to work it out, she said. Collective bargaining requires a lot of patience and compromise and understanding the big picture. It's about winning the war, even if you lose some small battles.\n\nAfter four years with Proskauer, Berman was hired by the NHL in 2006 as a staff lawyer.\n\nNHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly, who was then head of the legal department, said the team had the opportunity to observe Berman on the job while she consulted on behalf of Proskauer.\n\nWe could see how she worked under stressful, difficult situations. We saw the level of expertise and creativity she brought, said Daly. She is very committed to accomplishing things. Anything that's put on her plate to accomplish, she'll go to great lengths to make sure it gets done.\n\nThat trait was in full display in 2013 when her husband, Brad Berman, a marathon runner, suffered a stroke at age 37. Doctors had to cut out a chunk of his skull to relieve pressure from a ruptured blood vessel in his brain (storing it in his abdomen for future reattachment) before placing him in a coma, where he remained for six weeks.\n\nThe stroke initially left him totally paralyzed on his left side, unable to even move the left side of his face. For the next few years, Jessica Berman balanced work, raising the couple's two young children — both under the age of 6 — and taking care of her husband.\n\nShe also raised more than $750,000 to help the Burke Rehabilitation Center, where her husband was being treated, to purchase machines and other equipment, including a robotic exoskeleton, needed for his progress.\n\nI often describe Jessica as the quarterback of my recovery, said Brad Berman. There were many difficult and complicated decisions that had to be made. She collected tremendous amounts of information and did a lot of research and figured out what the best technology was in terms of helping me to recover the left inside of my body and pulled in experts from around the country to deal with my condition.\n\nToday, he is not only well on his way to recovery, but also working full time as a tax attorney.\n\nThe couple's marriage, however, did not survive. The Bermans divorced earlier this year, but remain close.\n\nOur marriage didn't survive the experience. It changed the dynamics of our relationship, she said. When they say your life can change in an instant, I really know what it means.\n\nThrough it all, family, friends, the community and the NHL were pillars of support, she said.\n\nTime for change\n\nIn 2015, looking for a change in her career track, Berman approached Gary Bettman, the NHL commissioner and deputy commissioner Daly: She wanted to move from the legal side to the business side to gain a better understanding of revenue generation.\n\nBerman was offered the position of vice president for community development, culture and growth, responsible for designing and executing the league's strategic corporate social responsibility goals, initiatives, policies and programs.\n\nOne of her priorities was to increase revenue by building programming that engaged the community, such as an initiative honoring the Hockey Mom of the Year.\n\nMillennials and Gen Z really leverage their own spending on brands that are committed to community and purpose, she said. And when you have programming that authentically engages the community, sponsors will align around those objectives and support the programs.\n\nTwo years ago, as she turned 40, Berman said she sought out mentors to help her figure out how she could grow in her career.\n\nShe said she knew she would have to step out of her comfort zone.\n\nAn opening at the National Lacrosse League proved to be that opportunity.\n\nAfter 13 years, I felt like my identity was intertwined with the NHL, she said. It was a very hard decision to leave, but ultimately, I felt like if I want to stretch and learn and grow, I owed it to myself to challenge myself, redefine myself in a lot of ways and see where it leads.\n\nExpanding the NLL\n\nBerman is not shy about her ambitions.\n\nI wanted to intentionally fill any gaps in my experience so that I'd be a qualified candidate for any opportunity that comes my way in the future, she said. Whether it's to be a commissioner of a league one day or the president of a team.\n\nBut first, winning a buy-in from her kids, Noah, 11, and Andrew, 9, to take on a high-pressure job which would require a lot of travel was important to her.\n\nAs a working mom, you're always trying to be conscious of 'where am I most needed?'  she said.\n\nFor Berman, the key to her ability to balance all of this has been keeping her kids up to speed on what she's working on and why it's important.\n\nI talked to them about it before I accepted the offer and I said, 'I already work really hard. This is going to be the next level and if you guys aren't on board, I probably won't take it. We need to do this as a team or I'm going to figure something else out.'\n\nNoah, when he heard about the opportunity, he says, 'Are you kidding mom? This is going to make you a pioneer,'  she said. I always say they're co-presidents of my fan club.\n\nBeing at a much smaller, emerging league (it was established in 1986) has offered Berman the opportunity to grow in her role as executive vice president of business affairs.\n\nIn my old role at the NHL, I touched the revenue side from a marketing standpoint, but I wasn't working directly on generating revenue, she said. Now I'm involved in things like selling expansion teams, for example.\n\nWhen an expansion team is sold into a new market, there are things one quickly needs to become familiar with, such as negotiation with the prospective owner, identifying an arena for the team to play and paying a fee to buy a new team.\n\nThe NLL, which currently has 13 teams, has been authorized by its board to expand to 16 teams by 2023. By comparison, the National Football League, National Hockey League and National Basketball Association each have roughly double that number.\n\nLacrosse is among the fastest growing sports in the United States, according to a recent Sport & Fitness Industry Association report.\n\nIt's been really fun to learn and work on. From bringing in new sponsors to working on media rights, there are so many new things to learn, said Berman.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy covers women and power for the USA Today Network Northeast.

Sandra Harwitt\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY Sports\n\nMELBOURNE — Verbosity hasn't often been an inclination for Serena Williams and at the start of her 20th season as a tennis superstar she hasn't developed a penchant for chattiness.\n\nSo it came as no surprise that when meeting the international press ahead of the Australian Open on Saturday, she primarily chose cagey over confessions.\n\nAt 35, Williams arrives in Melbourne with the chance to win a 23rd career Grand Slam trophy, which would break her shared Open-Era record of 22 Grand Slam titles with Steffi Graf, and place her one Grand Slam title away from equaling Margaret Court's all-time record of 24 titles.\n\nWilliams, however, had that looming possible achievement on her list of subjects not-to-be discussed.\n\nOh, I'm not talking about that, she said. I'm just here to play and to win, obviously, but just to play.\n\nThat led to wonderment as to whether she'd open the door to divulging any details on her recent engagement to Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of the social network Reddit. Williams played it mostly coquettish, but didn't totally shy away from being the future blushing bride.\n\nAsked about the exciting news in her personal life, she countered with a sly smile, Can you elaborate? then added, I'm just kidding.\n\nIt's been really great, said Williams, notably not flaunting an engagement ring. I've said from the beginning I just didn't want to think about it until after Australia because I was, like, Grand Slams mean a lot to me.\n\nMORE TENNIS:\n\nFrustrated Serena Williams loses in second round at Auckland\n\nThanks to Reddit, we can all now see Serena Williams' engagement ring\n\nI don't think I've had an opportunity to let everything sink in, she added. I won't allow it to sink in because I'm so focused. It was right in the middle of pre-season. Now I'm on the road, already back at work. I don't want to get too happy because I want to stay focused.\n\nThe pending marriage supposedly on the back-burner with questions such as whether the part-time fashion designer bride-to-be will create her own wedding dress unanswered, it was back to the basics of tennis.\n\nWilliams reached the final at the first three Grand Slams last season, winning her 22nd major trophy at Wimbledon, but lost out on the title to current No. 1 Angelique Kerber at the Australian and Garbine Muguruza at the French.\n\nAfter a semifinal defeat to Karolina Pliskova at the U.S. Open, Williams relinquished her No. 1 status to Kerber and shut down her year, prematurely, to nurse a left knee injury.\n\nFor me, it wasn't a great season, Williams said of 2016. I think for other people it would have been wonderful. It was what it was.\n\nAs it turns out it wasn't a joyous start to the 2017 season for Williams, who posted 88 unforced errors in a 6-4.6-7, 6-4 second round loss to fellow American Madison Brengle at the Auckland tournament nearly two weeks ago.\n\nWilliams' opportunity to change her luck will commence with a first round meeting against Belinda Bencic on Tuesday. They've split their two prior meetings with the Swiss posting the upset in the 2015 Toronto semifinals.\n\nAlso at stake for Williams at this Australian Open is a possible return to the top of the ranking charts.\n\nIt's a given that if Kerber journeys to the final, win or lose, she retains the No. 1 status.\n\nThe scenarios for Williams to dethrone the German work out to she must reach the final, but if Kerber advances to the round-of-16 Williams must win the trophy.\n\nI didn't come here to lose in the first round, or the second round, or at all, said Williams, sending an obvious message to the other 127 players in the draw.\n\nPHOTOS: SERENA WILLIAMS' GRAND SLAM WINS
After only one woman went home last week (bye, Elyse), this week's Bachelor was going to be a bloodbath. No surprise: It was! Five women left the show this week, four of whom Colton sent packing himself.\n\nSo, who's left?\n\nWe pick up this week right where we left off with last week's to be continued cliffhanger: with Colton frustrated on the beach. Heather dubs the Onyeka/Nicole/Colton drama the moment of the century, because, sure, there's nothing more important going on in the world.\n\nOnyeka confronts the group and asks if anyone feels like she's ever bullied them, and Nicole later joins them.\n\nNicole, you said I bullied you, back it up! Onyeka says in front of the group.\n\nThe show doesn't waste any time bringing us to the rose ceremony. There are seven roses on the table, which means two people are going home. It would be too easy for the two to be Nicole and Onyeka, right?\n\nWrong! The two troublemakers are out of the house faster than their backstabbing bickering match even began.\n\nAnd then we properly start this week's fun.\n\nLove at first sushi roll\n\nColton and the remaining contestants head to Vietnam, and Hannah G. (winner of the first-impression rose) gets the first date card.\n\nHannah G. is absolutely stunning, Colton says about her. Every time I see her I get a little smitten. The two sneak in some spa time and get facial masks.\n\nNot gonna lie, it's hard for me to keep my hands off her, Colton adds. All wrapped up at the spa, he tells her she looks like a sushi roll. I would definitely eat that sushi roll, he cheekily tells the camera.\n\nAfter Caelynn questions Hannah G.'s authenticity as a person to Cassie (i.e. wonders if there's a layer to her that they're missing), we see Hannah G. open up to Colton about her parents' divorce. Colton's parents also are divorced and the two bond. Duh, she gets the rose.\n\nHannah G. tells the camera she's falling in love with him. Colton tells the camera the same. (Start placing your bets, people.)\n\nFight! Fight! Fight!\n\nCassie, Heather, Tayshia, Caelynn, Katie, Hannah B., Sydney and Demi go on this week's group date, Are you ready to fight for love? They learn the ancient art of Vovinam, a Vietnamese martial art. Some are more ready to fight than others.\n\nI went to sleep last night as Hannah B. But I woke up this morning as Hannah Beast, Hannah B. says. She also referred to herself as Hannah Beast last week, so that's a thing.\n\nThe women pair off to spar with each other. The most pivotal moment comes when Demi swears Katie hit her in the face and she winces and whines like a toddler. This doesn't impress Colton. (Remember this later, friends.)\n\nColton opens up to Tayshia after the date and tells her their one-on-ones are what he'd kill for every day. Demi calls her mom with Colton by her side. (Demi's mom has spent time in jail, and this is going to be the first normal phone call they've had in years.)\n\nSydney opts to leave the show. She says that if it their relationship was right then it would be a lot easier. She doesn't think they can get there based on her needing more.\n\nThere are some very wonderful people in that group, she warns Colton. Find them. Figure out who they are. Don't be distracted by shiny things, especially now.\n\nTayshia ultimately gets the rose. She's someone who continues to push me each and every time that we sit down, Colton says.\n\nChemistry-less Colton and Kirpa\n\nKirpa and Colton channel their inner A Star Is Born and dive in to the water together on their boat trip one-on-one. Did anyone else hear far from the shallow now? Just us? Cool.\n\nThe two also go out to dinner and have about as much chemistry as a Tinder date that would fizzle after a month or so. She's been engaged before (from an eight-year-relationship) and he was saving himself for marriage. Colton asks her if she can see herself getting engaged again at the end of this, and she says if they keep progressing as they are she'd want to be engaged.\n\nColton insists he had a fun time and that though their relationship is moving slower, it's our pace. She gets a rose (somehow).\n\nDemi's sex plan fails\n\nDemi may not be a fighter, so she tries being a lover instead. Hopefully, after tonight, Colton won't be the virgin anymore, she says, and goes to visit Colton. Hasn't she learned what happens when you go visit Colton at night? (See: Elyse.)\n\nDemi tells him she feels like she's falling in love with him, but he tells her there's a part of him that doesn't know if they can get there. I don't know right now if I can see myself with you at the end of this, he says. And that's that, she's going home.\n\nWho (else) went home?\n\nAnd after all that: No cocktail party tonight. Five women are vying for roses, and only four are up for grabs. Colton sends Katie home, and she tells him, You have a great group of girls. And you know who's ready in there. And there's some that aren't. She adds, Just be smart about those girls, and the camera pans to Heather and Hannah B.\n\nColton confesses his greatest fear in all this is that he's going to be with somebody who's not ready to be engaged the end of this. He tells the remaining women that Katie's the third person this week to warn him that there's someone or some people here not ready for the future he wants.\n\nColton knows that the tea is brewing and he wants someone to spill the tea, Tayshia tells the camera. It seems like she tells Kirpa at the end (though it's not immediately clear, per some clever camera editing): Let's take this thing. Watch, it's us two at the end. Gulp.\n\nIn case you're an episode behind:'The Bachelor' recap: That kiss finally happens; 1 contestant quits\n\nOr you missed two episodes:'Bachelor' recap: Colton gets serious about sexual assault during chat with Caelynn
PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — No disrespect to Olympic gold medal prospect Nathan Chen, but the biggest current stars in American figure skating won't be taking to the ice this month. They'll be behind a microphone.\n\nFor many, the commentary combo of Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir are more of a reason to tune in to the Winter Olympics than the individuals and pairs populating the competition itself.\n\nThe Tara and Johnny show came to Sochi four years ago, but this time it has hit prime time on NBC and promises to be raucous, outrageous and completely unafraid to pull any punches.\n\nIt is a double act that works, to the extent that the network has put them together at Super Bowl media day, the Academy Awards, the Kentucky Derby and the National Dog Show.\n\nWhen you are trying to reach a younger crowd, this is 2018, the old school way isn't going to work, Lipinski, 35, told USA TODAY Sports in recent joint interview with Weir. You have to be honest and lay it down exactly as you see it. There's a lot of pretty strange things in our sport and you have to have a good chuckle.\n\nThat brand of irreverent humor isn't appreciated by some of the sport's hardcore and traditionalist fans, but is adored by the wider mainstream set that truly drives ratings. Figure skating hasn't boomed since the 1990s and has been left behind by the rapidly evolving media landscape. Weir and Lipinski are doing their darndest to bring it back.\n\nThe 90s were great, it was such a boom time, and on television in general everything was very airbrushed, very beautiful and packaged, Weir said. Then came the family we all love so much — the Kardashians — and suddenly butt injections were on TV, Lady Gaga was ruling the charts, things changed and people wanted reality. We give them reality.\n\nMedal count:How is Team USA faring?\n\nMeet Team USA:Where 2018 Olympians are from\n\nMore:Adam Rippon gives LGBTQ community athlete they can relate to\n\nLipinski, who won gold at Nagano in 1998, and Weir, a three-time national champion and 2008 world bronze medalist, did not cross paths during their own careers.\n\nIn 2014, they were NBC's broadcast experiment, thrown together. They've never looked back. Figure skating commentary may never be the same again.\n\nThe pair are close enough now that they sit for interviews with their bodies touching, and finish each other's sentences. Weir, who is openly gay, was bridesman at Lipinski's wedding to television producer Todd Kapostasy last summer.\n\nWhen she met Weir, Lipinski loved the way he spoke frankly and openly, on and off air.\n\nOur sport is very political and subjective and you can hide that if you want, Lipinski added. But why would you? If a skater falls five times and wins and the next skater who did stand up, doesn't (win), it is very confusing. Johnny is not afraid to go out on that limb, point it out and let the judges know he didn't agree.\n\nWeir was having a tough time during Sochi, with his marriage to ex-husband Victor Voronov on the verge of collapse. Things got messy with accusations flying back and forth, the matter ending up in divorce court, Voronov lodging a defamation suit against Weir and even a dispute over a valuable Faberge egg — much of it played out through TMZ and the New York tabloids.\n\nLooking back to Sochi in particular, I was going through a divorce – it was awful, the most horrible time of my life as far as dealing with another human being, Weir said. The best thing to come out of it was that Tara and I had to bond so quickly. We were in Russia, there was no one really around, I wasn't close to any of my coworkers or my bosses, I wasn't close to anybody. It was just terror. If I hadn't had her I would have panicked. (I would have) gone home or just crumbled under the pressure.\n\nLipinski remembers them working all day — then we'd cry and have therapy sessions with each other — then get back at it the next day and put together a collective breakout performance.\n\nWeir keeps most of his private life out of the commentary spiel but everything else is fair game, and you can confidently bet that the chatter with him and Lipinski won't be restricted to salchows and triple axels.\n\nAnything can be on the agenda, from hairstyles to costumes to whatever happens to be passing through their minds at the time, and unless the viewership's tastes have dramatically changed they'll be lapping it up once more.\n\nWeir and Lipinski are an oddity no more. Somehow, through the force of their own chemistry and personality, they have become a staple of the American Olympic landscape. Last time they were largely tucked away on the NBC Sports Network. Now they are front and center — and ready to shine brighter than the glittering costumes on the ice.\n\nWe just had this chemistry that came instantly and for the last four years we have been building on that, Lipinski added. America has accepted us as the voices of figure skating.\n\nAs a skater, Weir often found more popularity with the sport's occasional fans than he did from the traditionalists. He feels the same is true of his commentary.\n\nAre we feeling more loved? he said. Really hardcore skating fans … it's hard to impress them. We are getting a lot of love from people who don't watch skating and that's what we want — people to come back to our sport. But the sport itself doesn't change much, or quickly.
Patrick Ryan\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWell, it's a step forward from 1989.\n\nLest you've forgotten, Ryan Adams proclaimed himself the ultimate Swiftie in fall 2015, when he released a track-by-track cover album of Taylor Swift's gleaming foray into pop. Although it effectively brought Swift's vivid lyrics and undeniable hooks to the forefront, the sleepy, acoustic-rock slog more or less drained the life out of one of pop's best-crafted efforts in recent years.\n\nSo it's a relief that Adams returns to original material on follow-up Prisoner (**1/2 out of ****), out Friday, his 16th album and first collection of new music since his divorce from actress Mandy Moore was finalized last year. Though he takes no risks sonically, the dissolution of their six-year marriage provides a fascinating lens through which to read this next chapter.\n\nThe 42-year-old singer/songwriter sets the scene with the stomping Do You Still Love Me?, as he ponders what went wrong and attempts to salvage the dying embers of their relationship. Recalling an '80s-era Bruce Springsteen on the harmonica-assisted title track and Doomsday, Adams fights to hold on, singing on the latter, My love, we can do better than this / My love, how can you complicate a kiss? It's an aching sentiment that eventually turns into defeat on Shiver and Shake, in which he describes the physical distress of heartbreak and how if I wait here any longer, I'll just fade away.\n\nAfter a stirring first half, Prisoner treads into less affecting territory in its second, as Adams continues to wallow in pain while offering little insight into what may have actually transpired between them. The exceptions are Breakdown, a morose guitar ballad that veraciously captures the hopelessness that comes with breakups; and album closer We Disappear, in which he painfully takes a stab at closure, conceding, You deserve a future and you know I'll never change.\n\nWith the exception of a serene saxophone solo on the sanguine Tightrope, Prisoner hews closer to the bare-bones arrangements of 2011's Ashes & Fire than his more rock-heavy self-titled album in 2014. Some fans may gripe that Adams is simply doing more of the same, but overall, it's a solid, sincere addition to his prolific catalog.\n\nDownload: Do You Still Love Me?, Shiver and Shake, Breakdown
Japan's environment minister is taking paternity leave, a first for a Cabinet minister in the country where men rarely take time off for raising children.\n\nThe move has made waves around the country and world, even as Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, a potential candidate for prime minister one day, said he'd only take off two weeks over three months.\n\nHonestly, I had to think over and over how I should take time off for child rearing, or take paternity leave, while fulfilling my public duty as environment minister, Koizumi told ministry officials and reporters Wednesday. Unless we change the atmosphere, government employees presumably won't start taking paternity leave.\n\nThe decision comes as Japan has pushed for men to take paternity leave and spend more time with their families. The government changed its rules last month allowing public servants now to take more than a month of paternity leave. Governors in Hiroshima and Mie have taken leave, but never before has a Cabinet minister.\n\nAcross the country, Japan's leave policy is generous, with men and women allowed to take off up to 12 months with partial pay. However, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare says only 6% of eligible men took paternity leave from work in 2018.\n\nKoizumi, son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, said he'd be taking the leave without it affecting his parliamentary and Cabinet duties.\n\nKoizumi is having his first child later this month and said last year when announcing his marriage that he'd be taking the leave. Some have been critical of the decision, saying he should focus on his public service duties.\n\nI hope there will be a day when lawmakers' paternity leave is no longer news, he said.\n\nI wholeheartedly support him, Tokyo politician Hironobu Narisawa told local media, per CBS News. This will encourage other male employees.\n\nParental leave in the US:America's parents want paid family leave and affordable child care. Why can't they get it?\n\n'Childcare is outrageous here':Real people sound off on paid leave, affordable child care\n\nIn the United States, federal law allows for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a new child, however, individual employers may grant some amount of paid leave. The United States is the only OECD country that does not offer paid leave to new mothers, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.

LOS ANGELES – The fast-approaching end of Modern Family is sinking in for the people who make the acclaimed ABC comedy, cast members told USA TODAY during an exclusive on-set visit Thursday.\n\nCast, writers and crew Wednesday experienced one of the final milestones on the way to the April 8 series finale: the last group script reading – table read, as it's known in the business – before they begin shooting the final half hour of the 11-season series, a five-time Emmy winner for best comedy.\n\nThey shared their feelings Thursday during shooting breaks between scenes from the two-part finale, which will bring the show's episode count to a lofty 250.\n\nIt's getting a little real, says Julie Bowen, whose Claire Dunphy is married to Phil (Ty Burrell) and the mother of three now-grown children. I don't like table reads to begin with. I hate them as a performative thing, because they make me very anxious. It's like doing a play. And so I thought I wouldn't care, that I'd be thrilled when we were done.\n\n'Modern' maturation:Ariel Winter and Sarah Hyland on growing up on 'Modern Family': People love to attack women\n\nIt didn't quite turn out that way. I was sobbing and sobbing by the end, she says, acknowledging that the tears will be flowing during the final week of production. Turns out I'm not going to have any control over my emotions during this process.\n\nBowen, one of numerous cast members to commemorate the last table read on social media, conveyed the mood visually with an Instagram post featuring a photo of long-time Modern Family writer and producer Danny Zuker: Modern Family's FINAL table read is hitting @dannyzuker hard. Our writers truly are the heroes of the show...\n\nEd O'Neill, who plays patriarch Jay Pritchett, the husband of Gloria (Sofia Vergara) and father of Claire and her brother, Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), from his first marriage, says he's very happy with the final script of the series, which was created by Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan.\n\nO'Neill, speaking before shooting a scene on Thursday, called it perfect, just the right amount of sentiment, but not too much. It was very good and very funny.\n\nDuring the script reading, the cast sat facing the writers at a long table, as shown in Vergara's Instagram post below.\n\nAs it progressed, I could see people getting emotional, O'Neill says. When it ended, I just stood up and started applauding the writers. Everybody was doing it and that lasted for, like, five minutes.\n\n'Modern' milestone:Exclusive 'Modern Family' video: With Phil ill, jealousy bug bites Cam in 200th episode\n\nEric Stonestreet, who portrays Mitchell's husband, Cam, posted a short video of the table-read room with Trace Adkins' You're Gonna Miss This playing as a soundtrack.\n\nThe table read was kind of tough, just having it actually dawn on everybody that it's over, Burrell says, expecting more emotions in the coming days.\n\nBut I honestly feel like the dominant emotion isn't sadness. It's actually sort of an overwhelming gratitude that has a lot of people feeling emotional, he says. It's just feeling really grateful to have had the experience and to have been with these people, understanding how rare and special it's been.
Bree Burkitt\n\nThe Spectrum\n\nST. GEORGE, Utah — Following Tuesday nights announcement of the death of President Thomas S. Monson, questions have already emerged about who will be the next prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nAccording to a statement previously released by the church, the appointment of a new president is viewed by members as a divinely revealed process free of internal lobbying.\n\nFollowing the death of the president, the First Presidency is automatically dissolved and the two counselors in the First Presidency return to positions of seniority in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In this situation, that would be President Henry B. Eyring and President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, who served as Monson's two counselors since he assumed the Prophet role in 2008.\n\nMore:Mormon Church President Thomas Monson dies at 90\n\nMore:Mormon leader reaffirms faith's opposition to gay marriage\n\nA senior apostle is then determined based on who has the highest ranking seniority from the date when they were ordained to the Twelve. The longest-tenured member of the governing body is 93-year-old Russell M. Nelson. His appointment will not be officially named until after Monson's funeral services, out of respect.\n\nThe senior apostle will then preside over a meeting of the Quorum of the Twelve to consider two alternatives: should the First Presidency be reorganized or should they just move forward with the Quorum of the Twelve? A formal motion will be made and accepted.\n\nIf the motion to reorganize is passed, the Quorum of the Twelve will unanimously select the new president, who will assume the top role in the nearly 16 million-member church. The decision is predetermined, though.\n\nThroughout the history of the Church, the longest-serving apostle has always become the president of the Church when the First Presidency has been reorganized, according to a church release.\n\nThe next president has not been named yet, but based on this information the job is expected to go to Nelson. He has served nearly 34 years after being first called to service in 1984.\n\nAfter being officially selected, he will then choose two counselors from the Quorum of the Twelve to form a three-person presidency considered the religion's top governing body.\n\nThe second-longest serving apostle will be designated as the new president of the Quorum of the Twelve after the reorganization of the First Presidency. This would be Dallin H. Oaks, who has served for 33 years and nine months.\n\nThere have been 16 presidents, including Monson, since the founding of the LDS Church by Joseph Smith in 1830.\n\nThe choosing of the prophet differs from the choosing of other religious heads. For instance, traditionally, there is a 15- to 20-day waiting period from the death of a pope to the start of a conclave, the process of choosing the next leader of the Catholic Church.\n\nAt the start of a conclave —­ Latin for with key, referring to the voters being locked inside the Sistine Chapel ­— the 115 cardinals move into the Domus Santa Marta, a modest five-story building tucked securely behind Vatican walls.\n\nAfter morning prayers, the first balloting takes place, the Rev. Thomas Reese, author of Inside the Vatican: The Politics and Organization of the Catholic Church, told USA TODAY in 2013, during the selection of Pope Francis, who succeeded retiring Pope Benedict.\n\nAfter the first day, then there are customarily four votes per day, trying to reach a two-thirds majority of the cardinals. In 2013, Jorge Mario Bergoglio was chosen on the second day on the fifth ballot and became Pope Francis. Reese noted the last time a conclave lasted more than four days was in 1831.\n\nContributing: Marco della Cava, USA TODAY. Follow Bree Burkitt on Twitter: @breeburkitt
Married five days ago in a jailhouse wedding, a suburban Cincinnati man found himself Tuesday one step closer to deportation.\n\nYancarlos Mendez, 27, of Springdale, Ohio, was taken overnight to a federal detention center in Louisiana, the final move before he will be put on a plane for his native Dominican Republic. The Bayou State has three immigration detention centers in Basile, Jena and Oakdale, and his records did not come up in a search of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Online Detainee Locator System.\n\nHis lawyers confirmed the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement decision to proceed with Mendez's removal. He overstayed a 90-day non-visa waiver by more than two years, according to agency officials.\n\nLate Monday, lawyers Charleston Wang and Nazly Mamedova completed an emergency application for a stay of removal that says irreparable harm will befall a 6-year-old paraplegic boy named Ricky Solis. The son of Mendez's wife, Sanda Mendoza, is now legally related to Mendez as his stepfather.\n\n► Feb. 9:As husband's deportation looms, bride ready 'for whatever comes next'\n\n► Jan. 19:Immigrant's jailhouse wedding gets OK from sheriff\n\n► Jan. 18:Ohio sheriff blocks jailhouse marriage of immigrant facing deportation\n\nMendez's lawyers submitted the application overnight to Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan. She has jurisdiction over the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which this past week overturned its previous stay of Mendez's deportation.\n\nMendez, an auto mechanic, financially supported his fiancée and her son and has training from Cincinnati Children's Hospital staff to care for Ricky's extensive medical needs.\n\nRicky traveled last week with his mother and the family's ministers to the Morrow County Jail in Mount Gilead, Ohio, an hour north of Columbus, for the wedding. He was not allowed in the jail's secure area, where the ceremony took place.\n\n► Jan. 16:Can courts stop deportation of disabled boy's caregiver? Yes\n\n► Jan. 12:Deportation stay granted for caregiver 'daddy' of paraplegic boy\n\n► Jan. 8:Despite social media outcry, paraplegic boy's 'daddy' to be deported\n\nWe have one last chance, one last chance, Mendoza said.\n\nShe spoke Monday on the phone with her husband.\n\nI tried to cheer him up and tell him not to be sad, she said. It is so difficult.\n\n► Jan. 5:ICE to move forward with deportation of paraplegic boy's caregiver\n\n► Jan. 4:Paraplegic 6-year-old's 'daddy' faces deportation\n\nRicky was injured in a car crash a year ago in the Cincinnati suburb of Fairfield, Ohio. Mendez proposed shortly after the incident and lived in Ricky's hospital room with his fiancée for several months until the boy's release.\n\nMendez was detained and turned over to the federal government after he was stopped in November for driving without a license.\n\nFollow Mark Curnutte on Twitter: @MarkCurnutte
Bill Keveney\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBEVERLY HILLS, Calif. – A huge class divide hasn't stopped Downton Abbey's Lady Mary and her lady's maid, Anna Bates, from finding a way to connect.\n\nThe most interesting part of this story is the relationship between the two worlds. Mary has her most sisterly relationship with Anna. She knows her better than anyone, Michelle Dockery (Mary) says in a joint interview with Joanne Froggatt (Anna) before the sixth and final season of PBS Masterpiece's Downton (Sundays, 9 p.m. ET/PT, check local listings). For me and Jo, that's been a huge part of the experience, those scenes between the two of them.\n\nAnna has a strong marriage to her downstairs colleague, Mr. Bates (Brendan Coyle), but she speaks most freely to Mary.\n\nMary's been the one from the start that Anna's always confided in, Froggatt says. They really genuinely care for each other. Anna won't hear a bad word said about Lady Mary, even though she's not always perfect.\n\nThat applies from the other direction, too, Dockery says. A lot of the time, Mary doesn't really care what other people think, especially the family. But it's important that she gets approval from Anna.\n\nMary's relationship with her real sister, Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael), is fractious, leading to plenty of drama. There's some really great stuff between the sisters, especially late in the season, Dockery says.\n\nWhile Anna has a husband, the widowed Lady Mary, who has a young child, is seeking a new partner.\n\nIt's complicated. She's a widow now, so her choices are different, because it's about finding a father for George as well, Dockery says.\n\nDashing race-car driver Henry Talbot (Matthew Goode) is a candidate, although Mary may not agree. That's the sort of guy she would have liked at the beginning, Dockery says.  Mary was a rebel. Then her position gave her more responsibility, and she kind of became the person she didn't want to be.\n\nThere's a playful give and take between the two actors as they discuss swapping their Downton roles.\n\nI definitely want the (upstairs) wardrobe, Froggatt says.\n\nDockery cautions. Sometimes, you're like, 'You can take it,'  because of all the costume changes during filming.\n\nFroggatt reconsiders: I'm so glad all I have to do is one fitting at the beginning of each season.\n\nAnd Dockery decides she doesn't mind: . The outfit changes are always worth it, because they are knockout.\n\nThe period covered by Masterpiece's Downton – 1912 and through World War I to a technologically advanced 1925 – reflects massive change. You definitely feel those social changes, more so for the women, Froggatt says. You feel there are starting to be more opportunities for women and for the working classes.\n\nNew opportunities greet the actors, too. Dockery is set to play a thief and con artist in contemporary America in upcoming TNT drama Good Behavior, while Froggatt will go back to the 19th century to play poisoner Mary Ann Cotton in Masterpiece's two-part Dark Angel.\n\nThey appreciate their Downton fame, with each ending heading toward the March 6 series finale serving as a reminder.\n\nThe last day (shooting) at Highclere Castle was a big day, Dockery says. That's when it really started to sink in.
Keith Uhlig\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\n\nMARSHFIELD - Sara Guild's unborn baby died about halfway through her pregnancy.\n\nUntil that point in 2016, Guild, outreach director for U.S. Congressman Sean Duffy and a Marathon County Board member, and her husband, Daniel Guild, Weston village administrator, were thinking about the future.\n\nBy that stage, you are already planning a life around another member of your family, said Sara Guild, 33. After the doctor told her the news, she said she only had one thought: What did I do wrong?\n\nNothing. She took some solace when her doctor told her so. The baby likely died because its body got twisted up with the umbilical cord, her obstetrician said. It's the cause of an estimated 10 percent of stillbirths, according to research by the Stillbirth Collaborative Research Network.\n\nBut for many women who lose unborn babies, the reason isn't at all clear. And sometimes, there is no answer at all to a loss during pregnancy. Not knowing what happened or why can add even more emotional pain to an already difficult grieving process.\n\nThat special kind of suffering spurred Dr. Elizabeth McPherson and Diane Allingham-Hawkins of PreventionGenetics, a Marshfield genetic testing lab, to band together to find a new, better way to determine the causes of pregnancy loss. McPherson is a medical geneticist for the firm and director of the Wisconsin Stillbirth Service Program. Allingham-Hawkins is the senior laboratory director at PreventionGenetics and a geneticist who specializes in the technical aspect of scrutinizing human DNA.\n\nTogether, they and their colleagues at PreventionGenetics unveiled in December a first-of-its-kind process of determining why unborn or just-born infants have died, called the Comprehensive Miscarriage, Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Panel.\n\nCouples who experience these kinds of challenges are compelled to seek answers to questions whether the event will happen again, and if it could have been prevented, McPherson said. Genetic testing can sometimes open the doors to answers.\n\nHow the test works\n\nThink of DNA as a car engine. A skilled mechanic knows a good engine by the way it looks and sounds. When things go wrong, the mechanic can look at an engine and see oil seeping through a seal, find a cracked hose or hear a piston misfiring.\n\nIt was only recently that researchers fully understood what a sound gene looked like. Now they can use highly-refined equipment and testing procedures to look at DNA of the child and see where things have gone wrong — like a mechanic does with an engine. The PreventionGenetics testing panel uses genetic expertise and sophisticated technology developed over the past decade or so to identify DNA deficiencies in the child that cause pregnancy loss.\n\nThe PreventionGenetics lab itself isn't all the distinctive. It looks like a high-tech chemistry lab, full of equipment such as computers, monitors and machines that have a space-age, microwave or dishwasher kind of look. But the equipment is able to peer down into the sub-cell level and provide images of the genes that are the building blocks of life. Geneticists then can use those images to determine genetic problems.\n\nThe PreventionGenetic miscarriage panel is not just one simple test. It's a battery of tests that first scrutinizes for chromosome abnormalities (chromosomes are larger, and therefore easier to study). Then, if the cause isn't found, the tests go deeper into the DNA to scrutinize specific genes for problems, the most common first. In the past, all those tests were done individually. The PreventionGenetic procedure is unique because it uses one cohesive process and can find genetic disorders more efficiently.\n\nMcPherson has three decades worth of experience working with patients and she has a deep understanding of the genetic problems that cause pregnancy loss. One of the reasons McPherson specialized in genetics 30 years ago was because she foresaw how the study of the DNA could impact the future of medicine. Through her professional career, she has seen a science revolution in the field of genetics.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, we didn't know the genes and what they cause, McPherson said.\n\nThe PreventionGenetics Comprehensive Miscarriage, Stillbirth & Neonatal Death Panel is based at its very core on the work of the Human Genome Project. Begun in the 1990, the international scientific effort completed in 2003 the vast and intricate blueprint that provides the instructions for the development of a human being, according to the National Human Genome Research Institute.\n\nHuman DNA contains the information that determines a cell's makeup and role in the human body. Nearly every cell in a person contains a copy of the 3 billion DNA pairs that make up the human genome.\n\nThe Human Genome Project created a model, or map, of the entire sequence. That information gives medical researchers an understanding of the healthy DNA. They use that information to find defective or deficient genetic factors that contribute to diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. And miscarriages.\n\nLoss of pregnancy 'so common,' rarely discussed\n\nThousands of American families deal with a loss during pregnancy or death shortly after birth each year:\n\nMiscarriages, a pregnancy loss prior to 20 weeks, occur in anywhere from 10 to 25 percent of all clinically-recognized pregnancies, according to the American Pregnancy Association, an organization that promotes pregnancy wellness.\n\nAbout 24,000 stillbirths — defined as a loss 20 or more weeks after a woman becomes pregnant — were reported in the U.S. in 2013, or 1 percent of all pregnancies, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nNeonatal death refers to the death of a live-born infant before the baby is 28 days old. Precise statistics on neonatal deaths are difficult to find, but it affects about 4 million babies per year across the world, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nGuild said it wasn't until she miscarried that she learned how prevalent pregnancy losses are. After her experience, friends, relatives and colleagues began to speak to her about their experiences.\n\nIt is so common, Guild said. And it's so rarely talked about.\n\nA mother's guilt that she could be at fault is part of the reason for the taboo in discussing pregnancy loss, Allingham-Hawkins said.\n\nBut it's also often an unacknowledged loss, she said. People assume (because the baby hasn't been born) that (the mother) didn't connect with them. And that's just not true.\n\nDeveloping the test\n\nThe need for a new genetic testing panel became obvious to McPherson when she became the director of the Wisconsin Stillbirth Service Program in 2009. That medical program was developed in 1983 to provide state services to families and health care providers across the state, with a focus on assessing why stillbirths happen in Wisconsin.\n\nWhen she started working with the Wisconsin Stillbirth Service, McPherson also began to pore through the data compiled by the service, representing about 3,000 stillbirths and their causes. She looked for causes that would not be immediately apparent to an attending physician, but also were prevalent in the cases.\n\nI was searching for genetic diseases that might be missed on an autopsy, McPherson said.\n\nAbout half of early miscarriages, 25 percent of stillbirths and 20 percent of neonatal deaths can be traced back to abnormalities of the developing baby, and most of those have a genetic cause, according to PreventionGenetics.\n\nMcPherson's and Allingham-Hawkins' skills meshed together well to create the testing panel for miscarriages.\n\n\n\nAllingham-Hawkins's specialty is knowing how to create the genetic tests that find those problems.\n\nMcPherson and Allingham-Hawkins' partnership was a perfect marriage. There was a mixture of clinical expertise with technical know-how, said Christina Zaleski, the PreventionGenetics director of genetic counseling/client services.\n\nPersonal experience also motivated McPherson and Allingham-Hawkins to develop the test. Allingham-Hawkins understands full well the pain of miscarriage — she's had two.\n\nAnd just after the testing panel was completed, another PreventionGenetic colleague, Angela Gruber, a human molecular geneticist who is the director of the Specimen Processing Department, lost her child in December, four months before she was due.\n\nAs part of the grieving process, Gruber named her late child Rosemary, and she and her husband, Ben Gruber, a firefighter/paramedic, consented for Rosemary's DNA to be used to validate the testing panel and make sure it worked as designed.\n\nGruber still aches from the loss, but participating in the test development process helped ease some of the pain.\n\nKnowing that our little girl was directly involved in the validation of the test that can help so many families is comforting, Gruber said. For many families, getting an answer is closure, relief, and allows for you to be at peace with the situation.\n\nHer connection with her unborn baby led Gruber to allow a photographer to record the day Rosemary was delivered. We sang songs, read books, and continue to hold her close to our hearts, Gruber said.\n\nRosemary had trioplody, which is a chromosomal disorder which causes abnormal development and almost always causes pregnancy loss. It affects about 1 to 3 percent of all pregnancies.\n\nAt my 12-week appointment things seemed off, and I had a mother's intuition that something was wrong, Gruber said. It wasn't until our week 20 ultrasound that my fears and concerns were confirmed by a lot of life-threatening birth defects.\n\nGruber, an Auburndale native who has earned a doctorate in biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, understands more than most the genetic problems that can lead to miscarriage. Plus she had the support of colleagues such as McPherson and Christina Zaleski, the PreventionGenetics director of genetic counseling/client services.\n\nEven before Gruber lost Rosemary, McPherson diagnosed trioplody. In one sense, the diagnosis was a relief.\n\nWhen we first started to realize there was something not right with our little girl, my first concern was if my husband and I were carriers for a disorder. At least we know that this most likely was a random one-off event that shouldn't be something to worry about in future pregnancies, Gruber said.\n\nEven though Gruber knew why Rosemary didn't survive, using her DNA to validate the test was a way to help others in a similar situation, Zaleski said. (There's a) passion and desire here to bring answers to families experiencing a very deep and personal loss.\n\n'A really good tool'\n\nStillbirth often happens without any warning, said Dr. Maria Mascola, a maternal and fetal medicine specialist who treats women with high-risk pregnancies for the Marshfield Clinic in Marshfield. And it's not only devastating and perplexing for parents, but it's also important to them to find out why. ... That's such a natural reaction, of course.\n\nMascola estimates that she can ascertain causes for about a third to half of the stillbirths in her patients. That leaves a significant number left in doubt. The PreventionGenetics panel can help determine hard-to-find causes in those cases, Mascola said.\n\nSince learning about PreventionGenetics' panel, Mascola has ordered the testing to be done for two of her patients. She hasn't received results yet, but she believes in the process. That's because she's worked with McPherson in the past and is confident in McPherson's abilities.\n\nI don't think there's anybody better equipped than her to address this issue, Mascola said. I think she's developed a really good tool.\n\nMcPherson worked with Mascola as a geneticist with the Marshfield Clinic, and also as the director of the Wisconsin Stillbirth Project.\n\nThe Stillbirth Project is an amazing, amazing resource in helping clinicians, hospitals and patients find out the causes of stillbirths. And as the director, McPherson has expanded the knowledge base regarding miscarriages and stillbirths, helping create large databases that hospitals can use as resources, and because she has the deep genetic knowledge that doctors who specialize in obstetrics and gynecology generally don't have.\n\nGenetics is a complicated world, and is becoming more complicated each day as new discoveries are being made, Mascola said.\n\nThose new advances, such as the PreventionGenetics miscarriage panel, are life changing.\n\nKnowing what happened during a pregnancy carries the very essence of motherhood, said Sara Guild.\n\nAs a mother, it's up to you to protect that child from the moment it develops, Guild said. You're so emotionally invested from the moment of conception.\n\nKeith Uhlig can be reached at 715-845-0651 or at keith.uhlig@gannettwisconsin.com.

Fredreka Schouten and Mary Troyan\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — The Alabama political scandal that has cost the state's governor his marriage and now threatens his job has thrust politicians' growing use of often-secretly funded nonprofits into the spotlight.\n\nGov. Robert Bentley's former aides created the tax-exempt Alabama Council for Excellent Government last year to promote the governor's agenda, but some of its funds went to pay the governor's senior political adviser, exposed in recent weeks as his extramarital love interest. And like any other social-welfare group created under the 501(c)(4) section of the tax code, it does not have to disclose its donors.\n\nNonprofit groups have become a fixture in federal politics, allowing secret donors to pump unlimited sums into advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts in elections. But their use has spread rapidly to statehouses from Lansing, Mich., to Nashville, Tenn., and city halls from New York to Los Angeles, as another source of cash that elected officials of both parties can tap to help shape public policy.\n\nElected officials defend their use, saying nonprofits can move more nimbly than government agencies to advance civic initiatives and are less likely to draw the public's ire over using taxpayer funds for pet projects or quasi-political expenses, such as polling. Campaign-finance watchdogs, however, said they are just another way for unregulated money to seep into the political process and give big donors a back-door method to curry favor with decision makers.\n\nThe c4 world was created for social-welfare opportunities, to help hospitals and food banks and the like provide services to people, said Edwin Bender, an expert on campaign money who runs the National Institute on Money in State Politics in Helena, Mont. The fact they have morphed into political slush funds is certainly against the spirit of the (tax) code.\n\nIn Michigan, a tax-exempt group operated by Gov. Rick Snyder's supporters is helping to underwrite the Republican's public relations campaign to cope with the Flint water contamination crisis. The group, Moving Michigan Forward, discloses its donors and reported taking in nearly $300,000 during the first three months of this year. Most of the money came from another Snyder-linked non-profit, Making Government Accountable. That group does not make its donors' identities public, said Snyder spokesman Ari Adler.\n\nAsked whether the fundraising gave donors a behind-the-scenes opportunity to build relationships with the governor, Adler said: You could also look at it, though, that there are people who want to help in Flint and may not necessarily want to be out there cutting a check and making it public because they don't want the publicity.\n\nObama to visit Flint, prompted by 8-year-old's letter\n\nIn Los Angeles, Democratic Mayor Eric Garcetti helped establish a nonprofit, Mayor's Fund for Los Angeles, to raise funds for his initiatives, ranging from a public campaign to encourage city residents to reduce their water usage to a program that keeps parks and recreation centers open after dark during the summer months. It raised $14.6 million in its first full fiscal year, drawing support from philanthropic groups such as the Anheuser-Busch Foundation, to companies such as Goldman Sachs and Paramount Pictures, according to its website.\n\nGarcetti has said he has no control over the fund, which he describes on the website as a public-private partnership that enables the nimbleness of private enterprise to meet the scale of city government.\n\nThis year, allies of another big-city mayor, New York's Bill de Blasio, began disbanding Campaign for One New York, a nonprofit group created to advance his agenda on issues, such as universal pre-kindergarten. The group, whose donors have included individuals and companies with businesses before the city, had drawn sharp criticism from government watchdogs who claimed it amounted to a shadow government, operating outside of campaign-finance rules that bar corporate donations to mayoral candidates. The group discloses its donors.\n\nThe nonprofit now appears to be part of a sprawling federal and state investigation into the Democrat's fundraising practices. This week, The Wall Street Journal reported that JAD Corporation of America, a company that received a New York City contract to buy its mint-scented garbage bags that repel rodents, received a subpoena from authorities looking into De Blasio's affairs. The company's owner, Joseph Dussich, had donated $100,000 to Campaign for One New York.\n\nDe Blasio has denied any wrongdoing and has said the nonprofit is shutting down because its work is done. Dussich did not return telephone calls, and an official with the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York declined comment.\n\nIn Tennessee, Gov. Bill Haslam's former campaign manager formed Tennesseans for Student Success in October 2014 to defend Haslam's education policies, including running ads supporting like-minded legislators. This year, the 501(c)(4) announced it will spend $500,000 on an aggressive ground, air and data operation to support the policies that have led Tennessee to become the fastest improving state in the nation in education and hired a field director with experience on state and federal political campaigns. It does not disclose donors.\n\nThe practice also has reached the highest levels of government.\n\nIn 2013, President Obama became the first sitting president to launch nonprofit advocacy group to lobby for his agenda. The group, Organizing for Action, reported $40.4 million in revenue during its two years of operation, according to its most recent filings with the IRS. The tax-exempt group does not accept corporate money or donations from federal lobbyists and voluntarily discloses all contributions larger than $250 on its website. OFA has advocated for everything from Obama's push to overhaul the criminal-justice system to urging the Republican-controlled Senate to take action on his Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland.\n\nLike Obama, the 501(c)(4) in Alabama promoting Bentley's agenda was formed at the beginning of his second term, with two of the governor's former aides listed as incorporators. During the state legislative session that followed in early 2015, the Alabama Council for Excellent Government touted the Republican's unsuccessful $541 million tax and revenue package.\n\nDuring that same time, the group paid $15,000 to RCM Communications, a consulting firm run by Rebekah Mason, the adviser now at the heart of the scandal involving the governor. Mason resigned after recordings of their romantic phone conversations became public in March.\n\nAlabama governor took alleged paramour to formal White House dinner\n\nThe investigations have just begun into whether the arrangement — having a top adviser to the governor paid by private sources — violated Alabama's ethics laws. At least two lawsuits are seeking information about the finances of the organization, and some lawmakers are calling for Bentley's impeachment amid questions about whether state resources were misused.\n\nRebekah was paid by a campaign fund that we don't know who contributed to, and that just don't pass the smell test, said state Rep. Jim Patterson, a Republican lawmaker in Alabama who introduced legislation barring anyone paid using undisclosed, private money from working for the state.\n\nMason herself disclosed the Alabama Council for Excellent Government's payment to her consulting firm, but the group has not publicly identified any of its donors and has not fully disclosed how it has spent its money. It is run by Bentley's former legal adviser, Cooper Shattuck, who is now general counsel for the University of Alabama System.\n\nIn the wake of the Bentley scandal, Shattuck told USA TODAY that he has contacted the group's donors and none has agreed to allow their identities to be revealed. The Alabama Council for Excellent Government has not yet filed a tax return with the IRS, but Shattuck said the group has raised about $123,000 and spent almost $81,000 since March 2015.\n\nShattuck said using a tax-exempt group makes sense because it can make expenditures that help further a governor's agenda that some feel are more appropriately paid with private funds, such as polling and digital media advertising.
In an award season with no clear front-runner, Joker catapulted to the lead Monday morning. Director Todd Phillips' villainous origin story scored 11 Oscar nominations, including best picture and best actor for Joaquin Phoenix. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, 1917 and The Irishman each scored 10 nods.\n\nThe 92nd annual Academy Awards, airing Feb. 9 (ABC, 8 p.m. ET/5 PT), won't have a host for the second year in a row but will have plenty of excitement with a stacked best-picture race.\n\nJoker will compete against Quentin Tarantino's 1969-set L.A. fantasy Once Upon a Time, Martin Scorsese's gangster epic Irishman, Noah Baumbach's divorce drama Marriage Story, Sam Mendes' World War I thriller 1917, Bong Joon-ho's dark comedy Parasite, Greta Gerwig's coming-of-age adaptation Little Women, retro racing drama Ford v Ferrari and Taika Waititi's World War II satire Jojo Rabbit.\n\nBiggest Oscar snubs:Jennifer Lopez, Robert De Niro shut out of nominations\n\nWho's up for an Oscar?See the complete list of nominees\n\nParasite, which is in contention for the recently renamed international feature film Oscar, picked up six nominations, as did Jojo Rabbit, Marriage Story and Little Women.\n\nWith his transformative Joker role, Golden Globe winner Phoenix scored a best-actor nomination alongside Adam Driver (Marriage Story), Leonardo DiCaprio (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), Antonio Banderas (Pain and Glory) and Jonathan Pryce (The Two Popes).\n\nRenee Zellweger, who has earned stellar reviews – and a Globe win – as Judy Garland in the biopic Judy, is a favorite in the race for best actress, which also includes Scarlett Johansson (Marriage Story), Saoirse Ronan (Little Women), Charlize Theron (Bombshell) and Cynthia Erivo (Harriet).\n\nOnce Upon a Time star Brad Pitt, armed with a Golden Globe win and a ton of goodwill, could be on the road to Oscar glory with a nomination for supporting actor. He'll take on the Irishman duo Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, Tom Hanks (A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood) and Anthony Hopkins (The Two Popes).\n\nLaura Dern, who won the Golden Globe for supporting actress for Marriage Story, is in the Oscar category with Johansson (Jojo Rabbit), Margot Robbie (Bombshell), Kathy Bates (Richard Jewell) and Florence Pugh (Little Women).\n\nErivo was the lone woman of color nominated in a predominately white acting field that also snubbed Golden Globe winner Awkwafina (The Farewell), Screen Actors Guild nominee Jamie Foxx (Just Mercy) and Globe nominee Eddie Murphy (Dolemite Is My Name).\n\nThe race for best director features Tarantino, Bong, Mendes, Scorsese and Phillips, but no women were included.\n\nGerwig scored a nomination for Little Women in adapted screenplay, a category that also features Joker, Irishman, Jojo Rabbit and The Two Popes. Up for original screenplay are Once Upon a Time, Parasite, 1917, Marriage Story and Rian Johnson's murder mystery Knives Out.\n\nFrozen II, which recently became the highest-grossing animated movie of all time, picked up a nomination for best original song (Into the Unknown) but was shut out for best animated feature, which the first hit film won in 2014. The category this year spotlights recent Globe winner Missing Link, Toy Story 4, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World and a pair of Netflix films, Klaus and I Lost My Body.
Mark Curnutte\n\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nCINCINNATI — Amid U.S. immigration officials' efforts to send a young man thousands of miles away, he and his fiancee are trying to tie the knot.\n\nAn Ohio sheriff is blocking it.\n\nMorrow County Sheriff John L. Hinton said he will not allow the jailhouse marriage of one of his federal prisoners, Yancarlos Mendez of Springdale, to the mother of a paraplegic boy because it needs to go through U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement first.\n\nEven then, Hinton said, the decision about whether to let the marriage take place would ultimately be his.\n\nWe haven't allowed any in the past, Hinton told The Enquirer.\n\nMore:Despite social media outcry, paraplegic boy's 'Daddy' to be deported\n\nMore:Paraplegic 6-year-old's 'Daddy' faces deportation\n\nMendez, a native of the Dominican Republic with dual Spanish citizenship, has a final deportation order. However, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, which granted a temporary stay of deportation last week to determine if it had jurisdiction, on Thursday set a schedule for going forward with the case. The dates stretch into April.\n\nIn the meantime, Mendez will remain jailed in Morrow County, north of Columbus.\n\nSandra Mendoza and Mendez have planned to get married since February, but they were consumed with the around-the-clock medical needs of her son, Ricky Solis, 6, who is paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nRicky remains hospitalized at Cincinnati Children's Hospital because of abdominal bleeding. He sustained serious bowel, bladder and colon injuries in a February auto crash. He needs surgery.\n\nAttorney Nazly Mamedova said that legal precedent exists that prevents jailers or sheriffs from denying a prisoner's legal right to marry. She said she requested permission Wednesday and was told by a deputy that the sheriff does not allow inmate marriages.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 1987 Missouri case — Turner v. Safley — that preventing inmates from marrying violates their constitutional rights. Mamedova said the precedent has been affirmed in other cases by the court that a fundamental right to marriage exists under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe sheriff said he is not aware of such case law.\n\nI'd take a look at it, Hinton said\n\nICE wants to deport Mendez because it says he violated terms of the Visa Waiver Program, which is how he entered the United States from Spain. He overstayed the 90-day visa, ICE said.\n\nHis attorneys said Mendez is the sole provider for Mendoza and Ricky and, with Mendoza, was trained to provide specialized medical care to Ricky in the family's Springdale apartment.\n\nTheirs is not the only immigration case on which the 6th Circuit has ruled in the past week. On Wednesday, it ordered the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeal to reconsider evidence in the deportation case of Maribel Trujillo-Diaz. The Fairfield mother of four was deported to Mexico in April.
Would a real Oscar front-runner please stand up?\n\nWith less than two weeks until the Academy Awards on Feb. 9 (ABC, 8 p.m. ET/5 PT), it has become painfully obvious who's taking all the acting gold but not so much what's going home with the big prize: best picture. This awards season has spread the love around, giving every major film contender a time to shine and every person in an Oscar pool a chance to chew on his or her nails.\n\nThrowing other wrenches into the works: Best picture is voted on through a preferential ballot, where academy members rank their choices rather than just pick one winner, plus a voting body that is slowly getting younger and more diverse every year.\n\nBest picture:15 films that didn't deserve the Oscar – and the ones that should have won instead\n\nOscar tally: Here are the films and actors leading the race\n\nWhile one movie hasn't risen to rule them all quite yet, some have been left in the dust. The racing drama Ford v Ferrari may win some technical awards but that's it, the best chances for coming-of-age adaptation Little Women and divorce drama Marriage Story are in the screenplay categories, and the World War II satire Jojo Rabbit looms as a dark horse with key guild nominations but has yet to make a splash this season.\n\nHere are the five, though, with the right resumes to conquer the best-picture race on Oscar night:\n\n'1917'\n\nThe closest thing to a favorite is director Sam Mendes' World War I thriller, about two British soldiers (George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman) racing to deliver orders in time to save 1,600 fellow military men. The film has had big wins at the Directors Guild Awards and Producers Guild Awards, the latter a strong predictor for the Oscars: The PGA honoree has gone on to win best picture 21 out of 30 times, including the past two years with The Shape of Water and Green Book. Also in its favor is a Golden Globe victory for best drama and an impressive box office, scoring $104 million with only a few weeks of nationwide release. One troublesome statistic remains: 1917 doesn't have an acting nomination, and only 11 films in Oscar history – most recently Slumdog Millionaire in 2009 – have won best picture without one.\n\n'Parasite'\n\nThe Oscars have gone 91 years without awarding the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' highest honor to a foreign-language film, so history is not exactly on the side of South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho's acclaimed black comedy about class and social inequality. There is real love in the industry for Parasite, however, evidenced by the crowd eruption when it snagged a surprise win for outstanding ensemble at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. With actors being the largest voting bloc in the academy, the victory – plus an honor for best drama given by the American Cinema Editors – gives Parasite momentum going forward, though like 1917, it also has the problem of no Oscar acting nominations.\n\n'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'\n\nQuentin Tarantino's star-packed Tinseltown fable – one that intertwines the lives of a washed-up actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), his steely stuntman (Brad Pitt) and the Manson Family – has been a favorite among movie lovers ever since its summer release. Once Upon a Time won best comedy at the Golden Globes and best picture at the Critics' Choice Awards, it's a strong contender in the 10 Oscar categories where it's nominated (Pitt's pretty much a lock for supporting actor and Tarantino has a good shot at original screenplay), and the Academy Awards since their inception have always adored movies about Hollywood. This one has it right in the title.\n\n'The Irishman'\n\nMartin Scorsese's Netflix gangster epic came into Oscars like a heavyweight, but like A Star Is Born last year, is starting to look like an also-ran. The film, which tracks World War II veteran and Mob hitman Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) over multiple bloody decades, received widespread critical acclaim but has lost out on every major honor so far. Still, don't count out The Irishman yet: Crime dramas tend to do well at the Oscars (Scorsese's The Departed marked his first and only best picture in 2007), Netflix put a lot of horses behind its campaign, everyone involved is a Hollywood favorite – not only Scorsese and De Niro, but also supporting-actor nominees Al Pacino and Joe Pesci – and it could benefit from the preferential ballot if it's the second or third choice for a majority of voters.\n\n'Joker'\n\nOf course the Oscars' biggest wild card is the one with the iconic comic-book supervillain. Joaquin Phoenix seems destined to win best actor for his unnerving transformation from mentally unstable outcast to face-painted nihilist in Todd Phillips' psychological thriller origin story. The film's chances for best picture aren't as good as in other categories – such as original score and hair/makeup – but Joker leads with the most Oscar nominations (11 total). Like Irishman, it might also be helped by the preferential ballot, plus the controversial Joker has made enough money ($334.6 million domestically, $1.1 billion worldwide) that it can't be ignored.
Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith don't celebrate the day they tied the knot, which might not come as a shock to devout Red Table Talk viewers who have been privy to the highs and lows of their unique marriage.\n\nThe actors wed Dec. 31, 1997, but Pinkett Smith – who hosts the Facebook Watch series with her mom, Adrienne Banfield-Norris, and daughter, Willow Smith – said on Monday's episode the two spent the day apart.\n\nPinkett Smith said she likes to stay home on the last night of the year. Very rarely am I out and about for New Year's, she said. I like to snuggle up somewhere and just chill and kind of go inside. I do a lot of spiritual work during this time.\n\nUsually, Will on New Year's likes to be in an adventure in the world somewhere. There's no telling where he's gonna be, she said. I don't wanna be out in the world. He now has the freedom (to) go and have an awesome adventure of some kind.\n\nIt's more a life partnership, so it's not steeped in ... that day, the Girls Trip star explained. We don't really celebrate that day anymore, in that sense, because the context of our union is totally different.\n\nReflecting on 2018, Pinkett Smith appeared content with her personal life.\n\nEven with a lot of the transitions that we've made as a family, I feel like this year, everything has really come together in a beautiful, cohesive, harmonious manner, and that took a lot of work, she shared. So, it's so beautiful to just see it land, finally.\n\nOn Red Table, Pinkett Smith and Smith have spoken candidly about their 21-year union.\n\nOn a previous episode, she remembered her wedding ceremony, but not fondly. Pinkett Smith said that she didn't want to get married or have a wedding, but once she got pregnant, she felt pressured to tie the knot.\n\nI was so upset that I had to have a wedding. I was so (mad), she remembered. I went crying down the freakin' aisle getting married.\n\nOn another show, Smith talked openly about a rough patch. We broke up within our marriage and got back together again and had to rebuild with new rules and something way completely different.\n\nContributing: Anika Reed\n\nMore:Jada Pinkett Smith 'cried for 45 days straight,' husband Will Smith claims\n\nMore:Exclusive: Jada Pinkett Smith remembers Willow was destroyed by Santa truth on 'Red Table'\n\nMore:'I had a complete emotional collapse': Jada Pinkett Smith, Kid Cudi talk mental health
As David's Bridal was toppling toward Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018, the nation's largest wedding retailer took careful steps to show it was not leaving couples at the altar.\n\nThe company made sure customers knew it wasn't planning to close stores or cancel orders, unlike Alfred Angelo Bridal, whose 2017 bankruptcy culminated in a chaotic liquidation that temporarily left many brides-to-be without dresses.\n\nDavid's Bridal succeeded in using bankruptcy to slash burdensome debt it had acquired through a private-equity buyout years ago. The chain emerged from bankruptcy with more sustainable finances on Jan. 18.\n\nBut the company's challenges aren't over. With digital threats emerging, marriage rates declining and wedding alternatives proliferating, David's Bridal is adjusting its business to stay competitive.\n\nThe company has lowered prices on many of its bridesmaids' dresses, added more plus-size options and guaranteed free one-on-one consulting for brides-to-be.\n\nDavid's Bridal CEO Scott Key recently spoke with USA TODAY Money reporter Nathan Bomey. Excerpts from their conversation (condensed and edited for space and clarity):\n\nQuestion: How did the bankruptcy affect the business? Did it leave a mark?\n\nDavid's Bridal CEO Scott Key: Relative to the other 50 or so retail bankruptcies in the last couple years, our process was very clean, highly consensual and supported by our lender group. And very quick.\n\nThe news about David's entering bankruptcy – for some people that gets interpreted as David's is going away, and that's clearly not the case. We've come out the end a much stronger company.\n\nWe had work to do in communicating that David's is here to stay and in a healthy position, and we have been doing that.\n\nQ: Did you see a measurable impact on your sales?\n\nA: That's non-public at this point, but what I would say is that it is important that we reach out to brides in the market and let them know that David's is there for them and they can trust us. This business is built on trust, and they have to know that's part of the equation.\n\nWe were clear with our brides that dresses that were on order would be delivered on time, and we were clear with our vendors that they would be paid through the process and there would be no impact to them in that regard, that our stores would remain open, that our employees would remain harmless.\n\nWe kept all of those promises.\n\nQ: So many retail bankruptcies in the lastcouple years end up in a lot of stores being closed. You didn't take that approach. Why did you choose not to take that approach, and going forward what will your store footprint look like?\n\nA: You're right, we didn't shed a bunch of stores. And that is because we're actually in an advantageous position relative to most retailers. I think our fleet in the United States is appropriately sized, and our real estate choices have been well made in terms of the economics.\n\nThat said, I believe we have a significant opportunity to improve the customer experience in our stores and have been working to do so, with early steps being the introduction of a one-to-one service model.\n\nQ: What does that entail?\n\nA: In the past, in a busy, peak period … brides-to-be might find themselves in a situation where they're sharing the attention of the associate with another bride. And that was a dissatisfier for our customers.\n\n(Now) brides have the attention of a dedicated bridal stylist.\n\nQ: Does someone have to pay for that?\n\nA: No, it's free.\n\nQ: Does that mean you had to do some hiring or shifting people around?\n\nA: We actually reworked things. We created the bridal stylist, which is the most experienced of the staff we have in stores, and then what we call a dress specialist, which handles the bridesmaids and special-occasion side of the business.\n\nQ: You've lowered prices on some of your best-selling dresses. What's happening there?\n\nA: That's true in a number of categories, but it's particularly true in bridesmaids' (dresses). It's in response to us understanding better the competitive forces in the marketplace.\n\nIf you look in the online space, where the bridesmaids' business is the most competitive, you'll find other players have … figured out how to deliver them at a lower price. To be competitive, we need to be at parity with price, and so we made those adjustments.\n\nWe also introduced a new line of product. If you were to take the good-better-best spectrum of bridesmaids' (dresses), we amplified the good end of the spectrum and made those available online.\n\nQ: Is there a figure to quantify the price difference of bridesmaids' dresses overall at David's Bridal?\n\nA: No. I would say it's taken on case by case. Some were priced perfectly, some were perhaps north of what's competitive, and in some instances there might be some that were below.\n\nQ: Is it correct to say you're offering more, larger sizes now?\n\nA: It's not as much about the size run itself as it is the number of choices that are available in those sizes. David's is an open and inclusive brand, and we support many women with plus-sized needs and petite-sized needs.\n\nWhen a plus-sized woman would visit our store, she would likely be able to try on a dress in her size, which is different than the experience if she visited (a) boutique, but it might not be the dress she wanted.\n\nBasically we are … supporting women of all sizes and giving them an opportunity to try on a dress in their size.\n\nQ: Are you concerned at all about this surge of online competition and the effect it could have on your business?\n\nA: If you look at market share today, the reality is that the majority of the units and the sales happen in physical retail locations. But as is true of every other category of retail, that will change over time.\n\nWe see that first pivot happening in the bridesmaids' category, but over time that will shift into the gown, too.\n\nSo we are very focused on improving our digital customer experience and have a project going on that front.\n\nThink of online as the future and stores as the present. That said, the vast majority of research happens online. So between social channels like Pinterest and Instagram, that's where the bride gets inspiration and research from.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.
PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — Not all triumphs come with a medal.\n\nGus Kenworthy leaves the Pyeongchang Olympics empty-handed, failing to land a run in the slopestyle final Sunday. But his heart is full, knowing what he did here is far bigger than sport. In the evolution of societal attitudes toward gays and lesbians, Kenworthy and Adam Rippon's participation here will be a watershed moment.\n\nIt's not simply that they are the first openly gay athletes to represent the United States at the Winter Olympics. It's that they became two of the biggest American stars at these Games simply by being their authentic selves.\n\nThe only way to really change perceptions, break down homophobia, break down barriers is through representation, Kenworthy said Sunday afternoon.\n\nMore:Adam Rippon will work for NBC as a correspondent\n\nMore:Nick Goepper, Gus Kenworthy can inspire others by sharing stories\n\nFour years ago, Kenworthy wanted so badly to kiss his then-boyfriend after winning the silver medal in Sochi, but couldn't work up the nerve to do it. He hadn't come out yet, either publicly or to his family, and he was petrified of the reaction.\n\nNone of that crossed his mind Sunday when he kissed boyfriend Matt Wilkas before his first run, a moment shown during NBC's prime-time coverage.\n\nIt's positive. It's great. The exposure to that is a great thing for our community, Wilkas said. But, also, part of me thinks, `Well, big deal.' It was the tiniest kiss in the world.\n\nBut there are still places in the world where daring to be yourself is dangerous, where being gay can get you killed. There are politicians in our own country, the president and vice president chief among them, who view members of the LGBTQ community as being somehow less, and promote policies that have no other objective than to marginalize them.\n\nSo to see Kenworthy and his boyfriend act like any other couple, to be treated like any heterosexual couple, it speaks volumes. So, too, to see Rippon being embraced from Hollywood to the heartland.\n\nIt tells bigots whose hate is rooted in fear and ignorance that gays and lesbians pose no threat. It tells children who are gay and worried about what that will mean for them that they're OK and their sexuality will not define or limit them.\n\nIt is yet one more step in the road to true equality.\n\nTo see somebody like this who is unashamed, unafraid … it's game-changing. It's life-changing. It's reaffirming, said Tyler Oakley, a YouTube host and LGBTQ activist who has become friends with Kenworthy and called him and Rippon possibility models.\n\nTo see somebody celebrated when they're often used to being disenfranchised, it's a flip of the script.\n\nWhile Kenworthy and Rippon are proud of who they are and are willing standard bearers for the LGBTQ community, they look forward to the day when their sexual orientation is irrelevant. When they, or those who follow them, are known as athletes who happen to be gay rather than gay athletes.\n\nBut for that day to come, society will have to rid itself of its prejudices and fears. And there is no better way to speed that process along than when people like Kenworthy and Rippon are embraced by mainstream America.\n\nGus was worried before he came out that he would lose his fan base, said his father, Peter. I said, `You never know. You might gain a whole other fan base.' Which is exactly what happened.\n\nIt's worth remembering that, during the Sochi Games, gay marriage was still about a year and a half from being legal throughout the United States. Attitudes have undergone a significant shift since then, as more and more people realize just how conventional gays and lesbians are.\n\nThey are accountants and bricklayers, teachers and clergy, actors and attorneys. They are moms and dads, husbands and wives. They are your family members, co-workers, neighbors and friends.\n\nAnd, yes, they are people to be emulated and cheered.\n\nI was trying to remind myself that win or lose, I still have a lot to be proud of, Kenworthy said.\n\nKenworthy leaves these Games without a medal, but he won something much bigger. More tolerance and acceptance, both for himself and the entire LGBTQ community.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.
WASHINGTON – As President Joe Biden tells it, the nuns who taught the future president based their religious instruction on the Gospel of Matthew: Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.\n\nThat tenet was echoed during his first days in office, when Biden signed orders to ensure fair treatment for marginalized groups on housing and other issues.\n\nWe're all God's children, Biden said. We should treat each other as we would like to be treated ourselves.\n\nAnother of his earliest actions strengthened anti-discrimination protections for gay and transgender people. On Thursday, Biden was expected to sign a memorandum to protect the rights of LGBTQ people worldwide, including providing protections to gay and lesbian refugees and asylum seekers.\n\nBut what to Biden is an advancing equity agenda grounded in his deep Catholic faith appears to some Christian conservatives as attacks on their own intensely held beliefs that will unravel the religious freedom protections championed by the Trump administration. Those protections treated religious beliefs as paramount, even if they conflicted with another person's rights – to an abortion, to marry a person of the same sex, or to be transgender.\n\nIt absolutely is a direct conflict with Trump's approach, said history professor John Fea, author of Believe Me: The Evangelical Road to Donald Trump.\n\nStark contrast to Trump White House\n\nBiden, only the second Catholic president, has brought to the White House a different approach to faith, both personally and through policy.\n\nUnlike Trump, Biden regularly attends church. His Catholicism has played as large a role in his life as his outsized family Bible did at his inauguration. Biden wears his son's rosary beads, made the sign of the cross when paying his respects to fallen Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick Tuesday, and quotes Bible passages.\n\nThe contrast couldn't be starker, said John Carr, co-director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown University. We're going from one of the least overtly religious presidents in modern times to one of the most overtly religious presidents in recent history.\n\nThe difference is already clear in policy.\n\nTrump was a hero to the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns running homes for the elderly, which challenged the federal requirement that insurance plans cover birth control. At Trump's renominating convention, a nun from the Little Workers of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary questioned Biden's religion and called Trump the most pro-life president.\n\nBiden is praised by Sister Simone Campbell, executive director of Network Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention about caring for all of God's creations. She's thrilled by Biden's efforts to expand health care coverage, address racism and reverse Trump's anti-immigration actions.\n\nOne of the ways that he's living out his faith is by centering the issues of equity at the heart of his administration, which I find super-exciting, she said. It's never happened before.\n\nAdvancing the 'common good'\n\nBiden has not yet announced a faith-based adviser or created a faith outreach office. But he has declared that advancing equity has to be everyone's job.\n\nBiden's focus on the common good is a central concept of the centuries-old Catholic social tradition, Massimo Faggioli wrote in the new book Joe Biden and Catholicism in the United States.\n\nIn remarks to the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, Biden said his faith provides hope and solace, clarity and purpose.\n\nIt shows the way forward, as one nation in a common purpose, to respect one another, to care for one another, to leave no one behind, he said.\n\nNational Prayer Breakfast:Biden urges a turn to faith at event notable for absence of Trump\n\nBut Biden's emphasis on social justice issues over social policy flashpoints like abortion mirrors an ongoing struggle in the Catholic Church between Pope Francis, with his pastoral approach, and the church's more conservative wing. (A photo of Biden with Francis was among the personal photos arrayed behind Biden when, sitting at his desk in the Oval Office, he took steps last week to expand health insurance access and to allow federally funded family planning groups to provide or refer patients for abortion services.)\n\nWe are deeply committed to making sure everyone has access to care – including reproductive health care – regardless of income, race, zip code, health insurance status, or immigration status, Biden said in a joint statement with Vice President Kamala Harris last month recognizing the 48th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that affirmed the right to an abortion.\n\nFar from creating a more equitable society, Christian conservatives say, Biden's actions are reverse discrimination – particularly his first-day move to ensure workplace and other protections for people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nWith a stroke of a pen, President Joe Biden has turned 50-year-old civil rights legislation on its head, hollowing out protections for people of faith, Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said in a statement.\n\nTrump's strongest supporters\n\nWhite evangelical Protestants were Trump's strongest supporters, according to the Pew Research Center. That's despite Trump having been one of the least religious to ever run for the presidency.\n\nBut Trump promised on the 2016 campaign trail that the first priority of my administration will be to preserve and protect our religious liberty. Religious freedom became a signature issue of both his domestic and foreign policy.\n\nRecent cultural and demographic changes have made evangelicals feel not only that the idea of America as a Christian nation is under siege but that their own liberty is being threatened, said Fea, who teaches history at Messiah College in Mechanicsburg, Pa.\n\nTrump provided the kind of fighter, the strong man, to protect their interests, he said.\n\nThe feeling of both loss and victimization is reflected in Pew Research Center surveys. In a 2019 poll, a majority of adults who identify with or lean toward the GOP said that religion is losing influence in American life and that this is a bad thing. A 2020 survey suggests that Republicans who have experienced some form of harassment online are more likely than Democrats to say they believe their religion was a reason.\n\nWe live in a time when the freedom of religion is under assault, then-Vice President Mike Pence told Liberty University graduates in 2019. During the Trump administration, Pence's strong faith-based views on abortion and homosexuality made him a target of Democratic criticism, including from those seeking the party's 2020 presidential nomination. Biden had to backtrack after being lambasted by progressives and LGBTQ activists for calling Pence a decent guy.\n\nThere is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President, Biden tweeted.\n\nBiden's own positions on gay marriage and abortion evolved over the years. After voting to block federal recognition of same-sex marriages 16 years earlier, he backed legalizing gay marriage in 2012 – jumping out ahead of President Barack Obama in his announcement.\n\nBiden has become a strong supporter of Roe v. Wade and, in 2019, reversed his support for a longstanding provision that bans federal funding for most abortions.\n\nRabbi Hara Person, head of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, said she's encouraged that Biden is not imposing his faith-based opposition to abortion on others.\n\nReligious liberty means not only freedom to practice our faith as we see fit, but it's also freedom from having the religious views of others imposed on us, she said. That was something that was really missing these last four years.\n\nCarr, of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life, said he backed Biden, in spite of Biden's going along with the extremism of the Democratic Party on abortion.\n\nI think character matters, competence matters and treating people with respect matters, Carr said. Lifting up the poor and vulnerable matters, and Trump failed those tests for me.\n\nBut Carr is waiting to see what Biden will prioritize.\n\nIs it going to be overcoming COVID, bringing us together, caring for creation? Or is it going to be sort of a culture war? he asked. I think what Biden campaigned on, and who he is, is pursuing justice in unity – not a culture war agenda.\n\nCarr, who in a former role with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops helped develop their documents on political responsibilities of Catholics, recently organized a discussion of how Biden's Catholicism affects his presidency and the role its playing in the divide within the church.\n\nThe split was highlighted when Pope Francis' congratulatory message to Biden on Inauguration Day emphasized respect for the rights and dignity of every person, especially the poor, the vulnerable, and those who have no voice.\n\nIssuing his own statement, the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops warned that Biden has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender.\n\nOf deep concern is the liberty of the Church and the freedom of believers to live according to their consciences, wrote Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez.\n\nBiden's presidency could contribute to the difficult realignment of American Catholicism with Pope Francis's vision – a process resisted by `culture war' bishops since the time of Francis's election, but also interrupted by Trump, Faggioli wrote in his book on Biden and Catholicism. The mere possibility of such a realignment will being a lot of attention to this particular Catholic moment.\n\nMore broadly, there's a stark divide along religious lines on whether people see the United States as having an essential culture and values that immigrants take on or whether it's a nation made up of many cultures and values that change as new people arrive, according to Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life.\n\nWhite Christians – including white evangelical Protestants and white mainline Catholics – believe the U.S. has a central culture, surveys show. The majority of everyone else believe culture and values adjust, Cox said.\n\nThat's a fundamentally different conception of the country and where it ought to be headed, Cox said.\n\nBiden will have to take that into account as he tries to weave together the disparate groups that make up his coalition and fulfill a central campaign promise – one that's also rooted in his faith – of bringing the country together.\n\nI think, Cox said, that's really going to be challenge.

Sam Mendes scored a major awards-season victory when he won best director at Sunday's Golden Globes, and he followed it on Tuesday with a key honor from his peers.\n\nThe 1917 filmmaker has been nominated by the Directors Guild of America for outstanding directorial achievement in feature film for 2019.\n\nQuentin Tarantino, whose Once Upon a Time in Hollywood took best screenplay and comedy/musical at the Globes, is also in the field at the 72nd annual DGA Awards. Tarantino snagged nominations in 1995 for Pulp Fiction and in 2010 for Inglourious Basterds.\n\nJoining Tarantino and Mendes are Martin Scorsese (The Irishman), who won the DGA prize in 2007 for The Departed, and first-time nominees Bong Joon-ho (Parasite) and Taika Waititi (Jojo Rabbit).\n\nPGA Awards:'Joker,' 'The Irishman,' 'Knives Out' receive film nominations\n\nBAFTA:'Joker' leads with 11 nominations, 'Irishman,' 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' follow\n\nNotable snubs include Noah Baumbach (Marriage Story), Todd Phillips (Joker), Pedro Almodovar (Pain and Glory) and Greta Gerwig (Little Women).\n\nThe DGA Awards are often a strong bellwether for the Academy Awards. In three of the past four years, four of the five nominees also landed Oscar nominations for best director. And since 2014, every DGA winner also won the Academy Award: Alfonso Cuaron for Gravity (2014), Alejandro G. Iñárritu for Birdman (2015) and The Revenant (2016), Damien Chazelle for La La Land (2017), Guillermo del Toro for The Shape of Water (2018) and Cuaron last year for Roma. Since 2000, only six films have won the DGA but failed to win the best-picture Oscar; in that same time period, there have only been three instances when the DGA winner hasn't also won the best-director Oscar.\n\nThe category for outstanding achievement by a first-time filmmaker features Mati Diop (Atlantics), Alma Har'el (Honey Boy), Melina Matsoukas (Queen & Slim), Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz (The Peanut Butter Falcon) and Joe Talbot (The Last Black Man in San Francisco).\n\nWinners will be announced Jan. 25 at the Ritz-Carlton in Los Angeles.

Adam Rippon isn't a hulking football player like Michael Sam. He's not a 7-foot basketball center like Jason Collins. He's dissimilar from Robbie Rogers, a soccer player whose recent retirement from MLS left zero openly gay men in major professional sports in the U.S.\n\nThe fact that he happens to have come out as gay and did so as an active athlete is about the only thing that links Rippon to some of the more masc sports figures who courageously came out over the years — and that's part of his appeal.\n\nI think it's huge that he does not project the way other professional athletes have when it comes to masculinity, Anthony Nicodemo, a high school basketball coach in New York and LGBTQ activist, told USA TODAY Sports. He marches to the beat of his own drum the way somebody like Michael (Sam) and Jason (Collins) didn't. They fit that piece of masculinity we have come to expect in sports being big and strong. Adam doesn't fit into that box.\n\nRippon became the first openly gay U.S. figure skater to compete in the Olympics and the first out figure skater overall to medal as he aided Team USA's bronze medal finish at the free skate competition Monday. Eric Radford then became the first openly gay figure skater to win an Olympic gold medal as he and Meagan Duhamel helped Canada win the team figure skating event.\n\nThere are 15 LGBTQ athletes competing in Pyeongchang -- including Rippon and Gus Kenworthy (skiing) from Team USA --- per Outsports.com. There were seven in Sochi four years ago.\n\nIt's an awesome time, Mason Darrow, who came out in 2015 while a member of Princeton's football team, told USA TODAY Sports. For the lack of a better word, it's a gay Olympics. I think it's (a) really nice change of pace.\n\nRippon, 28, certainly hasn't shied from embracing who he is on the international stage -- and that included criticizing Vice President Mike Pence's views on the LGBT issues in an interview with USA TODAY Sports last month.\n\nBeing here at the Olympics does give me a louder voice, Rippon said earlier this week. It has given me a platform. It's given me a voice to reach to young kids. I've gotten so many messages I could even get emotional thinking about it, but I've gotten so many messages from young kids all over the country that my story's resonated with them. It's incredibly powerful this platform that you can have at the Olympic Games.\n\nRippon declined to speak with Pence, who attended the opening ceremony last week, before the figure skating competition began, USA TODAY Sports' Christine Brennan reported.\n\nThe bravery and courage he has is amazing, Austin Parrish, a former swimmer who came out in high school before competing collegiately at Eastern Illinois, told USA TODAY Sports. I personally love that he is taking on Mike Pence. I'm from Indiana, where Pence was my governor while I was a college athlete. I never felt supported by the politicians of Indiana or the support for being an openly gay athlete. The way Pence rejected marriage equality in Indiana brought several emotions to the surface.\n\nRippon has regularly -- on social media and in interviews -- talked about what it means to be an openly gay elite athlete.\n\nBeing true to who you are and not giving a (expletive) about what others think about you is an awesome and liberating thing whether you are gay or not, Rippon wrote on Twitter earlier this week. Sometimes we the gays need to be reminded more often but, LIKE, EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT, FOR REAL. JUST DO IT.\n\nRippon is hardly the first gay male figure skater, a sport that has seen gold medalist Brian Boitano, Rudy Galindoand NBC broadcaster Johnny Weir among the American skaters who have come out. However, they made that choice later in their careers or after their respective retirements.\n\nI definitely had that fantasy about being a figure skater when I was a young gay kid, said Darrow, who now works for the Cleveland Indians. I think most young gay boys did something of the sort. I think Adam is definitely easier to relate to on that front than somebody like a (football player) like I was.\n\nRippon scored 87.95 in the short program Thursday night, putting him 7th out of 21 competitors and tops among the three Team USA skaters. He remains a long shot to medal in the men's individual competition as the free skate takes place Friday night, although Nicodemo said much of LGBTQ community has taken in and appreciated all that Rippon has accomplished so far.\n\nThe interesting thing with Adam is that he's been embraced by the LGBT majority more than most out athletes, Nicodemo said. I think he's a lot of us who go brunching on Sundays and wear glitter. They see themselves in Adam even if they can't skate.\n\nFollow A.J. Perez on Twitter @byajperez
